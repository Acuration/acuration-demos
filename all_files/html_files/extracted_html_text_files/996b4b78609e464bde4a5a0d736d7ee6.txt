Suzlon Foundation furthers commitment to education through school renovation project in Tuticorin
Tuticorin, India: Suzlon Foundation, the CSR arm of the Suzlon Group today furthered its commitment
to education by contributing for the renovation of the St. Antony R. C. Primary School in Vadakku
Silukkampatty, Tuticorin District. The newly renovated school building was inaugurated in the
presence of Mrs. E. Vasantha, District Educational Officer, Education Department, Tuticorin District,
Mr. K. Baskaran, Block Education Officer and Mr. Michael Anthony, Headmaster.
The school building was very old with roofing in a very bad condition. Students suffered a lot without a proper class room. Renovation of the building helped the students and teachers to pursue their studies without any problems. The renovated structure has facilities to provide hurdle free education to the students with the building completely renovated with new brickwork, plastering, false ceiling, roof sheet, flooring and painting. Suzlon Foundation engaged with Gramodhaya NGO to carry out the renovation work at the school.

We are thankful to Suzlon Foundation for taking this development activity and renovating the school. I can see the students are all happy and eager to sit in newly renovated classrooms."
Dr. Jasmine Sofia Gogia, Senior General Manager, Suzlon Foundation said, "Suzlon Foundation endeavors to achieve social, economic and ecological development around all its areas of operations. Our CSR programs are specifically designed to the requirements of local communities and the renovation of the school is another step in that direction. We are glad to provide a conducive environment for the education of students and help them excel in their academics.
