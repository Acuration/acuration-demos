Press Release
August 14, 2019
Suzlon announces Q1 FY20 results
Pre-forex EBITDA of Rs 61 crores and EBITDA margin of 7.4% in Q1 FY20
Concerted efforts on-going towards a holistic solution for debt reduction
Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced its first
quarter results for financial year 2019-20 (Q1 FY20).
J. P. Chalasani, Group CEO, said, "We continue to witness sectoral slowdown, owing to the
prolonged industry transition to the bidding regime and policy uncertainty in few states. On
the positive side, tariffs are stabilizing and the volume growth in the long-term augur well
for sustainable growth of the sector. Our Operation and Maintenance Services (OMS)
division continues to deliver high machine performance for the customers, surpassing
industry benchmarks. We will fuel the growth for OMS with our value added products and
services. India is expected to be a relatively high volume market once the transitional
problems of the sector are addressed. We are well poised to capitalize on this growth."
Kirti Vagadia, Group CFO, said, "Post default scenario, the company operations are at a sub-optimal
level. However, we have continued to focus on cost optimization across the board including Cost of
goods sold (COGS), fixed costs, working capital and thereby curtailed losses in this lean period. This is
reflected in the fact that inspite of minimal volumes, the impact on the bottom line as compared both
on Q-o-Q and Y-o-Y basis has been limited. We are committed and tirelessly working towards debt
resolution and fixing the capital structure at a sustainable level and are exploring various funding
options like raising fresh equity, disposal of subsidiaries, etc."

months to 18 months)

SCOD 18 months from the date of PPA or PSA signing whichever is earlier
Part commissioning also eligible for full tariff
