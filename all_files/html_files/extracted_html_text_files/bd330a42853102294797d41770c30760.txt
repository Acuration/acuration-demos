A company that started as a manufacturer of wind turbines in 1995, is today counted among the world’s leading players in the renewable energy space, offering 360-degree solutions to its customers across the globe. Suzlon has expanded its footprint across the continents, with its global headquarters based in India.
India operations remain pivotal to the success of Suzlon as a global player, with all strategic decisions for global forays emerging from the company’s One Earth headquarters in Pune. Suzlon has a diverse clientele in India that includes FIIs, consortiums, government, manufacturing industries and community owners. The SCADA centre in India ensures that wind turbines located around the world are maintained 24/7, in varied climates and regions. Even as Suzlon has expanded its operations across the world, it remains firmly rooted in India.
Suzlon has today become synonymous with green energy in India, with its technology, manufacturing and research hubs based in the country. It is the No. 1 renewable energy player in the country with a cumulative installed base of around 13.8 GW.
The company has made strategic investments in different parts of the country over the years to develop a robust infrastructure. It currently has 14 manufacturing facilities in India, along with four R&D centres. This vertical integration of in-house manufacturing bestows a competitive advantage to customers as they are assured of maintenance of quality standards. In addition, it also facilitates quick servicing and maintenance of the wind turbines as the spares and components are readily available, thus minimising downtime. This is complemented by an expansive and carefully developed vendor base, giving it a distinct edge over other international players operating in India.
Suzlon is a proud partner of the Make in India initiative undertaken by the Government of India.
