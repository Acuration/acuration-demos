Over the last two decades, Suzlon has built a range of turbines that can generate 600 kW to 2100 kW of power. These turbines continue to generate power across the world, supported by Suzlon’s operations and maintenance services. With the introduction of new, high-yield next-generation wind turbines, Suzlon has phased out the manufacturing of its older WTG (wind turbine generator) models - S111, S97, S88, S82, S66, and S52.
However, Suzlon continues to support, operate and maintain all its installed wind turbines.

S111
S111
Suzlon boasts of a wide range within its 2.1 MW suite of products with varying rotor blade and tower heights suitable for all wind regimes. The S111 wind turbine has an impressive 111 rotor diameter, which can extract maximum power from available wind.
S111 offers various hub height (90m, 120m, 140m) and construction (Steel Tubular, Hybrid Lattice, Hybrid Concrete) options depending upon site conditions to optimally harness wind energy for maximum generation.
The S111-140m (140 meter hub height) prototype was set up in August 2017 in Gujarat, has achieved 43% plant load factor (PLF). It received its Type Certification in June, 2017.
The installed serial fleet confirms the high plant load factor and availability above 97%.
S97
S97
The Suzlon S97-2.1 MW series is an award-winning wind turbine generator range which was specially designed to make low wind speed sites profitable.
It was available in two variants:
S97-90m - All steel tubular tower that reaches a height of 90m
S97-120m - All steel tower that combines the lattice and tubular structure with a unique transition piece that reaches a height of 120m.
This innovative design of S97-120m won the prestigious Golden Peacock award 2016 in the ‘eco-innovation’ category.View the story behind the award
The S97 series has been phased-out since 2018. During the three years of its successful installations, more than
1,359 turbines of S97 were installed with a cumulative capacity of more than 2,853 MW.
Why was S97 the preferred choice?
An award-winning innovation by Suzlon
Increased height and stability
Reduced cost, simpler logistics and ease of construction
Design that enables higher generation
Made low wind sites that were previously unusable, viable
S88
S88
The S88-2.1 MW was designed for a medium wind speed regime. Inducted into the Suzlon fleet in 2004, the S88-2.1 MW was designed to withstand extreme conditions and operate effectively with low maintenance costs. The S88 was phased out in 2015 after 11 years of successful operations, during which time a total of 2,738 turbines were installed with a combined generation capacity of 5,748 MW. This product was one of the best and most successful products of Suzlon.
The S – 82
S82
The S82-1.5MW was designed for generating optimal power output even at sites with a modest wind speed regime. Inducted in 2006, the S82-1.5 MW is equipped with an asynchronous generator with high slip; it can operate within a limited speed range. In conjunction with the pitch system, it is possible to achieve an optimal energy yield within a wide wind range, with comparably low loads. Till its phase-out in 2015, there were 2,022 turbines installed with a combined generation capacity of 3,033 MW.
S66
S66
The S66-1.25 MW was designed for generating the optimal power output even at sites with a modest wind speed regime.
S66-1.25 MW is equipped with a dual-speed, dual-rating asynchronous generator; it can operate within a limited speed range. In conjunction with the pitch system, it is possible to achieve an optimal energy yield within a wide wind range, with comparably low loads. Between 2002 and its eventual phase-out in 2016, 2,940 turbines of the S62 along with similar turbines like the S64 and S70 were installed cumulatively generating
3,675 MW of energy.
S52
S52
The S-52 600 KW is similar to the S–66 1.25, but with lower energy generation capacities. Between 2006 and 2014, 762 turbines with a total installed capacity of 457 MW were installed.
