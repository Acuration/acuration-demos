Theproject has the potential to provide power to over 27,000 households and reduce 0.10 million tonnesof CO2 emissions per annum.J.P. Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon Group said, We are pleased to partner this leading power utilityyet again in meeting their commitments of providing sustainable and affordable energy. India iswitnessing a paradigm shift in the renewable energy landscape and it is heartening to witness powergeneration utilities embracing alternative energy to build up a robust sustainable energy architecture.We are best equipped to pursue our efforts in bringing down the cost of energy with our comprehensiveproduct portfolio, robust in-house R&D and more than two decades of experience in providing end-toendsolutions to customers along with a dedicated Life Cycle Asset management service capability. The S97 series of 2.1 MW WTG feature the time tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG)technology which is designed to maximise generation at lower wind sites. It not only delivers higherenergy output, but also offers higher return on investment for our customers.At a height of 120 meters the S97-120m is the Worlds tallest All-Steel Hybrid tower which combinesboth lattice and tubular structures, designed indigenously to harness the enhanced availability of windresources at higher altitudes making low wind sites viable. The combination of lattice and tubular givesenhanced tower strength at lower cost. The three-dimensional lattice structure can support heavierweights due to the broad base and reduces the steel requirement apart from being logistic friendly.The prototype, set up in November 2014, at Kutch, Gujarat, achieved a PLF of 35%.
