Suzlon S95  2.1 MW receives type certification; Delivers 102% of estimated power curve
Pune: Suzlon Group, the worlds fifth largest wind turbine maker*, announcedcompletion of testing and certification of its S95 STV (Standard TemperatureVersion) turbine in its 50 Hz and 60 Hz variants. The testing was carried out byindependent third party testing agencies, and the certification by GermanischerLloyd, a global leader in certification.The S95, with a rotor diameter of 95 meters and tower heights of 80, 90 and 100meters, is specially designed for medium wind speed sites (Class II wind regimes).It is part of the S9X suite of turbines, which has already seen over 1,000 MW inorders since its launch in April, 2011.The S95, in testing and validation, delivered 102 percent of its estimated powercurve, translating to higher than projected power generation, and improved returnsfor customers - an increase in energy yield of over 3 million kilowatt-hours over theturbines lifetime.Speaking on the development, Mr. John OHalloran, President, Technology Suzlon Energy Limited, said: This is a phenomenal achievement; it is incrediblyrare that a complex product like a wind turbine  with over 2,000 parts and weighingover 250 tonnes  generates more power than was even projected. This increase ismainly attributed to our new smart aerodynamic technology and efficient controlsystems. We are pleased to report that the S9X suite is consistently delivering 97percent plus uptime on all installations, over a period of more than 10 months now.This result is a testament to our ability to build on our vast global operatingexperience. We have continuously evolved our technology and products to deliverever improving returns to our customers. Added Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman  Suzlon Group: We are pleased to presentthese findings to the market. Our customers have already placed more than 1 GW oforders with us for the S9X suite of turbines, and this result clearly underscores thatwe have delivered a product that exceeds their demanding standards.I firmly believe that technology is the key differentiator in our industry; and the keyto market leadership. Our focus has been to consistently lower the cost of windenergy, and as a result we are today achieving parity with conventional sources likecoal and gas. At Suzlon Group, we have a wind turbine for every kind of wind site inthe world, and our focus remains to generate more energy from the same resources,creating more profit for our customers and more green energy to power the globaleconomy.The S9X suite builds on Suzlons long experience in the 2 MW space with its fleet ofover 2,000 S88 turbines  translating to over 4,000 MW of power generatingcapacity  operating around the world. The S9X builds on the robust track record ofthe S88 and was designed with exhaustive customer input to customize the productand service offerings to meet the exact needs of customers and operators around theworld.
