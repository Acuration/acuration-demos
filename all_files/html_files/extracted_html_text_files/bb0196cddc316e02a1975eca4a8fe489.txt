Press Release
August 28, 2020
Suzlon announces Q1 FY21 Results
Revenue of Rs.513 crores in Q1 FY21
EBITDA of Rs. 91 crores in Q1 FY21 and EBITDA margin of 17.7% in Q1 FY21
Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced its first
quarter results for financial year 2020-21 (Q1 FY21).
V R Tanti, COO, said, "The Covid-19 pandemic and the implementation of the Debt Restructuring
which was completed on 30th June 2020 impacted our WTG business in Q1. We have started securing
new orders in Q1 and have a healthy order book of 867 MW. Despite the challenges of the Covid-19
lockdown, our Operations and Maintenance Service (OMS) business continues to deliver good
performance and SEForge our forging and foundry business has also performed well. We have geared
up our manufacturing plants and project sites as per the new social distancing and safety guidelines
of the Government and are all set to begin full-fledged operations. The Government's focus on
'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' will boost domestic manufacturing in the Wind sector and definitely benefit
Indian Wind Turbine manufacturers like us. At an industry level there have been several positive
developments with a slew of policy announcements. Power ministry announced the extension of
waiver of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses on supply of power generated
from wind and solar sources until 30th June 2023. No ISTS charges would be levied for 25 years and
the same is also applicable to Captive power projects, which will open up a new market segment."
Swapnil Jain, CFO, said, "In the Q1 results we see a clear improvement in EBITDA over last year,
which is a testimony of the success achieved in controlling our fixed costs. As the Debt Resolution
Plan was implemented at the end of Q1 FY21, the impact of the reduction in interest cost will be seen
in the coming quarters. However, part of interest cost on securities issued to the Lenders would keep
getting charged to statement of profit and loss in future years which is notional. The company is now
strongly positioned to resume the WTG business and execute our order book. We have also
reorganised the business to suit the new market paradigm, which has helped in significant reduction
of our break-even levels making us even more competitive."
