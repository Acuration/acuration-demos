Suzlon well positioned to capitalise on volume growth in
auction regime
EBITDA of Rs. 73 crores (Pre-forex) and EBITDA margin of 6.7 % in Q3 FY19
2 orders totalling ~328 MW won from Adani Green Energy under auction regime
Timely servicing of debt
Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced its Q3
FY19 results.
J P Chalasani, Group CEO,
said, "We continue to strengthen our position in the Indian wind industry
with 2 orders totalling ~328 MW won from Adani Green Energy under auctions. We are on track with
the execution of our order book including the SECI projects. We are the only EPC player to have
completed the entire project awarded in the SECI 1 auction, 6 months ahead of SECI's revised
timelines. We are confident of maintaining the lead with our unwavering focus on execution. We will
begin FY20 with strong order book, since 10.7 GW of auctions have already taken place. With policy
stability, subject to land and grid infrastructure availability and timely payments by utilities, the
government target of 175 GW renewables by 2022 can be achieved. There should be enabling
policies to ensure utilization of ~10 GW wind turbine manufacturing capacity, which will lead to job
creation and overall socio-economic development in a sustainable way. Suzlon is ideally positioned to
cater to the volume growth with end-to-end business solutions, technology and products. The tariffs
are also stabilizing and there is immense opportunity for the long-term sustainable growth of the
wind sector."
Kirti Vagadia, Group CFO, said, "The prolonged transition phase continues to impact the industry at
large and also our Q3 FY19 performance. We are regularly servicing our debt obligations towards
banks and others including for the month of January 2019. Our focus on working capital, debt
reduction, cost optimization across the board including COGS and fixed costs is unwavering. During
the quarter, we have witnessed improvement in our net current asset. With a healthy order book and
volume visibility our single point focus is to ramp up execution in the coming quarters."
