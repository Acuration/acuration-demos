Suzlon launches new S9X suite of wind turbines
2 MW-class turbines, designed for moderate to low wind regimesRobust, reliable design optimized to deliver higher yields at a lower cost per-kW/hExtends proven technology platform to meet specific market, wind regime and operating conditionsChennai/Pune: Suzlon Group, one of worlds leading wind turbine manufacturers,announced today the launch of its new S9X suite of wind turbines at the Wind Power 2011conference in Chennai, India.Mr. Tulsi R. Tanti, founder, Chairman and Managing Director - Suzlon Group said:The wind industry is rapidly evolving; the center of gravity has shifted to emerging marketswhich are re-shaping the sector. This shift is also dictating the direction of technologydevelopment as more moderate and low wind sites become available in these new markets.The S9X suite of turbines has been developed to take advantage of these emergingopportunities.We have a very tight focus on providing higher yields for our customers at a lower costeven from low wind sites. This suite of products is an important addition to our portfolio,expanding on our proven, reliable technology platform to deliver more efficient wind powersolutions customized to our customers exact needs. We are confident the S9X suite extendsour competitive edge in emerging high-growth markets like India, China and Brazil andother select matured markets.Speaking at the event, Mr. John OHalloran, President  Technology - Suzlon EnergyLimited, said: Customer centricity is the hallmark of our new products. The S9X suite ofturbines has been specifically designed keeping in mind the needs of the market. We haveengaged closely with our customers in the development phase. Weve incorporated theirinput at the design stage - delivering not only a better product, but also significantlyimproving project execution and servicing of the machines in the field.Every aspect of the turbine  the blades, the generator and sub-systems  featuresimproved designs to deliver a higher return on investment. The machines also have bettergrid compatibility and are in accordance with the highest safety standards. The end result isa range of products which are extremely reliable, delivering significant increase in energyyield at a low cost through its life cycle.The S9X suite is an evolution of Suzlons proven technology platform, and is built around acore doubly fed induction generator-based technology. A compact and modular DFIG designallows ease of serviceability and meets the latest grid requirements for smoother windpower plant connectivity. New blade designs with rotor diameter of 95 meter and 97 meteroffers a larger swept area add to this with greater energy capture and power productionfrom moderate to low wind speeds. To ensure the highest standards in quality, Suzlonsblade testing far exceeds industry baseline by simulating total life cycle of blade (1 millioncycles) in most extreme onsite conditions.The turbines boast of variable tower heights of 90 or 100 meters, leading to low costoptimization and higher power generation. The S9X turbines also comply with low voltageregulation (LVRT) requirement, this leads to better compliance with grid regulation.Additionally, improved sub-systems like the new pitch and yaw systems have increasedsystem reliability of the machines.Serial production of the S95 turbine is scheduled to begin in Q2 FY11 - 12, followed by theS97 in Q4 FY11- 12, backed by a robust order book.
