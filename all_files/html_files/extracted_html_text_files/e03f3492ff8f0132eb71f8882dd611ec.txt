Pune, India: Suzlon Foundation, the CSR arm of Suzlon Group, completes 10 years of making a difference.

Dr. Jasmine Sofia Gogia, General Manager, Suzlon Foundation said, Our initiatives in the past decade have always focused on overall sustainability and balanced growth of communities in and around our area of operations. Our CSR programs are identified collaboratively with the villagers based on their needs and are mainly focused on enhancing the livelihood, health, education, civic amenities and educating on natural resource management. The foundation has evolved to adapt to the changing needs, however, our commitment to make a real impact to society has been unwavering.
