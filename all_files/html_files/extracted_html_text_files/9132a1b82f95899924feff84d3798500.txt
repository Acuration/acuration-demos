The S133 Advantage
Suzlon introduced the 3.0 MW platform to unlock unviable sites and deliver improved energy yield suitable for all wind regimes. The S133 is one of India's largest wind turbine generators (WTG). This platform is extendable up to 3.0 MW depending on the site wind conditions. The prototype of S133-105m was set up in August 2019. These products are available in 2.6 MW to 3.0 MW variants and offer up to 160 meters hub heights. It delivers a 25-30% higher generation over the S120. The same has been confirmed in successful measurement and validation campaigns over the last years. The S133 with a 160 meter tower is commercially operating successfully as part of the Initial fleet since June 2022. The product range is validated and certified according to latest India Grid Code requirements.
