Our senior secured lendersare supportive of our long-term business plans, and our efforts to consolidate ouroverall debt to achieve a sustainable capital structure.This is an important step towards stabilizing our business by enhancing liquidity andinjecting additional working capital. We believe this will help us to safeguard theinterests of our key stakeholders, including customers and vendors.Additionally, our ongoing engagement with our bondholders continues to be bothconstructive and progressive, and we expect that an acceptable solution for allstakeholders will be reached at the earliest possible date.Considering our overall business outlook, we recognize that despite strong businessfundamentals and a US$7.2 bn orderbook, liquidity constraints over the first half ofthe fiscal, a volatile market environment, and the timeline of the CDR process willcontinue to impact performance. Taking this into account, the Management Teamhas decided to suspend guidance for the current fiscal, however, we remainconfident of the companys performance over the mid-term, and of returning thebusiness to a position of strength.
