Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon, said, We are very optimistic on the growth of renewables in India. The country witnessed record renewable energy installations in FY16 and the industry will surpass it by over 30% in the current fiscal. Combined, wind and solar capacity has surpassed hydro capacity and is only next to coal-based capacity in India. The government thrust on renewables is supported by positive policy actions to enable the target of 175 GW renewables by 2022. Our confidence to achieve higher than the industry growth rate comes from our product portfolio, strong order backlog, execution capabilities and strong presence across the value chain and customer segments. Kirti Vagadia, Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Suzlon, said, In FY17, we are focused on ramping up volumes by executing our strong order backlog, ensuring that we continue to maintain tighter control on our working capital and fixed costs. We are also adequately capitalized to deliver high volume in the coming quarters. Our long term debt and overall finance cost is progressively reducing. The introduction of new accounting regime in form of IND AS mainly reflects in two major areas namely foreign exchange (FOREX) and impact of Right of Recompense (RoR) on a potential Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) exit scenario. Suzlon Group Q1 FY17 financial performance at a glance (consolidated): Revenue  Rs 1,650 CroresOperating performance (Before Forex gain/ loss) EBITDA - Rs 171 Crores, EBITDA margin at 10.4%  EBIT - Rs 88 Crores EBIT margin at 5.3%    Debt (excluding FCCB)  Gross term debt at Rs 7,526 Crores  Working capital debt at  Rs 2,475 Crores  Rupee term debt reduced by Rs 228 Crores QoQ Order book and order intake  Order book stands at 1,205 MW valued at Rs. 7,657 Crores   Consolidated customer advance of over Rs. 1,000 Crores   55% of order book resulting  from new products (S97 120m and S111 90m) Key highlights: 1.
