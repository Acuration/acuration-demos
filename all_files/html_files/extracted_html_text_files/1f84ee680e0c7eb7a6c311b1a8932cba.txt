Suzlon secures a 69+ MW order for the 3 MW series from a leading Nordic Energy Company
This is the fourth order of the new Suzlon 3 MW series in less than a month
To supply 23 wind turbines with a rated capacity of 3 MW each
Project to be completed in 2024 at Karnataka, with a total installed capacity of 69+ MW
Will serve Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Commercial & Industrial (C&I) Consumers
A project of this size can provide electricity to ~56 thousand households and curb ~2.24 lakh tonnes of CO2 emissions every year
Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, today announced a
significant order featuring the new 3MW series within a month. This order is for the development of a 69 MW wind power project for the Indian subsidiary of a leading Nordic Energy Company. Suzlon will install 23 wind turbine generators (WTGs) with a Hybrid Lattice Tubular (HLT) tower and a rated capacity of 3 MW each. The project is located at Karnataka and is expected to be commissioned in 2024.
This is the fourth order of the larger wind turbine model from the new 3 MW series - the S144-140m is part of the agreement wherein Suzlon Energy will supply the wind turbines (equipment supply) and project supervision and commissioning. Suzlon will also provide operations and maintenance services post-commissioning.
JP Chalasani, Chief Executive Officer, Suzlon Group, said,"At Suzlon, we take great pride that a
leading Nordic Energy company with a proven global track record in renewable energy has placed their trust in Suzlon for their first wind energy project outside of Europe. This order is a testament to the quality and reliability of our technology and service solutions. Targeting the Commercial & Industrial (C&I) consumer segment, this order will help in expanding the reach of renewable energy to more Indian industries, driving them toward their net-zero targets. Suzlon is committed to leading India's renewable energy vision by providing solutions that combine proven technology with world-class service offerings. Together with our customers and our valued partners, we will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible and drive meaningful progress towards a cleaner, greener, and more prosperous tomorrow for all."
The Suzlon 3 MW Series
The largest renewable energy solutions provider in India, The Suzlon Group is proud to announce its 3 MW series of wind turbines. With the primary objective of increasing generation, reducing the cost of energy, and contributing to an Aatmanirbhar Bharat, this series marks a significant milestone for the company and the country's wind energy sector.
Suzlon's 3 MW turbines feature a 144-meter rotor diameter and are designed to unlock low wind sites and deliver improved energy yield suitable for all Indian wind regimes. With local content of up to 85-90% by its serial launch, this series proves Suzlon's commitment to innovation and self-reliance.
The S144 wind turbine generator is one of the largest in India, extendable up to 3.15 MW, depending on site wind conditions, available at a hub height of 140 meters going up to 160 meters by its serial launch. At 160 meters hub height the S144 will also be India's tallest wind turbine. Suzlon's S144 fleet will deliver a remarkable 40-43% higher generation over Suzlon's current model, the S120 - 2.1 MW wind turbine, showcasing its ability to optimize wind resources at higher altitudes and make low-wind sites viable.
Furthermore, the 3 MW turbine generators feature the time-tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) technology and the SB 70.5 carbon fibre blade engineered and developed by Suzlon. This world-class technology provides the capability to utilize thinner aerodynamic profiles, resulting in excellent performance in low-wind sites, and a significant increase in generation yield per unit of land.
As a leader in the renewable energy sector, Suzlon's 3 MW series of wind turbines is a testament to the company's dedication to delivering sustainable and cost-effective renewable energy solutions for the future. We are confident that the 3 MW - S144 technology will contribute significantly to the country's renewable energy and net-zero targets.
