The resolutions were approved by significant majorities, with 100 per centand approximately 93 per cent of bondholders who voted in the June 2009 and June2007 series, respectively, being in favour of the extension. We have also receivedthe necessary permission from the RBI for this extension. We believe thisunderscores the strong relationship we have built with our bondholders and banks,and their confidence in our plans.We requested for extension in order to ensure that there is adequate time to obtainthe requisite approvals and to close administrative documentation necessary tocomplete this refinancing exercise. I am happy to report that the process is on trackand, along with our plans to divest non-critical assets, we are confident of meetingour near term FCCB obligations."The measure extends the maturity date of the June series of FCCBs till 27th July,2012, with the option for the company to bring forward the payment to a nearerdate, by providing five days notice to bondholders.
