Suzlon bags maiden order from Hero Future Energies for 31.50 MW wind power project
New order wins continue for the evolutionary 120 meter Hybrid Wind Turbine GeneratorSuzlon to supply and install 15 wind turbines of S97-120m hub height with rated capacity of 2.1 MW each in TelanganaMumbai, India: Suzlon Group, one of the leading wind turbine manufacturer, today announced thatit has won its maiden order from Hero Future Energies, an Independent Power Producer (IPP)company, for 31.50 MW of wind power project. Suzlon will install its S97 suite of WTGs (windturbine generators) with 120m hub height and rated capacity of 2.1 MW each at Zaheerabad site inMedak district, Telangana on supply and installation basis. The project will be scheduled forcommissioning by June 2016.The S97 - 120m is the Worlds tallest Hybrid tower and combines both lattice and tubular structurewhich is designed indigenously to harness the available wind energy across low wind sites. Itincreases energy output by ~ 12% to 15 % over other turbines of same capacity. The combination oflattice and tubular gives enhanced tower strength at lower cost. The three-dimensional lattice structurecan support heavier weights due to the broad base and reduces the steel requirement apart from beinglogistic friendly.Mr. Sunil Jain, CEO Hero Future Energies (HFE) said, Keeping in mind the emergent energy appetiteof a developing country like India, we have embarked on a journey to install a robust portfolio ofrenewable energy projects in the country. HFE has over 1100 MW of projects in wind in the pipeline.Our Zaheerabad (69 MW) site is our second project in a row in self-development mode. This movevalidates our efforts to optimize resources to enhance productivity onsite. We are positive about thispartnership and have faith in the value proposition of hybrid towers and Suzlons capabilities. Mr. Ishwar Mangal, Chief Sales Officer, Suzlon Group said, We are delighted to have signed yetanother order for our hybrid towers, with Hero Future Energies. Our Hybrid tower technology is agreat value proposition for the customers and we are encouraged by the customer response.The S97 120m hybrid tower is a game changer for the wind industry and is a result of our continuedfocus to invest in next generation technologies that offer higher ROI to our customers acrosssegments. We will continue to develop new relationships and further strengthen existing ones, andwe are looking forward to more successes this year.
