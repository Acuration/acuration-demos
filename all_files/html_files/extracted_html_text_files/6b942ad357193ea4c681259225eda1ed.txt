The blade retrofit project is on trackand will be complete by June, 09. said Mr. Sumant Sinha, COO - SuzlonEnergy Ltd.Mumbai: Suzlon Energy Limited (SEL), the worlds fifth leading and Indias largestwind turbine manufacturer, reported consolidated revenues of INR 6,893.04 cr. in Q3 FY09, a 117 % growth over corresponding period of the previous year. Profit after tax (before exceptional items,minority interest and associates profit) stood at INR 413.95 cr. The Suzlon Wind Group(which excludes Hansen and REpower) order-book stood at 1,916 MW (98 MWdomestic, 1,818 MW international) and INR 10,387 cr., as on January 26, 2009(excluding Hansen and REpower). Additionally the order-book for the componentbusiness stood at INR 1,080 cr.Speaking on the companys outlook, Mr. Sumant Sinha said: We have seen areduction in commodity prices, logistics costs, inventory, and overall project costs inthe wind sector. This will translate into cost reductions for customers, interest costreductions, and higher IRR on projects, which make the industry outlook favourablefrom FY10. The overall attractiveness of the industry has also improved for lenders dueto higher security cover from better returns, and more secure cash flows.GuidanceThe company is in negotiations with existing and prospective customers for projectstotalling over 2,000 MW across USA, Europe China and Australia, of which 1,000 MWare likely to be closed over the next six months.Strategic Priorities1. Blade Retrofit ProgramThe company completed a full Root Cause Analysis and implemented Corrective Actionafter completion of validation testing program at a third party facility on the S88 V2blade. The planned retrofit and replacement program to strengthen all V2 blades isunderway and on schedule, with 85% of the project scheduled to be completed byMarch 2009, and the remainder by June 2009. A provision of INR 170.88 cr. in FY09has been made to cover additional costs arising from the project.The S88 V2 blade was phased out by the next generation V3 blades in early 2008. 342units of the S88 V3 have been commissioned till date in USA and Australia. [SeeAppendix A for additional information]2. Optimizing Operating EfficienciesThe company has undertaken several key initiatives to increase operating efficiencies:focus on working capital reduction, freeze on capex plans, constant monitoring of rawmaterial procurement and prices; continuous performance monitoring and operatingcost rationalization.The company also restructured senior management responsibilities with the aim ofachieving greater consolidation and operational efficiencies as a Group. Mr. Tulsi Tantitook over direct charge of the companys operations while continuing his role as theGroups strategist. Mr. Sumant Sinha - COO, took over the day-to-day operationalmanagement of Suzlons wind energy business.3. Capitalizing on OpportunitiesSpeaking on the outlook for the sector, Mr. Tulsi Tanti said: The wind industryhas enjoyed a period of uninterrupted growth at over 34% CAGR over the past fiveyears. But with the impact of the credit crunch on the global economy, the windenergy sector is likely to witness subdued growth rates in the coming year. Thefundamentals of the industry, however, remain strong with energy security,sustainable energy sources and climate change high on the public agenda.3.1 Focus on renewable energies in key marketsThe long term outlook for the industry remains highly robust. Industry forecasts pointto an upswing by 2010 with easing credit, and reducing costs backed by existingdrivers such as renewable energy targets in Europe, China and India; the US tax creditsystem and the Repower America program providing a steady pipeline for growth.3.2 Strategic Group SynergiesInitiatives are underway to achieve synergies at the group level. The company isworking towards accelerating REpowers volumes and improving margins throughSuzlons supply chain linkages. The initiatives will reduce REpowers externaldependence for supply of rotor blades, gear box, generator, control panel, forging andcasting parts, converters etc. These initiatives offer the potential of reducing COGS forREpower through sourcing and scale economies.In a similar manner, Suzlon will pursue closer supply chain linkages with HansenTransmissions, plugging a gap in Suzlons supply chain for gearbox and technology,and with SE Forge supplying forged and cast steel components to Hansen.With Hansens expansion in Belgium, China and India, the synergies also create along-term growth driver for Suzlons component business, while the closer functioningof all three companies offers the opportunity to integrate turbine technology withcomponent technology and design, to develop the next generation of robust, costefficient wind power solutions.3.3 Changing Business DynamicsOver the coming year, with easing commodity prices and supply chain bottlenecks theindustry is expected to enter a period of consolidation, emerging with streamlinedsupply chains, and a customer base dominated by large utilities.Group Updates1. REpowerSuzlon and the Martifer Group entered into an agreement on a revised paymentschedule for Martifer's 22.4 percent stake in REpower. As per the terms, Suzlonacquires the stake in three tranches by payment of Euro 65 mn in December 2008,Euro 30 mn in April, 2009, and the final tranche of Euro 175 mn in May 2009, whichwill take Suzlons ownership level to approximately 91% in REpower. Suzlon alreadyholds 91% voting rights in REpower through an existing agreement with Martifer.Suzlon completed the acquisition of the first tranche of shares in December, 2008,taking the companys holding in REpower to 73.71%.2. HansenSuzlon successfully completed the sale of 10% equity in its subsidiary HansenTransmissions International NV to Ecofin Limited, a London-based specializedinvestment firm, for INR 500 cr. Following this disposal, the Suzlon Group will retain avoting and economic interest in Hansen of approximately 61.28%.3. Components BusinessSE Forge, Suzlons forging and foundry unit, established high precision forging andmachining facilities of 70,000 MT p.a. capacity in Vadodara. The facility willmanufacture components such as tower flanges, bearing rings, gear rim and ringgears, and has the capacity for rings of 5m diameter, the largest size made in India.SE Forge also established a 120,000 MT p.a. casting and machining unit inCoimbatore, with a 50 MT per-piece capability, the largest in India. The facility willmanufacture rotor hubs and other spherical castings, rotor shafts, main frames andcasings with product applications across industries such as wind, oil and gas, materialhandling, aerospace, defence, construction equipment, bearings and heavy machinery.The facility has started commercial production, supplying Suzlon, Hansen and othercustomers.Suzlon is also in the process of establishing verticals for rotor blades, electricals andtowers as part of its component manufacturing strategy.Suzlon  The Road AheadSuzlon over the past five years achieved meteoric growth, growing at twice as fast asthe industry on an average. The company in the period emerged as a global player,integrated the full value chain establishing 5,700 MW of manufacturing capacity, andmade two major international acquisitions.The changed market dynamics will allow the company in the coming year toconsolidate its growth  focusing on overcoming short term challenges, integratinggroup strategy, technological improvements, improving returns for customers on windprojects, and expanding the component business.The Suzlon EdgeWith the global wind industry shifting focus to shorter-term order visibility, thecompany is well positioned with a strong pipeline of potential customers. Suzlonretains the edge in tough market conditions with a combination of well establishedstrengths - cost competitiveness, vertical integration, expanded scope of services,well-diversified market reach, and a focus on key markets and customer relationshipsdominated by utilities and financially sound developers.       Appendix A: Suzlon S88  2.1 MW V2 Blade Retrofit Program SynopsisIssue: Suzlon encountered the appearance of cracks in the V2 version blades of itsS88  2.1 MW turbines in USA and Portugal. Cracks have occurred in 172 blades out ofa total population of 1,251 sets of blades. The cracks occurred in the transition area ofthe blade, approximately five meters from the root of the blade.Root Cause Analysis: The company immediately instituted a (now complete) RootCause Analysis (RCA) program to determine the exact cause of the problem anddetermine solutions.The reason for cracks was determined to be a high stress concentration causing initialdamage in the core of the blade shell. The problem was encountered only in the V2blades (phased out by V3 model blades).Solution: The analysis determined a strengthening of the affected region of the bladewould prevent the cracks by reducing stress levels from blade loads in the core oftransition area of the blade.Validation: A full scale dynamical blade test was conducted on V2 rotor blades byWind turbine Materials and Constructions (WMC), Netherlands using a realistic loadspectrum. The retrofitted blade designated V2A passed a life-cycle test of one milliontest cycles, validating the retrofit solution and blade quality.Retrofit: An immediate retrofit program was instituted to strengthen all V2-typeblades. The Retrofitting involves providing additional reinforcement in the criticaltransition region of the rotor blades, both from inside and outside of the blade, tocomply with the revised design standards of V2 rotor blades.The program is progressing as scheduled, with 85% of the project scheduled to becompleted by March, 2009 and remainder by June, 2009. A provision of INR 170.88 cr.in FY09 has been made to cover additional costs arising from the project.Product Evolution - The S88 V3: The development of the V3 blade was a productevolution from the V2 for improved aerodynamic performance, in process before V2crack issue surfaced. The V3 structural design has adequately addressed the bladecrack issue observed on the V2 blade.The S88 turbine with the V3 blade incorporates an improved wind turbine and rotorblade design, drawing on the experience from installing and running the S88 turbinewith the V2 blade. The new version has shown consistently better performance inmajor operating parameters over the previous version.342 units of the S88 V3 have been commissioned till date in USA and Australia. Noblade cracks have occurred on V3 blades till date, and V3 turbines in Australia havedemonstrated over 97% availability in majority of the turbines.Future product developmentSuzlons next generation blade development effort is already working on - High energyyield blade designs; Innovation in composite technology; Cost reduction through lowermaterial usage; Low wind speed technology and Regulation and generation systemevolution.
