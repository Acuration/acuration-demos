The center is dedicated toaccelerating Suzlons vision to become a leader in technology in the wind industry. The new center will befocused on developing the best blades and control systems in the industry, and integrating Suzlonsaerodynamic, loads and new structures research across the company.Dr. Thomas Buhl has joined Suzlon as Vice President to lead Suzlons Blade Science Center. From theTechnical University of Denmark (DTU) Wind Energy, Dr. Buhl has more than 15 years of experience inaerodynamics and blade structures, and has demonstrated strong leadership throughout his career. At hislast assignment, Dr. Buhl was heading the Section for Wind Turbine Structures at DTU Wind Energy wherehe managed a large group of scientists and engineers with a focus on mechanical design and loads,composite structures and structural optimization.Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman, Suzlon Group, said, The new blade center is aligned to our vision of being thetechnology leader in the global wind sector. Innovation is at the core of Suzlons DNA and I am confident the new blade center will give further impetus to our research and development efforts. We believe a new wave of innovation is required to unlock the true potential of renewable energy, to lower Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE), and take the game to a new level. Technology will be the key enabler to achieve this. Denmark is the birthplace of wind technology and we will leverage the experience and expertise of the talent pool there in our innovation efforts as we develop our next generation of turbines.Speaking on the development, Mr. Duncan Koerbel, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) said, We believe thenew blade center under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Buhl will be the epicenter for developing nextgeneration wind turbines. We will continue to accelerate our research into the next generation of air foilsand rotor systems to continue to reduce the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) and increase the Plant LoadFactor (PLF) for our customers. We have an aggressive series of new turbines for low wind sites planned forthe Indian and international markets. Through technology, we will advance the performance of thesemachines with our fourth generation blades, augmented with improved pitch control systems, and byintroducing carbon fiber in a unique industry application. I am confident the team led by Dr. Buhl will helpadvance research in all of these areas across our company.Research and Development foot-print of Suzlon Group
