Hamburg/Edinburgh: Suzlon Group subsidiary REpower Systems, a leadingmanufacturer of onshore and offshore wind turbines, has reached the historicmilestone of 1 gigawatt (GW) installed capacity across UK wind farms. REpower UK isonly the third manufacturer in the UK to achieve the 1 GW watershed.Since its inception in 2005, REpower UK has consistently been one of the fastestgrowing turbine manufacturers in the UK. The company has taken just over twoyears to add a further 500MW to its portfolio since announcing 500 MW of installedcapacity in the summer of 2010. By 2014 REpower UK is looking to secure 25 percent of UK onshore market share and 30 per cent of UK offshore market share.Since REpower UK reached 500 MW installed capacity back in 2010, themanufacturer has added a substantial number of wind farms to its portfolio inEngland, Scotland and Wales. These include the Penny Hill wind farm developed byBanks Renewables which features six 3.4M104 turbines and was the project thattook REpower UK to 1GW. 3.4M104 is currently the companys most powerfulonshore wind turbine, and is the most powerful onshore turbine to be installed andoperate in the UK.Rick Eggleston, Managing Director of REpower UK says: We are delighted toreach the historic milestone of 1GW of installed capacity in the UK.
