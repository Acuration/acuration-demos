Ourrevenues of Rs. 21,660 cr are a year-on-year growth of over 30 per cent; we booked ordersof over US$ 5.6 bn / Rs. 30,000 cr, and achieved an EBIT margin of 7 per cent, despitewhat continues to be a challenging economic environment.However, it is unfortunate that inspite of having our best-ever orderbook, we have hadlower volumes in Q3 FY12, leading to a downward revision of our full year guidance. Theselower volumes were primarily due to an extended monsoon in India, grid infrastructuredelays in China, and a procedural delay in closing our new working capital facilities.As a Group we are extremely well positioned in the global marketplace, and with our strongorder backlog we expect to deliver nearly 40 per cent growth in revenues in the next fiscal.Mr. Robin Banerjee, Chief Financial Officer  Suzlon Energy Limited, said: Focusingon the third quarter, we have maintained our gross profit margins at a robust 33 per cent.During Q3 we posted a cash profit of Rs. 26 cr, against a net loss of Rs. 286 cr, which wasprimarily due to certain non-cash items like international deferred tax liabilities of Rs. 121 crand depreciation of Rs. 170 cr.We continue to see a rationalization in our operating expenses, including manpower costs.We have made progress in leveraging Group synergies with the re-alignment of ouroperations in Australia and Europe, alongside commencing manufacturing of the REpowerMM92 turbine in India.I am pleased to report that we have now received an incremental sanction of Rs. 1,100 crin our working capital facilities, which will facilitate our planned deliveries in Q4 and into thenext fiscal.Key Updates Orders: Suzlon Group reported its highest ever order backlog of 5,755 MW. TheGroup secured order inflows of 2.85 GW in the first nine months of FY12, withapproximately 1.5 GW in Q3 FY12 alone; compared to 1.35 GW of inflows in all of H1FY12. Over 50 per cent of new orders came from repeat customers.Suzlon Group subsidiary SE Forge also won a major order worth Rs. 600 cr (US$ 121mn) from a large bearings manufacturer, and secured major contracts with two largewind players.A strong mix of orders between emerging and developed markets, from anincreasing share of large utilities and investors, creates robust visibility into FY13.Group synergies: Collaboration continued to grow rapidly between Suzlon andREpower over the course of the last quarter, combining operations in Australia, andrealigning European marketing operations under REpower  bringing operationalefficiencies, and optimizing our human resources.The quarter also saw the shipment of the first REpower MM92 made in India, fromthe Groups manufacturing facilities in Padubidri, Karnataka.Products: The Groups latest offerings, the Suzlon S9X and the REpower 3XM, eachhas seen strong acceptance in the global marketplace, with over 1,000 MW of ordersfor the S9X and approximately 750 MW for the 3XM. The S9X also received typecertification from leading international testing and certification agency GermanischerLloyd, and S9X turbines are already operational in India, Australia and USA, anddelivering uptime levels above industry standards.Machine availability: Global Group fleet of over 18,000 MW across 28 countriesconsistently delivering availability (uptime) levels above the industry average.Suzlon's flagship S88 turbine  with an installed base of over 2,200 units worldwide ended the most recent quarter with uptime at 97 per cent plus.Market outlook: The industry continues to grow with strong momentum inemerging markets, the offshore segment and key developed markets. The GlobalWind Energy Council (GWEC) reported that, in 2011, the wind industry grew at over21 per cent with the addition of over 41 GW of new wind capacity worldwide. Newoffshore installations in Europe reached 866 MW in 2011, maintaining themomentum from 2010. The Indian market continued its growth, adding 3,000 MW in2011 to reach over 16,000 MW in cumulative installations.With this growth, the Indian market is projected to reach 5 GW annually by 2015,and the offshore markets global share in total installations is likely to increase from~3.5 per cent in CY10 to ~8-9 per cent in CY15.
