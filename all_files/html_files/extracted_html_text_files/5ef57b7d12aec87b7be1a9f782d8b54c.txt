Pune, India: Suzlon Group, one of the leading renewable energy solutions providers in the world,
today announced that Suzlon Global Services Limited (formerly known as Suzlon Structures Limited)
(SGSL), its wholly owned subsidiary, has received A- (Provisional) credit rating with stable outlook
from CARE. The rating has been assigned for its proposed long term and short term bank facilities.
CARE A ratings are considered to have adequate degree of safety regarding timely servicing of

The proposed facility will be primarily used to repay the debt at the group level to optimize the overall
debt structure and interest cost.SGSL currently has a Tubular Tower division and Operation, Maintenance and Services division (OMS
division). The company is in the process of demerging its tubular tower division and merging the same
with Suzlon Energy Limited (SEL), its parent company. Post this re-organization, only the OMS division
will remain under SGSL. (Refer Stock Exchange Notification Dated 27th April 2016 on Inter Group
Merger / Demerger).
Speaking on the occasion, Kirti Vagadia, Group Chief Financial Officer, said: The A category credit
rating is a testament of our efforts towards achieving a sustainable turnaround alongwith a controlled
risk environment and increased cost consciousness. The higher rating is indicative of the low credit risk
profile of the OMS division under SGSL which has about 10 GW of assets under service and growing
risk free annuity like cash flows. It reflects an increased stakeholder confidence in the Company which
is a result of our concerted efforts to increase competitive strength, enhance productivity and optimize
the working capital cycle. With over two decades of experience in the industry, pioneering concept to commissioning business
model, varied customer profile, technological advanced products and strong leadership across all key
states in India, Suzlon is poised to significantly scale- up operations in future.
