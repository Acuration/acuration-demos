Recruitment Fraud Alert
Suzlon has received inquiries seeking clarification of job offers received unsolicited. These job offers appear to come from organisations falsely pretending to recruit on behalf of
Suzlon, or by people claiming to work for, or be affiliated to a Suzlon company.
What is job fraud?
Job fraud is a sophisticated scam offering fake job opportunities to job seekers. This type of fraud is normally carried out through online services such as false websites, or through fake
e-mails claiming to be from the company. The fraudsters often request recipients to provide personal information and to make payments as part of their fake recruiting process.
What is the genuine recruitment process at Suzlon like?
All individuals who are successful in gaining an offer of employment from Suzlon, whether directly or indirectly, are always required to
go through a formal recruitment process that will always be preceded by a formal application and face-to-face interviews at our offices.
We do not ask for bank details until an offer has been officially accepted and the employee has started working at Suzlon.
Suzlon does not ask for any financial commitment or contribution from a candidate at any stage of the recruitment process.
How do I know if a job offer I have received is fraudulent?
How do I know if a job offer I have received is fraudulent?
Fraudulent job offers often ask for financial or personal information early in the process.
The job offers come from a similar e-mail address of Suzlon.com with a different domain name
If a job offer from Suzlon is unexpected, then it is probably fake.
What should I do if I receive a fake job offer via e-mail?
In order to verify the authenticity of any Suzlon recruitment offer, you can write to us at report2us@suzlon.com
Suzlon has no responsibility for fraudulent offers and advises candidates to follow the guidance provided above.
