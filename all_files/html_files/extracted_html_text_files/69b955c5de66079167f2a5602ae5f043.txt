Suzlon Wind Energy Corp. Will Install More Than 700 MW of Clean Energy in 2010
Construction of Nine Wind Power Projects Expected to Funnel $1.5 Million into CommunitiesSuzlon Wind Energy Corp., the North American subsidiary of Suzlon Energy Limited, said itplans to bring online 728 MW of renewable energy in the U.S. in 2010. Suzlon EnergyLimited is the world's third-largest wind turbine group with a 12.3 per cent global marketshare.*Among the nine 2010 projects, 351 newly installed turbines will produce clean energy thatcan power as many as 220,000 homes in seven states. In addition, these projects willcreate more than 50 long-term wind turbine maintenance-related jobs in rural areas. Duringthe construction and commissioning of the nine wind farms across the country, Suzlonestimates that its employees will contribute $1.5 million to the local economies where theylive and work.We look forward to completing the many projects for Duke Energy, Iberdrola Renewablesand others, while simultaneously funneling money back into rural economies and creatinggreen jobs at each wind farm, said Andris Cukurs, CEO of Suzlon Wind Energy. Ourconstruction and service teams are working fervently to install the turbines and get themonline so they can begin generating clean power and providing a strong return for ourcustomers investments, as well as tax revenues for local communities.The nine Suzlon projects are located in seven states, including Arizona, Idaho, Illinois,Kansas, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. They encompass community projects inKansas and Minnesota, and the expansion of the first wind farm in Arizona. Nearly allprojects feature Suzlons S88-2.1 MW wind turbine that routinely has performed well.Last year we established the first commercial wind farm in Arizona, which produces 63 MWof power using 30 Suzlon S88-2.1 MW turbines. We have been extremely pleased with theperformance of the Dry Lake wind farm, said Martín Múgica, executive vice president,Iberdrola Renewables. Were looking forward to building on that successful milestone withthe completion of the Dry Lake II wind farm. After its permitting and construction, it will addup to another 65 MW of clean wind energy to the Arizona grid.Frequently, Suzlon hears about how its wind farm construction and maintenance employeesareappreciated for bolstering local communities and economies. At one wind power plant,Suzlon even contributed to the rebuilding of a town - Greensburg, Kansas - where 95percent of its structures were destroyed by a tornado in May 2006. Greensburgs wind farmis home to 10 Suzlon S64-1.25 MW wind turbines that can generate enough energy topower 3,750 homes.Suzlon and this wind farm provided a huge boost to this community after the tornadodevastated the region and during our recent recovery, said Greensburg Mayor Bob Dixson.The town is making a remarkable comeback with our mission to be better, stronger andgreener. Suzlons turbines are helping us achieve our green energy goals and are serving toexemplify the potential for wind-powered towns.At present, Suzlon has more than 1,750 MW of wind turbine capacity installed in the U.S.and expects to have 2,480 MW by the end of the year.
