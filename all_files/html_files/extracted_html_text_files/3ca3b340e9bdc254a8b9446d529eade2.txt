The $220 million project, using 47 Suzlon S88 turbines, is expectedto produce in excess of 380 GWh of electricity each year, saving more than 345,000tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually, and powering the equivalent of 70,000average Australian homes.The public opening, which took the form of a community event with food and producestalls, entertainment, displays and public wind farm bus tours, saw the unveiling of acommemorative plaque and permanent wind turbine blade and information display inSnowtown, by the Premier of South Australia the Honourable Mike Rann andTrustPower Chairman Mr Bruce Harker.Other distinguished guests included the Federal Member for Grey Mr Rowan Ramsey,the State Member for Frome the Honourable Mr Rob Kerin, the Mayor of Wakefield Mr.James Maitland, Toine van Megen, Global CEO of Suzlon, Dan Hansen, CEO of SuzlonEnergy Australia, and members of the TrustPower board and management teamincluding Chief Executive Officer, Keith Tempest.The Snowtown wind farm site spreads more than 20km along the Hummocks andBarunga ranges, allowing for significant future expansion and is equipped with 47Suzlon S88 wind turbines to produce a peak output of 98.7 MW. The Suzlon windturbines have a rotor diameter of 88 metres and a tower height of 80m.Construction of Stage 1 of the Snowtown Windfarm involved 350 escorted truckjourneys from Adelaide, the use of 7km of high tension cables for anchor footings,5000 cubic metres of concrete, 8,000 tonne of steel for towers, 27km of undergroundcable and 18km of overhead 33kv power line, with 15,000 tonnes total weight of cargotransported to the site.Suzlon Energy Australia took up the project on a turnkey EPC basis and completed iton time and within budget.TrustPower Chief Executive Keith Tempest says the opening of the Snowtown WindFarm marks another important milestone for TrustPower, which has a portfolio of 100percent sustainable hydro and wind generation facilities."We are proud of our investments in sustainable generation in New Zealand, whichincludes 35 hydro facilities and the countrys largest wind farm, plus plans for twofurther hydro facilities and two further wind farms now having been granted resourceconsents. We see this as the first of what we hope will be significant furtherinvestments in Australian wind energy, the income from which will complement thatfrom New Zealand and provide increased income security in times of difficult economicor climatic conditions, as well as making a worthwhile contribution to combatingemissions induced climate change"."The wind farm will help develop a positive new image for the town," said theChairperson of the Snowtown Community Management Committee, Paul McCormack."The local community has taken a strong interest in the project, and appreciates itbeing named the Snowtown Wind Farm," Mr McCormack said. "Its a good news storyfor this community."Mr McCormack is particularly enthusiastic about the 44 metre wind turbine blade whichis on permanent display in the middle of town. "It is a fantastic tourist attraction and itallows people to stop off in Snowtown and get a sense of the turbines up close."Mr McCormack, who has one of turbines on his land, said lightheartedly: "Everymorning I walk to the chook house to collect an egg for breakfast, and I look up at myturbine on the hill to ensure that its still spinning. I think its a beautiful beast, and itmakes me greener and greener each day."While addressing the gathering, Suzlon's Global CEO, Toine van Megen said that theAustralia market is a focus market for Suzlon and congratulated the Australian SuzlonTeam for delivering the project in time and within budget and to the entire satisfactionof TrustPower."Suzlon is committed to the Australian market for the long term and we look forwardto realising more projects with TrustPower. I congratulate the Snowtown communitywith the wholehearted support that they have given to TrustPower and Suzlon.Without your support this project would not have been realised. Suzlon is in Australiafor the long term and we are happy to do our part in creating a sustainable and greenenvironment in Australia through our products and services".Mr. Dan Hansen, CEO of Suzlon Australia thanked TrustPower for the close and opencooperation between the two companies throughout the construction of the projectand thanked the local community of Snowtown for their support and participation,which we trust will continue through the long term operation, service and maintenanceof the wind farm.
