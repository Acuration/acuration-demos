Shri Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Honble Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh inaugurates Suzlons rotor blade manufacturing unit at Badnawar, Ratlam
The Rotor Blade Unit at Badnawar, Ratlam will manufacture Rotor Blades for its latest S111 2.1 MW Turbines and have annual manufacturing capacity of 400 MW.  Over 480 direct and ~50 indirect employment opportunities created within the State  Badnawar, Dhar: Suzlon Group, one of the leading renewable energy solutions provider in the world, inaugurated its newest state-of-the-art, aerodynamic technology rotor blade manufacturing facility at Badnawar in Dhar district, Madhya Pradesh. The inauguration was done by the Honble Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The facility, spread across 19 acres, has an annual production capacity of 400 MW and will manufacture rotor blades for its latest S111 2.1 MW turbine. The latest in its 2.1 MW fleet, the S111 has a blade length of 54.8 meters, making it one of the largest rotor diameter WTGs in India. Especially designed to enhance wind generation at low wind sites, the S111 reduces the cost of energy, increases return on investment for customers and makes low wind sites viable. The facility at Badnawar is Suzlons 14th manufacturing facility in India and has been brought into operation in less than one year. The facility is also the first one of Suzlon to employ 20 local female engineers in manufacturing who have been provided with 9 months of training at the Suzlon Quality Academy. The existing blade manufacturing units of Suzlon are located in Bhuj (Gujarat), Dhule (Maharashtra), Padubidri (Karnataka), Pondicherry (Tamil Nadu), Daman, Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) and Anantapur (Andhra Pradesh). With this rotor blade unit in Ratlam- Madhya Pradesh, Suzlon has increased its global manufacturing footprint to 15 facilities, spread across India and China (JV). Speaking on the occasion, Honble Chief Minister, State of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said, We need to focus on encouraging Wind and solar energy to fight against the risks of climate change which is the biggest threat to mankind and MP is moving fast in harnessing clean energy from wind and solar. I congratulate Suzlon for truly contributing to make in India and exporting wind turbines to other countries. I also congratulate Suzlon for giving direct employment to 450 youth and I am confident that initiatives such as these will further create job opportunities in Madhya Pradesh. Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman, Suzlon Group said, The Indian renewable energy sector is witnessing positive winds of change. India is a key focus for Suzlon. Our vision is aligned to the governments Make in India initiative and target of 250 GW renewable energy by 2030. Our new blade manufacturing facility is a testament of our commitment to make India the renewable energy technology hub of the world. India has the potential and capability to lead the global transition to renewable energy sources and Suzlon is committed to harness this potential. Technological innovation is at the core of Suzlon groups philosophy. Our new product development efforts are focused on providing affordable and sustainable energy for all. We are reducing the cost of energy and making an increasing number of wind sites viable. The Madhya Pradesh Government has established growth-friendly initiatives such as Make in Madhya Pradesh, establishment of single-window clearance system and increasing energy generation capacity. This is a big boost to renewable energy in the State and I am confident that Madhya Pradesh will be pivotal to achieving energy security and creating a low-carbon economy. The State has also established much-needed policies for social development. Our decision to providing training and employment to 20 women engineers from MP is in line with the Beti Bachao Abhiyan of the Madhya Pradesh Government. We hope that this move will further their efforts in empowering women. The Suzlon Group has been present in Madhya Pradesh since 2004, with major wind parks at Dewas, Ratlam and Mahuria. Over the past 12 years, Suzlon has held ~30% of the renewable energy market share of the State and has provided direct employment to over 100 people. Suzlons blade manufacturing facility in Badnawar is also aligned to the groups commitment to increase renewable energy projects in the state. The new rotor blade manufacturing unit in Badnawar has generated over 480 direct jobs and ~50 indirect jobs, giving a boost to the development of Madhya Pradesh.
