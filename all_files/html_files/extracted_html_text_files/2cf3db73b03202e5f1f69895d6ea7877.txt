Suzlon One Earth
One of greenest corporate campuses in the world
Suzlon believes in creating and maintaining a positive environment, both outside its office walls as well as on the inside. Suzlon One Earth is the embodiment of this belief. Situated in Pune, India, it is the eco-friendly, self-sufficient headquarters of the company. The campus is spread across 10 acres and is completely powered by renewable energy, including hybrid wind turbines, solar panels and photovoltaic cells.
Suzlon One Earth is a LEED Platinum and GRIHA 5 - star certified building and is one of the greenest corporate campuses in the world. It is divided into five interconnected, individual buildings that are aptly named after the elements of nature – Sun, Aqua, Sky, Tree and SEA.
Through sustainable practices like rainwater harvesting, on-site waste conversion and an ‘Office in Garden’ design to maximise daylight use, Suzlon One Earth successfully reduces its operating cost by 35%. This benefit is then passed on by the company to its customers through increased investment in technology.

Little Earth Crèche facility at One Earth campus
Little Earth is a state-of-the-art on-site childcare centre at Suzlon’s One Earth campus in Pune. This is an initiative to support Suzlon’s commitment to gender diversity and employee engagement. Accommodating children in the age group of six months to six years, this facility provides employees a hassle-free experience and reduces the stress and uncertainty about their child’s well-being. Little Earth aligns with Suzlon’s strong belief in diversity and gender inclusivity at Suzlon.
A complete day-care operation built on the principles of high safety and hygiene, the crèche boasts of completely transparent operations with CCTV and an open-door policy.
The centre follows a detailed SOP (Standard Operating Plan) which has guidelines for everything, including emergency medical attention. The important features of Little Earth are:
Optimal age-appropriate adult-to-child ratio.
Day plans that offer age-appropriate learning and activities to support the child's social, physical and emotional growth.
A caring, nurturing and learning environment that provides ample opportunity for exploratory learning.
Regular training of staff members on hygiene, sanitation and child psychology.
Complete kitchen operations including cooking breakfast, lunch, milk, fruits and evening snacks as per the nutrition plan developed by professionals.
A complete record of the child’s conduct in a daily activity diary to be shared with the parent – including naptime, meal details, toilet records, ouch report as well as learning activities participated in by the child.
Little Earth is part of Suzlon’s endeavour to provide employees with an atmosphere where they can rest assured about their personal commitments. It is an extension of Suzlon’s promise of providing employees a workplace that they can be proud to be part of.
