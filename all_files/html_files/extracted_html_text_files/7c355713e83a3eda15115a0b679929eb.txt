Pune / Edinburgh: Suzlon Groups wholly owned subsidiary, REpower, has signed a deal to supply20.5 MW to Sixpenny Wood wind farm, which has been developed by Your Energy, a subsidiary of AESWind Generation. The wind farm, located 2.5 miles east of Howden, in the East Riding of Yorkshire,consists of 10 MM92 REpower machines.This is the first contract REpower has signed with AES Wind Generation, which is a subsidiary of TheAES Corporation, a global power company operating more than 1,800 MW of wind capacity around theworld.The turbines at Sixpenny Wood, with a rated output of 2.05 MW each, will generate enough electricityto power the equivalent of nearly 12,000 homes annually.Installation of the wind turbines will start in mid-2012 and the wind farm is expected to be completeby the end of the year.Rick Eggleston, Managing Director of REpower UK, commented: Its a pleasure to be workingwith AES Wind Generation for the first time. Weve already installed a number of wind turbines in thatarea, so we know that the MM92 machine that were supplying for Sixpenny Wood is ideal for the localwind conditions.David Wilson, Project Director at AES, added: AES is pleased to begin working with REpower onthis project and hope this contract signals the start of a successful relationship.Since its launch in 2004 REpower UK has delivered 36 onshore wind farms in Scotland, England andWales and one offshore wind farm, Project Beatrice, in the North Sea.
