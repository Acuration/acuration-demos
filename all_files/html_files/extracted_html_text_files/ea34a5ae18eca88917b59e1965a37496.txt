The offer of Equity Shares in the Issue should not be construed as an invitation, offer or sale of any securities to the public in India. Unless you have received a pre-numbered Placement Document addressed to you inviting you to make a bid through the application form, no offer and/or invitation of offer of Equity shall be deemed to have been made.
The Placement Document has not been and will not be registered as a prospectus or a statement in lieu of prospectus with the offices of the registrar of companies in India under the Companies Act.
Access to the Placement Document does not constitute a recommendation by the Company, the Lead Manager or any of its respective affiliates or any other person to subscribe to the Equity Shares offered in the Issue (as both terms are defined in the Placement Document).
The Placement Document has not been and will not be reviewed or approved by any regulatory authority in India, including the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Reserve Bank of India, any Registrar of Companies in India or any stock exchange in India or any other jurisdiction.
The information in the Placement Document is as of the date thereof and none of the Company, the Lead Manager or its affiliates or any of the Company’s or the Lead Manager’s respective directors or employees are under any obligation to update or revise the Placement Document to reflect circumstances arising after the date thereof.
The Equity Shares offered in the Issue have not been and will not be registered, listed or otherwise qualified in any jurisdiction except India and may not be offered or sold to persons outside of India except in compliance with the applicable laws of each such jurisdiction. In particular, the Equity Shares offered in the Issue have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any state of the United States and may not be offered or sold in the Unites States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Equity Shares are being offered and sold only outside the United States in offshore transactions as defined in and in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. The Placement Document may not be viewed by any person located in the United States.
The Equity Shares offered in the Issue may not be offered or sold and the Placement Document may not be distributed, directly or indirectly, in or into any jurisdiction if to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction.
You are hereby notified that any forwarding, delivery, distribution or reproduction of the Placement Document, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.
