Suzlon completes blade retrofit program
All turbines with retrofitted blades delivering consistent performanceProgram sets new benchmarks for blade testing and validationNo additional retrofit costs in FY2009-10Pune: Suzlon Energy Limited (SEL), the worlds third leading* and Indias largest windturbine manufacturer, announced the completion of its worldwide program tostrengthen and reinforce all Suzlon blades of the V2 type on its ">S88  2.1 MW turbinefleet.Instances of blade cracks were first discovered in late 2007 during the operation ofsome of Suzlons S88 wind turbines in the United States. Suzlon respondedimmediately and launched a detailed root cause analysis and identification process,followed by extensive testing of the solution and a comprehensive retrofit operation tosafeguard and enhance 1,251 (or 417 sets) of S88-V2 blades around the world  acommitment of approximately USD 100 million, already provided in FY2008-09.Said Mr. Andy Cukurs, Chief Executive Officer of Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation: Weare happy to report the completion of the program in September, 2009. This projecthas been a priority effort for us, and our Technology and Project teams have workedhard to complete this project within the shortest possible time. After receiving the firstreport of cracks in the S88-V2 blades, we immediately undertook a root cause analysisto identify the problem, devise a solution, and resolve the issue in a timely and costeffectivemanner. We believe we are the custodians of our customers investment and,in keeping with our commitment to our customers, decided to retrofit the entire S88V2 fleet and replace the few cracked blades at our own cost to eliminate any possibilityof further issues, no matter how small the chance.In parallel with strengthening the S88-V2 blades, Suzlon also introduced the nextgenerationS88-V3, which is consistently delivering and exceeding performancestandards at windfarms around the world. One of Suzlons S88 turbines producesenough energy to power approximately 500 average American homes.**Speaking after the completion of the retrofit program, David A. Drescher, VicePresident - John Deere Renewables, said: We are pleased that Suzlon has completedthe replacement of the blades in our S-88 fleet and is addressing other productsupport requirements.Speaking on successful completion of the S88 type certification with the modified bladedesign, about the testing protocol applied Christian Nath, Vice President -Germanischer Lloyd, said: Analysis that implies the effect of 3-D loading and designwas used for the verification of the modified blade design. Testing beyond the normalscope of IEC 61400-23 was applied to prove the designs feasibility."The Retrofit Process was carried out in a multi-stage process detailed below:Root Cause Analysis and Identification    Working directly with its customers, Suzlon engaged Navigant Consulting, a    leading international consulting firm, to conduct an extensive Root Cause    Analysis (RCA) examining all primary and secondary contributing causes to the    blade crack issue.? The RCA team concluded that the S88-V2 blade design, while designed andtested to industry standard certification guidelines, had a weakness in thetransition area  about 6 meters (20 feet) from the root of the blade. Theblades measure 43 meters (142 feet) long and weigh 7 tonnes (15,650pounds).? At the completion of the program, only 179 blades of the total fleet of 1,251blades developed cracks. However, Suzlon upgraded the entire fleet in supportof its customers.Design Solution and Testing   To resolve the blade cracking issue, Suzlon added the following to the S88-V2   blade: Three additional plies of fiberglass to the blades exterior in the transverse   direction. These plies extend over the entire blade surface in the transition   area. One additional ply was added to the interior of the blade.  The new reinforced S88-V2 blade has lower stress and strain level in thetransition area, preventing cracks from forming.  Suzlon worked with Germany-based Germanischer Lloyd (GL), aninternationally-recognized wind energy certification organization, to test andcertify the V2 blades according to international standards.  Through this process Suzlon has developed a new level of blade testing for allits blades by putting increased loads into the test process which exceed currentindustry standards, raising the bar in product design and testing for theindustry as a whole.
