Individuals andorganizations which refuse to accept the status quo... The world is facing multiplecrises but also huge opportunities to move toward a more resource-efficient, moreintelligently-managed planet."*Champions of the Earth winners are selected to represent the cutting edge ininnovative thinking and execution of these efforts. UNEP has identified four principlecategories which aim to highlight the urgency of cooperation between all players andall sectors of society to achieve a Global Green Economy - Policy Leadership; Science &Innovation; Entrepreneurial Vision and Inspiration & Action  and a special award for09 recognizing Next Generation Champions.The 2009 trophy is a miniature, crystal version of a sculpture created by Prof. YuanXikun, a Beijing-based Chinese sculptor, and donated to UNEP for display at itsheadquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. The base of the sculpture is a warming earth beneatha leaning iceberg thawing from the heat. Two panicky young cubs and their helplessmother balance on the top of the thawing iceberg. With his sculpture, Yuan calls forpeople from all walks of life to protect the world's environment and promotesustainable development.
