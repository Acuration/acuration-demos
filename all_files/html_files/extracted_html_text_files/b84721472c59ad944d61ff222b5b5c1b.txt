Therefore, we have decided to realign our business there, as reflectedin this transaction. This is also in line with our previously announced strategy todispose of non-critical Group assets to reduce our long-term debt.We believe this is a positive, strategic move for both companies; the Suzlon Groupmonetizes a high-quality enterprise that we have built up since 2006, and CPNEexpands its base and capabilities in a highly competitive marketplace. We stronglybelieve that China will maintain its position as the worlds largest wind market, andwe continue to remain fully committed to China and our customers here. Lookingahead, we will approach this market by combining development with an innovativepartnership model.Suzlon Group established its marketing operations in China in 2005, followed by theset up of its wholly-owned manufacturing facility in 2006.
