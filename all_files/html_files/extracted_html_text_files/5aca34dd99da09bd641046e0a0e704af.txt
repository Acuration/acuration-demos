Pune - Suzlon Energy (Tianjin) Limited (SETL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SuzlonEnergy Limited, India, has secured orders totaling nearly 200 MW of capacity for windfarm projects in China. The orders from two major players in Chinas energy sector, isa significant addition to Suzlons position in the countrys growing wind energy market.The first order from Ao Lu Jia New Energy Development Ltd., calls for the delivery of148.5 MW of wind turbine capacity through 99 units of the S82  1.5 MW turbine foruse in three wind farms. Deliveries for the first wind farm are scheduled for shipmentduring the second quarter of FY2008-09. Ao Lu Jia New Energy Development Ltd. is aSino-Norwegian joint venture and partially owned by Norways NBT AS. This jointventure is NBTs participation in renewable energy developments in China. NBT ASseeks to develop an extensive wind portfolio in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongoliaprovinces, with a target to build 588 MW of capacity by the end of 2010.The following order from Beifang Longyuan (North Union) calls for the delivery of 50MW of wind turbine capacity through 40 units of the S64  1.25 MW turbine, scheduledfor delivery in the first quarter of FY2009-10.

North Union is100% owned by the Huaneng Group, the largest power project developer in China.Beifang Longyuan has been involved in wind power business for more than 15 yearsand has rich experience in wind farm operations.China is an extremely important market for Suzlon. Growing from a low base, Chinaswind energy market has set a scorching pace towards meeting its renewable energygoals, growing at 127% in 2006-07 and setting a three-year-average of 97%.* Theseorders demonstrate Suzlons strong position in the market. With our dedicatedintegrated manufacturing facility in Tianjin, Suzlon is poised to be a key player in thisrapidly growing market, Paulo Fernando Soares  CEO, Suzlon Energy (Tianjin) Ltd.stated, commenting on the order.China features an abundance of windy locations suitable for wind farms andpredominantly moderate wind speeds. The wind market is driven by the economysrapidly increasing need for power, and the governments aggressive renewable energytargets. An increasing gap between demand and supply provides a major opportunityfor wind energy to play a key role as part of Chinas energy mix  providing a scalable,pollution free and sustainable solution to power the countrys growth.China forms one of the key growth markets for our global growth story. The countryhas a strong stated commitment to renewable energy, and we are fully committed togrowing the market and bringing the fruits of clean, sustainable wind energy to helppower greater economic development in China, Andre Horbach  CEO, Suzlon Groupstated.China added 3,287 MW in wind capacity in 2007, a major increase over 2006installations of 1,334 MW, taking the cumulative installed capacity for the market to5,875 MW. This remarkable growth has made China the second leading wind energymarket, behind the United States, comprising nearly 17% of the global market. Themarket is expected to continue its rapid growth, with new installations of 36,500 MWprojected between 2008 and 2012, taking cumulative installed capacity to the over42,000 MW at the end of the period.*
