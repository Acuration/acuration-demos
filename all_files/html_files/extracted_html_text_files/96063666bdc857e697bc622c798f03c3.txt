About Suzlon
CSR
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Suzlon believes that Sustainability can be ensured only if all resources – financial, natural, social, human and physical are continually and responsibly enhanced for the benefit of business. The CSR team is responsible to offset the impact of business in the immediate neighbourhood. Suzlon believes that business and its environment are inter-dependent, and that focus should be on strengthening the organic link between them. Thus, the CSR Mission has been derived by the holistic understanding of the business and the social arena into four main goals of:
Having minimal impact on the natural environment
Enabling local communities to develop their potential
Empowering employees to be responsible civil society members
Committing ourselves to ethical business practices that are fair to all the stakeholders
Suzlon’s CSR model
‘SUZTAIN’ is an unique approach which has matured from an existing provider-beneficiary approach to a partnership approach – wherein local communities, development functionaries, employees, company CSR teams, government departments and NGOs work together in planning, implementing, monitoring and sustaining village level sustainable development interventions. The approach is implemented through ‘Engage-Empower-Sustain’ principles of Suzlon CSR and are aligned with the UN Sustainable development goals
(SDGs).Suzlon has mandated Suzlon Foundation, a section 8 non-profit organisation to lead the CSR activities of Suzlon Group of companies since December 2007
