This is despite the seasonal low volumes; usually the first quarter contributesonly a small percentage of planned annual volumes in the wind business, said Mr.Toine van Megen, CEO  Suzlon Energy Limited.Suzlon reported a strong order book (excluding Hansen and Repower) position of INR16,491 crore (3,040 MW); with INR 1,449 crore (267 MW) in domestic orders, and INR15,042 crore (2,772 MW) in international orders, as on July 30, 2008.Commenting on the results, Mr. Tulsi R.

However, accounting rules require us to make us provision for foreign exchangetranslation loss of Rs. 146 crores from our FCCB of USD 500 million. These funds havebeen deployed to purchase shares of European wind turbine maker Repower. Sincethese are Euro denominated assets accounting for any rupee-dollar translation loss onthe borrowing is one-sided and entirely notional.We believe Suzlons fundamentals are very strong, since, the opportunity forrenewable energy is immense with the increasing cost of fossil fuels and itsdiminishing supplies. With our comprehensive product portfolio, end-to-end solutions,technology-focus, market mix and fully vertically integrated value chain  we arepoised to continue our industry beating growth. In addition, our 3,000 MW capacityexpansion plan is progressing on track. Key Developments:REpower: Consolidation of holdingsSuzlon in June acquired Arevas total stake of approx 30% in REpower Systems AG,Germany.

Suzlon also enjoys voting rights of approximately 89% throughits voting pool agreement with Martifer of Portugal, the other major shareholder inRepower.DLF: One of the largest orders ever in IndiaSuzlon secured one of the largest orders in India for 71 turbines, each of 1.50 MW,totaling 106.5 MW of capacity from the DLF Group. With this repeat order the totalportfolio of Suzlon turbines to DLF will reach 256.50 MW.The order, once commissioned, will make DLF the owner of the largest single windportfolio in the country, reflecting a growing commitment of corporations to wind andrenewable energy, and the increasing competitiveness in comparison with conventionalfossil fuels.
