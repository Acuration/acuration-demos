76 solar powered lights installed in six welfare hostels in Anantapur district  700 students benefited from the activity  Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh: Suzlon Foundation in collaboration with Menda Foundation, undertook a drive to install solar lights across six welfare hostels in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh. A total of 76 solar powered lights were installed in six welfare hostels at Uravakonda, Vajrakarur and Konakondla, benefiting around 700 students living in these hostels. Aligned with Suzlon foundations zero darkness initiative, the installations of solar lights has helped students to receive uninterrupted power supply during study hours, thereby, providing an enabling environment for students to study and improve their learning capacity.

The activity is in line with the Suzlon foundations objective to power a greener tomorrow with clean energy sources and reduce the carbon footprint.  Dr. Jasmine Sofia Gogia, General Manager, Suzlon Foundation said, Suzlon Foundation is committed to brighten up lives of community members in its neighbourhood areas.
