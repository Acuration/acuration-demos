 Suzlon successfully completes commissioning of 340 MW solar projects
Projects commissioned on turnkey basis across Telangana, Rajasthan and Maharashtra 
Comprehensive operation and maintenance (O&M) services will be provided by Suzlon for a period of 25 years
Projects were won through competitive bidding (Telangana), NTPC bid (Rajasthan) and SECI bid (Maharashtra) 


Pune, India: Suzlon Group, Indias largest renewable energy solutions provider, today announced that it has completed the commissioning of 340 MW solar power turnkey projects across sites in the state of Telangana (210 MW), Rajasthan (60MW) and Maharashtra (70MW). The projects have been executed over a period of time, concluding in Q4 FY18.  
With the commissioning of the 340 MW Suzlon has completed delivery of its entire solar order book. The projects have been executed by combination of joint ventures or formation of Special Purpose vehicles (SPVs) with various partners. 
J.P. Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon Group said, We have delivered the entire 340 MW solar project on turnkey basis. Our focus on solar will continue to be through Wind-Solar hybrid projects, which will lead to better utilization of grid, due to complementary generation profile. It will also save on duplication of costs such as land and evacuation infrastructure. We have an edge due to our existing large land bank, technologically advanced products and nationwide O&M strength. With the positive change in the Indian renewable energy landscape, we are confident that the volumes will witness significant growth across all sources of clean energy. Suzlon endeavors to bring down the cost of energy and provide clean and affordable energy for all.
