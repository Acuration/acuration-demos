 Suzlon undertakes De-silting of Ponds in 23 villages across Jaisalmer District
De-silting activity took place across 23 villages 
25,100 cubic meters of capacity increased 
De-silting to ensure rain water storage and aid recharging of groundwater level 
Jaisalmer, India: Suzlon Foundation, the CSR arm of Suzlon Group recently undertook de-silting activity of ponds across 23 villages in Jaisalmer District. The de-silting activity has helped to increase storage capacity by 25,100 cubic meters. The activity was carried out with the help of partner NGOs; CECOEDECON and NIDAN.
De-silting activity in progress
Since Jaisalmer is a desert district, rainfall is very low in the area, which leads to scarcity of water for drinking, agriculture as well as for animals. Hence it becomes very important to collect and store water in the monsoons. The de-silting activity will ensure rain water storage and will aid to recharge groundwater level in the villages. 
Dr. Jasmine Sofia Gogia, General Manager, Suzlon Foundation said, "Suzlon Foundation works towards overall sustainability and balanced growth of communities in and around our area of operations. Water sustainability is extremely vital and improving water efficiency results in higher productivity in farming, better livelihood and thus enhancing the ecological balance of the community. In Rajasthan, our water management program aims to enhance water and land resources in order to create self-sustaining ecosystem for communities."
