 India's first SECI auction wind project by Sembcorp dedicated to the nation 250 MW wind project constructed by Suzlon
First among all SECI auctioned wind projects to achieve full completion
  Project consisting of 119 turbines completed ahead of SECI timelines 
Project to light up more than 2,16,000 homes & reduce CO2 emissions by over 700,000* tonnes/ annum

New Delhi, October 5, 2018: Sembcorp Energy India Limited (SEIL), a leading independent power producer (IPP) in India and Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, today announced the completion of the first SECI 1 wind power project in India. 
The wind power project was dedicated to the nation by Honourable Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri Raj Kumar Singh at the 2nd Global RE-INVEST summit. 
Sembcorp Green Infra Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of SEIL, won this project in the first round of wind bids conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) on behalf of the Government of India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), in April 2017.

Sembcorp's 250 MW project is the first wind power project, under the first reverse wind auctions in India, with the entire capacity completed ahead of the SECI timelines. Suzlon is the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) partner for the project. 
The wind project located at Chandragiri in Tamil Nadu consists of 119 units of Suzlon's 2.1 MW S111-120m Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs). Under long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Sembcorp and Power Trading Corporation (PTC), power generated from the project will be supplied to the states of Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.

Vipul Tuli, Managing Director, Sembcorp Energy India Limited, said, "The successful completion of the Chandragiri wind power project is an important milestone in Sembcorp's journey towards providing energy to support India's continued development and prosperity. It is a moment of pride for Sembcorp Energy India Limited and our EPC partner Suzlon, as we were able to deliver the entire project ahead of the SECI timelines. This project adds to Sembcorp's growing renewable energy portfolio worldwide, and strengthens our collective track record in clean energy.
Not only is this a happy day for Sembcorp, but also for the Indian energy sector. This project reflects the tremendous advances that India's wind industry has made in ensuring cost effective energy security for India, through new technology, executing massive projects on time, indigenisation, and with greater transparency. For this, I would like to thank the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy and Ministry of Power, SECI, PGCIL and other stakeholders for their unwavering support."
J.P. Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon Group, said, "We are pleased to have achieved yet another milestone. We partnered with Sembcorp from the pre-bid stage and delivered the full capacity ahead of the SECI timelines despite the challenges, uncertainties and initial teething issues of the new bidding regime for wind. We are glad we could live up to the trust and confidence of our customers and have successfully met the stringent due diligence and quality standards of Sembcorp. This is indeed a proud moment for us and we thank SECI, all our partners, vendors and stakeholders who have been part of this successful project execution. This is a testament of our joint commitment to "Make in India" and "Powering a Greener Tomorrow" for our nation."
