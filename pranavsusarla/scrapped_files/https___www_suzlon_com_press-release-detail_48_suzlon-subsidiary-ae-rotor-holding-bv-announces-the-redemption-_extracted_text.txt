A notice has been issued to the Bank of New York, Mellon(the Trustee) by SBI CAG pursuant to the occurrence of a pre-payment event (sale of Senvion andlarge amount of equity raising at parent level resulting in reduction in SBLC by the lenders) under theOffering Circular for the issuance of the Bonds. Pursuant to the same, AERH has availed a credit facilityof US$ 590.4 million maturing in March 2018 from State Bank of India, London Branch and ExportImportBank of India, London Branch, at coupon rate of 3.30% backed by the SBLC and repaid US$ 590.4million to the Bondholders on April 29, 2016.As per Accounting Standard 11 (AS 11), companies can amortise the exchange differences pertaining tolong-term foreign currency monetary items up to March 31, 2020 or the period of loan, whichever isearlier.
