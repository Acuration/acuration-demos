November 10, 2017
 Suzlon is well positioned in the transition phase of wind energy sector
527 MW sales volume in H1 FY18  
H1 EBITDA of Rs. 582 crores (Pre-forex); EBITDA Margin 15.1%  *Net profit at Rs. 117 crores in H1 Pune, India: Suzlon Group, Indias largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced its half
yearly (H1 FY18) results.  J P Chalasani, Group CEO, said, "Indian wind industry is in transition from FiT to competitive bidding
mechanism. Indian government's commitment to Renewable Energy remains intact and we strongly
believe that the long term fundamentals of the wind industry are sound. This transition has a
temporary impact on installations in FY18, due slow beginning of bidding and delay in regulatory
approvals. However, we are confident that the industry is likely to regain its momentum with 6 GW+
volume expected in FY19. It will soon migrate towards a 10 GW market size. With the newly discovered
tariff, Wind is competitive with respect to other sources of energy and has emerged as a mainstream
energy source.  Going forward, we are well positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities with our superior
technology, project execution experience spanning over two decades, new generation turbines offering
higher energy yield, presence across the entire value chain, vertically integrated operations and best-in-class
service capabilities."Kirti Vagadia, Group CFO, said, "The advent of bidding has led to a temporary uncertainty due to the
transition from the FiT regime. We have focused on cost optimization across the board including COGS,
fixed costs and interest, in order to become more competitive in this changed market scenario. With
strong project pipeline and customer tie ups, we are confident of quickly ramping up volumes and
execution to meet the expanded market requirements. Our priorities are to continue to ramp up
volumes, build strong order backlog, optimize costs across the board, and maintain disciplined working
capital level." Suzlon Group H1 FY18 financial performance at a glance (consolidated):   Revenue of Rs. 3,852 croresEBITDA (pre-forex) of Rs.582 crores, EBITDA margin of 15.1% Debt (excluding FCCB)   Net term debt at Rs 6,747 crores  Working capital debt at Rs 3,244 crores  Minor increase in Working capital debt due to higher utilization of Working capital limits Key highlights:  Credit rating improvement by CARE ratings: 
SE Forge Limited (SEForge) rating upgraded to BBB+ from the earlier Suzlon Global Services Limited (SGSL), received credit rating upgrade for proposed long
term bank facilities to A (Provisional) rating with stable outlook.
  Note to the editor:  *Includes exceptional gain on account of de-recognition of asset & liabilities and release of foreign currency
