Suzlon took up the challenge put forth by Shri Narendra Modi of establishing 2000 MW windenergy in Gujarat and till date has already installed 1800 MW thus accounting for 20% ofSuzlons total pan-India capacity of over 8250 MW.

Wind energy will give a fillip to the manufacturingindustry in the country. With the Central governments goal of Make in India, Vibrant Gujarat ispoised to attract investments and establish linkages across various the value chain participants. Thiswill reinforce Gujarats position as Indias leading market in renewable energy and illustrate the statescommitment to power a low-carbon economy.As the world is waking up and implementing measures to combat climate change, the contribution ofwind energy in the energy architecture mix across the world has increased manifold. Gujarat is ranked 1st in Economic Freedom of States in India (EFSI) and also has a market-friendlygovernment policy framework with a pro-business mind-set. The state governments initiative to scaleup wind energy to ~10 GW is aimed at giving a fillip to local manufacturing. And the Centralgovernments thrust on clean energy has opened up opportunities for the growth of the SME industriesand sectors such as textiles, automobiles, agricultural products (food processing), cold storage anddefence.
