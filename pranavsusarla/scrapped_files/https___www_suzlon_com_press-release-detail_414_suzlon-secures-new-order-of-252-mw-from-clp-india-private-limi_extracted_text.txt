Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Managing Director, CLP India said, "We are excited about growth opportunities in India, and our shareholders CLP Group and CDPQ share a vision to invest in a low carbon, clean energy portfolio in the country. Our Wind Energy Project in Sidhpur, Gujarat is our largest renewable project at a single site. It is a testimony of our commitment towards India's renewable goals. We are pleased to partner with Suzlon, given their technologically advanced products, EPC capabilities, operations and maintenance services."

Speaking on the order win, Ashwani Kumar, CEO, Suzlon Group said, "We are delighted to partner again with CLP India for their Wind Energy Project in Sidhpur, Gujarat.
