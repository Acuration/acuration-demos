 Suzlon wins order of 71.40MW from Gujarat Industries Power Company Ltd.
Order for 29 units of S97-120 m hybrid tower and 5 units of S97-90 m tubular tower with rated capacity of 2.1MW each.Project to be completed in Kutch, Gujarat by April 2017.To provide operation and maintenance service for a period of 20 years.Pune, India: The Suzlon Group, one of the leading global renewable energy solutions providers in theworld, today announced its maiden order win for 71.40MW wind power project from Gujarat IndustriesPower Company Ltd (GIPL), a leading Gujarat based public sector undertaking engaged in the business ofelectrical power generation. Suzlon will install 29 units of S97-120m Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs)with all steel hybrid tower and 5 units of S97-90m WTGs with tubular tower having rated capacity of2.1MW each.Located in Kutch district, Gujarat, the project will be completed in three phases with executionculminating by April 2017. Suzlon will execute the entire project on a turnkey basis and will also provideoperation and maintenance services for a period of 20 years through an integrated service package.Suzlon has more than two decades of experience in wind sector and maintains and services more than9GW across India, accounting for nearly 37% of the countrys total installations. As of March 2015,Gujarats total wind installations stand at 3,645MW, out of which 1,742MW has been contributed bySuzlon. Suzlons wind energy installations in Gujarat offset approximately 3.5 million tonnes of CO2emissions, thereby supporting the transition of the state to a sustainable energy mix.The S97 series of 2.1MW WTG feature the time tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG)technology which is designed to maximise generation at lower wind sites. It not only delivers higherenergy output, but also offers higher return on investment for our customers.At a height of 120 meters the S97-120m is the Worlds tallest All-Steel Hybrid tower which combinesboth lattice and tubular structures, designed indigenously to harness the enhanced availability of windresources at higher altitudes making low wind sites viable. The combination of lattice and tubular givesenhanced tower strength at lower cost. The three-dimensional lattice structure can support heavierweights due to the broad base and reduces the steel requirement apart from being logistic friendly. Theprototype, set up in November 2014, at Kutch, Gujarat, achieved a PLF of 35%. It has successfullygenerated 6.42 million kWh over the first 12 months of operation. The evolutionary product hasreceived an encouraging response from customers across segments and reflects in the ~600MW ordersreceived till dateMr. Ishwar Mangal, Chief Sales Officer, Suzlon Energy, says, Gujarat has been at the forefront ofgenerating power through renewable energy sources and Suzlon has played a pivotal role incontributing to its renewable energy portfolio. We have developed one of Asias largest wind parks at Kutch (Gujarat) with current capacity of over 1 GW as at 31st March and ongoing further installations.We are pleased to partner with Gujarat Industries Power Company Ltd. (GIPL) for driving theircommitment towards sustainable and affordable energy. We are thankful to GIPL for theconfidence reposed in Suzlon and its technology. With our comprehensive product portfolio,robust in-house R&D and more than 2 decades of experience in providing end-to-end solutionsto customers alongwith integrated maintenance and services, we are best equipped to pursueour focus on bringing down the cost of energy
