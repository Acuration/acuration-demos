Mumbai: Suzlon founder and Chairman & Managing Director, Mr. Tulsi R Tanti hasbeen named as one of the Heroes of the Environment in the current issue of leadinginternational news and current affairs magazine TIME, ranking among the likes ofgiants of the environment movement like Nobel laureate Al Gore and former SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev.Ranked among the Moguls & Entrepreneurs, Mr. Tanti is recognized for his personalvision and leadership in creating Suzlon  one of the worlds leading wind powerplayers. Speaking to TIME about the journey to become one of the most successfulentrepreneurs in renewable energy, Mr. Tanti said: "Yes, green business is goodbusiness, but it's not just about making money. It's about being responsible."Mr. Tanti played a leading role in resurrecting the fledgling wind industry in India,taking what was a fledgling industry just over a decade ago and building thefoundations for what is over a 2,000 MW  year market today. This rapid growth ofthe market has led India to become the fourth leading wind power market in theworld.The recognition comes close on the heels of the recognition of the UN  InternationalPanel of Climate Change, headed by Indias Dr. R.K. Pachauri, and Mr. Al Gore fortheir contribution towards raising awareness and initiating action on Climate Change.Mr. Tanti will be recognized with the Heroes of the Environment award at a ceremonyin London on the 25th Oct, 2007. This will be the second edition of the awards,instituted in 2006 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the establishment ofTIME magazine.With the focused international attention from governments, businesses, media andpeople at large, the response to the climate change crisis is fast shifting from debate,to action. And Suzlon is on leading edge of enterprises working towards poweringsustainable development around the world through harnessing the power of thewind. Suzlon is frontrunner in bringing concrete solutions to mitigating climatechange, and as the company makes an ever increasing contribution, in Mr. Tantisown words, I just want to do what I can to fix the problem."
