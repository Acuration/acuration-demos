This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated 
                            containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based

                            individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account

Google Web Fonts
For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open 
                            a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus 
                                becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the
                                 interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. If your browser does not support web fonts, 
                                 a standard font is used by your computer.
Further information about handling user data, can be 
                                found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google's privacy policy 
                                at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
Google Maps

                                This site uses the Google Maps map service via an API. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, 
                                Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
To use Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address. This information is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and 
                                    stored there. The provider of this site has no influence on this data transfer.
Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of Google at
                                 https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.
                            
Google reCAPTCHA
We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our websites. This service is 
                                provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").
reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form)
                             has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website 
                             visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the
                              website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on
                               the website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.
                           
The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised
                            that such an analysis is taking place.
For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy, please visit the 
                                following links: https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and 
                                https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html.
