most diversified fuel mix portfolios in the country and we are committed to expanding our renewable
energy portfolio on the back of supportive government policies. With wind energy, we have been able

We have a long-standing association with Suzlon for both our wind and solar projects. We made our

world's first solar project quality certification, having exhibited the highest quality standards. We are
confident that we will be able to continue driving operational excellence across all our projects"
