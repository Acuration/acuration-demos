April 29, 2010
 Suzlon global headquarters One Earth receives LEED Platinum certification
?New corporate HQ achieves top sustainability certification, making it one of the worlds greenest?Campus powered 100 percent by renewable energyPune/Washington, D.C.: Suzlon Energy Limited (SEL), the worlds third-largest* andIndias largest wind turbine manufacturer accepted on Thursday, April 29, the Leadership inEnergy and Environment Design (LEED) Platinum award for its new corporate headquartersin Pune, Maharashtra, India.Her Excellency Meera Shankar, the Ambassador of India to the United States, awarded theLEED rating citation to Suzlon at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., jointly organized by theConfederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the US India Business Council (USIBC).The LEED standards  a green environment rating system complying with the standards ofthe U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC)  specify stringent norms to be met for thegreenest, most energy-efficient and high-performance buildings. Started in the U.S., LEEDcertification continues to gain international traction. CII has been at the front of promotingLEED standards in India, having established the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) in2001, in partnership with the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Godrej Foundation & USAID,with technical cooperation with the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). SuzlonsOne Earth campus is among the first 100 sites in India to receive LEED certification.Developed on an area of 41,000 square meters (10.13 acres) with a capacity to house2,300 people, One Earth ranks among the largest green building projects in India. Thefacility sets new benchmarks in energy efficiency in all aspects of engineering andconstruction. This whole-building approach to sustainability helped secure the highest LEEDrating by focusing on key areas such as human and environmental health; sustainable sitedevelopment; efficient water; energy and waste methods, materials and resource selection;and indoor environmental quality and innovation. This approach has also made it possible toconstruct the facility at a lower cost compared to other facilities of comparable size,ultimately leading to a lower lifecycle cost and smaller environmental footprint in the longterm.Specific features of Suzlon One Earth include: Low-energy materials - More than 70 percent of materials used in the interiorshave a reduced carbon footprint. They ensure higher recycled content, have lowerembodied energy and are rapidly renewable. Renewable energy-based exterior lighting - LED street lighting is poweredentirely by renewable energy-based systems located on the site thus reducingapproximately 25 percent of the total lighting load. Ninety percent of regularlyoccupied spaces have daylight exposure, thereby saving on artificial lighting. Daylight & occupancy sensors - Daylight sensors are used in the workstation areafor maximum use of artificial lighting. Occupancy sensors control task lighting inunoccupied workstations ensuring savings of about 20 percent of energy costs. Efficient ventilation system - Jet fans installed in the basements intermittentlypush out stale air & bring in fresh air, saving 50 percent energy as compared toducted basement ventilation system. Storm & rainwater management system - Channels all rain received into acontrolled flow, preventing soil erosion and facilitating removal of silt.Speaking about the award, Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman of Suzlon Group, said, This awardunderlines Suzlons commitment to sustainability. I believe that One Earth  named as atribute to Earths unique existence as a self-replenishing eco-system  will be inspirationand proof to others that it is possible, if we are really determined, to create a sustainableworld for our future.Commenting on the green building movement in India, Ms. Meera Shankar, Ambassador ofIndia to the United States, remarked, The issue of climate change poses a seriouschallenge for India. While meeting this challenge in ways consistent with our nationaldevelopment goals, we also see this as an opportunity to leapfrog in adoption of low carbonintensive technologies and building national competitiveness through resource efficiency.The Green Building Movement, led by industry and the Energy Conservation Building Codes,initiated by the Government of India, are enabling 20-30% reduction in energy consumptionin the building sector. India's commitment and actions speak for themselves.
