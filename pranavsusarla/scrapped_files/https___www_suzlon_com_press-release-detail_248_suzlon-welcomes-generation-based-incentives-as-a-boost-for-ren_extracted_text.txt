 Suzlon welcomes Generation Based Incentives as a boost for renewable energy in India
Copenhagen/Pune: Suzlon Energy Ltd. today welcomed the Governments announcementof Generation-Based Incentives (GBI) for the renewable energy sector, hailing it as a firststep in realizing Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs vision as laid out in the National ActionPlan on Climate Change (NAPCC).Breaking off from key discussions at the COP15 summit in Copenhagen, Mr Tulsi Tanti,Chairman and Managing Director of Suzlon Energy said: "We congratulate ourcountrys leaders on their commitment to combating climate change, and on working tomake the vision of India fueled by renewable energy a reality. Indeed, we applaudspecifically Dr Farook Abdullah, the Minister for New and Renewable Energy; without hisperseverance and persistence it would not have happened.The GBI program is a significant push by the Government of India to take unilateral andvoluntary action to support the growth of renewable energy technologies in the country,creating an attractive investment market for large Independent Power Producers andForeign Direct Investors, which will facilitate large sized projects of 50 MW and above. It isan extremely positive step for the industry in India, and in the fight against climate change.This announcement sends a signal to all nations demonstrating India's commitment to atruly sustainable future."The incentive offered is an option for investors who cannot avail the benefit of accelerateddepreciation, thereby creating the much needed level playing field for stand alone IPPs andFDI investments in the wind energy sector.
