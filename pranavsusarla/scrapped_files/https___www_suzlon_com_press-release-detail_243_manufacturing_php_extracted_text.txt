 Suzlon enters Swedish wind market
                  Order for 4.2 MW through two Suzlon S88-2.1 MW wind turbinesPune/Aarhus: Suzlon Wind Energy A/S (SWEAS), the international business arm of SuzlonEnergy Limited  broke new ground with its first order in Sweden. The order from TriventusAB, the highly respected wind power developer and consultant in Sweden, comprises of twoS88-2.1 MW wind turbines. The 4.2 MW Assjö project, located 150 km from Göteborg andStockholm, will be delivered by SWEAS through a contract that covers engineering,procurement and construction.The project will be sold to Svensk Vindkorporativ Ek. Forening (SVEF), an active local windpower corporative after six months of operation. Suzlon will also sign service andmaintenance partnership agreement with Triventus Energiteknik AB, subsidiary of TriventusAB, which will be applicable to future Suzlon projects in Sweden as well to ensure fastturnaround time and flexible service.Sweden is a high potential wind market with more than 1,000 MW wind power alreadyinstalled making it the tenth largest installed base for wind within Europe. However, withalmost 3,000 MW more expected to be installed by 2013, and new orders of over 1,000 MWover 2008-09 alone, Sweden ranks as the sixth largest wind market in Europe.In 2009, the Swedish Government set forth an integrated climate and energy policy for upto 2020. This forms the most ambitious climate and energy policy ever presented by aEuropean country and proposes highly ambitious targets including that half of Swedensenergy coming from renewable sources in 2020; Swedens net emissions of greenhousegases being equal to zero by the middle of the century with a 40 percent greenhouse gasemissions reduction target for 2020.Speaking on the order, Mr. Erik Winther Pedersen - CEO, Suzlon Wind Energy A/Ssaid, This is our first step into the exciting and promising Swedish wind market. We arevery happy to take this step in partnership with Triventus AB laying the foundation for astrong future. We believe this is an example of our commitment and capabilities that allowus to create solutions that are optimized to the market conditions and our customersneeds.Mr. Gert-Olof Holst - Managing Director, Triventus AB, said, The project called forflexible wind turbine suppliers with an open profile towards operations and maintenancesystem and technology and Suzlon has worked very hard to meet our needs perfectly. Weare confident of their products and services, and look forward to a mutually rewardingrelationship in the long term.Speaking on the order, Mr. Sumant Sinha - COO Suzlon Energy Limited said, Thismarks the beginning of Suzlons establishment in Sweden which with its far reaching visionon climate change and energy presents a very exciting market opportunity for us. This neworder testifies to our customer centricity, and we look forward to expanding our footprint inSweden and the world over."
