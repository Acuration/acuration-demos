The program is scheduled for completion in August, 2009, with no furtherprovisioning needed.Long-term Fund Raising: Suzlon successfully undertook strategic fund raising ofUSD 202 mn. Suzlon issued Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) of USD 108 million,and secured USD 94 million through an issue of Zero Coupon Convertible Bonds.Order Outlook: Suzlon achieved an orderbook of 1,501 MW and INR 8,316 cr. as on30th July, 2009, with 66 MW (INR 380 cr.) in domestic orders and 1,435 MW (INR7,936 cr.) in international orders.REpower reported a confirmed order book of 1,231 MW as on 30th June, 2009, with acontractually confirmed order volume of EUR 1.45 billion and more than EUR 5 billionin framework agreements and firm contracts.Suzlon has also commenced supply of blades to REpower in China, following successfulprototyping and achievement of specific technical criteria.Market Landscape: The global wind markets have continued to feel the impact of thecredit crisis and overall macro-economic conditions. Financing issues continue to be ashort-term challenge, however strong worldwide policy support and cost-competitiveness continue to drive a strong long-term outlook, with the industryprojecting a revival from end-2009. China announced new feed-in-tariffs in place ofthe existing public bidding process, creating a highly competitive market landscape.The US has announced new measures under the stimulus program with provisions forcash grants in lieu of tax credit supports opening up the market to newer investors.Several states in India have announced favourable revisions to purchase prices forwind power adding to wind energys competitive advantage.Speaking on the industry Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman and Managing Director ofSuzlon Energy Limited, said: Despite some momentum being lost, we seegovernments around the world continuously building strong policy frame-works tosupport the growth of renewable energy. Stimulus packages announced bygovernments around the world have dedicated funds of approximately USD 163billion** to green energy, with much of the impact expected to happen in 2010,driving alongside the overall economic revival the world over.Speaking on the companys performance, Mr. Sumant Sinha, COO  SuzlonEnergy Limited, said: We have continued our focus on consolidation in the quarter,and are pleased to report a steady improvement in the health of the operations. Wehave achieved a gradual reduction in working capital intensity, stabilization ofinventory levels and reduction in receivables at the Suzlon Wind level. We have alsobrought extraordinary costs under control, and are on track with the blade retrofitprogram with no new provisions needed. We have launched a focused operations costreduction program targeting significant reduction on costs.While we have registered growth in revenues at a consolidated level, our profits havelagged due to lower quantity of sales at the Suzlon Wind level. This has been causedby multiple factors such as the delayed budget impacting orders in India, andcustomers in international markets postponing deliveries to the second half of thefinancial year. For the full year - we see volumes picking up significantly in the secondhalf, normalising the effect of the first half. On a market-wide level, we see the windindustry revival starting end-2009 with the US stimulus package catalyzing growth inthe US and also other markets with the full impact of the stimulus packages likely tobe felt in 2010 and 2011 revitalizing the wind industry.
