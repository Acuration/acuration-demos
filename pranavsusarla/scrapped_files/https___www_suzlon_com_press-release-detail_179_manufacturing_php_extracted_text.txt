 Proposes pragmatic model that builds on innovative public/private partnerships  to create low-carbon economy Highlights viability of renewable energy; its potential to lead the energy mix and  reduce reliance on fossil fuelsPune / Davos: Tulsi Tanti, Chairman, Suzlon Group  the worlds fifth leading wind turbine maker today presented his publication Lets Save the Planet at the annual meeting of the WorldEconomic Forum in Davos. Developed in association with The Climate Group, Lets Save the Planetdiscusses the opportunities for sustainable development through energy efficient and economicallyprofitable business models.The document outlines the severe threat of climate change and offers a solution through innovativeenergy usage and competitive green solutions.Commenting on the publication, Tulsi Tanti said: Climate change offers us several avenues forsustainable growth. It is a myth that energy efficiency and green development have to be costlyand disruptive. Through this publication I wish to highlight the possibility of a safe and securetomorrow which lies well within our reach.I would specially like to thank The Climate Group for the support they have extended in producingthis document. I urge you all to join their commendable efforts in bringing about a CleanRevolution.Mark Kenber, CEO of The Climate Group, said: Tulsi Tanti is a true pioneer of The CleanRevolution, showing how confronting the global climate challenge goes hand-in-hand with businesssuccess and creating lasting prosperity. In Lets Save the Planet, he lays out a set of small butsignificant steps to take clean technologies to scale and avoid severe environmental damage to theworlds economy. I commend it to all those attending this years World Economic Forum in Davos.Determining the true cost of energy, and forming alliances between governments, private sectorand civil society are essential for securing sustainable future energy needs. The solution outlined inthe document requires commitment to legally binding emissions caps, as well as private sectorinitiatives for sustainable and profitable business models.The astonishingly high potential of modern day renewable energy is highlighted: while oil andconventional gas may peak between 150-160 years, wind and solar alone has over one million GWof estimated potential power capacity, which can fulfill electricity needs for many centuries.To view Lets Save the Planet please ">click here.
