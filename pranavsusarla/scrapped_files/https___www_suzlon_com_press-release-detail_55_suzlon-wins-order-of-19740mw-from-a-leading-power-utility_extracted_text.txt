 Suzlon wins order of 197.40MW from a leading power utility
Order for 56 units of S97 120m hybrid tower and 38 units of S97 90m tubular tower with rated capacity of 2.1MW eachProject to be progressively completed in Kutch and Bhavnagar districts, Gujarat, by March 2017The project will provide electricity to ~0.1 million households and curb ~0.42 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per yearPune, India: The Suzlon Group, one of the leading global renewable energy solutions providers in theworld, today announced its order win for development of 197.40MW wind power project from a leadingprivate sector power utility. Suzlon will install its S97 suite of wind turbine generators (WTGs) with 120mand 90m hub height and rated capacity of 2.1MW each. The projects will be located across three sites inthe Kutch and Bhavnagar districts of Gujarat. The project will be commissioned in phases with completeexecution scheduled by March 2017.Suzlon will execute the entire project on a turnkey basis and will also provide comprehensive operationand maintenance services for the complete project lifecycle.The Suzlon Group is credited with building one of Asias largest wind parks located in Kutch, Gujarat andhas contributed ~1,742MW of wind energy installations across the State. Suzlons wind installations inthe state offset ~3.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, thereby supporting the transition of thestate to a sustainable green energy mix.Speaking on the order win, Mr. Ishwar Mangal, Chief Sales Officer, Suzlon Energy, said, The order winfrom the leading power utility underscores our commitment and focus on the domestic market. Thecustomer faith and trust in our technology, new products and end-to-end capabilities is trulyencouraging. We believe the synergy in our common resolve towards Indias energy security brought ustogether to partner for this project. We are witnessing interest from power utilities to invest inrenewable energy not only to meet their RPO requirements, but to also contribute towards a greenertomorrow.Suzlon has more than two decades of experience in the wind sector and is the custodian of more than9GW wind assets across India. We are best equipped to cater to the growing demand for renewableenergy in India with our pan-India presence, comprehensive product portfolio, robust in-house R&D andbest-in-class services.The S97 series of 2.1MW WTG features the time tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG)technology which is designed to maximise generation at lower wind sites. It not only delivers higherenergy output, but also offers higher return on investment (ROI) for our customers. At a height of 120meters the S97 120m is the worlds tallest all-steel hybrid tower which combines both, lattice andtubular structures. Designed indigenously to harness the enhanced availability of wind resources athigher altitudes, the hybrid tower has made low wind sites viable. The prototype set up in November2014 at Kutch, Gujarat, recently achieved a Plant Load Factor (PLF) of 35%. It has successfully generated6.42 million kWh over the first 12 months of operation.
