This combined capacityincludes projects located in the high wind states of Rio Grande do Norte & Ceara in Brazil. The installationscomprise of 150 WTGs (Wind Turbine Generators) of Suzlons proven S9X product series  S95 & S97 and 18WTGs of Suzlon work-horse of S88, both with a rated capacity of 2.1 MW.The above 168 WTGs were distributed amongst three major clients representing Banks/FinancialInstitutions/Funds and EPC/Construction Companies in Brazil.Speaking on the project completion, Mr Tulsi R.

We remain focused on high growth & emerging markets and Brazil is akey geography of our growth strategy. Suzlon is committed to contribute to Brazils energy basket by reducingits carbon footprint and bridging the countrys power needs.Suzlon machines across various wind farms in Brazil have delivered the highest Capacity Factor in Brazil overthe years. According to Operador Nacional do Sistema Electrico (ONS), Brazils national grid operator, amongstthe top ten Wind Farms for the period Dec 2013 to Nov 2014, the first five slots and the eighth rank has beenawarded to the Wind Farms with Suzlon machines.The three projects will contribute to reducing Brazils carbon footprint by eliminating approximately 0.54million tonnes of CO2 emissions per-annum.
