 Suzlon Group announces S8X; next generation low-wind 1.5 MW turbine for India
Pune: Suzlon Group, the worlds fifth largest wind turbine maker*, announced itslatest turbine in the 1.5 MW range focused on harnessing Class III, low-wind sites.The new turbine is specifically designed to deliver high efficiency and cost effectivepower generation even at low wind speeds, therefore increasing the size of themarket and making wind power projects even more financially competitive than theyare today.The S8X, scheduled for launch in 2012, is designed specifically for the Indian marketwhere the majority of potential lies in medium-to-low wind sites. This turbine isdesigned with advanced rotors, with diameters of 86.5 and 89 meters, and a towerheight of 90 meters, which will bring improvements in energy yields of between 15to 20 percent over the current S82  1.5 MW offering in low wind conditions.Additionally, the S8X is designed specifically to operate in high temperatures, and tomeet the current and future grid requirements in India.This turbine is an evolution of the proven S82  1.5 MW platform, withapproximately 2,400 MW in installations consistently delivering 97 percent plusavailability (uptime). The new design also incorporates several key features from theS9X suite of turbines, helping to achieve higher reliability, improved power output,higher safety and improved lightening protection. Like the S9X, the new turbineoffers an improved pitch and yaw system, hub assembly, main frame and other keycomponents, ensuring easier maintenance, greater reliability and higher uptime.Speaking on the subject, Mr. John OHalloran, President, Technology  SuzlonEnergy Limited, said: This marks an extremely important step forward in ourproduct strategy. The S8X builds on our extensive operating experience with ourhighly successful S82  1.5 MW fleet in some of the most challenging environmentsin the world. The development program drew extensively on feedback from our keycustomer groups  primarily PSUs and IPPs in India  to create a product that meetstheir current and future needs, and provides consistently improving returns oninvestment.The S8X features advanced blade designs and highly efficient control systems tooptimize loads and performance  delivering higher reliability, significantly improvedenergy output and ultimately, increased financial performance for our customers.These turbines will be built to the latest guidelines issued by certification agencies,with even more advanced and stringent testing standards than previous guidelines.Added Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman  Suzlon Group: We are very pleased to bringthis cutting edge offering to the market. The S8X represents our relentlesscommitment to continuously improve our products and services to meet the exactneeds of our customers, today and in the future.As the Indian wind market continues to grow at over 40 percent per year, webelieve the S8X will be a game changer in the high-growth 1.5 MW segment delivering higher reliability, uptime, energy production and ultimately greatlyimproved returns on investment to customers over its lifecycle.
