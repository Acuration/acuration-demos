 Suzlon signs Australian orders; Two contracts over 200 MW of capacity
Mumbai: Suzlon Energy Limited (SEL), the worlds fifth leading and Indias largestwind turbine manufacturer announced the signing of two major new orders inAustralia. The contracts, totaling over 200 MW of capacity, were signed with SydneysRPV (Renewable Power Ventures) and utility-major AGL Energy by the companysAustralia-operations arm  Suzlon Energy Australia Pty Ltd (SEA).Speaking on the orders Mr. Dan Kofoed Hansen, CEO  SEA, said: We are verypleased to partner with RPV and AGL Energy to deliver sustainable power solutions inAustralia. The large size of the orders, and AGLs repeat-order, demonstrate our abilityto deliver total wind farm solutions to the exacting expectations of our customers. Weare looking to continue our success and assume an even larger role on Australias windenergy stage.The first contract, from Sydney-based Renewable Power Ventures, calls for thedelivery of 63 units of Suzlon S88  2.1 MW wind turbine, translating to 132 MW ofcapacity. The project, named Capital Wind Farm, will come up in New South Wales,approximately 50 kilometers north of Canberra. The contract includes full turnkeydelivery including a 330kV electrical substation and power line works and is scheduledfor completion in the first half of 2009.The second contract, a repeat contract from AGL Energy  one of Australias leadingutilities - calls for the delivery of 34 units of Suzlons S88 turbine translating to 71.4MW of capacity. The project will come up in South Australia approximately 250kilometers north of Adelaide, and near the original Hallett project where AGLs initial95 MW project supplied by Suzlon is under development."The Hallett Hill wind farm will significantly add to AGLs capability to selfsupplyits renewable generation needs. Hallett Hill is a superior location forwind generation. In addition to one of the best wind resources on mainlandAustralia, its proximity to the Hallett wind farm, which will use the sameturbines, will provide significant opportunities for operating efficiencies andsynergies stated Mr Michael Fraser, CEO of AGL EnergyWith its plentiful windy sites and a growing economy, we believe Australia is keymarket for wind energy. We are very proud to partner with Renewable Power Venturesand AGL Energy to deliver the economically profitable and environmentally sustainablebenefits of wind energy to Australia, stated, Mr. Andre Horbach  CEO, SuzlonGroup.
