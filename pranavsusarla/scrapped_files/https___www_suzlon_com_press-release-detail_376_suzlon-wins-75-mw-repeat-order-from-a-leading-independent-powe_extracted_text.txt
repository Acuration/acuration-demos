 Suzlon wins 75 MW repeat order from a leading Independent Power Producer (IPP) through MSEDCL bid
To supply  around 36 units of S111-140m with rated capacity of 2.1 MW each
Project to be completed in Maharashtra as per MSEDCL bid guidelines
The project will provide electricity to ~46,850 households and curb ~1,54,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year

Pune, India: Suzlon Group, Indias largest renewable energy solutions provider, today announced its order win for development of 75 MW wind power project from a leading Independent Power Producer (IPP) through Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) bid. Suzlon will install around 36 units of S111-140m wind turbine generators (WTGs) with rated capacity of 2.1 MW each. The project will be located in Maharashtra and will be commissioned as per MSEDCL bid guidelines. 
Suzlon will execute the entire project on a turnkey basis and will also provide comprehensive operation and maintenance services for the complete project lifecycle. 
Speaking on the order win, J.P. Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon Group said, We are glad to partner with the leading IPP yet again for their MSEDCL bid project. We are encouraged by the trust and confidence demonstrated by them in Suzlons technologically advanced and innovative products and services. With our two decades of experience, proven technologies, comprehensive product portfolio, and end-to-end solutions along with integrated maintenance and services, Suzlon is best positioned to capitalize on the growing market opportunities in India.
