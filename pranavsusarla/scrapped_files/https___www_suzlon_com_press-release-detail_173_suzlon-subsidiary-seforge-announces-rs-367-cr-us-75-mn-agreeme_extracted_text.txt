 Suzlon-subsidiary SEFORGE announces Rs 367 cr (US$ 75 mn) agreement with wind major
Coimbatore / Pune: SEFORGE Limited, a Suzlon Group subsidiary, announced akey purchase agreement with a leading wind turbine manufacturer for the supply ofmachined tower flanges, used for wind towers, over a period of three years. The Rs.367 crore (US$ 75 mn) contract covers supply of flanges for wind turbine towers forprojects in India and international markets.Speaking on the agreement, Mr. Kamlesh Bhadani, CEO - SEFORGE, said: Thisagreement underscores our ability to deliver components that meet the exactingstandards of the global wind industry.This agreement, alongside recent agreements with other tower manufacturers and alarge European bearing producer, highlight SEFORGEs growing presence as anindependent parts supplier to wind and related industries. We project that by FY1350 per cent of our sales will be from companies outside the Suzlon Group.Speaking on the order, Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman  Suzlon Group, said: This is avery important order that underscores our collaborative relationship with other majorwind turbine companies the world over. Wind has today achieved parity with mostconventional sources of energy, beating even gas in per-unit cost in some markets;and it is projected that by 2015 wind will be truly competitive against even coalbasedpower. With wind contributing a mere three per cent to the worlds energy gridtoday, we as an industry have a enormous opportunity before us to become a centralpillar of the energy mix of the future.SEFORGE operates a state of the art forging facility capable of producing seamlessforged rings of maximum diameter of 5.2 meters, with an annual capacity ofbetween 40,000 to 60,000 rings at Vadodara, Gujarat. SEFORGE has establisheditself as a key supplier to all major wind turbine manufacturers in India for thesupply of forged rings used in wind turbine towers and bearings. The company alsosupplies rings to major international players in the oil and gas, power and defensesectors over and above the bearing and wind turbine sectors.Three long-term agreements signed by SEFORGE in last few months together willconsume approximately 40 per cent of SEFORGEs forging capacity for the next threeyears.SEFORGE also has a foundry division, based in Coimbatore, with a modernmanufacturing facility capable of producing large sizes of castings with an annualcapacity of 120,000 MT of castings. Large size castings are primarily supplied to windindustry, and the Foundry division also has potential to diversify into heavyengineering, aerospace and power sector equipment.
