Turbines totaling 400 MW of capacity hit high performance over 12 monthsChicago: Suzlon Wind Energy Corp. announced the one-year anniversary and outstandingperformance at four Oregon wind power projects that came online. Horizon Wind Energyand Iberdrola Renewables have each hosted two of the Suzlon wind farms that were thefirst Suzlon S88-2.1 MW turbines installed in the Pacific Northwest last year.We are proud to be marking the one-year anniversary of our Oregon projects as theyvesurpassed an average 97 percent availability throughout the first year, said AndrisCukurs, CEO of Suzlon Wind Energy Corp. In 2010, we are growing our business withboth Iberdrola Renewables and Horizon Wind Energy in the Pacific Northwest and lookforward to delivering even more high-performing wind farms.We have been pleased with Suzlons performance over the past year and hope to seecontinued excellence in availability, said Terry Oswald, director of operations forHorizon Wind Energy.The four projects involve 190 Suzlon S88-2.1 MW turbines, which contribute 400 megawattsof power generation capacity to Oregons almost 1,758 megawatts of installed wind power.In the U.S., 400 MW of wind energy can power an average of 140,000 homes. A fifthOregon wind farm, Star Point in Moro, Ore., was finished recently, increasing to 28 percentthe percentage of wind power generated in-state by Suzlon turbines.Oregon, which ranks No. 6 in the U.S. in installed megawatts of wind capacity, also isplanning to add more. In the coming year, Suzlons presence in the Pacific Northwest willincrease with the development of Leaning Juniper in Arlington, Ore., an IberdrolaRenewables wind farm and Horizon Wind Energy project at Kittitas Valley Wind Farm inKittitas, Wash.Suzlon continually has shown us a commitment to its turbines, said John Martinez,regional director of operations at Iberdrola Renewables. The turbines haveperformed exceptionally well since the start of commercial operation.The four Oregon projects exceeding 97 percent average availability include RattlesnakeRoad and Wheat Field in Arlington, both hosted by Horizon Wind Energy; and Pebble Springsin Arlington, and Hay Canyon in Wasco, both hosted by Iberdrola Renewables. The recentlycommissioned fifth Oregon wind farm, Star Point in Moro, is also owned by IberdrolaRenewables.
