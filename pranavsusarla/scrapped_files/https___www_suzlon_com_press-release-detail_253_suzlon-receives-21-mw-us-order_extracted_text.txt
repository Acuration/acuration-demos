 Suzlon receives 21 MW US order
         Project part of Minnesotas innovative community based wind modelChicago: Suzlon Wind Energy Corp., the North American subsidiary of Suzlon EnergyLimited (SEL) - the world's third largest wind turbine group, with 12.3 per cent ofglobal market share* - announced a new order for the community-based Grant CountyWind Farm in southwestern Minnesota, USA. Developed by ">Juhl Wind (Juhl) ofWoodstock, Minn., the project consists of 10 Suzlon S88 2.1 MW wind turbines and atfull capacity will produce 21 megawatts, enough energy to power 7,000 homes in thearea.The Grant County Wind Farm is a Community-Based Energy Development (C-BED)project and is partially owned by local farmers. C-BED is an initiative in Minnesota thatfosters the development of renewable energy by optimizing local and regionalagricultural and economic resources. This often allows for interconnection of smallerrenewable energy systems to the larger power grid and cost-sharing, creating a stablemarket for renewable energy.Were excited to be a part of this community-run project to help generate clean windpower and revenue for farmers and towns in the region, said Andris Cukurs, CEO ofSuzlon Wind Energy Corp. Currently, community-run wind power projects are rare inthe U.S., but the Grant County project is proof that renewable energy can beactualized in a variety of ways.The project is interconnected with Otter Tail Power Company and Northern StatesPower (NSP) is purchasing the clean energy. The Grant County Wind Farm will joinOtter Tails existing 45 megawatts of renewable energy on the grid, while NSP - aleading electric utility company - will offer the electricity to its service territory spreadacross the northern states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Dakotas and Michigans UpperPeninsula.Once again, we are happy to partner with Suzlon and Minnesota farmers on windenergy development, and expanding to Grant County, said Dan Juhl, CEO of JuhlWind, which was Suzlons first customer in the U.S. Community wind farms helpfarmers diversify their revenue streams while producing renewable energy for the localarea. We have worked with Suzlon for several years now and have been pleased withthe partnership in bringing Suzlon machines to Minnesota communities desiring asustainable power supply.The Grant County Wind Farm is a great example of a community-led initiative forrenewable energy, said Denise Bode, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association.The perks of wind power arent exclusive to developers and utilities alone; this projectshows how citizens can save money and be more energy efficient through their ownrenewable energy projects.Construction on the site has already begun. The wind farm is expected to be incommercial operation in the first quarter of 2010.
