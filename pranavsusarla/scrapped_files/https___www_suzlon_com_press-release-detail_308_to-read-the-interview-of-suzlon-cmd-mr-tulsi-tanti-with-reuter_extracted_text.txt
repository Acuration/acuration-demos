 To read the interview of Suzlon CMD Mr. Tulsi Tanti with Reuters
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - India's Suzlon Energy, the world's fourth-largest windturbine maker, plans to invest about $1.4 billion to almost triple its productioncapacity by 2009, allowing it to expand at twice the pace of the rapidly growingindustry.The expansion would raise Suzlon's turbine production capacity in India to 5,700megawatt (MW) by March 2009 from 2,700 MW now, the firm's chairman Tulsi Tantisaid in an interview on Wednesday.By the end of this year its recently acquired subsidiary, Germany's REpowerSystems, would have increased its capacity to 1,200 MW from an existing 700 MW,he added."The total investment in this three-year plan is about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion)and most of this investment would be financed by debt," Tanti said in Singapore,where he attended the Forbes CEO Conference.Tanti said the expansion would allow Suzlon to grow twice as fast as the global windindustry which, he said, was likely to expand at 20-30 percent in the next threeyears.The company also plans to raise its capacity to produce wind gearboxes, made by itsunlisted Belgian subsidiary Hansen Transmissions, to 9,300 MW by 2009, Tanti saidThe company's order book stands at around $3.5 billion, up from $3.3 billion in July,with most orders from outside India, he said.Shares in Suzlon traded up 0.6 percent at 1,333.8 rupees in a slightly weakerbroader market, having risen less than 3 percent so far this year.Suzlon also makes wind turbines in China and owns manufacturing facilities formaking components like rotor blades, generators, control systems and towers inIndia and the United States.It competes with industry leaders Vestas Wind Systems of Denmark, General Electricand Spain's Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica. All are tapping demand for cleanerenergy sources."Most of the growth in absolute megawatt terms would come from Europe and thenfrom markets like China and the United States," Tanti said.He said growth at home -- India generates about 40 percent of Suzlon's revenues --was likely to be around 20 percent in the same period."The emerging markets where the growth is likely to be strong in coming yearswould be in South America and Africa, countries like Brazil, South Africa andTanzania," he said.Tanti said the company was unlikely to make any new acquisitions, after buying amajority stake in REpower in May this year and acquiring Hansen, the world'ssecond-largest wind gearbox-maker, in March 2006."Now we want to consolidate all the businesses and focus on organic growth. Wehave the full value chain so we don't require further acquisitions for now."Tanti said the company has also put on hold its plans to seek a secondary listing inEurope. "At this moment no such plan is there. Maybe at an appropriate time we willthink about it."The company said in June it might seek a listing in London or Frankfurt in the next12-24 months.
