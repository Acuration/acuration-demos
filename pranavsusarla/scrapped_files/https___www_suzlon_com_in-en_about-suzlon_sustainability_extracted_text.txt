About Suzlon
Sustainability


Sustainability





                  Suzlon is transforming and redefining the way renewable energy sources are harnessed across the World. Climate change, resource depletion and
                  increasing cost of energy are some of the crucial challenges which are impacting all of us. Hence it has become crucial to implement the concept of Sustainability in all business operations.
               

                  Suzlon believes that the purpose of a business is around creating shared value and it was with this in mind that the very business of wind energy was started. Sustainability at Suzlon refers to sustainable development, defined as development that ‘meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.’ (The Brundtland Commission, UN, 1987). Suzlon subscribes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which are articulated by the United Nations and is working towards these SDGs. The major emphasis is on working towards ending poverty, food security, education, gender equality, water-energy access, infrastructure, employment, reduce inequalities, influence production patterns, combat and mitigate climate change, as well as promote inclusive societies. Since Suzlon acknowledges the fact that the future generations have similar rights as the current one, therefore integration of environmental, social, and economic values into business operations will serve as the key.
