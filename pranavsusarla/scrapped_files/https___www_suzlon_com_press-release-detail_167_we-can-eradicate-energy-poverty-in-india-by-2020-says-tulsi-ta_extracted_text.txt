 We can eradicate energy poverty in India by 2020,  says Tulsi Tanti in TERI University address
New Delhi / Pune: Suzlon Group Chairman Tulsi Tanti in a speech at The Energy andResources Institutes (TERI) University on the occasion of Earth Day, highlighted energy povertyas the greatest challenge facing India today.Speaking to an audience comprising of students and leading academics, Noble Laureate Dr. RKPachauri  Chancellor of TERI University and Chairperson  Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange and Mr Mark Kenber, CEO of The Climate Group.Mr Tanti spoke on the urgent need to work towards a sustainable energy economy, hehighlighted the challenges and the opportunities India faces.With our increasing population and drive to bring better living standards to all  the most crucialenabler for India is energy. Each Indian must have access to safe, secure and affordable energysupplies  this is a fundamental right. It is a sad fact that even today approximately 400 millionIndians do not have regular access to power.However, this is not an insurmountable challenge. With the right policies, investment andpublic-private partnership models, we can bring energy poverty to an end by 2020. For this tohappen we must all  government, industry and citizens  must make a sustainable energy mixan immediate and urgent priority. The tools are already with us, we are blessed with more thanenough wind, sun and tides to meet our needs and that of future generations. India is uniquelypositioned among developing nations to leapfrog the technology divide and lead the change. Aspopulations grow and with it the need for energy, we have the opportunity to lead the world onto the road to truly sustainable, equitable development.He added: Its been an honor to speak at the university and I really enjoyed the opportunity toconnect to the youth of the country. Their response has been very heartening. They havepledged to live and work in ways which would minimize their carbon footprints.Mr Tanti also introduced his publication Lets Save the Planet launched at the annual meeting ofthe World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year. Developed in association with The ClimateGroup, Lets Save the Planet discusses the opportunities for sustainable development throughenergy efficient and economically profitable business models. The document outlines the severethreat of climate change and offers a solution through innovative energy usage and competitivegreen solutions.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global population will increase by 26 percent, from 6.8 billion in 2009 to 8.6 billion in 2035, with over 90 per cent of the increasehappening in non-OECD regions. Those non-OECD countries will deliver a further 70 percent of the increase in economic growth and up to 90 per cent of energy demand growth.
