July 6, 2020
 Suzlon announces Q4 FY20 Results
Revenue FY20 at Rs 2,933 crores, Q4 FY20 Rs 643 crores
Pre-forex EBITDA loss of Rs 423 crores in FY20, Rs. 150 crores in Q4 FY20

Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced its fourth
quarter (Q4 FY20) and annual audited results for financial year 2019-20 (FY20).
J P Chalasani, Group CEO, said, "It was a highly challenging year where the market remained
restricted to very low volumes and the country witnessed only 20% capacity utilization. Suzlon has
installed 350 MW in FY20 in spite of working capital constraints and the Debt Restructuring process.
Our Operation and Maintenance Service (OMS) and SEForge our forging and foundry business
continued to perform well. Post the delayed transition phase the Industry has installed ~2.1 GW in
FY20, taking the overall installed capacity to 37.7 GW and contributing 44% of India's installed
Renewable Energy capacity. The market in now on a path to recovery and tenders from earlier
auctions are yet to close. The Company is very well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity
post the debt restructuring. The Government's thrust on 'Make in India' and becoming
'ATMANIRBHAR' will also help Suzlon's growth as we would be able to manufacture wind turbines
and its components for the sector as a whole in the country and reduce imports."
Swapnil Jain, CFO, said, "In FY20 our debt restructuring and working capital constraints continued to
impede our operations and that is reflected in our performance. Our losses at EBIDTA level are
primarily because the WTG (Wind Turbine Generator) business, was almost at a standstill resulting in
under-absorption of overheads and certain non-recurring costs. Having closed our debt restructuring
successfully we have also reduced our fixed costs in FY20 thereby bringing down our break-even
levels significantly. Post restructuring we will have an improved balance sheet in FY21, equipping us
to ramp up execution of our order book."
