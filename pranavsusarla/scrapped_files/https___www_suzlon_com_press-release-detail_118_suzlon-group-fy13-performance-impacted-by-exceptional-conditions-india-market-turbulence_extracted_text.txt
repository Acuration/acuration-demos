 Suzlon Group FY13: Performance impacted by exceptional conditions; India market turbulence
Liability management-focus impacts volumes, execution, adds nonroutine costsRevenues of Rs 18,743 cr / ~US$ 3.33 bn         o REpower FY13 revenues of EUR 2.22 bn; 35% CAGR FY11  FY13Consolidated EBIT of Rs (2,037) cr/ US$ (362) mnProject Transformation: Suzlon Wind operating fixed costs down by 20%, headcount down by over 2,000; working capital reduced to 20% at Group-level; further optimization underwayPune: Suzlon Group, the worlds fifth largest* wind turbine maker, on Thursday 30th May2013, announced its results for financial year 2012-13 (FY13).Mr Tulsi Tanti, Chairman  Suzlon Group, said: This has been an extremely difficultyear for the Suzlon Group. We faced both significant internal challenges on the liabilitymanagement front, and externally with a highly competitive global wind sector, andturbulent India market which shrank by almost 50 per cent.Breaking out of this cycle required a strategic shift on our part in order to preserve valueand ensure the sustainability of our business in the long-term. This meant that, over thefiscal, the business was under-resourced which contributed to what is a very poor result.However, we consider this to have been a necessary sacrifice and have made substantial andreal progress in addressing our liabilities, as well as in improving our business efficiency.Despite these challenges, we secured new orders of nearly US$ 4.3 bn over the year,REpower continued to outperform the sector, and we enter the new fiscal focusing 100 percent on execution.Mr Kirti Vagadia, Group Head of Finance, said: As we have stated in the past, FY13presented us with a textbook conflict in allocation of resources, between our business needsand those of our liabilities. While we made significant progress, under ProjectTransformation, in streamlining the organization over the year  reducing headcount atSuzlon Wind by nearly 2,000 positions, improving business efficiency, and in liabilitymanagement  the impact of this has been a very low volume of execution, along with theresultant non-routine costs. Delays in execution have also led to the cancellation of a smallnumber of orders, totaling 195 MW; however with a steady intake of new orders, our orderbook position remains net positive, giving us solid order coverage over the mid-term.While our FY13 numbers are extremely disappointing, the business is starting to stabilize.We embark into FY14 with additional working capital support, a leaner workforce, lower fixedcosts, and a more efficient cash cycle. While the market environment continues to remainextremely challenging, we are positioning the business to take advantage of the marketrecovery, which is independently projected for CY2014.Key updates:Business performance:? Performance at the Suzlon Wind level was significantly impacted by the internalfocus on liability management; as well as by our home market, India, shrinking bynearly 50 per cent due to removal of key policies  Accelerated Depreciation (AD) andGeneration Based Incentives (GBI)  limited Suzlon Wind volumes to 251 MW, andadded non-routine costs. The GBI policy has been reinstated in FY2013-14 Unionbudget.REpower continued to outperform the industry achieving 35 per cent CAGR FY11 FY13, and posting revenues of EUR 2.22 bn for FY13 against EUR 1.67 bn for FY12.The Company crossed 1 GW in installations in both the US and UK, and maintainedthe Groups position as the second leading offshore supplier in 2012.? The Groups Service (OMS) vertical continued its growth with total installedcapacity under contract approaching 20,000 MW, translating to a service orderbacklog of US$ 3.4 bn over a five-year horizon. With best-in-class availability, theOMS vertical contributed 9.6 per cent of Group revenues in FY13, projected toincrease by over 38 per cent year-on-year, with EBIDTA margins of over ~25 percent.Exceptional items: The FY13 financial result was impacted by non-routine costs, includingforeign exchange losses, asset impairments, tax credit reversal et al, totaling approximatelyRs 1,100 cr.Board meeting update: The Board of Directors approved an omnibus resolution forissuance of equity or other equity linked instruments to an extent of Rs 5,000 cr, subject tothe approval of shareholders. This is an enabling resolution to facilitate the Company to raisefunds at an appropriate time, if required.Liability management: The Company's Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) package wasapproved and implemented, extending the maturity profile of its domestic debt with a twoyear moratorium on principal and interest on term debt, conversion of interest costs intoequity, lower interest rates, and a significantly back-ended maturity profile. Additionalworking capital support also became available under the CDR package, helping restart theKey updates:Business performance:?
