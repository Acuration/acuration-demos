Ranked 67th in the Carbon Clean 200 (Clean200)- a list of the 200 largest companies worldwide ranked by their total clean energy revenuesLeads amongst the seven Indian companies featured in the list for clean energy revenue generation Suzlons global wind installations of ~15.5 GW help in reducing 20.50 million tons of CO2 emissions annually    Pune, India: Suzlon Group, one of the leading renewable energy solutions providers in the world, today announced that it is ranked 67th in the inaugural Carbon Clean 200 list of clean energy companies worldwide ranked by their green energy revenues. The Clean 200, the biggest 200 public companies by green energy revenues is published by Canada based research house Corporate Knights and non-profit organization As You Sow. Speaking on the occasion J.P Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon Group said, We are proud to be ranked amongst the leading Indian companies in the Clean 200 list. It is a testimony of our efforts towards powering a greener tomorrow and creating a low carbon economy. Our vision is aligned to the government commitment at COP21 to cut the rate of carbon emissions relative to GDP by 33% to 35% by 2030 and achieving 40% renewables by 2030. We are committed to play a pivotal role in Indias transition from a fossil fuel dominated energy architecture to a sustainable, affordable and reliable energy mix. The Clean 200 ranks the largest publicly listed companies worldwide by their total clean energy revenues as rated by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). In order to be eligible, a company must have a market capitalization greater than US$1 billion and earn more than 10 per cent of total revenues from clean energy sources. The list excludes all oil and gas companies and utilities that generate less than 50% of their power from renewable sources, as well as the top 100 coal companies measured by reserves.  Environment Sustainability is at the core of Suzlon Groups philosophy with a vision to Power a greener tomorrow.
