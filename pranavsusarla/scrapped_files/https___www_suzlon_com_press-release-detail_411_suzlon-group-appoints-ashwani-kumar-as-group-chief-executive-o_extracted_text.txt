 Suzlon Group appoints Ashwani Kumar as Group Chief  Executive Officer
Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced
today that it has appointed Mr. Ashwani Kumar as its Group CEO.
Ashwani Kumar, with over three decades of experience in the areas of projects, business development and finance at leading Indian Power and Infrastructure companies is a Mechanical Engineer, and an alumnus of IIM Bangalore and The Harvard Business School.
Having led construction of over 6,000 MW of power projects from bidding to commercial operations, Ashwani Kumar has proven expertise in closing and managing large, complex contracts, effectively leveraging corporate affairs and leading transformations resulting in agile and responsive organizations.
Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman and Managing Director, Suzlon Group said, "I am delighted that
Ashwani Kumar is joining the Suzlon family. He brings with him rich experience of power and
infrastructure sectors in India. Renewable energy has transformed into a mainstream source
of energy offering power plant scale solutions, making his experience highly relevant for us.
Having worked extensively in infrastructure as well as in utility management, Ashwani is the right fit for the organization given the current context of new opportunities for wind and renewable energy in India and all over the world. With his keen commercial acumen, I am confident that he will lead Suzlon with tremendous success and create lasting value for all our stakeholders. I wish him all the very best."
Ashwani Kumar said, "I have always followed Suzlon's journey with keen interest. I have
great respect for the resilience and tenacity of the company and its stakeholders. I believe
the business fundamentals are strong with compelling and credible business operations.
I also believe that the time for wind and renewable energy to grow exponentially in India is
now. We have seen how the world is moving towards responsible choices and I see a future
where sustainable sources like renewable energy will be the new normal. The early signs of
growth are already there and Suzlon is best positioned to tap into the next phase of RE
sector growth in India. I am excited to join the company at such an important juncture and
look forward to working with the founders, the management team and the Suzlon family to
build a stronger, future ready company."
