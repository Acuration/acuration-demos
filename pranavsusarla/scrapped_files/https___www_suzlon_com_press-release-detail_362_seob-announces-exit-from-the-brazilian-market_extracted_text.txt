 SEOB announces exit from the Brazilian market
Pune, India:
Suzlon Energy Ltd (Company) announces the filing of voluntary
liquidation of its Brazilian subsidiary Suzlon Energia Eólica do
Brasil Ltda. (SEOB). 

SEOB
was established to manage business opportunities in Brazil in 2006. 

SEOB
has taken this decision after carefully
considering all options and as a consequence of multiple factors that
are unique to Brazil.
Commenting on the
announcement, the company spokesperson said, We believe that this
is a responsible decision for the benefit of long-term sustainability
of the Company and its shareholders.
The decision does not, in
any way, alter Suzlons global operations strategy.
