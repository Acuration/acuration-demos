 Suzlon installs solar powered street lights in Tuticurin district, Tamil Nadu
 Four solar street lights were installed in Ottanatham and Sangampatti villages, Tuticurin
 district.  200 families benefitted from the activity. Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu: In line with the vision of powering a greener tomorrow Suzlon Foundation,along with Association for Integrated Rural Development (AIRD), installed two solar street lights in eachvillage, Ottanatham and Sangampatti, in Tuticurin district, Tamil Nadu as part of the zero darknessinitiative. The objective of the activity was to promote green energy sources for community lighting andto reduce the carbon footprint. The lights were installed in common places where there was completedarkness.A total of 200 families benefited from the activity. The activity witnessed support from electedrepresentatives of Gram Panchayat.Dr. Jasmine Sofia Gogia, General Manager, Suzlon Foundation said, At Suzlon, we are guided by thephilosophy to pursue social, economic and ecological development for our planet. More than 1.3 billionpeople in the world do not have access to electricity. The common areas in the villages are dark after sundown, making it unsafe to step outside their homes due to security concerns. To overcome this problem,we came up with the initiative of installing solar street lights in the villages that do not have access toelectricity at night.To help break the cycle of poverty, people must have access to light wherever and whenever they need.By providing these solar powered lights, we are bringing clean, efficient, renewable, and affordableillumination to the rural areas, thereby making a positive impact. We thank the elected representativesof Gram Panchayat for extending their support in carrying out this activity. Suzlon has wind energy installations of over 2,000MW in Tamil Nadu spread across various locations.Over 100 villages are covered under Suzlons CSR programs in Tamil Nadu.Suzlon believes that it has the responsibility to enhance financial, natural, social, human and physicalresources around its operating areas. Suzlon Foundation has developed a sustainability frameworkwhich forms the basis of its responsive programs. These include those programs that respond toneighbourhood needs and to offset the social/environmental impact of the business, if any. Apart frombeing a technology leader, Suzlon aims to champion the cause of sustainable energy and create a lastingand harmonious environment.
