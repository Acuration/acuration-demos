 Suzlon Foundation collaborates with Rajasthan Government for water conservation initiative in Jaisalmer
 Constructs Anicut- water harvesting structure in Pohra   The activity will benefit 300 families and will conserve around 1 lakh cubic meter of water Jaisalmer, India: Suzlon Foundation in collaboration with the Government of Rajasthan launched an initiative called the Jal Kalyan Karayal Rupasar in Pohra village near Jaisalmer to replenish ground water. The initiative involved construction of water-harvesting structure called Anicut which will enable conservation of around 1 lakh cubic meter of water and will benefit nearly 300 families by improving access to water.   Suzlon Foundation has undertaken various initiatives focused on water conservation with the objective of improving water access, providing clean drinking water and to reduce the water borne diseases in the neighbourhood villages across all its areas of operations.  To nurture public private partnerships in rural infrastructure, Pohra villagers provided man hours while Suzlon and Government of Rajasthan executed and completed the activity. The initiative of constructing an anicut has endured fruit, the villagers now witness the nearby well getting recharged even with scanty rains. Dr. Jasmine Sofia Gogia, General Manager, Suzlon Foundation said, Suzlon Foundation works towards upliftment of remote villages in terms of making them self-reliant. Water sustainability is extremely vital and improving water efficiency results in higher productivity in farming, better livelihood and thus enhancing the ecological balance of the community. In Rajasthan, our water management programmes aims to enhance water and land resources in neighbourhood communities. We are pleased to collaborate with the state government for this initiative and look forward to their continued support.  Suzlons footprint in Rajasthan, however, extends much beyond its installations and manufacturing set-up. Suzlons Corporate Social Responsibility programme works for the sustainable development of the society. Suzlon Foundations CSR outreach in Rajasthan for water conservation has had the following positive impact: Total 57 villages covered with 4000 families through 60 Rooftop water harvesting structures, 40 Naadies, 15 Khelies, 2 Beris and 125 Tankas. About Suzlon Group: The Suzlon Group is one of the leading renewable energy solutions providers in the world with an international presence across 19 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa and North and South America.
