Built initially for Indian Petrochemical Corporation Ltd., now Reliance Industries Ltd., the site has a total of 14 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) commissioned and erected for IPCL and other SMEs. 10 of the WTGs have completed 20 years, with the remaining 4 scheduled to do so in December, this year. The 10 units consist of 2 units of 270kW and 8 units of 350kW. The site has successfully powered 70,000 households in Gujarat since March, 1996.Mr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman, Suzlon Group, says, The milestone of our first wind site completing 20 years is a significant achievement for the organisation. Since the start of our journey in 1996, our emphasis has been to build strong and robust products that outperform the design life which are norms for the industry. Reliability has been the cornerstone of our value proposition to our customers and this milestone is a testimony. We take this opportunity to thank all our customers for reposing their faith in our wind power solutions. We would like to specifically acknowledge and express our gratitude to the customers who trusted us with their investments way back in 1996 and were instrumental in our maiden foray in wind energy. I am personally delighted about this achievement and the project as it set the course for our future direction and was a precursor to our 20 year old journey during which we have installed over 9,500 MW in the country.Present in Gujarat since its inception, Suzlon has played a pivotal part in the growth of wind energy in the state.
