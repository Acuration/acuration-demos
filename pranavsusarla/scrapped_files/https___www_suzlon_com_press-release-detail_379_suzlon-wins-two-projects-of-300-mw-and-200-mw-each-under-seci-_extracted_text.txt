Two Projects of 300 MW and 200 MW each won under SECI bid
Projects to be completed at Kutch district in Gujarat as per SECI guidelines 
The projects will provide electricity to ~3 million households and curb ~10 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year

Pune, India: Suzlon Group, Indias largest renewable energy solutions provider, today announced that it has won two projects of 300 MW and 200 MW each for development of wind power projects. Suzlon will install 238 units of S111 140m wind turbine generators (WTGs) with rated capacity of 2.1 MW each. The project will be located at Kutch district in Gujarat. 
Suzlon will execute both the projects on a turnkey basis and will also provide comprehensive operation and maintenance services. 
Speaking on the order win, J.P. Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon Group said, The two projects totalling 500 MW order is a testament to the customers confidence in our technologically advanced and innovative products and services. There is an increased interest from all customer segments to invest in renewable energy in their pursuit of contributing towards mitigating risks of climate change and providing affordable and renewable power for all.  With the introduction of the bidding regime, the industry is poised to grow to 8-10 GW annually. We are committed to partner with our customers to scale it up further and enable Indias transition from conventional fuel dominated energy architecture to renewable energy sources. 
Suzlon has more than two decades of experience in the wind sector and is the custodian of more than 11 GW wind assets across India. We are best equipped to cater to the growing demand for renewable energy in India with our pan-India presence, comprehensive product portfolio, robust in-house R&D and best-in-class services.
The S111 wind turbine generator (WTG) is the latest addition to the 2.1 MW platform and features the time tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) technology. With a swept area of 9,852 sq. metre, the S111 140m is designed to optimally harness wind resources at higher altitudes making low wind sites viable. It not only delivers superior energy yield, but also offers higher return on investment for customers.
