 Suzlon strengthens leadership in the PSU segment; commissions second wind project  for HAL
The two wind energy projects will cater to about 46.6% of HAL's energy consumption
This project comprises of four revolutionary Suzlon S111-120m 2.1 MW wind turbine
generators (WTG)
Project will help in offsetting ~25,162 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually
Hubli/Bengaluru, India: Suzlon Energy Ltd, one of the leading global renewable 
energy solutions provider, today announced the successful commissioning of its second wind power project for
 Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL), the state-owned aerospace and defence company. The 8.4MW captive wind 
 energy project located at Kushtagi, Bagalkot district in the State of Karnataka was  inaugurated by Shri R
 Madhavan, CMD, HAL. With the completion of this project, HAL's total wind energy capacity delivered by Suzlon
 stands at ~14 MW and caters to 46.6% of HAL's energy consumption of its Bengaluru based divisions. HAL's 
 first wind project of 6.3MW is located in Davangere, Karnataka and was commissioned in July 2016.
 Suzlon also provides comprehensive operation and maintenance services for both the projects for an initial 
 period of 10 years. 
Mr. R Madhavan, Chairman and Managing Director, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, said, 
"We are glad that through this green initiative, HAL would reduce its carbon footprint by around 25,000 tons of CO2 emissions per annum. This project would cater to about 25% energy consumption at Bengaluru based divisions. We are committed towards increasing the share of renewable energy in the overall energy consumption across the Company."

Mr. J. P. Chalasani, CEO, Suzlon Group said, "The increased focus of public sector companies to harness renewable energy for meeting their power needs, gives a boost to India's efforts to achieve energy security and to power a greener tomorrow. Suzlon's 'concept to commissioning' approach offers convenience to customers for setting up wind projects for captive use. This has established Suzlon as market leaders in the Indian market, including the PSU segment. We are glad to be the partner of choice for HAL for the second time after the successful commissioning of their maiden wind project in 2016. We are committed to further strengthen our collaboration with PSUs to help them transition to renewable energy sources to meet their power requirements."
A result of Suzlon's continuous investment in R&D with an aim to develop technologically advanced and innovative products, the S111 wind turbine generator is part of the 2.1 MW platform that is a game changer in the industry. It features the time tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) technology. With a swept area of 9,852 m2, the S111-120m is designed to optimally harness wind resources at higher altitudes making low wind sites viable. The 120 meter hub-height that uses the award-winning lattice tubular technology ensures enhanced performance, while the SB54 blades are designed to withstand extreme, on-site conditions. The turbines, with a safe and efficient nacelle design, are built for easy and secure operations and maintenance. Its features facilitate improved ventilation for better air cooling with an onboard crane that allows easy maintenance.
