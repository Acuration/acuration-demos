The successful commissioning ofthe Capital Wind Farm demonstrates the real and important role that wind energy hasto play in a low carbon economy.As one of Australias largest wind farms Capital will produce clean energy to power theSydney Water desalination plant and avoid the emission of approximately 390,000tonnes of greenhouse gases each year.The wind farm has provided an important boost for clean energy jobs and investmentin the local economy. Infigen invested more than half the total value of the project inAustralian products and services, such as the steel wind turbine towers. The windfarm will continue to provide clean energy jobs for the life of the project to meet theongoing service and maintenance requirements.The Capital Wind Farm also plays a role in helping shape the clean energy jobs of thefuture.
