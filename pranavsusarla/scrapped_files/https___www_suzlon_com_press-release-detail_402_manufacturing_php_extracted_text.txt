 Suzlon Global Services Limited wins 1st Prize at the prestigious IMC Ramkrishna Bajaj National Quality Award
Award recognizes performance excellence, quality & fostering competitiveness
Massive fleet of 8700+ turbines | 12+ GW | 150+ sites under management
Managing assets worth INR ~75,000 crores for customers and their lenders
Managing over 35% of entire Indian wind installed capacity
Delivers +97.4% fleet machine availability and 9% higher generation energy generation
over previous year.
Pune, India: Suzlon Global Services Limited (SGSL), a 100% subsidiary of Suzlon Energy Ltd. won the
1st Prize for Service category at the prestigious IMC Ramkrishna Bajaj National Quality Award 2018.
The stringent assessment criteria for the award is similar to that of Deming Prize & Malcolm Baldrige
Award of USA and follows a rigorous process of evaluation which included 360 degrees approach
and included several interactions with all stakeholders - Employees, Management, Customers,
Vendors, CSR community and Site Teams. The Award process is a highly structured and transparent
system involving individual assessment, consensus meetings and site visits.
SGSL operates and maintains a fleet of 8700+ wind turbines, handling over 12 GW across 150+ sites
in 8 states. With rich experience of over two decades, SGSL presently manages 35% of the Indian
wind installed capacity delivering over +97% Machine Availability for our 1800+ customers. Suzlon
has developed a best-in-class Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. More than
300 sensors in each turbine continuously transmit data 24x7 on secure network to Suzlon's
Monitoring Centre (SMC) where, round-the-clock monitoring and advanced analytics is carried out to
enable troubleshooting, identify recurring events, predict likely failure of events and prevent
unscheduled downtime. Additionally, SGSL has been developing various Value Added Products and
Services to further improve the reliability of the older fleet as well as improve the Annual Energy
Production (AEP).
There has been increased thrust on providing mobility solutions to the site teams, in order to
enhance the effectiveness of Preventive Maintenance (PM). A mobile app enables technicians to
capture all the PM checklist data, while performing tasks in order to have real time input and
feedback. It also provides comprehensive overview dashboards to monitor and analyze the progress
of Preventive Maintenance (PM) activities of the wind farm. This has greatly improved the quality
and timeliness of the PM activities. With consistent focus on the management of huge Grid Network,
SGSL has been able to improve the overall performance of the complete Wind Park Facility for the
customers.
Commenting on the award, Mr. J P Chalasani, Group CEO, said, "At Suzlon, our focus is on innovation
and robust processes to ensure continuous quality improvement to deliver on our promise of service
excellence and ensure the best return on investment (ROI) for our customers. Our OMS division has
been consistently performing well on various parameters like availability of parts, up skilling of
engineers, digitalisation of services, adherence to safety and delivering good results on the
operational front. We are the second largest player in the Operations & Maintenance business in
India, with over 12 GW assets under maintenance. We have achieved +97.4% fleet machine
availability and 9% more energy generation than previous year for our customers. This award is a
testament of our efforts and inspires us to continue to work with our stakeholders to deliver quality
products and services."
