 Suzlon announces Q2 FY20 results
Concerted efforts on-going towards a holistic debt resolution 
Pre-forex EBITDA loss of Rs. 243 crores in Q2 FY20

Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced its Q2 FY20 results. 
J P Chalasani, Group CEO, said, "The sector is witnessing issues on project execution due to some policy issues but there has been some healthy growth in installations over the last year. Wind capacities added in India in H1 FY20 was ~1,304 MW as compared to ~569 MW in H1 FY19. Our operations are at a subdued level with minimal allocation of funding as we are trying to fix our capital structure. In the recently concluded auctions, we have seen the tariffs are stabilizing and there is immense opportunity for the long-term sustainable growth of the wind sector. Our Operation and Maintenance Services (OMS) business continues to deliver strong profitability & high machine performance for the customers, surpassing industry benchmarks. India is expected to be a relatively high volume market once the transitional problems and policy uncertainty are addressed. We continue to work determinedly for a sustainable long term debt resolution plan with our consortium of lenders, to preserve the value of the Company.

Swapnil Jain, CFO, said, "Our operations are at a sub-optimal level due to liquidity challenges being faced by the Company. We remain focused on cost optimization across the board including cost of goods sold (COGS) and fixed costs. We are committed and tirelessly working along with our lenders towards a holistic debt resolution and fixing the capital structure to align with our earning capability under the new market paradigms."
