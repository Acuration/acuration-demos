Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, today announced the second order of the 3 MW product series for the development of a 69.3 MW wind power project for Juniper Green Energy Private Limited. Suzlon will install 22 wind turbine generators (WTGs) with a Hybrid Lattice Tubular (HLT) tower of their new product with a rated capacity of 3.15 MW each. The project is located at Surendra Nagar district in Gujarat and is expected to be commissioned in 2024. 
This is the first major order for the company's largest turbine rated 3.15 MW, S144-140m from the 3 MW series. As part of the agreement, Suzlon will supply the wind turbines (equipment supply) and execute the project including, erection and commissioning. Suzlon will also provide comprehensive operations and maintenance services post-commissioning.
JP Chalasani, CEO, Suzlon Group, said,"We are delighted to announce our first order with Juniper Green Energy Private Limited and our second order for the 3 MW series. Juniper Green Energy is a committed renewable energy player in India with a comprehensive solar footprint. This is their first wind energy project, and we are honoured that they have placed their trust in us for the same. The electricity from this project will serve the people of Gujarat, helping us deepen our contribution to the state.

the people of Gujarat with sustainable renewable energy solutions."
The Suzlon 3 MW Series
The largest renewable energy solutions provider in India, The Suzlon Group is proud to announce its 3 MW series
of wind turbines. With the primary objective of increasing generation, reducing the cost of energy, and contributing to an Aatmanirbhar Bharat, this series marks a significant milestone for the company and the country's wind energy sector.
Suzlon's 3 MW turbines feature a 144-meter rotor diameter and are designed to unlock low wind sites and deliver improved energy yield suitable for all Indian wind regimes. With local content of up to 85-90% by its serial launch, this series proves Suzlon's commitment to innovation and self-reliance.
The S144 wind turbine generator is one of the largest in India, extendable up to 3.15 MW, depending on site wind
conditions, available at a hub height of 140 meters going up to 160 meters by its serial launch. At 160 meters hub height the S144 will also be India's tallest wind turbine. Suzlon's S144 fleet will deliver a remarkable 40-43% higher generation over Suzlon's current model, the S120 - 2.1 MW wind turbine, showcasing its ability to optimize wind resources at higher altitudes and make low-wind sites viable.
Furthermore, the 3 MW turbine generators feature the time-tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) technology and the SB 70.5 carbon fibre blade engineered and developed by Suzlon. This world-class technology provides the capability to utilize thinner aerodynamic profiles, resulting in excellent performance in low-wind sites, and a significant increase in generation yield per unit of land.
 As a leader in the renewable energy sector, Suzlon's 3 MW series of wind turbines is a testament to the company's
dedication to delivering sustainable and cost-effective renewable energy solutions for the future. We are confident that the 3 MW - S144 technology will contribute significantly to the country's renewable energy and net-zero targets.
