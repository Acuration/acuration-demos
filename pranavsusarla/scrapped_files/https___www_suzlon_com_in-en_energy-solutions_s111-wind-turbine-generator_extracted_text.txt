The S111 Advantage

 The S111 transcends height limitations by achieving a hub-height of 140 meters (equivalent to a 40 storey building) by using the award-winning lattice tubular technology. It makes generation possible even at low wind sites such as IEC Class III ones.


    The S111 is built on technology that makes optimum use of available wind resources and s available in variants of 50 Hz and 60 Hz, making it compatible for a variety of climatic conditions. It also offers a combination of an asynchronous induction generator with a six pole design and DFIG (doubly fed induction generator) to enable optimum operations in variable wind speeds. The turbine is built for easy and secure operation and maintenance thereby ensuring higher machine availability. The turbines have a safe and efficient nacelle design; and features that facilitate improved ventilation for better air cooling within the nacelle. An onboard crane makes for easy maintenance, thus achieving higher reliability and machine availability for longer periods.


  The S111 has the capabilities to accommodate fluctuating utility demands and satisfy differing needs for energy. The S111 suite of WTGs has successfully delivered a PLF of 43%. Since its launch, more than 884 S111 WTGs are in operation with a cumulative installed base of 1,856  MW.


   All these features, supported by Suzlon's SURE suite of total lifecycle care services, ensure that your investment in the S111 turbines yields maximum returns.
