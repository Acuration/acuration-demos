As a pioneer of the Indian wind energy sector, Suzlon forayed into the solar energy sector in 2016. Suzlon has leveraged its reliable relationships, knowledge and advanced experience to establish a strong team for design, engineering and project development, in order to bring a complete turnkey solar energy solution and EPC (equipment, procurement and construction) services to its customers. Suzlon offers a whole range of services beginning from land acquisition to power distribution. With its experience in developing utility-scale wind parks, Suzlon is leveraging its vast expertise in power generation, land procurement, liaison and working with various state utilities in India, to develop similar projects in the field of solar energy. Just as it does in wind energy, Suzlon provides end-to-end solutions in solar power projects and supports clients in the acquisition of a solar power plant and guides them through the challenges in setting up a profitable unit.


A one-stop solar energy solution provider, Suzlon offers the following solutions:


Land acquisition and approvals
Solar irradiance assessment
Infrastructure and power evacuation
Supply chain – procurement of modules, inverters and balance-of-systems

Centralised communication network – in-house SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition system)
Lifecycle asset management – operations and maintenance



The Suzlon Solar Advantage

Solar power projects in India are promoted through a tendering process followed by a reverse auction. This can be complex and confusing for customers; Suzlon’s experience in tendering can make the process smooth and effective.
