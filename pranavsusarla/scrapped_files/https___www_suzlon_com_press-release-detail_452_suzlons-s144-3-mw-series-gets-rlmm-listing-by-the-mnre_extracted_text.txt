 Suzlon's S144 - 3 MW series gets RLMM Listing by the  MNRE


Suzlon's S144, 3 MW - 3.15 MW wind turbine series gets the RLMM (Revised List of Models & Manufacturers) Listing from MNRE (Ministry of New and Renewable Energy).
This is an important milestone required for successful commercialization of the product.
Continues Suzlon's focus to make more wind sites in India economically viable to unlock the country's true wind energy potential.


Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, today announced the RLMM listing of its S144 - 3 MW series of wind turbines which are extendable to 3.15 MW making them a formidable force in the market. This listing marks an important milestone for successful commercialization of the product.
Suzlon has already installed the first prototype of this series at a hub height of 160m with a Hybrid Lattice Tubular (HLT) tower at the Gondal site in Gujarat. Currently the product is in the process of serial manufacturing and commercialization.
JP Chalasani, Chief Executive Officer, Suzlon Group, said, "This listing comes at the right time after
our S144 product received enthusiastic response from the market, evident from the strong order inflow.
Transformation toward more energy-efficient products is driving the Indian wind energy market. It is
imperative for us to offer technologically advanced products that are best suited for sites in India,
ensuring a higher return on investment (ROI) for our customers. Considering India's varied wind
regimes and terrains, the S144 turbine is designed to make it customizable for the site-specific
requirements for higher PLFs (Plant Load Factor). The S144  3 MW series is a true testament to 'Make
in India' and 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' with 90% domestic content. We believe that this product will go a
long way in driving India's renewable energy targets towards a more sustainable country."
"Our comprehensive product portfolio, led by dual star products; the proven and successful S120 - 2.1
MW and the new S144 - 3-3.15 MW product series of larger wind turbines offer solutions for all Indian
wind regimes and sites with an aim to increase generation and reduce LCoE (levelized cost of energy)."
