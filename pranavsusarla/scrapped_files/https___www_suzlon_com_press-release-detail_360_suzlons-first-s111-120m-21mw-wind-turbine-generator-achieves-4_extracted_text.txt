 Suzlons first S111 120m 2.1MW Wind Turbine Generator achieves ~42% Plant Load Factor
Pune, India: Suzlon Group, one of the leading global renewable energy solutions provider in the
world, announced that its revolutionary S111 120m 2.1 MW wind turbine generator has achieved ~42% Plant Load Factor (PLF) in its first 12 months of operation at the Jamanwada site in Kutch
district of Gujarat. The prototype was commissioned in March 2016.   The 42 percent PLF demonstrated by S111 120m is 20 percent higher than 35 percent PLF achieved
by S97 120m in its first 12 months performance at the same location.  The S111 wind turbine generator is the latest addition to the 2.1 MW platform and features the time
tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) technology. With a swept area of 9,852 m2
the S111
120m is designed to optimally harness wind resources at higher altitudes making low wind sites
viable. It not only delivers superior energy yield, but also offers higher return on investment for
customers.  The new fleet of Suzlon has garnered encouraging market response from customer segments across
the board. J.P. Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon Group said The S111 120m 2.1MW wind turbine is a game
changer in the industry. It has been our continuous effort to reduce the levelised cost of energy (LCoE)
and we continue to invest in R&D with an aim to develop technologically advanced and innovative
products. It is a proud moment for us to witness the prototype of S111 120m 2.1 MW turbine deliver
~42% PLF. It has successfully generated yield of 7.66 million Kwh over the last 12 months. With its
reduced levelised cost of energy (LCoE), cost effective design and superior performance S111 120m
will unlock unviable sites and set new benchmarks in the Indian wind industry  Duncan Koerbel, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Suzlon Energy, said We are very pleased with the
performance of our new wind turbine model S111 120m. By delivering ~42% PLF, the turbine
performance has validated our design goals. Our focus is on developing efficient turbines to make
previously unviable sites viable. The world needs more and more renewable energy systems and
Suzlons technology will continue to play a crucial role in powering a greener tomorrow.  About Suzlon Group: The Suzlon Group is one of the leading renewable energy solutions providers in the world with an
