 Suzlon wins 100 MW World Bank funded project in China
Pune: Suzlon Energy Limited, the world's fifth largest wind turbine maker with 10.5%of global market share*, announced the entering of an agreement between thecompanys China-operations subsidiary Suzlon Energy (Tianjin) Limited (SETL) andInner Mongolia North Longyuan Wind Power Corporation, for 100 MW of wind turbinecapacity.The order calls for the delivery of a total of 80 units of Suzlons S64  1.25 MWturbine, in two lots of 50 MW-each in FY2010 and FY2011 to the project site located120 km north-east of Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,China. The project site is characterized by temperatures as low as -30 degreescentigrade during the winter and moderate temperatures during the summer, with anannual average temperature of -2 degrees centigrade. Suzlon has strong capabilities indesigning wind turbines to operate in harsh and variable climates, and has built upconsiderable experience in successfully installing and operating wind projects in someof the most extreme environments. The site for the new project is in close proximity toSuzlon's existing Datang International Zhuozi site, which is in operation since 2007with a total of 32 units of S64  1.25 MW turbines.Speaking on the project, Mr. Paulo Soares, CEO  SETL, said: We are verypleased to win this order. North Longyuan is a joint venture between North UnionPower and Longyuan, the leading wind project developer in China. North Union Poweris itself a joint venture among some of the largest power developers in China, withHuaneng as its leading shareholder with 51%. This is a group of very well establishedplayers in the Chinese wind industry. The project is also unique from theperspective of drawing financing from the World Bank, which maintains thehighest standards in project selection. This project is one of the keycommitments in the wind power business in China made by the World Bank,and we are glad to be part of it.China has set aggressive targets for renewable energy, targeting significant increase inthe share of non-hydro renewables, which should reach 1% of total power generationby 2010, and 3% by 2020 for regions served by centralized power grids, figures which,if achieved will lead to installed capacity of about 20GW by 2010 and 100GW by 2020.The country had installed over 12,000 MW by end-2008, a growth in installations of87% over the previous yearMr. Sumant Shina, COO  Suzlon Energy Limited, said: This World Bankfundedorder clearly underlines Suzlons value proposition in terms of itstechnology, product and people. China is one of the worlds fastest growing windenergy markets, and we have a long-standing presence in the country with dedicatedmanufacturing facilities in Tianjin focused on the local market. We expect the Chinesewind market to continue its rapid growth, and Suzlon is well positioned to be a big partof this opportunity.
