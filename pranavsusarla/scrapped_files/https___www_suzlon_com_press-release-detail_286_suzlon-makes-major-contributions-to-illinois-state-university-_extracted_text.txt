 Suzlon makes major contributions to Illinois State University RE program
                         Gives $50,000 to Center for Renewable EnergyPune/Chicago - Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation, a step-down subsidiary of SuzlonEnergy Limited of India, the worlds fifth largest wind turbine maker, announced acontribution of USD 50,000 to the Illinois State Universitys Center for RenewableEnergy, which is also connected to its new Renewable Energy bachelors program.Suzlons support as a Founding Member is part of its corporate vision to build asustainable, educated and skilled workforce, which will contribute to the need forpeople knowledgeable specifically in the field of renewable energy and can power theindustrys meteoric growth into the next decade.In Illinois and across the Midwest, Suzlon believes strongly that a four-year programlike the one Illinois State University has established is essential to developing theworkforce that we must have now and well into the next decade, said Andris Cukurs,CEO of Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation. Investing in students today is like investingin better technology, smarter development and stronger wind companies for thefuture, he added.The newly formed Renewable Energy Major is a four-year program that already boasts40 students enrolled for the Fall semester, and features students tapped asPresidential Scholars, the highest award given by the University.Suzlon joins a respected team that forms an advisory board to the Center forRenewable Energy providing expert input for future industry research anddevelopment of wind energy and other renewables. The company is also involved inthe development of the Centers internship program and supports the campus seminarprogram of featured industry speakers.Since the growth trend for U.S. wind power is undeniably explosive, it requires thatSuzlon work even harder to keep pace with the demand for new and well-educatedemployees. Whether it is through internships or hiring recent Illinois State Universitygraduates, Suzlon needs to invest in its own backyard to retain quality educatedstudents here, while also offering job growth opportunities across the country, addedCukurs.We are excited to have Suzlon as a Founding Member of the Center, said David G.Loomis, Director of the Center for Renewable Energy. This gift and partnership showsSuzlons commitment to building a well-educated workforce for tomorrows windindustry.Suzlon is aware of strong initiatives taken up by several four-year university programs,and is taking the extra step to recognize Illinois State as one of the first in the Midwestto design not only a comprehensive program, but also partner it with a high-qualityrenewable energy research center that can be used as a collaborative hub with otheruniversities and wind energy companies.
