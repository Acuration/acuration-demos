Telangana, India: Suzlon Energy, one of the leading renewable energy solutions provider announced that the worlds first solar project quality certificate for photovoltaic (PV) power plants has been awarded to the Veltoor Solar Power Project in Telangana, owned by SE Solar Ltd. Suzlons SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) with CLP India. The certificate was conferred by DNV GL, the global quality assurance and risk management company. The certification was carried out according to the service specification 'DNVGL-SE-0078' Project certification of photovoltaic power plants. It is the world's first, and currently only, global guideline for certifying solar PV projects. 
The certification by DNV GL awarded to the Veltoor Solar Power Project conforms to all relevant safety features required of a solar park, and demonstrates technical compliance of the project with the globally recognized standards. The certification process encompassed an overall evaluation of the asset with an in-depth review of the design basis, design, grid code compliance, manufacturing process, transport and installation, commissioning and optionally in-service phases. 

"The comprehensive requirements of DNV GLs certification provided a clear roadmap for us to ensure the highest quality as we designed and built Veltoor, said Rajiv Mishra, Managing Director of CLP India. Operational excellence is part of our DNA and CLP maintains the highest-quality standards across all facets of our work. As the only certification body that provided complete guidelines for PV projects, DNV GL has worked hand-in-hand with us to help the Veltoor project meet our quality objectives." 

J P Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon said, "The Indian renewable energy industry is poised for exponential growth and we are rightfully placed to capture the same. The certification from DNV GL is testament to our commitment to high quality projects and we are glad to have clear guidelines from DNV GL for the same.  It gives us the confidence that we are on the right path as we expand our renewable energy footprint to deliver value to our stakeholders. Suzlon has now demonstrated turnkey capabilities in both wind and solar, giving us a strong competitive edge in India. With such capabilities we aim to harness the emerging opportunities in Wind-Solar Hybrid, which is gaining traction in India with around 5 GW of bid pipeline already sanctioned."
