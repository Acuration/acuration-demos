 Suzlon announces Q2 FY21 Results
Revenue of Rs 725 crores in Q2 FY21
 EBITDA of Rs 112 crores in Q2 FY21 and EBITDA margin of 15.4% in Q2 FY21
Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced its
second quarter results for the financial year 2020-21 (Q2 FY21).
Ashwani Kumar, CEO, Suzlon Group said, "Q2 of FY 21 was the first quarter post closure of our debt
restructuring process. This quarter marked the restart of our operations and entry back into the
market amidst the constraints of COVID 19. I am encouraged by the financial performance of our
operations and service business in these challenging times. Overall despite the ongoing challenges, I
remain confident of growing momentum in the coming months.
The Government's focus on 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and the overall encouraging environment will
pave the way for boosting the sector and attracting diverse investors. We are particularly
enthusiastic about forthcoming bids being conducted by SECI for RTC (round the clock) renewable
energy power and wind-solar-storage hybrid power procurement. We see this as the next phase of
growth in the Renewable Energy market in India."
Swapnil Jain, CFO, Suzlon Group said, "In the Q2 results we again see a clear improvement in
EBIDTA over last year. Our focus on controlling operating and fixed cost as well as reduction in
finance costs is reflected in our P&L performance. Pursuant to our debt restructuring which was
implemented in June 2020, part of our debt was converted to Optionally Convertible Debenture
(OCD) and Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) which are recorded at fair valuation in
liabilities of the company and the balance has been credited to other equity.
Our manufacturing operations have resumed with six facilities starting production in line with all
precautions of the COVID 19 protocol and the pace is picking up. This quarter we also restarted
supply of our turbines. Our service business continues to do well and all our wind farms have been
functioning without interruption. SE Forge, our forging and foundry business is also securing good
orders. The impact of our operational progress will be felt in the coming quarters."
