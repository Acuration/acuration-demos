These orders include Suzlons latest product offerings the S111 90m tubular tower and S97 120m hybrid tower and also the time-tested S97 90m and S95 90m tubular tower models all with a rated capacity of 2.1 MW each.  Suzlon will provide the entire spectrum of turnkey solutions right from equipment supply till commissioning and also offer dedicated life cycle asset management services for a contractually defined period to these customers. The projects are spread across the key windy states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and are scheduled to be completed by March 2017. J.P.Chalasani, Group CEO, Suzlon Group said, We are happy to be associated with our existing customers time and again and further strengthening our partnership with them. It is encouraging as these orders continue to add a fillip to our robust order book and this is good investment by SME to support Make in India initiative. We are committed towards adding value to the energy security of our country and we continue to leverage our technological expertise which enables a product suite suitable to varying wind regimes and develop high yield products that effectively bring down the cost of energy. The innovative S9X and S11X series product portfolio is designed to optimally harness the available wind resources and deliver higher energy and return on investment (ROI) to customers. These product series feature the time tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) technology which is designed to maximise energy yield and unlock the potential of low wind sites. The S97 120m is one of the tallest all-steel hybrid tower (120 meter height) in the world and combines both lattice and tubular structures. The S97 120m prototype, set up in November 2014, at Kutch, Gujarat, achieved a plant load factor (PLF) of 35% over the first 12 months of operation. The S111 90m features a rotor diameter of 111.8 meters with a swept area of more than 9500 square meters, making it one of the highest yielding wind turbines in its class. The S111 90m proto type was successfully commissioned in Tamil Nadu. The 2.1 MW rated capacity product platform is the most proven fleet with ~8 GW commissioned, having crossed a cumulative of 100 million operating hours.
