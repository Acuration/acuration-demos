Honeywell Revolutionizes Fall Protection With Miller H500 Series, Keeping Workers Safe and Jobsites Compliant
Honeywell Revolutionizes Fall Protection With Miller H500 Series, Keeping Workers Safe and Jobsites Compliant
October 26, 2020
CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 26, 2020 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced the Miller® H500 series that combines ergonomics and comfort with intuitive safety features to provide workers with more confidence when working at heights in construction, utilities, steel, manufacturing, military and other industry operations.
Workers know the importance of their fall harnesses when working from heights. They spend long hours wearing this equipment and if it isn’t comfortable it can lead to muscular fatigue due to restricted freedom of movement, overexertion, repetitive tasks, or load exposure. These issues can contribute to critical errors, leading workers to incorrectly wear or adjust their harness, which may increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and fall.
“Honeywell has a long history of providing safety equipment to keep workers safe and supported,” said Celine Verdot, global product and marketing leader, fall protection for Honeywell’s personal protective equipment business. “We’ve integrated ergonomics, safety, comfort and style with cost-effectiveness to provide a more breathable, lightweight harness.”
The Honeywell Miller® H500 series offers greater freedom of movement with specially formulated webbing that flexes to accommodate movement and body contours for a more comfortable fit. It boasts a new, more modern design with four core models to choose from. The patented shoulder and back padding designs minimize overexertion and offer more breathability to keep workers drier and cooler.  The new ergonomic waist pad offers optimum lumbar support. The harness series is easy to fit and comes with a smart anti-tangle for hassle-free donning experience, a dedicated SRL web link for an easy attachment of personal SRLs, user friendly resettable lanyard keepers, clearly identifiable fall impact indicators for hassle-free inspection, and improved visible stitch pattern for easy inspection.
This modern harness design provides higher visibility, smarter features and safer, more comfortable functionality. To learn more about the Honeywell Miller® H500 harness, watch this video.
