Meet a #futureshaper: Mohan Singh Tomar
Meet a #futureshaper: Mohan Singh Tomar
Mohan Singh Tomar collects ideas and helps turn them into new innovations.
The software engineer builds programs that predict maintenance for airlines and uses blockchain to track airplane parts.
Based in Bengaluru, India; here is his #futureshaper story.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
The variety of things I work on each day and each week and the limitless learning and freedom to explore new ideas. It is even more dynamic in my current role as an innovation leader, where I get to debate and nurture new ideas daily.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
We are witnessing an unprecedented transformation in each industry due to rapid adoption of connected and artificial intelligence. Advancements in computing capabilities will leapfrog with quantum computers. I believe industry boundaries will start to blur.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
A #futureshaper is curious (knows the customer, market and technology), creative (applies technology to develop world class products and solve problems), contrarian (has perspectives which other don’t), tenacious (does not give up easily, but is not stubborn) and agile (adopts to change and learns quickly).
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Enjoy your time at work, interact with people, learn from them and help others understand the big picture. Do not get bogged down in technology alone. Be the best in whatever you do.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I take long evening walks with my wife to catch up and spend time with my boys and our dog.  I also love to spend time reading about startups and Indian politics. I also work on carpentry or gardening project at our new house.
