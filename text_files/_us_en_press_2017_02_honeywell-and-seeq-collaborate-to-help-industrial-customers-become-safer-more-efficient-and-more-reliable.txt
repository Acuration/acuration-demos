Honeywell And Seeq Collaborate To Help Industrial Customers Become Safer, More Efficient And More Reliable
February 14, 2017
HOUSTON, Feb. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) and Seeq, today announced they will collaborate as part of the Honeywell Connected Plant initiative to help process manufacturers leverage data and insights in their operations. This joint development agreement will help customers minimize unplanned shutdowns, maximize output, minimize safety risk and optimize supply chain strategies.
"Honeywell's deep domain knowledge and capabilities in process optimization, data consolidation, storage and asset monitoring combined with Seeq's technology help us to identify and solve previously unsolvable problems," said Shree Dandekar, senior vice president and general manager, Honeywell Connected Plant. "Our goal is to create an effective solution that securely captures, aggregates and analyzes data, and then leverages a vast ecosystem to provide a higher level outcome for our customers. This ecosystem includes leading equipment vendors, process licensors, OEMs and other industry experts."
"We see this collaboration between Honeywell and Seeq as beneficial to continuously improving how we serve our customers with the latest advanced software and analytics," said Steve Sliwa, CEO and co-founder, Seeq Corporation. "Honeywell provides key infrastructure to collect and securely store data, while we embed decades of domain knowledge into advanced analytics for more business value, faster. This collaboration will help us provide our customers with new insight through transformative capabilities that lead to more rapid decision-making and process optimization."
Seeq is the latest company to join Honeywell's Connected Plant program, which uses the power of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to help improve the safety, efficiency and reliability of operations across a single plant or several plants across an enterprise. Honeywell has recently announced agreements with Flowserve, Aereon and several other industrial leaders. For customers who use Honeywell UOP process technology, the company offers Connected Performance Services, which leverages UOP's process and service expertise into the Connected Plant cloud platform.
Multiple industry analysts have recognized Seeq as a leading innovator in the advanced analytics market. The company's approach to empowering front-line engineers &endash; the employees with the expertise and experience &endash; to find insights in production data sets it apart from data-scientist focus of many modern analytics offerings.
"This collaboration between Seeq and Honeywell should make it easier for both firms to help their mutual customers gain new and valuable insights from their data," said Janice Abel, Principal Consultant, ARC Advisory Group. "By providing actionable information, these insights could enable industrial organizations to make better decisions, faster; enabling them to optimize their business and production processes."
Founded in 2013, Seeq is a privately held company that publishes Seeq, an application for engineers and operations analysts to rapidly find insights in process manufacturing data. Seeq is currently being used in the Oil & Gas, pharmaceutical, specialty chemical, utility, renewal energy and many other vertical industries to improve production outcomes.
