Meet A #Futureshaper: Mohit Singhai
Meet A #Futureshaper: Mohit Singhai
What's it like bringing a new technology to life? Get to know one of the leaders at the helm of aerospace product manufacturing enabling a more efficient future.
Air taxis that run on electricity are going to be critical for a more efficient future of flight. Known as urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft, these innovations are going to change the way you commute around your city.
As an aerospace procurement leader, Mohit Singhai helps build and bring products to market that are helping to power next-generation aircraft.
Get to know Mohit and a bit of his #Futureshaper story.
What do you do?
I help our factories build aerospace products and ship them to customers. Just one example of those technologies is essentially an air conditioning system for the electric aircraft industry. It uses a lower global warming-potential refrigerant which helps us lower the greenhouse emissions of the aircraft.
What is your personal connection to sustainability?
My family has taken steps in our personal lives to be more sustainable. We feel that even swaps including using metal straws instead of plastic straws can make a difference. As a family, we firmly believe that one small step at a time can lead to a much more sustainable Earth for future generations.
What does being a #Futureshaper mean to you?
Dream big, work smart and never give up. I live by that daily, and I teach that to my kids.
Meet other Futureshapers who are innovating to make our world smarter, safer and more sustainable.
