Honeywell Establishes Global Solutions Command and Control Center in India
20 September 2022
The center provides 24/7 remote monitoring and technical support to help Honeywell’s oil and gas customers around the globe operate efficiently
Gurugram, September 20, 2022 -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) today announced the launch of its Global Solutions Command and Control Center (GSCCC) in Gurugram, which offers 24/7 proactive remote monitoring and technical support for the company’s oil and gas sector customers worldwide. It is Honeywell’s first such center globally and the only one of its kind in the industry, servicing more than 200 refinery units for 50+ customers using core Honeywell technologies with capacity to add 1,000+ units by 2028.
Honeywell’s Process Monitors are digitally connected to the customers’ operating units and send continuous data through cloud. The center uses Honeywell’s proprietary kinetic models, simulations, and cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) models to track key performance indicators (KPI) and generate actionable insights. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers customers exception-based alerts to take corrective measures on a real-time basis, thereby driving better operation optimization decisions for process improvements, increasing productivity, and supporting sustainable outcomes.
Notably, the center enables Honeywell to help customers benchmark the performances of their operating units on a global scale.
A state-of-art video wall canvas effectively monitors Honeywell’s connected deployments across the globe with the world's first Thunderbolt™ 4 professional display. This system enables Honeywell’s experts to smartly view and evaluate the performance of every connected unit, identify gaps, generate customizable alerts, and recommend corrective measures.
“As a global leader in process technology, process control, cybersecurity, and managed performance, Honeywell helps customers on their digitalization journeys. We are pleased to establish Honeywell’s Global Solutions Command and Control Center in India, which leverages the country’s ease of doing business environment and capitalizes on the strength of our engineering talent,” said Rajesh Rege, president, Honeywell India.
“The center demonstrates Honeywell’s long-standing commitment to India and its importance as a strategic hub for the right balance between technology, technical skills, specialization and costs,” continued Rajesh Rege.
Speaking at the launch, Ashish Gaikwad, vice president and general manager, Honeywell UOP India and Honeywell Process Solutions India, said, “At Honeywell, it is our constant endeavor to create value for our customers and help them meet their business objectives. Honeywell’s Global Solutions Command and Control Center is a new state-of-the-art center that uses the best remote monitoring infrastructure and uses advanced AI/ML capabilities to provide customers with valuable advice to optimize assets and enhance operations.”
The center enables Honeywell to continue developing its data sciences and analytical capabilities and be the frontline hub for global customer technical troubleshooting. It offers two tiers of monitoring:  Key Variable Monitoring which will continuously assess a core set of fundamental operating variables to detect problems early on and provide timely, remedial advice, and Proactive Monitoring, which will expand to both core variables and advanced KPIs to detect critical deviations or mounting issues.
