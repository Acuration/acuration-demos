Vehicle Mounted Computer Improves Productivity
Vehicle Mounted Computer Improves Productivity
October 31, 2018
FORT MILL, S.C., Oct. 31, 2018 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced a new vehicle-mounted computer, built for the company's Mobility Edge Platform, to help forklift operators locate and move products quickly and efficiently throughout distribution centers.
The rugged Thor VM1A vehicle-mounted computer – a refresh of the company's VM1 and CV41 computers – runs on the AndroidTM operating system and features the same smart dock and field-replaceable front touchscreen and keyboard the previous models. This makes servicing or swapping the devices a simple and easy task to minimize downtime.
The mobile computer runs on Honeywell's Mobility Edge Platform, a unified hardware and software architecture built for Android mobile devices. Devices built on Mobility Edge support multiple versions of Android to provide long-term investment protection by making operating system updates and security fixes a simple and quick process.
“Distribution centers today cannot afford any downtime in their operations. Their forklift operators rely on rugged mobile devices to improve productivity and accuracy without having to move from the driver's seat,” said Michael Noyes, general manager of Mobility for Honeywell's Productivity Products business. “We've designed the new Thor VM1A to handle the challenges of the modern warehouse. If a forklift is down for maintenance, the device can be easily swapped out and placed on another vehicle so that the operator can be up and running in no time.”
The rugged Thor VM1A is easy to maintain with a field-replaceable front panel and Honeywell's exclusive SmartDock system to allow for quick exchanges between vehicles without having to touch cabling. This minimizes downtime and reduces the number of spare parts needed to be kept in inventory. In the event of an issue, customers can reduce maintenance costs as technicians can easily repair a damaged touchscreen and keyboard, rather than sending in the entire computer for service.
The mobile computer is compatible with Honeywell ThorTM accessories, including docks, cables and vehicle mounts, to allow existing customers to deploy the devices without having to make additional hardware investments.
