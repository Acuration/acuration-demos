Honeywell Launches Battery Energy Storage System Platform to Help Users Forecast and Optimize Energy Costs
Honeywell Launches Battery Energy Storage System Platform to Help Users Forecast and Optimize Energy Costs
Battery storage will play a crucial role in grid stability as organizations transition to clean power generation
Scalable platform can improve resiliency, reduce supply costs and support corporate sustainability goals
June 21, 2021
HOUSTON, June 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) announced today its Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Platform, which integrates Honeywell asset monitoring, distributed energy resource management, supervisory control and analytics functionality to enable organizations to accurately forecast and optimize their overall energy use.
Honeywell's BESS Platform leverages best practices for energy management such as energy arbitrage and demand management to deliver flexibility and control of when energy is purchased and used. The platform is ideal for a wide range of commercial and industrial companies, independent power producers and utilities. The BESS Platform is backed by Honeywell performance-based guarantees, which include predictable and consistent costs along with improved uptime.
"Honeywell has delivered large, turnkey automation and control projects around the world," said Eren Ergin, general manager, Renewables and Distributed Assets, Honeywell Process Solutions. "We're delivering Renewables and Distributed Assets projects such as our Battery Energy Storage System Platform with a similar turnkey approach. From the physical storage assets to the automation software being utilized, customers can benefit from Honeywell performance-based guarantees."
Honeywell's BESS Platform improves grid stability and sustainability while decreasing supply costs. If a generator fails or goes offline for any reason, the platform reduces the need to bring additional, non-renewable power generators online. In this scenario, a remote facility can maintain operations as the platform runs in parallel with traditional generators. The system can then restart the disconnected generator or initiate back-up generator sets before returning to standby mode.
In addition, the BESS Platform can reduce the need for non-renewable power sources such as gas turbines and diesel generators and their associated high gas consumption rates, contributing to a smaller carbon footprint.
Honeywell will support customers with a variety of solutions, including small pilot projects and programs covering multiple sites.
