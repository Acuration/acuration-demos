Honeywell To Provide Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant To Cardinal Midstream III, LLC
Honeywell To Provide Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant To Cardinal Midstream III, LLC
March 13, 2018
DES PLAINES, Ill., March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Cardinal Midstream III, LLC will use UOP Russell modular cryogenic equipment to process 200 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas at its Iron Horse Gas Processing Complex in Grady County, Oklahoma.
Honeywell customized the gas processing plant for the needs of the location, including a modular design that reduces project schedules and delivers a custom, gas-specific plant with proven uptime and reliability.
"Cardinal chose to go with Honeywell due to our proven approach to gas processing solutions that increase yields of high-value natural gas liquids (NGLs)," said Craig Ranta, UOP Russell business director at Honeywell. "We're delivering a customized plant to match the rich feed gas composition in the basin, while the high NGL recovery helps Cardinal be more competitive in capturing contracts from producers."
Cryogenic gas processing plants cool natural gas until the heavier and more valuable NGLs form into liquids. These liquids – including propane, ethane and butanes – can be used as fuels, fuel-blending components and other valuable petrochemicals.
The plant is designed to accommodate the NGL-rich gas located in Oklahoma. Its low capital and operating expense, coupled with high NGL recovery, allow Cardinal to offer gas producers competitive processing terms.
"We decided to work with Honeywell for our Iron Horse project because of the company's proven track record," said Cardinal Midstream Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer T. D. Baskin. "We know we can depend on Honeywell to help us predictably process and transport our customers' gas and NGL products to market."
Honeywell's pre-engineered modular equipment can readily be tailored to customer specifications and shipped to remote locations. Modules fit together easily and efficiently, significantly reducing construction time and expense, and enhancing reliability after start-up. This enables customers to more quickly begin processing gas and earning revenue.
Founded in 2008, Cardinal Midstream is focused on natural gas and crude oil gathering, natural gas processing, centralized compression facilities, condensate stabilization, vapor recovery and natural gas treating. Cardinal is supported by capital commitments from EnCap Flatrock Midstream. Cardinal is based in Dallas and has offices in Mustang, Okla.; Kingwood, Texas; and Galeton, Pa.
