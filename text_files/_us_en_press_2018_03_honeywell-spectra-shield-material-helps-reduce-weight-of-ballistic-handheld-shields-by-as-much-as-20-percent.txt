Honeywell Spectra Shield® Material Helps Reduce Weight Of Ballistic Handheld Shields By As Much As 20 Percent
Honeywell Spectra Shield® Material Helps Reduce Weight Of Ballistic Handheld Shields By As Much As 20 Percent
March 13, 2018
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that Safariland Group is using Honeywell Spectra Shield® in a breakthrough new design that changes the way ballistic glass is installed in ballistic handheld shields. The resulting shields can be up to 20 percent lighter. Safariland is introducing the new design in its new X Series line of lightweight ballistic shields, sold under its PROTECH Tactical brand.
Handheld shields have a lens cap, also known as a viewing window, made from ballistic glass. It is typically installed into a frame that is then bolted into the shield. Using Spectra Shield, Safariland is able to integrate the lens cap directly into the rest of the shield. This streamlined design eliminates points of weakness that arise from the traditional bulky frame system such as drill holes and seam lines. The result is better ballistic integrity with as much as 20 percent less weight. Traditional ballistic handheld shields can weigh more than 20 pounds.
"When we challenged ourselves to design a lighter ballistic shield for our law enforcement customers, we knew we had to use Honeywell Spectra Shield because it was the most optimal material to help us meet our goals," said Todd Mackler, Vice President, Armor, Safariland. "Our innovative X Series Lightweight Shields remove common structural weakness points without sacrificing ballistic protection, ensuring that we continue to protect our men and women in uniform while helping to lighten their load. We are excited to offer this latest result from our extensive collaboration with the Honeywell Spectra team."
Safariland supplies protective equipment to law enforcement personnel in the U.S. and around the world. The PROTECH Tactical line of hard and soft armor products includes ballistic tactical vests, shields, armor plates, helmets and other accessories.
"Demand for Spectra Shield continues to grow as it consistently proves to be the best material for the world's most advanced armor products," said Sanjay Sharma, Vice President and General Manager, Packaging and Composites, at Honeywell. "Customers choose Spectra Shield for its unique, mission-critical benefits: best-in-class ballistic performance, while being lightweight, strong and comfortable. They know that our team is dedicated to providing application expertise and support to help them realize their designs, resulting in innovative products such as the new X Series Lightweight Shields."
Pound for pound, Spectra is 15 times stronger than steel, yet light enough to float. It has up to 60 percent greater strength than alternate aramid fiber. Spectra fiber is made from ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene using a patented gel-spinning process. It is used to create Spectra Shield, an advanced ballistic-resistant composite material. Honeywell's Shield technology is a patented Honeywell process designed to optimize the ballistic performance characteristics of Spectra, as well as for aramid fiber in Gold Shield® materials.
Spectra Shield and Gold Shield products have been widely adopted and proven for the most advanced armor applications globally, from bullet-resistant vests, breast plates and helmets to combat vehicles and military aircraft – all of which require lightweight solutions and superior performance.
Honeywell maintains an active Spectra fiber and ballistic materials research program focused on continuous improvement and development of high-performance materials. For more information about Spectra fiber, visit www.honeywell-spectra.com.
