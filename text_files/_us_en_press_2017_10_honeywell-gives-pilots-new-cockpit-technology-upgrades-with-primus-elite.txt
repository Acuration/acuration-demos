Honeywell Gives Pilots New Cockpit Technology Upgrades With Primus Elite
Honeywell Gives Pilots New Cockpit Technology Upgrades With Primus Elite
October 10, 2017
LAS VEGAS, Oct. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is expanding its Primus Elite® cockpit offerings with new Federal Aviation Administration certifications for Bombardier, Cessna, Dassault, Embraer and Fairchild-Dornier aircraft. This provides business jet operators with a simple display upgrade option that delivers advanced functionality and improved visual clarity. In addition, Honeywell has regulatory approval for its Primus Elite Advanced Features software upgrade, enabling pilots to use the Synthetic Vision System to help them be more aware of their surroundings and increase safety.
"We know business jet operators are continually looking for ways to update their fleet without having to purchase new aircraft," said Allison Haugen, director of Product Management, Honeywell Aerospace. "Honeywell is committed to helping pilots and operators transform their fleet and move into the digital age by providing more cockpit upgrade options. We are working with equipment manufacturers and aftermarket partners to provide access to the latest cockpit technologies inside operators' own aircraft."
The new Primus Elite Supplemental Type Certifications (STC) allow operators to gradually update their systems at a lower cost rather than invest in a full cockpit upgrade up front. With a one-to-one upgrade, operators can install Honeywell's DU875 liquid-crystal displays (LCD), which are more reliable and are seven pounds lighter than the DU870 cathode-ray tube displays, which are now obsolete. Once all cockpit displays have been upgraded, pilots will have access to more advanced technology such as electronic charts and maps, graphical weather, and video inputs through the Primus Elite upgrade program. Finally, Honeywell has recently certified the Primus Elite Advanced Features software upgrade via STC as well. The update, available to operators with the new LCD displays and the Primus Elite cockpit upgrade, gives pilots access to the Synthetic Vision System, a 3-D color image of runways, terrain and obstacles that gives pilots a clearer view of their flight path. This feature is especially valuable when flying into an unfamiliar airport in the dark or in bad weather.
Honeywell's Primus Elite Supplemental Type Certificates
The Primus Elite cockpit upgrade improves safety and comfort for pilots by providing more situational awareness through enhanced flight-control monitoring and with an upgraded graphical user interface that displays information in pilots' primary field of vision, helping them make inflight decisions more quickly. For operators, upgrading their cockpits to Primus Elite can make their current aircraft feel new again while reducing the cost of ownership and increasing aircraft value. New STCs for Honeywell's Primus Elite include:
Approved Model List STCs that allow operators to replace the DU870 CRT with the DU875 LCD are available for Bombardier Global Express and Learjet 40/45; Cessna Citation X, Bravo, Excel Ultra and Encore; Dassault Falcon F900/EX; Dornier 328; and Embraer Legacy 600/650 aircraft.
New STCs for the Primus Elite Advanced Features software upgrade for the Dassault Falcon F900C/EX platforms, providing pilots with access to Honeywell's Synthetic Vision System.
Primus Elite is currently certified and available for many business aviation platforms such as the Bombardier Global XRS and Global 5000, Fairchild-Dornier DO-328, and the Dassault Falcon F900C. PEAF is available for Gulfstream aircraft including the GIV, GIV-SP and GV.
