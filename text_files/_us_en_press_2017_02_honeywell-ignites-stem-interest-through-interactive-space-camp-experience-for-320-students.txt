Honeywell Ignites STEM Interest Through Interactive Space Camp Experience For 320 Students
Honeywell Ignites STEM Interest Through Interactive Space Camp Experience For 320 Students
February 16, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Feb. 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that 320 students from 45 countries and 27 U.S. states and territories will attend the Honeywell Leadership Challenge Academy this year. As part of the leadership program, Honeywell will host students for two consecutive, weeklong programs, Feb. 25 through March 10, 2017, at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center (USSRC) in Huntsville, Ala.
The Honeywell Leadership Challenge Academy aims to encourage excitement and engagement around Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) subjects for students between the ages of 16-18. The program is packed with hands-on activities such as building and testing rockets, simulated astronaut training, shuttle missions, and a moon walk. The program is designed to educate students on the importance of STEM in an ever-changing, connected world.
Ashley Fitzpatrick, a student from New Mexico who attended the Academy in 2016 and is returning this year as a student ambassador, said: "We build and launch model rockets and learn that there are so many different types of engineering fields to pursue. It's a growing field with a high demand for men and women. That really opened my eyes. What's really great is that the program combines science and engineering with friendship and fun."
The focus on STEM-based career opportunities is integral to the values of Honeywell and its employees. During the program, astronauts and engineers share their personal journeys and career experiences with students.
"The act of bringing this global Honeywell community together with Space Camp allows these students to plan for a future of improving life on our planet and beyond," said Dr. Deborah Barnhart, CEO and executive director, USSRC. "They bring the best of their diverse cultures to Space Camp, where they will use teamwork and technology to prepare them for a future they have yet to imagine."
"Honeywell Leadership Challenge Academy is designed to inspire students to become tomorrow's science, math and engineering leaders," said Michael A. Bennett, president, Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the company's corporate citizenship initiative. "We want to give these students a passion to fuel their generation's technological contributions to the world."
Since its launch in 2010, Honeywell, in partnership with the USSRC, has awarded 2,093 scholarships to students of Honeywell employees. Scholarships are granted after a rigorous application and review process based on academic achievement and community involvement. Financial contributions from Honeywell and its employees fund the scholarships, which cover the cost of tuition, meals, accommodations and program material.
