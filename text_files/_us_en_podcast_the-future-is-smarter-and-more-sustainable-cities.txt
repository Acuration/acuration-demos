The Future Is... Smarter and More Sustainable Cities
The Future Is... Smarter and More Sustainable Cities
Matthew Britt, general manager of smart cities and communities at Honeywell, discusses all things smart cities: what they are, what they aren't, and examples in the world today.
Nearly 7 in 10 people will live in cities by 2050, according to the World Bank. That's around double compared to today.
With urban populations globally on the rise, smart city technologies and concepts can help municipalities better support their citizens, from faster delivery of emergency services to effectively managing power usage.
This episode of "The Future Is..." podcast explores how smart cities work and why they are the future of more resilient communities.
"A smart city is one that uses technology and data-driven solutions to help improve the quality of life of its residents and help improve operational efficiency within the municipal government," Matthew Britt said on the podcast.
Listen to this episode to learn more about smart cities.
