How We Challenge Gender Bias
How We Challenge Gender Bias
On International Women’s Day and every day, we pledge to stand up to inequality.
The benefit of having female leaders in critical roles is evident within Honeywell Gas Analysis & Safety, its team members said.
"We choose to drive and overcome gender bias by staffing key leadership roles with female applicants on an ongoing basis, and challenge our teams to build inclusive and diverse teams as well," the team said.
As part of a pledge, members of the team raised their hands on a video call and pledged to challenge gender bias and stereotypes on International Women’s Day 2021.
Here’s how other Honeywell employees plan to #ChoosetoChallenge.
Dora Gonzalez, Sr. Account Development Manager
Location: Frisco, Texas
Why do you choose to challenge gender bias and inequality?
I choose to challenge gender bias and inequality for the future of my daughter! I want to pave the way for Katalina to make it more attainable for her to reach her future goals of becoming an engineer and an inventor. It has been hard for me as a female and I want to make sure it is not a such a difficult road for her.
Contessa Dorsey, Engineering Principal
Location: Clearwater, Florida
Why do you choose to challenge gender bias and inequality?
I choose to challenge gender bias because others may not be strong enough to handle the burden of the challenge. I choose to stand in the gap for the women before that could not challenge the status quo. When I see bias, I consider it another challenge, test or obstacle for me to overcome as a Black female engineer.
Louise Quilter-Wood, Vice President of Human Resources for Safety and Productivity Solutions
Location: Charlotte, N.C.
Why do you choose to challenge gender bias and inequality?
My mother grew up in the UK in the 1950s when expectations were very different for women – at that time there was no expectation of equal pay or career opportunities. As a young woman she felt sidelined, left out, less important and not heard. She also felt angry!  She raised my sister and me to believe and to know we could be and do anything. Today, I am challenging myself to teach my daughters and sons to challenge inequality in any form and to know that being inclusive takes a series of deliberate actions – it is not a passive sport!
Meagan Lewis, Senior Business Leader
Location: Des Plaines, Illinois
Why do you choose to challenge gender bias and inequality?
I want everyone to feel safe and comfortable to live their life each day and to know that their hard work can lead to success. Bias and inequality gets in the way of this.
Dalia Garza, Demand Planning Manager
Location: Monterrey, Mexico
Why do you choose to challenge gender bias and inequality?
I choose to challenge gender bias and inequality, because women are underrepresented in corporations and the share of women decreases with each step up the corporate hierarchy. More must be done to enable highly skilled women to advance into leadership positions. On the Aerospace commercial demand management team, we use our influence and expertise to challenge adverse social norms and gender stereotypes to advocate and partner for change. We build a diverse team in which women are empowered and visible as role models for change.
Gill Chandrasena, Vice President of Human Resources, Honeywell Connected Enterprise
Based: Atlanta, Georgia
Why do you choose to challenge gender bias and inequality?
I believe that people should be judged fairly on the work they do and the value they contribute. Whether we like to admit it or not, the playing field isn’t even and it’s our job to make it as level as possible whether that’s in regards to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or any such attributes. As a parent to two small children of mixed ethnic origin, I also feel accountable; if you don’t speak up and pay it forward, you’re part of the problem.
