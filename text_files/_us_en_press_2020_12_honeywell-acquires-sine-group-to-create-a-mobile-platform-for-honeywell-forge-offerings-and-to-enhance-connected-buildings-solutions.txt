Honeywell Acquires Sine Group To Create A Mobile Platform For Honeywell Forge Offerings And To Enhance Connected Buildings Solutions
- Sine's visitor management software, designed with mobile users in mind, will augment Honeywell's Connected Buildings offerings with expanded safety, security and compliance capabilities
December 14, 2020
ATLANTA, Dec. 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that it has acquired Sine Group, an Adelaide, Australia-based technology and software as a service (SaaS) company that provides visitor management, workplace and supply chain solutions that are readily accessible with mobile devices. Sine's technologies will support a cloud-based mobile platform for Honeywell Forge, Honeywell's enterprise performance management offering, and Sine's software will augment Honeywell's Connected Buildings offerings with expanded safety, security and compliance capabilities.
Honeywell will also expand on Sine's features and solutions and make Sine's offerings available to more customers, globally.
"Sine's innovative and intuitive self-service software, combined with Honeywell Forge, will enable our customers to return to work and help keep their employees and customers safe," said Que Dallara, president and CEO, Honeywell Connected Enterprise. "We will leverage Sine's technological know-how and expertise to create a mobile extension of Honeywell Forge while also substantially enhancing our Connected Buildings offerings to enable even greater levels of safety and productivity for building occupants and their guests."
Sine's intuitive mobile application enables touchless check-in by mobile phone across a wide variety of industries including commercial real estate, pharma, education, industrial, logistics, construction and others. Sine's SaaS solution provides companies with capabilities to help improve safety, security, and compliance across their facilities for visitors, building occupants and workers. Sine has also built a suite of features to enable organizations to manage their COVID-19 return-to-workplace protocols, including pre-screening, thermal camera integrations, capacity management and contact tracing.
"The combination of Sine's visitor management software and Honeywell's enterprise performance management software is a powerful one for businesses globally," said Antony Ceravolo, founder and chief executive officer of Sine. "Sine's solutions will bolster Honeywell's capabilities to help organizations operate more efficiently and safely. Sine will benefit from Honeywell's global scale and buildings management expertise. Together, with an accelerated roadmap, we will deliver a deeper set of solutions globally, while continuing to grow our ecosystem of partners and third-party integrations."
Honeywell Forge is purpose-built on a native edge-to-cloud, data-driven architecture designed to accelerate digital transformation of operations. For industrial businesses, this enterprise performance management SaaS application provides capabilities for facility, plant, or warehouse managers to help make their operations smarter, leaner and more efficient.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and there is no change to Honeywell's 2020 financial guidance as a result of the acquisition.
