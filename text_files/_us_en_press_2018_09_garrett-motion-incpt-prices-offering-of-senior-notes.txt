Garrett Motion Inc. Prices Offering Of Senior Notes
Garrett Motion Inc. Prices Offering Of Senior Notes
October 5, 2018
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Sept. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell International Inc. ("Honeywell") (NYSE: HON) announced that, in connection with the previously announced spin-off (the "Spin-Off") of Garrett Motion Inc. ("Garrett") from Honeywell, Garrett LX I S.√† r.l. (the "Issuer") and Garrett Borrowing LLC (the "Co-Issuer" and, together with the Issuer, the "Issuers"), wholly owned subsidiaries of Garrett, have priced a private offering of ‚Ç¨350 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 (the "Notes"). The aggregate principal amount of Notes to be issued reflects a decrease of ‚Ç¨100 million from the time of launch. The aggregate principal amount of our term loans under our new credit facilities is expected to increase by a corresponding amount. The Notes will be issued at par, bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per annum and mature on October 15, 2026. The Notes offering is expected to close on or about September 27, 2018.
In connection with the Spin-Off, Garrett intends to use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under a new credit facility, to repay intercompany indebtedness to Honeywell or a subsidiary of Honeywell and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the new credit facility and the Notes offering. We anticipate that the repayment to Honeywell or a subsidiary of Honeywell will be approximately $1.6 billion.
The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by Garrett, each of Garrett's domestic subsidiaries and certain of Garrett's foreign subsidiaries. The Notes will be secured by security interests granted by the Issuer over the equity interests in a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer and an unsecured intercompany loan to an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer. These security interests will rank as junior to the security interests granted by the Issuer in such collateral to secure the new credit facility and any other future indebtedness secured on a basis senior to the Notes.
The Notes and related guarantees were offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and related guarantees will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes or any other security, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. Any offers of the Notes or related guarantees will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum.
