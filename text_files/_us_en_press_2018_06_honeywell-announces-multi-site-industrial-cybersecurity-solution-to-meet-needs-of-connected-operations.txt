Honeywell Announces Multi-Site Industrial Cybersecurity Solution to Meet Needs of Connected Operations
Honeywell Announces Multi-Site Industrial Cybersecurity Solution to Meet Needs of Connected Operations
June 5, 2018
HOUSTON, June 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced a software solution to provide cybersecurity to industrial customers who manage diverse process control networks, sites and vendors. As customers continue their digital transformation and their industrial sites become more connected, integrating cybersecurity has become even more critical.
The multi-site solution for cybersecurity management is based on Honeywell's ICS Shield', which provides a top-down operational technology (OT) security management solution for securing connected industrial control system (ICS) environments with multiple physical sites and multiple automation equipment types. It also enables secure management of remote field assets through a single security operations center. Honeywell integrated and enhanced ICS Shield technology following its acquisition of Nextnine in 2017, and the solution has become the ICS cybersecurity platform of choice with more than 1 million industrial nodes managed globally.
"With industrial companies connecting operations worldwide to drive greater efficiencies, there's a real need for multi-site cybersecurity technologies designed for ICS environments," said Jeff Zindel, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Industrial Cybersecurity. "As a trusted partner to critical infrastructure providers for more than 50 years, Honeywell offers an industry-proven solution for enterprise-wide cybersecurity with a secure, vendor-agnostic approach that strengthens industrial cybersecurity defenses and lowers operational risks."
For companies facing internal cybersecurity skills and resource shortages, Honeywell Managed Security Services can help install, configure, and continually manage ICS Shield, allowing customers to focus on running their operations. Servicing more than 400 customers worldwide, Managed Security Services provide secure remote access, automated patching, continuous monitoring and incident response along with firewall and intrusion detection system management capabilities. These services expedite the ability of industrial companies to close major security gaps, and unlike pure IT solutions, ensure that industrial security experts carefully balance manufacturing and production priorities with security requirements. In addition, knowledge transfer from Honeywell experts improves customers' cybersecurity capabilities in the long term.
Honeywell is the leading provider of cybersecurity solutions that protect industrial assets, operations and people from digital age threats. With more than 15 years of industrial cybersecurity expertise and more than 50 years of industrial domain expertise, Honeywell combines proven cybersecurity technology and industrial know-how to maximize productivity, reliability and safety.
