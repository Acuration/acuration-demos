Honeywell-Sponsored Program Featuring Nobel Laureate Challenges Czech Technical University Students to Question Conventional Wisdom
Honeywell-Sponsored Program Featuring Nobel Laureate Challenges Czech Technical University Students to Question Conventional Wisdom
November 9, 2017
PRAGUE, Nov. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Professor Stefan W. Hell, winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics, inspired more than 5,000 students and professors at Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague, the Czech Republic, today, as part of the Honeywell Initiative for Science & Engineering (HISE). This marks the fifth time Honeywell's (NYSE: HON) global program was presented at CTU.
Sponsored by Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the company's corporate citizenship initiative, HISE aims to encourage students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). For more than a decade, it has benefited thousands of students and teachers at top universities in China, India, the United States, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico and Romania. The initiative includes a series of laureate lectures and career discussions with Honeywell's top engineers.
Hell, who received the Nobel Prize for the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy, is among 26 Nobel laureates sponsored by Honeywell at universities worldwide since 2006. It is the eleventh time the program has been delivered to a university in the Czech Republic. Other participating Czech schools have included Brno University of Technology and V≈†B&endash;Technical University of Ostrava.
"At Czech Technical University, we are committed to developing well-rounded, globally competitive leaders to achieve technical, economic and social breakthroughs in the Czech Republic," said CTU Rector Professor Petr Konvalinka. "We are delighted to welcome Nobel Laureate Stefan Hell and Honeywell engineers to our campus, and believe today's HISE event will help students see their future career possibilities."
Hell is a director at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G√∂ttingen, Germany, where he leads the Department of NanoBiophotonics. He also is a director at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, where he leads the Department of Optical Nanoscopy. He is credited with having conceived, validated and applied the first viable concept for overcoming Abbe's diffraction-limited resolution barrier in a light-focusing fluorescence microscope. For these achievements and their significance for other fields, Hell has received numerous awards, including the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience.
"Challenge conventional wisdom," Hell advised students during his lecture. "Use your imagination to solve a technical challenge in a way that others haven't thought about, and then prove that your solution is the right one."
"At Honeywell, we are blending physical products with software solutions to link people, processes and assets within an organization, making it more efficient, productive, and connected," said Ji≈ô√≠ Tom√≠ƒçek, Vice President and General Manager, Honeywell Technology Solutions (HTS), the Czech Republic. "By offering CTU students the opportunity to learn from a Nobel laureate and interact with Honeywell engineers, we hope to inspire these students to pursue careers in STEM."
Honeywell closely cooperates with the Czech Republic's technical universities on programs such as engineering lectures, collaborative projects, student events, academic thesis opportunities and internships.
Honeywell Hometown Solutions supports STEM education in the Czech Republic by inviting local middle school science and math teachers and high school students to attend the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in the United States each year. Additionally, middle school Czech students compete in the global Student Automotive Design Challenge (SADC), an annual co-sponsored program between Honeywell and SAE International that challenges teams of students to research, design, test and build electric and gear-driven toy cars.
