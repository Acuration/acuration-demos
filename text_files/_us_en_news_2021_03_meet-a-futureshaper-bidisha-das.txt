Meet a #futureshaper: Bidisha Das
Here’s how she’s making buildings smarter.
Bidisha Das believes that in the future, artificial intelligence will impact every aspect of our lives.
“We will see building technology be more about computers and edge devices becoming connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and enhanced by machine learning algorithms,” Bidisha says.
Based in Mumbai, India, here is her #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up? When I was a child, I wanted to be a Doctor. I was inspired by the renowned heart surgeon Dr. Devi Shetty who treated my father and wanted to be in this profession which saved people’s lives.
What brought you to Honeywell? I joined Honeywell as a Graduate Trainee and was recruited from my Engineering college as a part of Honeywell’s Graduate Trainee Program in India.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
In all these years with Honeywell, the one thing that I have always enjoyed is engaging with our customers, solving their problems, supporting them in achieving their organizational outcomes through our solutions. That is the most satisfying and exciting part of my job in Honeywell.
Did you ever imagine you would end up in the job you are now?
When I was studying engineering, I always wanted to work for an organization which has technology and innovation at its core. Though I never imagined that I would be leading a sales team someday, my dream of working for an industrial and technology leader was fulfilled when I joined Honeywell.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged from reel life to real life and will pretty much impact all aspects of our life in the near future. We will see building technology be more about computers and edge devices becoming connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and enhanced by machine learning algorithms.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
I would say have an open mind, challenge yourself and always push yourself out of your comfort zone.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
To be successful in your career, do what excites you, motivates you and become the best version of yourself. Lastly, always honor your commitments with integrity.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I have a 4-year-old son. My time off work is spent with my son and family. I also enjoy reading fiction and collect good old-fashioned paperback books. They are my source of inspiration and rejuvenation. Back home, I have a decent collection of “books I want to read” and have read.
