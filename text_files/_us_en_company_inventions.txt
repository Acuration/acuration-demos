Inventions
From the late 19th century to today, our inventors have made history and shape the future.
1885
Automatic heating
Albert Butz invented a device he called the "damper flapper.” That system included a thermostat, battery and motor. It would lift the damper in a furnace, fanning the flames and warming a home.
Why it’s innovative: The invention was the predecessor to the modern thermostat and set the stage for building controls and comfort. Honeywell continued to have many firsts in this area, including those that support building operations through the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, fire safety systems and video surveillance. Our products are present in 25% of buildings worldwide.

WWII
Autopilot
The autopilot maintains stable flight of an aircraft even if a pilot took their hands off the stick.
Why it’s innovative: Autopilot was the first step toward aviation autonomy. Honeywell continued to advance the state of the art in autopilot and flight controls through the World War II era C-1 autopilot and postwar missile guidance and commercial aircraft systems.

1960s
Unleaded Gasoline
Honeywell UOP developed better refining methods of crude oil and the technologies that brought lead-free gasoline.
Why it’s innovative: Unleaded gasoline is safer for the environment and people and continues to fuel vehicles to this day.

1960s
Biodegradable detergents
Detergents once polluted many of the world’s rivers and lakes, with rapid algae growth that killed fish and plants. Biodegradable detergent technologies, prevent that from happening.
Why it’s innovative: Today, more than 85% of worldwide biodegradable detergent production uses Honeywell UOP’s petrochemical process technologies.

1960s
Collision avoidance system
The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alert pilots to obstacle in the flight path such as a mountain.
Why it’s innovative: The GPWS made air travel safer and helped pilots know that the obstacles existed despite weather conditions like fog.

1974
Most widely used barcode
The Code 39 barcode is the most widely used barcode today.
Why it’s innovative: Barcodes are now used throughout industries, including grocery store checkouts, package tracking, flight boarding passes, in the health care space and more.

2000s
Low-GWP refrigerant
Solstice is a fluorinated compound has lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) than the refrigerant it replaces in car air conditioners, supermarket refrigeration and home insulation.
Why it’s innovative: It keeps food fresh longer, protects homes from extreme weather and reduces car emissions.

2003
Gentle warehouse sorting
Essential to warehouses and distribution centers, these conveyors, software and controls protect products from being damaged.
Why it’s innovative: These systems can accommodate virtually any product size and shape. This maximizes throughput and efficiency – getting goods where they’re going faster.
