Meet a #futureshaper: John Jenkins
Meet a #futureshaper: John Jenkins
He's helping protect people during work and play.
John Jenkins helps solve problems.
He helps protect people from the environments where they work and play.
Safety products will become more mainstream and a more integrated way of life, he said.
Based in San Diego, California; here is his #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I always thought I would join and retire from the military.  I wanted to be an Air Force Pilot and then perhaps go into commercial piloting.  I followed through on joining the Air Force.  While training, I decided to go another path.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
Being responsible for identifying new product opportunities, creating products from scratch, and launching products that will be purchased, worn, protect and appreciated by people I don’t even know!
Did you ever imagine you would end up in the job you are now?
No, not for a minute, and I actually worked for a company that worked with Honeywell on hearing protection, never imagining that someday I would be developing the primary product that I studied.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
A #futureshaper does not feel like it is “just a job” at all.  We bring the best that we have in all things we do and hope to inspire the best from those around us.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Do think clearly and intently on what you want to do in the long term.  Develop a plan that will get you there and focus on the steps required to achieve that goal.  Along the way, take opportunities to verify you plan is right for you and importantly, adjust as necessary.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I sincerely enjoy cracking open the throttle on my Harley from time to time, in a safe manner of course.  Time with friends is important to me, along with critical music listening.
