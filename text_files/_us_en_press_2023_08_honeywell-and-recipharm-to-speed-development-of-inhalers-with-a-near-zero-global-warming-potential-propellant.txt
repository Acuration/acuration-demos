Honeywell and Recipharm to Speed Development of Inhalers with a Near-Zero Global Warming Potential Propellant
Honeywell and Recipharm to Speed Development of Inhalers with a Near-Zero Global Warming Potential Propellant
Partnership will reduce environmental footprint of pressurized metered dose inhalers and accelerate transition to lower greenhouse gas respiratory care.
August 17, 2023
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. and STOCKHOLM, Aug. 17, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) and global contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) Recipharm have today announced a commercial partnership that will speed the development of pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) that use Honeywell's near-zero global warming potential (GWP) propellant.
As many as 384 million people globally suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and about 262 million people suffer from asthma.1 Many of these patients are treated using pMDIs that have a high global warming potential due to the use of hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs) as propellants.
Honeywell Solstice® Air (HFO-1234ze(E) cGMP) is a hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) propellant in clinical development today for pMDIs that has 99.9% less global warming potential than HFAs. In addition, Honeywell Solstice Air is non-flammable, non-ozone-depleting and volatile organic compound (VOC)-exempt under federal and state guidelines.
"Honeywell is making great strides to offer patients who rely on pMDIs a lower greenhouse gas solution to meet their medical needs," said Laura Reinhard, vice president and general manager, Honeywell Foam and Industrial Products. "Through our collaboration with Recipharm, the increased use of near-zero GWP propellant used in pMDIs will help reduce the environmental impact of the life-saving medical treatments patients need, without sacrificing performance."
"As the first CDMO to partner with Honeywell for use of Solstice Air, this collaboration significantly accelerates and simplifies our customers' pathway to develop the next generation of low greenhouse gas pMDIs," said Chris Hirst, president of Recipharm's Advanced Delivery Systems business unit. "Our collaboration is supported by Recipharm's investment in manufacturing with HFO-1234ze(E) cGMP at our Holmes Chapel, United Kingdom site, and the further development of the Bespak® valve range to ensure the required product performance."
The partnership with Honeywell follows Recipharm's announcement that it is expanding its pMDI product development and manufacturing capabilities to accommodate increased demand from pharmaceutical companies. Research will be conducted at Recipharm's dedicated inhalation development facility in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
Recipharm customers will also benefit from the company's market-leading Bespak® valves, which have been optimized to ensure performance with products containing Honeywell Solstice Air as the propellant.
Honeywell has invested more than $1 billion in research, development and new capacity for its Solstice technology, which has applications in refrigerants, blowing agents, aerosols and solvents. Use of Honeywell Solstice technology has helped avoid the potential release of the equivalent of more than 326 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, equal to the carbon emissions from nearly 70 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles per year.2 For more information on Honeywell Solstice Air, its applications, and impact, visit: https://sustainability.honeywell.com/us/en
Honeywell is committed to achieving carbon neutrality in its operations and facilities by 2035. About 60% of Honeywell's 2022 new product introduction research and development investment was directed toward Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) oriented outcomes for customers.3
As a CDMO focusing on sustainability, Recipharm is committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). It has set ambitious and transparent targets to reduce its emissions from direct operations by 42% and emissions from the full value-chain by 25% by 2030. It also has B- rating for Climate from CDP which indicates Recipharm is showing clear evidence of managing its climate impact. To find out more, read Recipharm's Sustainability Report, here.
