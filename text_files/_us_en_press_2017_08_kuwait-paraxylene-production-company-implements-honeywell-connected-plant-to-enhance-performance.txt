Kuwait Paraxylene Production Company Implements Honeywell Connected Plant to Enhance Performance
Kuwait Paraxylene Production Company Implements Honeywell Connected Plant to Enhance Performance
March 20, 2018
DES PLAINES, Ill., Aug. 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Kuwait Paraxylene Production Co. (KPPC) will use two Honeywell Connected Plant services to improve the performance of its CCR Platforming™ and aromatics complex, which produces paraxylene for plastic fibers and films, at its Shuaiba petrochemical facility in Safat, Kuwait.
KPPC will use Honeywell Connected Plant's Process Reliability Advisor for ongoing monitoring, early event detection and mitigation of performance issues before they become costly. The company also will use Process Optimization Advisor, which continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies Honeywell UOP process models to determine the most economical mode of operations. Both services use big-data analytics and machine learning to improve plant operation.
"Both of these services combine plant process data with Honeywell UOP expertise and powerful software to enable our customers to run more reliably and at the top of their plant capabilities," said Zak Alzein, vice president for Honeywell UOP's Connected Performance Services business. "We will be able to identify operational adjustments that provide significant incremental value that KPPC is able to achieve by using these services."
Honeywell Connected Plant combines the company's unmatched industrial expertise, software and digital technologies to make its customers' operations more reliable, profitable and secure than ever before possible. Part of Connected Plant, Process Reliability Advisor leverages Honeywell UOP process models and fault models configured to each operation, finding problems that hamper production, and preventing unplanned shutdowns that can deprive plant operators millions of dollars per year in lost productivity.
Process Optimization Advisor provides recommendations based on plant-specific information, with actual operating constraints and economic information, providing recommendations that can significantly improve plant profitability.
Kuwait Paraxylene Production Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kuwait Aromatics Company (KARO), a joint venture between Petrochemical Industries Co. (PIC), Kuwait National Petroleum Company and Qurain Petrochemical Industries Company. As the aromatics unit of PIC, KPPC is one of the region's largest marketers of paraxylene. The Shuaiba aromatics complex annually produces 780,000 metric tons of paraxylene, which is marketed by PIC -- and 370,000 metric tons of benzene, which is used locally for production of styrene monomer by The Kuwait Styrene Company (TKSC).
