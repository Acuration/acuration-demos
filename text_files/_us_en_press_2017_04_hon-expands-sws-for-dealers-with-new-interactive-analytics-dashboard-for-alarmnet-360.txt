Honeywell Expands Software Solutions for Dealers with New Interactive Analytics Dashboard for AlarmNet 360
Honeywell Expands Software Solutions for Dealers with New Interactive Analytics Dashboard for AlarmNet 360
April 12, 2017
MELVILLE, N.Y., April 12, 2017 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today released AlarmNet 360 Insights, an interactive analytics dashboard in the AlarmNet 360' cloud-based business management platform that makes it easier for security dealers and central stations to explore customer data, uncover opportunities and expose problem areas.
“For more than 30 years, AlarmNet has provided monitored security to approximately 1.8 million protected premises, processing more than 7 million signals per day,” said Alice DeBiasio, vice president and general manager, fire and security software, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “The AlarmNet 360 Insights dashboard delivers enhanced business analytics, and is fully interactive to help central station executives and security dealer executives, sales managers and operations teams make smart business decisions.”
The data within AlarmNet 360 Insights is updated on a daily basis to ensure that the data is current, giving dealers more opportunities to be proactive with their accounts. A wide range of filters is available for dealers and central stations to view their account base by communication types, communicator models, AlarmNet services, and Honeywell Total Connect' Remote Services.
Better Understand Current Customer Base: The Map view shows current account locations, streamlining how users analyze and measure the current state of their business by geographic areas. Users can select a product or service, use the Map to review their total service area and zoom into specific areas as needed. Users can quickly and easily compare sales performance or analyze customer and technical support by region or service area, to help uncover business trends and upsell opportunities.
Protect Current Customer Base: The dashboard is designed to help operations teams retain their current customer base. For example, a technical or customer support representative can view how many accounts are offline and use the Map feature to visually evaluate whether the problem is an isolated or widespread incident.
Identify Areas for Growth: The dashboard empowers customers to explore their account base in new ways, helping them create upgrade programs with greater chances for success. For example, dealers and central stations can get a list of their end users who have Honeywell Total Connect Remote Services but have not yet subscribed to the service. This allows them an opportunity to create targeted campaigns to protect accounts and maximize growth opportunities.
AlarmNet360 Insights is free to use and is now available for all AlarmNet dealers and central stations.
