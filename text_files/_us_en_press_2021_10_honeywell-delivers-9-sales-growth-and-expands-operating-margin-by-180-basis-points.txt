Organic Sales up 8%; Second Straight Quarter of Sales Growth in All Four Segments

October 22, 2021
CHARLOTTE, N.C., October 22, 2021 -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced outstanding results for the third quarter that met or exceeded the company's guidance.
“The third quarter was another strong one for Honeywell, with sales growth in all four segments, significant margin expansion, and exceptional execution even as we faced tough challenges in the supply chain environment,” said Darius Adamczyk, chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell. “Organic sales grew 8%, led by 38% growth in Aerospace commercial aftermarket, 21% growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions, and 29% growth in UOP and 14% growth in advanced materials within Performance Materials and Technologies. Our focus on operational and commercial excellence enabled us to expand segment margin by 130 basis points to 21.2%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 60 basis points. As a result, we delivered adjusted earnings per share1 of $2.02, up 29% year over year, achieving the high end of our third-quarter guidance range. Our cash performance was strong, and we remain on track to meet our cash flow commitments for the year. We continued to execute on our capital deployment strategy, repurchasing $0.7 billion in shares, announcing our 12th dividend increase in the past 11 years, and completing the acquisition of Performix Inc. to expand our portfolio of automation solutions for the life sciences industry."
Adamczyk continued, “Our disciplined approach to productivity and pricing helped deliver a strong third quarter despite an uncertain global environment marked by supply chain constraints, increasing raw material inflation, and labor market challenges. We continue to focus on mitigating these challenges in the fourth quarter, while capitalizing on near-term growth opportunities across our portfolio."
Honeywell updated its full-year guidance to reflect the persistent effects of the macro-challenged environment as well as the third-quarter results. Full-year sales are now expected to be in the range of $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion with organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% due to supply chain constraints. Segment margin is expected to be in the range of 20.9% to 21.1%. Adjusted earnings per share2 is expected to be $8.00 to $8.10. Operating cash flow is still expected to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion and free cash flow is still expected to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion. A summary of the company’s full-year guidance changes can be found in Table 1.
Third-Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the third quarter were up 9% on a reported basis and up 8% on an organic basis. The third-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.
Aerospace sales for the third quarter were up 2% on an organic basis driven by an ongoing recovery in commercial aftermarket demand as flight hours continued to increase as well as by strong growth in business and general aviation original equipment, partially offset by lower defense volumes, which were impacted by supply chain constraints. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 38% year over year and air transport aftermarket sales were up double digits sequentially from the second quarter, demonstrating momentum in the aftermarket recovery. Segment margin expanded 390 basis points to 27.1% driven by commercial excellence, favorable sales mix, and productivity net of inflation.
Honeywell Building Technologies sales for the third quarter were up 3% on an organic basis driven by strength across the building products portfolio and continued growth in building solutions services. Orders were up double digits year over year, driven by strong demand for building projects and products. The services backlog was up over 35% driven by strong global bookings, positioning the business for continued growth. Segment margin expanded 190 basis points to 23.5% driven by commercial excellence and productivity, partially offset by inflation.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the third quarter were up 9% on an organic basis driven by demand for process solutions services and thermal solutions, petrochemical catalyst shipments and equipment volumes in UOP, and continued double-digit growth in advanced materials driven by strong demand across the portfolio. Robust demand for services, automation projects, gas processing, and advanced materials drove double-digit orders growth year over year for the second consecutive quarter. Segment margin expanded 260 basis points to 22.2% driven by commercial excellence and productivity, partially offset by inflation.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the third quarter were up 21% on an organic basis driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in the warehouse and workflow solutions, productivity solutions and services, and gas analysis businesses, partially offset by lower personal protective equipment volumes. Orders were up double digits year over year driven by over 50% orders growth in warehouse and workflow solutions, productivity solutions and services, and advanced sensing, which should drive continued growth. Segment margin contracted 70 basis points to 13.2% driven by unfavorable business mix and Intelligrated supply chain challenges, partially offset by commercial excellence.

This release contains financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Honeywell’s non-GAAP financial measures used in this release are as follows: segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, a measure by which we assess operating performance, which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in the Appendix; segment margin, on an overall Honeywell basis, which we define as segment profit divided by sales; organic sales growth, which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following the transaction date; free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures plus cash receipts from Garrett, if and as noted in the release; adjusted free cash flow conversion, which we define as free cash flow divided by adjusted net income attributable to Honeywell; adjusted net income attributable to Honeywell, which we define as net income attributable to Honeywell which we adjust to exclude changes in fair value for Garrett equity securities, an expense related to UOP matters, gain on the sale of the retail footwear business, and the 3Q20 non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from Garrett, if and as noted in the release; and adjusted earnings per share, which we adjust to exclude pension mark-to-market, changes in fair value for Garrett equity securities, an expense related to UOP matters, gain on the sale of the retail footwear business, the non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from Garrett, net of proceeds from settlement of related hedging transactions, the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions, and a non-cash charge associated with a further reduction in value of reimbursement receivables following Garrett’s emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2021, if and as noted in the release. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Certain metrics presented on a non-GAAP basis represent the impact of adjusting items net of tax. The tax-effect for adjusting items is determined individually and on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Appendix attached to this release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
