Honeywell Names Stephen Gold As Vice President And General Manager, Connected Enterprises
Honeywell Names Stephen Gold As Vice President And General Manager, Connected Enterprises
February 8, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Feb. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that Stephen Gold has been named Vice President and General Manager, Connected Enterprises. This new position reports to Krishna Mikkilineni, Senior Vice President, Engineering, Operations and IT, and Darius Adamczyk, President and Chief Operating Officer.
"Honeywell already has an unmatched ability to combine advanced software with great physical products to provide enormous value to our customers across a wide variety of vertical markets. Our technologies improve lives, strengthen businesses, and enable a cleaner and more sustainable environment," said Adamczyk, who will become Honeywell's Chief Executive Officer on March 31. "Stephen's track record of leading successful connected enterprises and building software-focused businesses across industries and geographies will provide a strong foundation for leading our connected businesses. Among his many responsibilities will be leading our new Atlanta Software Center."
Last September, Honeywell announced plans to establish a state-of-the-art Software Center along with the headquarters of its newly-formed Home and Building Technologies business in Atlanta, and to staff the center with more than 730 software-focused employees over the next five years. Most will specialize in software application development, including cloud computing and data analytics, and will work on critical software projects across the company. The Atlanta center will add to the company's considerable existing capabilities – almost half of Honeywell's 23,000 engineers worldwide today are focused on software development.
"Honeywell has a unique position in the market, serving both the consumer and commercial sector, bringing deep subject matter expertise and a legacy of delivering extraordinary value," Gold said. "Our focus will bring together the physical world with data and digital intelligence, including next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) technology and advanced analytics. I am excited by the opportunity to deliver greater customer value and to work with such an accomplished team and organization."
Most recently, Gold has served as principal architect and Chief Marketing Officer of IBM's Watson Group as well as Vice President, Business Development, commercializing solutions based on Watson's transformative technology in industries such as healthcare, finance, education, retail, marketing, supply chain management and in the Internet of Things (IoT). He also oversaw partner programs, investments, and mergers and acquisitions for Watson. Prior to that, Gold was CMO of SPSS Inc., a provider of predictive analytics software and solutions that was acquired by IBM. Before SPSS, Gold served as President of the Aberdeen Group, a data science firm where he drove 28 percent year over year growth and expanded operations in 22 markets. Gold also held positions at Digital Market (now Oracle), Reptron, and CalAbco/Packard Bell. He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois and an MBA from Carnegie Mellon University.
