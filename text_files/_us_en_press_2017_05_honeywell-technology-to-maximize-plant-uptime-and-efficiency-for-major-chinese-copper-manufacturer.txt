Honeywell Technology to Maximize Plant Uptime and Efficiency for Major Chinese Copper Manufacturer
Honeywell Technology to Maximize Plant Uptime and Efficiency for Major Chinese Copper Manufacturer
May 2, 2017
SHANGHAI, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) Process Solutions (HPS) today announced that it will upgrade four process control systems that will improve reliability and help prevent unplanned shutdown losses for one of China's largest copper manufacturers.
Under the agreement, Honeywell will provide its industry-leading Experion® Process Knowledge System (PKS) suite including software, hardware, consulting services, and training to facilitate Jinlong Copper Industry Ltd.'s upgrade from its existing Total Plant System (TPS).
"Honeywell Experion PKS is unparalleled in its capability to integrate process control, safety, and SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) applications into a single platform," said Chen Yan, vice president and general manager, HPS Greater China. "It allows our customers like Jinlong Copper to upgrade their legacy systems with lower capital investment by retaining existing system I/O (input/output) and saving up to 15 percent of total project cost."
Located in Tongling, Anhui province, Jinlong Copper is a subsidiary of Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group, one of the largest copper manufacturers in China.
"Effectively using the plant data to sustain operation reliability is critical," said Zhao Yao, Deputy Chief of Security, Jinlong Copper. "Honeywell's integrated and open system enables us to achieve this."
Honeywell Experion PKS is an enterprise-wide solution combining disparate functions, systems, and knowledge to integrate people with processes, business requirements, and asset management for increased productivity and reliability. Since 1997, when Honeywell's distributed control system (DCS) first launched in China, there have been about 2,000 systems successfully installed and currently serving more than 800 Chinese customers.
In addition, Honeywell provided Jinlong Copper with its unique Business Effectiveness Benchmarking toolkit. Incorporated with the DCS best practices, Honeywell's toolkit helps customers to position their current operation against best practices and identify gaps. Customers will be able to get a clearer picture of where they stand and how to improve DCS operations to realize more value.
