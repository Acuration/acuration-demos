Meet a #Futureshaper: José Anaya Lopez
Meet a #Futureshaper: José Anaya Lopez
"What inspires me and the team is to work on things that used to only live in science fiction," says José.
José Anaya Lopez is making flying more efficient - and fun.
José, an avionics system engineer in our Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) division, builds technologies and systems to power what you might think of as flying taxis, carrying either people or cargo above city streets.
He's part of a team whose goal it is to make flying UAM and UAS vehicles efficient and user-friendly.
Get to know more about José.
What should people know about urban air mobility?
UAM will impact how people commute on a daily basis, and it will reduce air and noise pollution in cities. Drone technology today is used to reduce the use of fuel and costs of traditional test flights to develop components like antennas and radars, but can also develop solutions for the delivery, surveillance and search and rescue.
What does your day-to-day look like?
I coordinate with various teams to generate a cohesive system. I work with flight controls, customers and many other teams in our aerospace business when developing solutions that start as test benches but will end up going on aircraft.
How do you define Futureshaper?
A Futureshaper is a person who observes the world, discovers areas of improvement in their surroundings, ideates solutions and implements them, and gradually makes the world better.
Meet other Futureshapers who are innovating to make our world smarter, safer and more sustainable.
