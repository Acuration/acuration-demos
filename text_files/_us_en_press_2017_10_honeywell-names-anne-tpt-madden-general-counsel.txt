Honeywell Names Anne T. Madden General Counsel
Honeywell Names Anne T. Madden General Counsel
October 9, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Oct. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that it has named Anne T. Madden as Senior Vice President and General Counsel, reporting to President and CEO Darius Adamczyk and serving as a company officer.
Madden has served as Vice President of Corporate Development and Global Head of M&A since 2002. During her tenure, Honeywell has executed about 100 acquisitions representing $15 billion in sales along with about 70 divestitures representing $8.5 billion in sales. Madden succeeds Kate Adams, who served in the role since 2009 and has decided to leave Honeywell to become Apple's General Counsel.
"We appreciate all of Kate's contributions to Honeywell, and under her leadership, we built a deep bench of legal talent. Anne has strong business acumen and deep legal expertise, and she is a welcome addition to Honeywell's leadership team. She has a proven track record not only of facilitating transactions, but supporting Honeywell's growth around the world," Adamczyk said. "Anne has also been instrumental in developing and executing our disciplined integration process that has driven the high payback we have achieved with the vast majority of our deals. Our successful M&A strategy and the returns we have generated have differentiated Honeywell from its peers."
Prior to her current role, Madden served as vice president and deputy general counsel for the Performance Materials and Technologies business group. Prior to Honeywell, Madden was in private practice at the New York law firm of Shearman & Sterling, focused on M&A and Corporate Finance. She started her career as an auditor in the Financial Services Group of KPMG Peat Marwick in New York.
Madden earned an A.B. in English and American literature from Brown University, a M.S. in accounting and a M.B.A. in finance from the New York University Stern School of Business, and a J.D. from the Fordham University School of Law, where she was Managing Editor of the Law Review.
