Honeywell Demonstrates Support For India’s Covid Relief Efforts
Honeywell Demonstrates Support For India’s Covid Relief Efforts
5 May 2021
Bengaluru
Honeywell today issued the following statement of support for India’s relief efforts in response to the ongoing Covid pandemic:
“We are deeply saddened and distressed by the scale of the humanitarian crisis in India and are working closely with government, industry, and NGO partners to assist in a number of critical areas. Since the start of the pandemic, Honeywell has committed over US$3 million in Covid relief for India.
“Our newest initiative is the establishment of Covid critical care centers across five cities that will be equipped with beds, oxygen, personal protective equipment kits, and basic medical infrastructure. Honeywell will provide funding for our NGO partners to build these centers in consultation with state governments in Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Haryana, and Tamil Nadu. Honeywell will also fund the donation of over 1,000 oxygen concentrators and 10,000 N95 respirators to these facilities. In addition, Honeywell will donate 50 ventilators to government and private hospitals across the country. Last year, Honeywell donated over 9 million meals and over 12,000 hygiene kits to underprivileged communities.
“Honeywell has been working toward meeting critical healthcare needs in India throughout the pandemic, including adding N95 respirator production in Pune that can produce 2 million N95 face masks per month. We are currently working to supply our UOP OXYSIV™ molecular sieve adsorbents (essential components of medical oxygen concentrators) to the licensees of the Defence Research and Development Organisation and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–Indian Institute of Petroleum.
“We are also supporting our employees through this difficult time. We continue to offer them expanded insurance coverage, free Covid testing, and access to company-provided medical support and vaccinations, among other support services.
“Honeywell’s leaders are in continuous dialog with stakeholders in the U.S. and in India to see how we can continue to help during the ongoing crisis. Our hearts go out to all of those who are suffering, and we will make our best efforts to contribute toward a speedy recovery from the current situation.”
