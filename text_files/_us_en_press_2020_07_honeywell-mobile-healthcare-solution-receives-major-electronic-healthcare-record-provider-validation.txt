Honeywell Mobile Healthcare Solution Receives Major Electronic Healthcare Record Provider Validation
Honeywell Mobile Healthcare Solution Receives Major Electronic Healthcare Record Provider Validation
Multipurpose CT40 HC mobile computer for healthcare now approved for use with Cerner, Epic, Lawson applications
CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 20, 2020 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced its CT40 mobile computer for healthcare has been validated by three large electronic healthcare record (EHR) providers, giving hospital systems and healthcare providers another powerful tool for frontline medical workers to access patient data securely.
The mobile computer designed for the healthcare worker is now approved for use with Cerner’s CareAware Connect, Epic’s Rover and Lawson’s SCM Suite, allowing healthcare workers to view patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans and more right at their fingertips, reducing medical errors and providing better care.
“Mobile solutions are revolutionizing patient care and driving efficiencies across all areas of healthcare,” said Kevin Dehoff, president of Honeywell’s Productivity Products business. “Validations from Cerner, Epic and Lawson, now available for integration in the CT40 HC, give nurses and other mobile equipped clinicians access to the patient information at the right time, allowing for faster response times, better collaboration with team members and overall patient satisfaction.”
A recent Honeywell study conducted by HIMSS revealed data security and integration with EHR software as two of the most important factors when vetting a mobile communication solution for clinical use.
Designed with the highly-mobile worker in mind, the CT40 mobile computer for healthcare is certified for the FIPS 140-2 Level 1 security requirements to protect patient data – the highest level of data security in its class. The disinfectant-ready housing and connectors on the device are specifically designed to withstand frequent exposure to healthcare-approved cleaning solutions.
The CT40 HC also includes Honeywell’s 2D imager that quickly and accurately reads 1D and 2D barcodes on virtually any medium – vials, syringes, IV bags, patient wristbands and more. The 13-megapixel color camera lets mobile workers document in electronic health records or digital patient chart.
Healthcare workers can connect the mobile computer to a display dock, quickly creating a mobile workstation to help update patient records. This can help hospital systems and providers eliminate the cost of purchasing separate PCs for the same task.
The CT40 HC can download apps through the Honeywell Marketplace including Honeywell Smart Talk, a unified communications solution giving instant access to staff in the hospital and healthcare provider ecosystem, reducing staff travel time and supporting social distancing protocols during this ever-changing environment.
The device can also be connected to the Honeywell Operational Intelligence asset management platform, giving medical facilities a digital platform to monitor IT assets while helping to enforce new health and safety procedures due to rapidly evolving guidelines. The cloud-based solution enables deeper insights into your clinical workforce – including basic device usage tracking to detecting potential abuse of company assets – so healthcare organizations can maximize the value and longevity of your device lifecycle and keep your staff focused on their patients.
New features allow medical providers to support on-site social distancing protocols, help enforce customizable device cleaning procedures and deploy software to digitally identify who has handled each device.
The Android Enterprise-recommended device is built on Honeywell’s Mobility Edge platform, a unified hardware and software architecture with an integrated software toolset that extends asset life, accelerates deployment and simplifies management of mobility solutions. Mobility Edge enables IT departments to reuse their investment in solution development and software certification across multiple computer form factors.

The Enterprise Mobile Device Solutions survey was conducted in March 2020 in collaboration with HIMSS Media, an independent third-party research firm not affiliated with Honeywell or its business groups. The 102 qualified U.S.-based respondents are employed in hospitals, health systems and outpatient practices and work in IT/Tech, informatics and clinical roles.
