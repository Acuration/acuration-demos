Meet a #futureshaper: Christie Newsome
She's an engineer ... who took a marketing job
August 20, 2019
Christie Newsome always knew she would be a leader.
“I enjoy building technical teams, helping people break down large problems into manageable pieces and supporting individuals in their career development,” said Christie, director of engineering.
Her team turns warehouses and distribution centers into efficient, automated places.
Based in West Chester, Ohio; here is her #futureshaper story.
What do you do?
I lead a team of engineers and project managers who are responsible for providing aftermarket engineered solutions for our customers in the warehouse and distribution space as well as automated material handling equipment such as palletizers and robotics.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day?
Working with my team to understand and address the short and long-term challenges of product development and project execution. I like to focus on the people, our processes and our products to drive efficiencies that increase our ability to be fast and nimble when engineering aftermarket solutions for our customers.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell?
You can be anything you want to be, do anything you want to do, anywhere you want to do it!
How has Honeywell changed since you began working here?
I see a greater focus on data capture and how we use that data to help our customers and their employees make faster and smarter decisions whether it is related to safety, quality, productivity or cost.
Why is the future important?
Very simple – I have children and my children will have children. We are all responsible for making our lives and the environment a little more enriched whether that is through health, wealth, sustainability, simplicity or longevity. A #futureshaper does exactly that!
How does your job make tomorrow better/safer than today?
My team supports the fast and accurate delivery of product via material handling within a distribution center. In some cases, we are supporting the need for “I want it as fast as I can get it” gratification, but in others, we are putting life-saving supplies in the hands of people who need it. I always like to think of our projects in those terms where speed and accuracy are imperative.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper should have?
A futureshaper must believe they have the ability to influence and mold the future. They must have a curiosity to understand the root of today’s problems so they can inspire and innovate tomorrow’s solutions.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
Same-Day Delivery will become Standard Delivery.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Be the master of your own career… make sure you align yourself with a dynamic mentor. Challenge the norm. Don’t be afraid to take a left turn on your career path and step outside of your comfort zone. I took a 2-year assignment in Marketing – it was tough, I had to think differently, change the way I processed information, change the way I interacted with people. I had to choose to be an extrovert when I am an introvert by nature, but I believe I am a much better engineering leader because of it.
What do you for fun?
I am learning how to do archery on horseback.
