Honeywell Lyric and Controller Home Security System Compatible With Apple's HomeKit
Honeywell Lyric and Controller Home Security System Compatible With Apple's HomeKit
December 7, 2017
ATLANTA, Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON), a leading Connected Home solutions provider, announced that its Lyric Controller Home Security System is now certified for use with Apple HomeKit. Honeywell's offering is the first professionally installed and monitored security system to support Apple's smart home platform, which enables homeowners to control their Lyric Controller security system with the Apple Home app or by simply asking Siri.
"Smart home technology has made consumers more reliant on their mobile devices to manage their homes," said Scott Harkins, vice president and general manager of Connected Home, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. "The addition of HomeKit support to the Lyric Controller improves the connected home experience for consumers, and provides new opportunities for dealers. Dealers can leverage the Apple ecosystem of HomeKit partners to expand their connected home offerings and deliver a robust interface to manage the home."
The free software update, which is available to both current and future Lyric Controller consumers, allows even more consumers the opportunity to connect the Lyric security system without interrupting their current connected home platform of choice. HomeKit provides an easy way to control your home's lights, doors, thermostats and more from your iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch® using the Apple Home app or Siri. In addition, the Lyric Controller integration with HomeKit allows the system to respond to voice commands based on personalized presets and automate scenes for energy saving, comfort and security. Lyric Controller users can access their security systems using native authentication on iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, including Touch ID and Face ID on iPhone X.
The Honeywell Lyric Controller, with its 7-inch touchscreen and built-in camera, serves as the central hub for arming and disarming the system. If a Lyric sensor, such as a door/window or motion detector, detects an unusual situation, the controller will provide visual and audible notification. With pro-monitored security service, the central station can quickly contact first responders. In addition, through HomeKit other local actions can also be triggered, such as lighting, locks and temperature controls.
The Lyric Controller Home Security System is the latest in a line of reliable Honeywell smart home solutions with the power of connected to HomeKit. Honeywell's Lyric T-Series and Lyric Round thermostats also work with HomeKit. For more information on the Lyric Controller Home Security System, please visit https://yourhome.honeywell.com.
