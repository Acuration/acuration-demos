Remembering Gen. Raymond Odierno, Honeywell Board Member
Remembering Gen. Raymond Odierno, Honeywell Board Member
October 12, 2021
In February 2020, retired four-star U.S. Army Gen. Raymond (“Ray”) T. Odierno was elected to join Honeywell’s Board of Directors after an illustrious military career. He brought deep insights to our Board across a wide range of areas that were very relevant to Honeywell such as international and geopolitical relations, communications, technology, and cybersecurity. We were greatly saddened to learn over this weekend that Gen. Odierno passed away at the age of 67.
Gen. Odierno was a visionary and inspiring leader, both on the battlefield and in our Boardroom. During his short time on our Board, his ability – shaped by his experiences in the military – to assess constantly changing circumstances and respond strategically was invaluable in helping our company navigate the challenges brought about by the pandemic. He was an excellent leader and outstanding colleague who treated everybody around him with respect and was universally revered by all who worked with him.
Gen. Odierno’s wise counsel and enduring spirit will be missed by all of us who had the good fortune to know him. We extend our sincere condolences to his family.
