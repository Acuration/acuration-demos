Meet a #futureshaper: Subhadeep Pal
In today’s world, pilots and passengers must stay connected at all times, said Subhadeep Pal director of engineering.
Satellite Communications (SATCOM) technology makes that possible.
Pilots can send and receive important information throughout a flight.
Meanwhile, passengers can connect to friends and relatives on the ground or watch entertainment content through the internet.
Subhadeep’s team helps make that possible.
Based in Bangalore, India; here is his futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
As a child, I was fascinated by UFOs and had a strong urge to be involved in Ufology (studies related to UFOs). While we did not have access to internet then, I used to go to our local library and read a lot of books available on the subject.
What brought you to Honeywell?
Fresh out of college, I wanted to get hands-on knowledge, and I knew Honeywell was a big name. I considered myself lucky when I joined the Aerospace business.
Over the years, I have grown to respect Honeywell for all the values that it has stood for. I have continued to be motivated by the leadership, fueled by the knowledge and capability of my fellow workers and inspired by the passion and commitment across the organization.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
Honeywell provides us with tons of opportunities to learn every day. There has been hardly a day that I have been at work and not learnt something new. That and the opportunity to work with highly talented colleagues.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
Urban Air Mobility will be common in the near future. Air taxis for intra-city and inter-city commutes will reduce congestion and will be extremely widespread. Cloud technologies, widespread artificial intelligence and constantly updated data will enable autonomous decision-making across interconnected systems possible. I expect Honeywell connectivity enablers will have a key role to play in this.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
A #futureshaper is innovative and a creative thinker. Self-motivated and passionate about the work they do as well as a self-starter and with a strategic vision.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Focus on learning something new every day. Be open and transparent. Think out of the box, ideate, continuously drive change and not be content with what is being asked of us. We are engineers, we invent and engineer new products, that is what we should do.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I travel a lot. I love experiencing new places and exploring the culture and food. Other hobbies include pub trivia - participating and organizing and playing board games with my daughter. I have also taken recently to drink mixing.
