Enjoy Customized Home Security With The New Honeywell Lyric C2 Wi-Fi Security Camera
Enjoy Customized Home Security With The New Honeywell Lyric C2 Wi-Fi Security Camera
September 12, 2017
ATLANTA, Sept. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The newest connected home product from Honeywell (NYSE: HON) allows consumers to help feel as though they are in two places at once. The Honeywell Lyric' C2 Wi-Fi Security Camera offers DIY (do it yourself) awareness, enhancing many features found on the C1 camera – most notably sound and motion detection, and added video capabilities.
The new C2 camera can detect the sounds from many smoke or carbon monoxide alarms and can identify the sound of a baby crying. When the C2 camera senses motion or detects a sound in up to four customizable detection zones, it will send a notification to your phone or tablet. Consumers also can adjust the audio detection sensitivity levels and set exclusion zones, such as in a room with a ceiling fan. The camera also has a two-way talk feature.
The C2 camera is outfitted with a flexible design that enables secure wall or ceiling mounting, or even tabletop placement. Like the C1 camera, the C2 captures footage of the seconds leading up to and after an event, which is bolstered by the C2's ultra wide angle lens (145 degrees), night vision, and Full HD 1080p quality with 6x digital zoom. The added clarity allows consumers to see what caused a situation or to more clearly identify a home intruder.
Wired power and 256-bit encrypted local storage ensure the C2 camera can keep recording, even if your Wi-Fi goes out. An 8 GB SD card is included, and the camera can also accommodate SD cards up to 64GB. Through the Lyric app, consumers can stream and download the last 24 hours of clips from their C2 camera with free cloud storage. Consumers will soon be able to add the C2 camera into a professionally monitored, Connected Home security system for added peace of mind, a feature already available for the C1 camera. The upgrade to professional security is possible by contacting a local security dealer.*
The Lyric C2 Wi-Fi Security Camera is available now (MSRP $169.99) at https://shophome.honeywell.com and at The Home Depot. Both the C2 and C1 cameras are compatible with other upcoming products in Honeywell's connected home portfolio. To learn more about Honeywell's family of products and updates for homes, including thermostats, water leak and freeze detectors, security and control systems, and more, please visit https://yourhome.honeywell.com.
* Professional security installation and system monitoring subject to additional fees, which can vary by local security provider.
