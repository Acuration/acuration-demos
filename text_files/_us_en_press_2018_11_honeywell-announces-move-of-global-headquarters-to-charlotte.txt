Honeywell Announces Move Of Global Headquarters To Charlotte
Honeywell Announces Move Of Global Headquarters To Charlotte
November 30, 2018
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Nov. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced it will relocate its global corporate headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, a business- and family-friendly city close to several of Honeywell's businesses in the Southeast United States. Honeywell also announced it will relocate the headquarters of its Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS) business group from Fort Mill, South Carolina, to Charlotte. The final decision is subject to the recently passed North Carolina Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) legislation becoming law and the final award of state and local incentives, which the company expects to be completed early next week.
As part of the move, about 150 to 200 New Jersey-based senior management positions and about 100 South Carolina-based positions will relocate to Charlotte between now and September 2019. The company envisions gradually adding about 500 Honeywell corporate and SPS positions to the Charlotte location over the next five years, bringing total employment there to about 750 by the end of 2024. Any corporate roles that will be added in Charlotte will come from multiple locations, not just New Jersey.
"Today's announcement reflects our commitment to locate our corporate headquarters close to our large centers in Charlotte alongside Safety and Productivity Solutions, and Atlanta, where our Honeywell Building Technologies and Honeywell Connected Enterprise businesses are located. Charlotte is a top-10 destination city in the U.S. that will readily enable us to recruit and retain the world-class talent we will need over the long term to support Honeywell's strategic focus on leading technology and software solutions within our end markets," said Darius Adamczyk, Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer. "We also are strong believers in supporting our communities, and we look forward to bringing Honeywell Hometown Solutions &endash; our award-winning corporate citizenship initiative &endash; to the Charlotte area.
"Our decision does not reflect any issues with the quality of our experience in New Jersey," Adamczyk added. "We value the strong relationship that we have built with the state of New Jersey and with Governor Murphy. New Jersey will remain a substantial employment center for us."
Approximately 1,000 Honeywell employees will remain in New Jersey across the company's six locations in the state, including about 800 employees at Honeywell's offices in Morris Plains. Fort Mill will also continue to be a significant employment center for Honeywell.
