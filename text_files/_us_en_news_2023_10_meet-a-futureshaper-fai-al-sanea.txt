Meet A #Futureshaper: Fai Al Sanea
Meet A #Futureshaper: Fai Al Sanea
Fai is a lead engineer implementing software to advance autonomous operations and help industrial companies manage their emissions.
Fai Al Sanea is a lead engineer using her passion for the environment to help industrial operations advance and become more resilient -- no matter where they're at in their sustainability journey.
Based in Saudi Arabia, here's her Futureshaper story.
Much of your work deals with industrial operations. What should people know about emissions management?
An important step toward decarbonizing the industry is getting the basics right. That means reducing emissions in current operations, then working to design future operations.
Data is critical -- businesses can only manage and reduce what they can monitor and measure.
What does being a Futureshaper mean to you?
I am determined to lead by example and inspire others to join me in making a difference by creating technologies to ensure a better future for the next generations.
Meet other Futureshapers who are innovating to make our world smarter, safer and more sustainable.
