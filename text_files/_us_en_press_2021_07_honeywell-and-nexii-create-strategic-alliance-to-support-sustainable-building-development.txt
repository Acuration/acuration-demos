Honeywell And Nexii Create Strategic Alliance To Support Sustainable Building Development
Honeywell And Nexii Create Strategic Alliance To Support Sustainable Building Development
Honeywell to be exclusive building technologies supplier for Nexii construction projects
July 15, 2021
ATLANTA, July 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) and Nexii Building Solutions Inc. (Nexii) today announced the creation of a strategic alliance to further the development of buildings with a reduced environmental impact. This alliance names Honeywell as the exclusive building technologies supplier for new buildings constructed by Nexii, providing products that offer energy savings and operational efficiencies.
The companies will integrate Nexii expertise in high-performance and efficient building systems with the Honeywell Small and Medium Building Administrator powered by Honeywell Forge, an affordable and scalable building portfolio management system designed specifically for small- to medium-sized buildings. The Honeywell Small and Medium Building Administrator can save users up to 30% in facility energy costs,1 improve visibility into building portfolio performance, and help facility managers optimize occupant comfort, operational performance and safer asset management. Honeywell will also provide its industry-leading fire and security systems to support Nexii-constructed buildings.
"Continuing to find ways to creatively reduce the impact that buildings have on the environment is incredibly important and Nexii is doing just that," said Doug Wright, president and CEO, Honeywell Building Technologies. "This alliance brings together our decades of building automation experience with Nexii's novel construction techniques. This combination of experience and innovation will allow us to help customers address environmental challenges and meet sustainability goals by reducing aspects of buildings' environmental impacts – from construction to day-to-day operations."
More than 90% of the U.S. commercial building stock consists of properties under 50,000 square feet, and most of these buildings lack a proper building management system (BMS) to manage energy usage.2 Unlike competitive products that are either traditional BMS solutions built for large-scale, complex buildings or simple heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control systems designed for smaller scale use, the Honeywell Small and Medium Building Administrator enables multi-site businesses to drive smarter building operations and meet compliance requirements.
"We are excited to work with Honeywell to further our mission of lowering the environmental footprints of the buildings we deliver to our clients," Stephen Sidwell, co-founder and CEO, Nexii. "Adding Honeywell's expertise at saving energy through its powerful building management system as well as improving responses in the case of emergency with its fire and security products will enhance the value proposition for Nexii customers. Now, we can increase speed of delivery with a construction process that is less damaging to the environment while also providing systems that drive the building's ongoing energy efficiency and safety after completion."
Nexii's high-performance green building products are precision manufactured in plants to project specifications using 3D software. This allows Nexii panels to be able to fit together like jigsaw pieces onsite, accelerating standard build times by 50%-75%.3 This process – where Nexii products are manufactured offsite and assembled onsite – enables Nexii to eliminate significant construction waste. Nexii's breakthrough materials and building processes allow for higher energy savings, near-zero construction waste, and substantially less climate impact than a traditional concrete building.
Recent Nexii projects include a first-of-its-kind Starbucks café built using Nexii's revolutionary construction technology located in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, developed to support Starbucks Canada's aspiration to operate more eco-friendly stores under its global sustainability strategy. Also in Abbotsford, a new Popeyes restaurant was constructed using Nexii's building system. Nexii anticipates that its technology will also reduce both the Starbucks café's and Popeyes restaurant's operational building carbon emissions by approximately 30% compared to traditionally constructed buildings.
Honeywell recently committed to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations and facilities by 2035. This commitment builds on the company's track record of sharply reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of its operations and facilities as well as its decades-long history of innovation to help its customers meet their environmental and social goals. About half of Honeywell's new product introduction research and development investment is directed toward products that improve environmental and social outcomes for customers.
