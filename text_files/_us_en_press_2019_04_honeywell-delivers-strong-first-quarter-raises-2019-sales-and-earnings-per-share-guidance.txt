Honeywell Delivers Strong First Quarter; Raises 2019 Sales and Earnings Per Share Guidance
Honeywell Delivers Strong First Quarter; Raises 2019 Sales and Earnings Per Share Guidance
April 18, 2019
Earnings per Share of $1.92, up 2%, up 13% Ex-Spins1; Exceeding High End of Guidance by 7 Cents
Reported Sales Down 15% Due to Impact of Spin-Offs; Organic Sales up 8% Driven by Strength in Long-Cycle Businesses
Operating Income Margin up 190 Basis Points to 18.5%, Segment Margin up 120 Basis Points to 20.4%
Operating Cash Flow of $1.1 Billion; Adjusted Free Cash Flow2 of $1.2 Billion, Conversion 82% vs. 68% in First Quarter 2018
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., April 18, 2019 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2019 and raised its full-year sales and earnings per share guidance.
“Honeywell delivered a very strong start to 2019 with first-quarter results that exceeded the high end of our sales and earnings guidance. Organic sales grew 8% led by our long-cycle businesses in commercial aerospace, defense, and warehouse and process automation, and strong demand for commercial fire and security products. Our robust sales growth, supported by winning positions in attractive end markets and the continuous improvements we are making across our supply chain, drove earnings per share of $1.92, seven cents above the high end of our first-quarter guidance and up 13%1 excluding the impact of the spin-offs.” said Darius Adamczyk, chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell. “Segment margin was above 20% for the second quarter in a row with 120 basis points of segment margin expansion year-over-year driven by the favorable impact of the spin-offs, increased sales volumes, and operational improvements. We also continued to make progress on cash, generating $1.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow2, with conversion of 82%, up 14 percentage points year-over-year, while repurchasing $750 million in Honeywell shares in the quarter. We remain on a path to 95% to 100% conversion for the full year.”
Adamczyk continued, “As a result of our first-quarter performance and our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareowners, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance to a new range of $7.90 to $8.15, and organic sales guidance to a new range of 3% to 6%.” A summary of the company’s full-year guidance changes can be found in Table 1.
“We are very pleased with the start to 2019. Organic sales growth was strong in all of our segments this quarter. Our long-cycle backlog increased more than 10%, and our investments in new product development and commercial excellence are delivering results, while positioning the company for short- and long-term success,” Adamczyk concluded.
First-Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the first quarter were down 15% on a reported basis and up 8% on an organic basis. The difference between reported and organic sales primarily relates to the spin-offs of the Transportation Systems business (formerly in Aerospace) and the Homes and ADI Global Distribution business (formerly in Honeywell Building Technologies) as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. First-quarter reported earnings per share was $1.92. The first-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.
Aerospace sales for the first quarter were up 10% on an organic basis driven by robust demand from business aviation original equipment manufacturers, continued strength in the U.S. and international defense business, and growth in the commercial aviation aftermarket. Segment margin expanded 260 basis points to 25.1%, primarily driven by commercial excellence and the favorable impact from the spin-off of the Transportation Systems business.
Honeywell Building Technologies sales for the first quarter were up 9% on an organic basis driven by strong demand for commercial fire and security offerings, and global building projects growth. Segment margin expanded 240 basis points to 19.5%, primarily driven by the favorable impact from the spin-off of the Homes and ADI Global Distribution business, partially offset by stranded cost impacts related to the spin, which the company intends to eliminate by the end of 2019 as planned, and unfavorable mix.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the first quarter were up 5% on an organic basis driven by broad-based growth in automation projects and maintenance and migration services in Process Solutions, as well as continued demand for fluorine products. Segment margin expanded 140 basis points to 21.9%, primarily driven by higher sales volumes and commercial excellence.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the first quarter were up 10% on an organic basis driven by continued double-digit sales growth in the Intelligrated warehouse automation business, robust demand in sensing and IoT, and strong demand across China. Segment margin contracted 260 basis points to 13.4%, primarily driven by lower sales volumes in productivity products, impact of inflation, and unfavorable mix due to higher sales in Intelligrated, partially offset by commercial excellence.

This release contains certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that we or our management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon certain assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. The forward-looking statements included in this release are also subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services and prices. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward-looking statements. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This release contains financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Honeywell’s non-GAAP financial measures used in this release are as follows: segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, a measure by which we assess operating performance, which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in the Appendix; segment margin, on an overall Honeywell basis, which we define as segment profit divided by sales and which we adjust to exclude sales and segment profit contribution from Resideo and Garrett in 2018, if and as noted in the release; organic sales growth, which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation, and acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following transaction date; adjusted free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and which we adjust to exclude the impact of separation costs related to the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett, if and as noted in the release; adjusted free cash flow conversion, which we define as adjusted free cash flow divided by net income attributable to Honeywell, excluding pension mark-to-market expenses, separation costs related to the spin-offs, and adjustments to the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge, if and as noted in the release; and adjusted earnings per share, which we adjust to exclude pension mark-to-market expenses, as well as for other components, such as separation costs related to the spin-offs, adjustments to the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge, and after-tax segment profit contribution from Resideo and Garrett in the periods noted in the release, net of spin indemnification impacts assuming both indemnification agreements were effective in such periods, if and as noted in the release. The respective tax rates applied when adjusting earnings per share for these items are identified in the release or in the reconciliations presented in the Appendix. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Refer to the Appendix attached to this release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
[1] Adjusted EPS V% ex-spins excludes 1Q18 after-tax separation costs related to the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett and 1Q18 after-tax segment profit contribution from Resideo and Garrett, net of the spin indemnification impacts assuming both indemnification agreements were effective in 1Q18.
[2] Adjusted free cash flow and associated conversion exclude impacts from separation costs related to the spin-offs of $165M in 1Q19 and $10M in 1Q18. Associated conversion for 1Q18 also excludes after-tax separation costs related to the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett.

Also excludes the 2018 after-tax segment profit contribution from the spin-offs, net of spin indemnification impacts assuming both indemnification agreements were effective for all of 2018, of $0.62.
