VESDA-E VES Smoke Detectors from Honeywell Introduce Advanced Zoning to Improve Threat Identification and Reduce Losses
VESDA-E VES Smoke Detectors from Honeywell Introduce Advanced Zoning to Improve Threat Identification and Reduce Losses
VESDA-E VES delivers sector addressability to enable large protected areas to be divided into four separate zones for improved smoke detection and response. Aspirating smoke detectors minimize downtime and reduce total cost of ownership for end users.
August 27, 2019
ATLANTA, August 27, 2019 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today launched its VESDA®-E VES aspirating smoke detectors. As part of the VESDA-E line of advanced smoke detection technology, VESDA-E VES aspirating smoke detectors allow users to divide protected areas into four distinct sectors to help ensure early detection and warning of a potential threat. The detectors also help reduce total cost of ownership by decreasing installation, commissioning and operating expenses.
The VESDA-E VES sector addressability provides individually configurable alarm levels for each of the four sectors, reducing the search path for early warning events to deliver optimum protection in highly secure environments or areas with clear zones. The new intuitive LCD display provides instant status reporting and allows real time event tracking.
“Downtime in data centers can cost businesses significant revenue losses,” said Raj Kappali, general manager, global advanced fire detection, Honeywell Building Technologies. “Built on the latest advanced detection technology and years of application experience, VESDA-E VES leverages the latest detection technology to provide early detection of a potential threat and allow immediate and targeted response. This is exactly what a smart building fire detection system looks like.”
VESDA-E VES offers reliable, very early warning and higher detection stability over a wider range of environments through its Flair Detection Technology. The patented Flair Detection Technology employs the latest laser-based light scattering combined with CMOS image analysis to provide best-in-class very early warning and nuisance alarm rejection. It also helps to quickly detect and locate the specific source of smoke.
VESDA-E VES detectors offer Ethernet and Wi-Fi connectivity with Xtralis software for configuration, secondary monitoring and maintenance. Additionally, the longer pipe runs of VESDA-E VES allow convenient detector mounting for accessible and reduced maintenance costs.
VESDA-E VES is compatible with existing installations within the VESDA portfolio, which Honeywell acquired from Xtralis in 2016. Xtralis is a stand-alone business within Honeywell catering to the needs of customers across the value chain. From advanced fire protection solutions to smarter security capabilities, Honeywell helps owners and operators leverage building connectivity to simplify management of increasingly complex building environments and improve occupant safety.
Honeywell’s portfolio consists of trusted and well-known brands in the life safety industry; each designed to be easy to use, install and maintain – even in the most demanding and critical environments. Among the most widely used fire panels in commercial buildings, NOTIFIER and Gamewell-FCI customers can now maximize their protection capabilities with VESDA-E technology.
VESDA-E VES is compliant with all current regulations with multiple security elements in place to prevent tampering. For more information on VESDA-E VES technology and Honeywell’s various security and fire solutions, click here.
