Spotlight: Ivvette Hofrichter
Ivvette leads an international team of engineers responsible for product and technology reliability, maintainability and safety.
September 29, 2019
Off work, she kicks safety into high gear, teaching and training in Krav Maga, an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) self-defense system derived from boxing, wrestling, aikido, judo and karate, along with realistic fight training.
Here’s what she said about aligning  precision, safety and learning:
How did you get started in your role?
My membership with Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and attendance at one of the SWE conferences brought my resume to the attention of Honeywell managers. They thought my math background would be a good fit for statistical analysis. When I first started with Honeywell, I did reliability analysis for pneumatic valves and air turbine starters.  My manager offered me the tools, training and opportunity to move into roles of increasing responsibility.
Now, seven years later, I am the manager of the group I started across six international sites. I have continued my professional involvement with industry organizations, currently as a member of the Society of Hispanic and Professional Engineers (SHPE).
What makes your work at Honeywell unique?
Many companies do safety analyses and risk assessments on their products, however Honeywell allows me to assess the safety and risks associated with complex aerospace systems such as environmental control systems, missiles systems and nitrogen generating systems. It’s important that my team contributes to designing safe aircraft systems so that people can fly safely and comfortably.
The coolest project I’ve worked on was on a military fighter jet engine.
How does being a global company impact your work?
Every day I get to work with a highly diverse group of people around the world. My direct team encompasses three different countries (India, Canada and the U.S.). The diversity of Honeywell is integral to our culture. It helps us think outside the box, affording new perspectives and a different way of looking at problems.
What is the most compelling reason people should come to Honeywell for their careers?
Honeywell is a large global company with many available opportunities to help you discover your true passion. Whether you want to follow a highly technical track or learn how to run a business, Honeywell can provide that opportunity. I’ve found that learning never stops. I tell new hires, “Learn as much as you can, keep an open mind and don’t be afraid to take risks in your career.”
What would you predict as the future of your industry?
Commercial aviation is a quickly evolving industry that will soon morph into an on-demand service (i.e. air mobility). In this uncharted territory, companies will be forced to define what safety means for new aerial vehicles in an urban space while regulatory bodies, such as the FAA, race to catch up in defining new safety criteria.
