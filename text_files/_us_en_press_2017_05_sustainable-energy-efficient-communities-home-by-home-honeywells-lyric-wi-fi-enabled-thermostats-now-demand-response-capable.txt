Sustainable, Energy-Efficient Communities, Home-by-Home: Honeywell's Lyric Wi-Fi-enabled Thermostats Now Demand Response-Capable
Sustainable, Energy-Efficient Communities, Home-by-Home: Honeywell's Lyric Wi-Fi-enabled Thermostats Now Demand Response-Capable
May 11, 2017
ATLANTA, May 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A leader in home comfort and security, Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is giving consumers across the U.S. more ways to help manage their home energy use, maintain a lower carbon footprint, and create more sustainable and efficient communities.
Honeywell's full suite of Lyric™ Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats (Lyric Round, Lyric T5, and Lyric T6 Pro), are starting to be included in opt-in demand response programs with select energy and utilities providers nationwide, including those in California, New York, Texas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Arizona, and Rhode Island.
Demand response programs are used by energy providers to avoid brownouts or blackouts during summer months when energy use exceeds their ability to deliver it to the consumer. Regional providers will be announced throughout 2017, giving consumers more convenience to maximize comfort and potential savings1 in their own connected homes.
When enrolled in a demand response program, consumers are able to conserve energy at home, while also help manage energy consumption across the larger, local area in which they live. During peak usage periods, such as when more home cooling or heating systems are running, the local energy and utilities provider can make slight adjustments to the temperature in participating homes to more efficiently use the community's available power. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has reported that residential consumers participating in a demand response program could save 100 kilowatt hours on average annually2.
Consumers with Honeywell's Wi-Fi-enabled Lyric and TCC (Total Connect Comfort) thermostats are already able to use their cooling and heating systems efficiently through connected home features like app-controlled scheduling, geofencing to sense when someone is home or away, and other convenient settings. With the addition of demand response capabilities, those thermostats can further extend benefits from a single home to the larger community.
Consumers can connect with their local utilities and energy provider to find out if demand response is available in their area, and is compatible with their Honeywell thermostat; rebates on new Honeywell thermostats may also be available.
