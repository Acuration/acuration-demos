The Future Is... Back to School
The Future Is... Back to School
Our experts explain how technology will help students return to classrooms.
Last spring, students had to abruptly switch to online learning when the coronavirus pandemic swept the United States and around the world.
As the fall and a new school year approach, universities and K-12 schools are looking at upgrading their infrastructure to encourage social distancing and help clean the air.
In fact, about one in four campuses plan to have in-person classes, according to The College Crisis Initiative.
"There's a technical angle to this - which is how do you actually sanitize the air and clean the facilities?" said Jeff Kimbell, chief commercial officer for Honeywell.  "But then there's also a reassurance angle and communications angle to it as well."
Patrick Hogan, chief commercial officer of Honeywell Building Technologies, said that technologies can help make it safer for students to return to campus. For example, upgrades to a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system can help clean air or ultraviolet-C (UV-C) lighting can help clean surfaces.
