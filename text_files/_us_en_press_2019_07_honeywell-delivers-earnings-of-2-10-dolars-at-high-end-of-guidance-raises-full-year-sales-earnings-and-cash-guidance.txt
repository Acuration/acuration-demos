Honeywell Delivers Earnings Of $2.10, at High End of Guidance; Raises Full-Year Sales, Earnings, and Cash Guidance
Honeywell Delivers Earnings Of $2.10, at High End of Guidance; Raises Full-Year Sales, Earnings, and Cash Guidance
July 17, 2019
Reported Sales Down 15% Due to Impact of Spin-Offs; Organic Sales up 5% Driven by Commercial Aerospace, Defense, Process Automation, and Building Technologies
Operating Income Margin up 280 Basis Points to 19.1%; Segment Margin up 170 Basis Points to 21.3
Operating Cash Flow of $1.7 Billion; Adjusted Free Cash Flow[1] of $1.5 Billion, Conversion 100%
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., July 18, 2019 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2019 and raised its full-year organic sales, earnings per share, and adjusted free cash flow guidance.
“Honeywell delivered another strong quarter of top-line growth, margin expansion, and adjusted free cash flow. Organic sales grew 5% led by our long-cycle businesses including U.S. and international defense, business and general aviation, and oil and gas. Our long-cycle backlog was up over 10%, which positions us well for the second half of 2019. We also saw robust demand in our short-cycle commercial fire, process automation services and software, and aerospace aftermarket businesses. Segment margin expanded 170 basis points year-over-year, which was 30 basis points above the high end of our guidance. We delivered earnings per share of $2.10, which was up 9%[2] adjusted, excluding the impact of the spin-offs, and at the high end of our second-quarter guidance,” said Darius Adamczyk, chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell. “In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.9 billion in Honeywell shares and generated $1.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow1, with conversion of 100%. We remain on a path to deliver approximately 100% conversion for the full year.”
Adamczyk continued, “We are making significant progress in transforming Honeywell into a premier software-industrial company, with connected software sales continuing to grow at a double-digit rate organically. The Honeywell Connected Enterprise foundation is firmly in place, supported by the launch of Honeywell Forge, a comprehensive IIoT software solution. Our digitization and supply chain transformation initiatives are underway, which will enhance our commercial efforts and drive continued segment margin expansion. We are pleased with our progress to date.
“Given our first-half performance and our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareowners even in an uncertain environment, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance by 5 cents to a new range of $7.95 to $8.15, and raising our organic sales guidance to a new range of 4% to 6%,” Adamczyk concluded.
A summary of the company’s full-year guidance changes can be found in Table 1.
Second-Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the second quarter were down 15% on a reported basis and up 5% on an organic basis. The difference between reported and organic sales primarily relates to the spin-offs of the Transportation Systems business (formerly in Aerospace) and the Homes and ADI Global Distribution business (formerly in Honeywell Building Technologies) as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The second-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.
Aerospace sales for the second quarter were up 11% on an organic basis driven by double-digit growth in business aviation original equipment; continued strength in the U.S. and international Defense and Space business, which grew 20% organically; and commercial aftermarket demand across air transport and business aviation. Segment margin expanded 330 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by commercial excellence, higher organic sales volumes, and the favorable impact from the spin-off of the Transportation Systems business in 2018.
Honeywell Building Technologies sales for the second quarter were up 5% on an organic basis driven by ongoing strength in commercial fire products and building management software, and global building solutions projects growth. Segment margin expanded 390 basis points to 20.7% driven by the favorable impact from the spin-off of the Homes and ADI Global Distribution business in 2018.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the second quarter were up 4% on an organic basis driven by short-cycle demand in Process Solutions; strong licensing, engineering, and refining catalyst sales growth in UOP; and demand for Solstice® low global warming products in Advanced Materials. Segment margin expanded 140 basis points to 23.5%, primarily driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the second quarter were down 4% on an organic basis driven by lower sales volumes in productivity products due to inventory destocking and fewer large project rollouts, partially offset by demand for gas sensing and detection, and Intelligrated aftermarket and voice solutions growth. Segment margin contracted 420 basis points to 12.3%, primarily driven by lower sales volumes in productivity products and higher sales of lower margin products.

This release contains certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that we or our management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon certain assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. The forward-looking statements included in this release are also subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services and prices. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward-looking statements. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This release contains financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Honeywell’s non-GAAP financial measures used in this release are as follows: segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, a measure by which we assess operating performance, which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in the Appendix; segment margin, on an overall Honeywell basis, which we define as segment profit divided by sales and which we adjust to exclude sales and segment profit contribution from Resideo and Garrett in 2018, if and as noted in the release; organic sales growth, which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation, and acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following transaction date; adjusted free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and which we adjust to exclude the impact of separation costs related to the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett, if and as noted in the release; adjusted free cash flow conversion, which we define as adjusted free cash flow divided by net income attributable to Honeywell, excluding separation costs related to the spin-offs, and adjustments to the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge, if and as noted in the release; and adjusted earnings per share, which we adjust to exclude pension mark-to-market expenses, as well as for other components, such as separation costs related to the spin-offs, adjustments to the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge, and after-tax segment profit contribution from Resideo and Garrett in the periods noted in the release, net of spin indemnification impacts assuming both indemnification agreements were effective in such periods, if and as noted in the release. The respective tax rates applied when adjusting earnings per share for these items are identified in the release or in the reconciliations presented in the Appendix. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Refer to the Appendix attached to this release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

[2] Adjusted EPS V% ex-spins excludes 2Q18 after-tax separation costs related to the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett, the 2Q18 after-tax segment profit contribution from Resideo and Garrett, net of the spin indemnification impacts assuming both indemnification agreements were effective in 2Q18, and 2Q18 adjustments to the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge.
