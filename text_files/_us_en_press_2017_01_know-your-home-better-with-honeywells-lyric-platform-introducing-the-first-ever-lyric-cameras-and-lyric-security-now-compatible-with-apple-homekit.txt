Know Your Home Better With Honeywell's Lyric® Platform: Introducing The First-Ever Lyric Cameras, And Lyric Security Now Compatible With Apple HomeKit
Know Your Home Better With Honeywell's Lyric® Platform: Introducing The First-Ever Lyric Cameras, And Lyric Security Now Compatible With Apple HomeKit
January 5, 2017
LAS VEGAS, Jan. 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Opening even more doors into the smart, connected home, Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is keeping comfort, control, safety, and security top of mind at CES 2017. Created with DIY and pro installations in mind, Honeywell's Lyric' family of products and growing set of partners are ready to help people get to know their homes better.
Lyric C1 and C2 Wi-Fi Indoor Cameras
The new Lyric C1 and C2 Wi-Fi Indoor Cameras are the latest additions. DIY-ready, the Lyric cameras can help keep an eye on what's happening day or night, whether someone is home or away. The Lyric app provides access to livestreaming, recorded events, screenshots, and will send alerts when something is seen (or even heard and analyzed using the built-in microphone, such as a smoke/CO detector going off, or a crying baby). The Lyric C1 Camera captures HD, 30fps video with a 135-degree viewing angle, while the Lyric C2 Camera records in Full HD at 30fps and has a 138-degree viewing angle. A built-in speaker on both models makes two-way talk possible, whether it's speaking to someone in the room or telling a pet to get off the furniture.
Wired power means no batteries to check or change, and local storage – an 8GB SD card comes with every Lyric C1 and C2 Camera – ensures recording can happen even if the home Wi-Fi isn't working. Free cloud storage per day is also included, with 7- and 30-day upgrades available.
Able to smartly record seconds before an event happened (and even ignore something like a ceiling fan, thanks to two detection zones with the Lyric C1 Camera and four with the Lyric C2 Camera), the cameras can be turned on or off manually, or through geofencing via the location of someone's phone. Powerful, 256-bit end-to-end encryption captures and sends footage securely, and both cameras can integrate with professional, 24-7 security monitoring if preferred*. The Lyric C1 and C2 Wi-Fi Indoor Cameras will be available within the first three months of 2017.
Lyric Home Security and Control System With Apple® HomeKit'
Launched in 2016, the Lyric Home Security and Control System is now the first-ever pro-installed and pro-monitored security system to include Apple HomeKit** compatibility for control using voice with Siri, or the Apple Home app in iOS 10. The software upgrade – which will be available to both current and future Lyric Security consumers – expands Lyric Security's reach. Apple HomeKit technology provides an easy, secure way to control your home's lights, doors, thermostats and more from your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
The Lyric Security controller, with its 7-inch touchscreen and built-in camera, remains the hub for securely arming and disarming the system. If a Lyric sensor – such as a door/window or motion detector – detects an unusual situation, the controller will provide visual and audible notification, and on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. If you already have pro-monitored security service, the central station can quickly contact first responders. Apple HomeKit compatibility for the Lyric Home Security and Control System will be widely available within the first three months of 2017.
To learn more about the entire Lyric family of products and how Honeywell is shaping consumers' homes today and tomorrow, please visit the Honeywell booth (42118) at the CES Smart Home area (Sands, Level 2), from January 5-8, 2017. More information is also available at https://yourhome.honeywell.com.
* Professional monitoring subject to potential software updates and monitoring fees, which can vary depending on local provider.
** Apple HomeKit requires an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 8.1 or later. Remote access for HomeKit-enabled products requires an Apple TV (3rd generation or later) running Apple TV software 7.0 or later, and an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 8.1 or later.
