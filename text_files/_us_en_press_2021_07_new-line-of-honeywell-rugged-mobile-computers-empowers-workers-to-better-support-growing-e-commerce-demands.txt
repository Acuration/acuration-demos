New Line Of Honeywell Rugged, Mobile Computers Empowers Workers To Better Support Growing E-Commerce Demands
New Line Of Honeywell Rugged, Mobile Computers Empowers Workers To Better Support Growing E-Commerce Demands
CT45 mobile computers are all-purpose productivity tools ensuring reliable performance, data connectivity and communications for workers in retail, logistics and fieldwork
First rugged mobile computer device featuring Wi-Fi 6 communications and capable of software support through 2032
July 15, 2021
CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 15, 2021 -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) today announced its latest family of rugged enterprise mobile devices designed for workers that pick, pack, sort and deliver e-commerce orders to keep the retail supply chain moving smoothly from factory to consumer.
Honeywell’s CT45 and CT45XP mobile computers are rugged, all-purpose productivity tools enabling mobile workers to efficiently execute tasks and access to business-critical data. These handheld devices are used by workers throughout a changing retail supply chain – including logistics, warehousing, in-store retail and last-mile delivery – that play a critical role in e-commerce fulfillment.
“Retailers are investing in technology to implement new consumer shopping options like click-and-collect and curbside pickup while asking their employees to work smarter and more efficiently,” said Kevin Dehoff, president of Honeywell’s Productivity Solutions and Services business. “The combination of high customer expectations and a more digital-savvy workforce gives businesses the option to roll out these advanced mobile devices without the fear of a steep learning curve. We designed our CT45 to be the ultimate tool in the mobile workers toolbox to engage consumers and raise sales conversion while holding down costs.”
Shopping options like next-day home delivery, click and collect and curbside pickup have rapidly accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and retailers are pushing digital transformation strategies to keep up with demand. A recent Euromonitor International/National Retail Federation Survey revealed nearly three quarters of retail professionals said the pandemic accelerated their company’s digital transformation by at least a year and accelerated their company’s technology-related investments.
Built on the Honeywell Mobility Edge platform with the latest cutting-edge Qualcomm IoT mobile solutions, the CT45 offers a future-proof guarantee of continuous Android version support through AndroidTM 13, with a commitment of support through Android 14 and 15 if feasible. With the Honeywell Android Service, this ensures software patch support through 2032, enabling users to maximize the return on investment in their solution.
The CT45 XP is the first rugged handheld device in the industry featuring Wi-Fi 6 capability, allowing for faster, more reliable connections for multiple devices in crowded distribution centers, warehouses and retail stores.
Combined with Honeywell’s rich software ecosystem, including apps that can be downloaded through the Honeywell Marketplace, the CT45 family of devices gives businesses and mission-critical mobile workers the tools to make sure they can be successful in a hyper-competitive landscape.
