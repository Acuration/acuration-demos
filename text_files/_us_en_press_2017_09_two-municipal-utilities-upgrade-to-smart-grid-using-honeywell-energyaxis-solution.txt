Two Municipal Utilities Upgrade to Smart Grid Using Honeywell EnergyAxis® Solution
Two Municipal Utilities Upgrade to Smart Grid Using Honeywell EnergyAxis® Solution
September 28, 2017
ATLANTA, Sept. 27, 2017 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that it is providing Honeywell smart meters, software and communication networks that will enable two municipal utilities to upgrade from a traditional grid to smart grid infrastructure, allowing them to deliver enhanced reliability and service to their customers.
The municipal utilities that will use the Honeywell EnergyAxis® smart grid solution &endash; Hope, Arkansas, and Fayetteville, Tennessee &endash; will take a significant step toward becoming connected utilities by realizing the benefits of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) system, including reduced operating expenses, enhanced data analytics for better grid management and improved reliability. AMI systems also help utilities better serve customers through frequently updated billing data, greater convenience during move-in/move-outs and faster recovery from power outages.
“As a municipal utility, we have a responsibility to city leadership, constituents and taxpayers, as well as to our customers. We strive every day to provide the best and most reliable utility service possible, as well as applying practices and technology that help us manage operational costs,” said Steve Saum, general manager, Hope Water and Light Commission. “Our choice of Honeywell as a smart metering system provider was based on the superior capabilities of their solution, their ability to provide a technology platform that uses the MultiSpeak 4.1 Specification to interact with the products offered by National Information Solutions Cooperative (NISC), their smart grid experience and a thorough consideration of the alternatives.”
Britt Dye, CEO and general manager, Fayetteville Public Utilities, said, “Building on the legacy of innovation we established by becoming one of the first counties in Tennessee to bring electricity to its residents, we look forward to providing the benefits and performance of a smart grid to our customers throughout Lincoln County. Through its EnergyAxis solution, Honeywell has provided a comprehensive and unified AMI platform for electricity, water and gas that will support the ongoing delivery of excellent services to our customers.”
“We are excited to provide our Honeywell EnergyAxis smart grid solution to Hope and Fayetteville as they rapidly move from traditional grid infrastructure to a connected utility model built on a smart grid,” said Gary Bennett, vice president and general manager of Smart Energy Electricity Americas, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “Our field-proven EnergyAxis solution offers an end-to-end AMI option for utilities, including smaller utilities, helping them to bring the benefits of a connected, smart grid to their customers and perform at the highest level.”
Each utility will own and operate Honeywell's EnergyAxis system, including the network communications system, and connected smart meters and modules. The electricity meters will provide data on customer energy consumption to enable more accurate billing, and also help detect meter tampering and outages for faster power restoration. Two-way communications and embedded intelligence enable electricity, water and gas meters to transmit data to the utility, as well as accept instructions and respond to requests from utility departments or customer service.
In addition, each utility uses enterprise-wide smart grid software solutions from NISC to fully leverage the power of the Honeywell EnergyAxis system data through the MultiSpeak Specification (version 4.1) for standards-based data transfer.
Both utilities are receiving EnergyAxis connected electricity meters, communications network and system management technology, as well as monitoring and data analytics capabilities. Further details for each of the deployments include:
‚Ä¢ Hope Water and Light Commission, City of Hope, Arkansas &endash; The birthplace of President Bill Clinton and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Hope is deploying smart electricity meters and water meters/modules with a fixed communication network infrastructure that leverages existing assets owned by Hope. Honeywell is delivering the system as a turn-key operation including the Honeywell Connexo NetSense network management software, hardware, installation, training and ongoing customer support services.
‚Ä¢ Fayetteville Public Utilities (FPU), City of Fayetteville, Tennessee &endash; FPU provides electricity, gas, water/wastewater, and cable/internet/VOIP services to the 33,000 residents of Lincoln County. Honeywell is providing a turn-key deployment including installation, which began in April of this year. The project includes smart electricity meters, smart gas and water modules, Connexo NetSense software and network communication infrastructure. FPU is Honeywell's third “triple-play” utility (electricity, water and gas) in the Tennessee Valley Authority region.
Honeywell provides complete smart grid and energy management solutions that drive energy efficiency, operational improvements and cost savings for utilities, commercial and industrial customers, and consumers. Honeywell has more than 130 utility-managed EnergyAxis deployments worldwide, including 53 public utilities in the United States and 27 city-owned utilities in Canada.
