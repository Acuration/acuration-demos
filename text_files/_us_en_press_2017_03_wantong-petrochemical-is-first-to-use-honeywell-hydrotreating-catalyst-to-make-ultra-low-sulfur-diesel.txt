Wantong Petrochemical Is First To Use Honeywell Hydrotreating Catalyst To Make Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel
Wantong Petrochemical Is First To Use Honeywell Hydrotreating Catalyst To Make Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel
March 20, 2017
DES PLAINES, Ill., March 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Wantong Petrochemical Group is producing ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel using Honeywell UOP's new high-activity HYT-6219 hydrotreating catalyst.
The catalyst, which is part of Honeywell UOP's Unity' hydrotreating portfolio, enables Wantong Petrochemical to produce cleaner burning ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel without a costly modification of its existing hydrotreating unit in Donyging in China's Shandong Province. Hydrotreating is a method of removing sulfur from fuels in the refining process, using proprietary catalysts.
"This Unity hydrotreating catalyst will help Wantong and many other refiners meet new global standards for ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel, without a costly revamp of its equipment," said Ken Stacherski, vice president and general manager of Honeywell UOP's Catalysts, Adsorbents and Specialties business. "The high-activity HYT-6219 catalyst produces high-cetane diesel that meets the China V emissions standard, with sulfur levels lower than Wantong has ever before been able to achieve in its existing unit."
Today's announcement marks the first commercialization of a Honeywell UOP hydrotreating catalyst in distillate hydrotreating service since it exited an alliance with Albemarle last year, and follows launches of other hydrotreating catalysts for naphtha, hydrocracking pretreat and fluid catalytic cracking pretreat. The HYT-6219 hydrotreating catalyst is capable of achieving more stringent sulfur regulations of less than 10 parts per million without requiring a costly revamp of the refinery's existing hydrotreating unit.
Additionally, it allows refiners to take advantage of heavier "opportunity" crudes, oil that is cheaper and more widely available, but which is harder to process -- along with cost-effective systems that meet tighter environmental regulations on fuel quality.
Shandong Wantong Petrochemical Group Co., Ltd. was founded in 1998. The company's line of business includes producing gasoline, kerosene, distillate fuel oils, residual fuel oils, and lubricants.
Honeywell UOP is recognized as the leading developer of advanced catalysts for the refining industry. Its vast lineup of Unity hydroprocessing catalysts deliver solutions for hydrotreating, pretreat and hydrocracking.
