Honeywell Launches New Independent Software Vendor Partner Program
Honeywell Launches New Independent Software Vendor Partner Program
Program gives Honeywell customers and partners greater access to software solutions, helping to increase productivity and cost savings
July 10, 2019
FORT MILL, S.C., July 10, 2019 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today launched its Independent Software Vendor Program, giving partners and software vendors a platform to serve customers with solutions for industries including distribution centers, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and transportation and logistics.
The global program gives software vendors the opportunity to join Honeywell’s broad ecosystem, which includes distributors and reseller partners specializing in mobility, scanners, printers and voice solutions. Vendors can collaborate and work with customers to find solutions for Honeywell’s Mobility EdgeTM-enabled mobile computers and data capture products.
Honeywell customers can benefit from the program by leveraging currently more than 150 vendors globally to solve their business needs and efficiently connect hardware and software, making end user roles more efficient.
“Having an end-to-end hardware and software solution set offers a much broader value proposition to our customers, and we’re looking to partner with leading software innovators to help them maximize their investments,” said Lori Haggart, director of software innovation at Honeywell. “Our ISV Partner Program helps solidify our value proposition and gives software vendors the opportunity to open new revenue streams by teaming with a globally-recognized Fortune 100 brand.”
The ISV Partner Program is a part of Honeywell’s software transformation, putting significant investment in partnerships with software vendors, universities and incubators to create new solutions for industrial customers with both simple and complex needs. Partners have access to place software in the Honeywell Marketplace, an enterprise app store that enables enterprises to find and purchase innovative software solutions, technologies and services to help improve their productivity and increase efficiency. Currently with more than 80 applications, the Marketplace manages the billing process, eliminating the need for software vendors to invest in backend payment and invoicing systems.
Shyft Technologies is one of the most recent partners to join the program. Founded in 2015, the Shyft mobile-first workforce management app helps users create a seamless experience for retail associates to manage personal administrative tasks, such as shift swapping, alongside other operational tasks on the same device.
“Joining Honeywell’s vendor ecosystem through its ISV Partner Program has greatly expanded Shyft’s reach, extending the range of devices on which Shyft can be accessed,” said Brett Patrontasch, CEO of Shyft. “We’ve seen immediate benefit by joining the program working with others in the Honeywell vendor ecosystem to create more opportunities.”
Other key features of the partner program include:
Open API access: Through Honeywell Operational Intelligence, ISVs can leverage data from users of Honeywell devices to enhance or create new products within their solution suite.
Dedicated Account Management: Depending on the tiered partnership level, partners are assigned a Honeywell business representative within their region. These business representatives help ISVs grow and expand their sales footprint by leveraging Honeywell’s extensive partner community, sales team and marketing and sales programs.
Honeywell Recommended Program: Becoming Honeywell Recommended validates compatibility of ISV software with Honeywell hardware and devices. As a Honeywell Recommended ISV, customers are assured hardware and software are synchronized.
Demo Equipment Purchase Program: The Program provides deep discounts on products for use in application development, customer and event demonstrations, demo centers, training and proof-of-concept activities.
Deal Registration: Software vendors can receive incentive payments for recommending Honeywell devices and hardware to customers.
Customer Events and Activities: Vendors can participate in Honeywell’s exclusive events to expand lead generation and increase opportunities.
