Meet a #futureshaper: Sandra Barbosa
As vice president of human resources and communication in Latin America, Sandra Barbosa is helping Honeywell grow and creating value by taking care of the most important asset: the people.
Having been with Honeywell for 15 years, her advice is: “Always be willing to help. Be humble. When you do not know what to do, ask for help and you will find there are talented, kind, smart people happy to help. Be resilient, do not stop at first no.”
Based in Mexico City, Mexico; here is her #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I wanted to be several things: a teacher, translator and lawyer.
What brought you to Honeywell?
The possibility to interact with a global, diverse team.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
The challenges and helping my team and LATAM region continue to perform and succeed.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
Honeywell will help our customers solve their most complex problems and help society with better usage of natural resources.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
Think big and make things happen. The world is full of possibility. It all comes down to how far you are willing to go!
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I play with my two daughters; it is amazing how I get a lot of energy even when I am physically tired around them. I love to read and enjoy discussing Brazil politics with my husband.
