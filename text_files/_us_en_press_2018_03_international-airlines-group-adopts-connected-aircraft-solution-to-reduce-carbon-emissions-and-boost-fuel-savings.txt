International Airlines Group Adopts Connected Aircraft Solution To Reduce Carbon Emissions And Boost Fuel Savings
International Airlines Group Adopts Connected Aircraft Solution To Reduce Carbon Emissions And Boost Fuel Savings
March 20, 2018
ROLLE, Switzerland, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announces that its GoDirect® Flight Efficiency software is being deployed by International Airlines Group across its fleet of more than 500 aircraft. The parent company of Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL and Vueling will use the Connected Aircraft flight data analytics platform, which uses flight analysis tools to cut carbon emissions, to enhance efficiency and reduce fuel costs.
"We have a strong track record of identifying and implementing initiatives to reduce our carbon emissions. This technology will allow our airlines to further optimize their fuel consumption by analyzing aircraft performance and sharing best practice across the group," said Willie Walsh, chief executive, IAG. "We are investing in a modern fleet and developing innovative operating techniques to reduce CO2 output. Producing sustainable fuel is also critical, and we continue our work to convert domestic waste into jet fuel, which will help deliver our carbon emissions target while reducing landfill. We have set ambitious environmental targets and are determined to lead the industry in tackling climate change."
By adopting Honeywell's software across its airlines, IAG will take advantage of advanced flight data analytics that allow airlines to make data-driven decisions on fuel usage. IAG is the first airline group to partner with Honeywell in the development of a central group platform to enable benchmarking across its fleet.
"Improving flight efficiency and reducing emissions are among the biggest pressures facing airlines today," said David Shilliday, vice president, Airlines, EMEA, Honeywell Aerospace. "For a business like International Airlines Group, which operates some of the world's leading airlines, this is even more crucial. Our GoDirect Flight Efficiency solution is a user-friendly software upgrade that integrates data sources to monitor fuel use and lower environmental impact."
Through its user-friendly interface, Honeywell GoDirect Flight Efficiency software integrates with existing systems to produce more than 100 analysis reports. These reports improve flight-planning capabilities and empower pilots with unprecedented levels of insight, helping to expand their knowledge of operations and allow them to learn from previous flights.
The GoDirect solution is a one-stop shop for Honeywell's services and applications that provide airlines, business aviation operators, Ô¨Çight crews and maintenance teams with the information they need to monitor their services and network. IAG joins an expanding list of more than 35 customers, including Etihad, Japan Airlines, Turkish Airlines, KLM and Lufthansa, using Honeywell's Flight Efficiency software.
