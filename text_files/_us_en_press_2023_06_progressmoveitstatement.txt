Statement on Progress MOVEit
Statement on Progress MOVEit
Honeywell immediately launched an investigation upon learning of the vulnerability in Progress MOVEit Transfer, a third-party web transfer application used by many companies, public institutions and governments. The investigation detected unauthorized access on a single MOVEit server. Our cybersecurity defenses limited the impact to this server and we fully patched and upgraded the Progress MOVEit app as soon as the patches were made available from the provider before restoring service. We are in contact with certain law enforcement and regulatory authorities.
As part of our investigation, we have found data, including certain personally identifiable information, that has been accessed through the MOVEit app by an unauthorized third party. We are contacting affected individuals, customers, and partners as appropriate.
All of our systems are fully online, and this has had no impact on company operations. At this time, we do not expect that the unauthorized access on the MOVEit server we used will have a material impact on our business operations. Security is a top priority at Honeywell, and we are committed to taking all appropriate measures to ensure the highest integrity of our systems.
We are aware that certain Honeywell suppliers have been impacted by the same Progress MOVEit vulnerability and that our data might have been impacted as a result. We will assess and respond to any impacts as part of our investigation as we receive notification from suppliers that our data has been compromised.
This contains certain statements that may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on management's assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities law. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the ongoing investigation into the unauthorized access to our server and any unauthorized access to our suppliers' servers, each of which that can affect our performance in both the near- and long-term. In addition, no assurance can be given that any plan, initiative, projection, goal commitment, expectation, or prospect set forth in this release can or will be achieved. Any forward-looking plans described herein are not final and may be modified or abandoned at any time. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
