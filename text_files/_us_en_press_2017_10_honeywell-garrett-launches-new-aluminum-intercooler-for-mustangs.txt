Honeywell Garrett Launches New Aluminum Intercooler For Mustangs
Honeywell Garrett Launches New Aluminum Intercooler For Mustangs
October 5, 2018
Honeywell Garrett expands its performance offerings for Ford's turbocharged Mustang
TORRANCE, Calif. – (Oct. 31, 2017) – Honeywell Garrett has built a reputation as one of the leading manufacturers of turbochargers and turbo system components. As an industry leader, Honeywell Garrett knows that heat is the enemy of performance, particularly in small displacement turbocharged engines and to that end, it is introducing a newall-aluminum intercooler for Ford's 2.3L EcoBoost Mustang.
The new all-aluminum intercooler by Honeywell Garrett (P/N: 857564-6001) is dramatically more efficient than the stock component it replaces thanks to the use of computational fluid dynamics in designing its end tanks and a 60% larger core. These changes combine to offer a 30% reduction in pressure drop as well as a 40 degrees Fahrenheit reduction in inlet temperatures versus the stock setup. HoneywellGarrett's intercooler can support up to 600 horsepower, nearly double what is offered from the factory.
The 2.3 liter4-cylinder EcoBoost engine in the 2015-2018 Ford Mustang is an extremely capable engine with the ability to produce well above its factory-listed 310horsepower. One of the bottlenecks for making more power with this engine is the undersized factory intercooler. The stock intercooler cannot cope with extended periods of full-boost driving and causes the engine to heat soak, thus robbing power; a problem that is solved by this uprated intercooler.
“The EcoBoost Mustang is one of the most exciting entry-level performance automobiles thanks to the incredible potential of its turbocharged engine,” said Eric Fraysse, Vice President and general manager, Aftermarket Honeywell Transportation Systems.“This excellent platform allows Honeywell Garrett to apply its decades of knowledge towards dramatically increasing performance with products like this new aluminum intercooler.”
This Honeywell Garrett intercooler will retail for $650 and installs in two and a half hours using basic hand tools and allows owners to reuse their factory hoses, clamps, and bolts. Slightly elongated inlet and outlet ports create a secure surface for hose attachment reducing the chance of blow-off on higher horsepower applications while maintaining compatibility with both OEM hoses and aftermarket charge pipes.
