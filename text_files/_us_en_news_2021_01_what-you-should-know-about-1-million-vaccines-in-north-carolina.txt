In North Carolina, fighting the Covid-19 pandemic is all about collaboration.
Honeywell, Atrium Health, Tepper Sports & Entertainment and the Charlotte Motor Speedway together with the State of North Carolina backed by Gov. Roy Cooper are partnering to vaccinate as many people quickly and efficiently.
“Getting vaccines in people’s arms as quickly and equitably as possible is a top priority for North Carolina,” said Gov. Cooper. “Partnerships with businesses, health providers and government like this can help get it done.”
Charlotte has been the location of our corporate headquarters since 2019, with the new building under construction in Uptown.
Here are the details of these vaccination efforts:
What: 1 million vaccinations in North Carolina
