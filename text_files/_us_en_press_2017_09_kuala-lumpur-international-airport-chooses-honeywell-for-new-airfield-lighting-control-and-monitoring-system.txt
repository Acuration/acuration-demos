Kuala Lumpur International Airport Chooses Honeywell For New Airfield Lighting Control And Monitoring System
Kuala Lumpur International Airport Chooses Honeywell For New Airfield Lighting Control And Monitoring System
September 28, 2017
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept. 26, 2017 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced a multi-million dollar, multi-year upgrade project at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), one of Asia's major aviation hubs, for a new airfield ground lighting control and monitoring system. The Honeywell system will play a critical role in helping KLIA safely and efficiently accommodate increasing aircraft traffic.
Malaysia Airports (Sepang) Sdn. Bhd., which operates the airport, has chosen Honeywell solutions to enhance the safety, capacity and efficiency of KLIA airside operations. Honeywell's technology will control and monitor airside systems, and provide real-time location information on lamp failures to enable faster response and repair – reducing risk and improving uptime.
“As the primary gateway to Malaysia, KLIA is a showcase of our ambition to grow as a nation,” said Datuk Badlisham Ghazali, managing director, Malaysia Airports. “As we move closer to becoming a developed country, our airports should reflect high standards of safety and efficiency. Our collaboration with Honeywell is in line with our commitment to maintain safety, improve efficiency, drive performance, and reduce operational expenses while we comply with the international regulatory standards.”
The project is an upgrade of the airport operator's existing work with Honeywell, which includes single-lamp control and monitoring for Runways 1 and 2, and the building management system at KLIA.
“We look forward to continuing our work with KLIA to support their runway improvements and passenger terminals,” said Briand Greer, president, Honeywell ASEAN. “With over 100 years of global experience in aviation and airports, Honeywell is a leader with a comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, and we are proud to support the growth and development of Asia's airports.”
This project will position KLIA as one of the most technologically advanced airports in the world, with the capability to move toward the advanced-follow-the-green' (A-SMGCS Level 4) technology.
Airfield ground lighting, as a visual aid for landing and taxiing, is an important element of an airport's infrastructure. Lighting installations for approaches, runways, taxiways, and aprons enable pilots to navigate the complex surface layouts of modern airports in all conditions, from taxiing and takeoff to landing. Honeywell's computerized control and monitoring system facilitates the operation and observation of these lighting installations, and ensures that safety requirements are met. This system provides workstations for tower and technical personnel to simplify daily operational processes and optimize maintenance activities.
