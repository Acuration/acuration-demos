How Honeywell is Responding to the Coronavirus
How Honeywell is Responding to the Coronavirus
With the spread of the virus, we’re donating equipment to schools and medical facilities and increasing production of facemasks
February 5, 2020
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is having a significant impact on people around the world.
As Honeywell is experiencing a surge in demand for N95 protective face masks in North America, Europe and China, we are increasing production at multiple facilities globally to address the growing demand.
In China, our products are available through JD.com and TMALL.com, and in the U.S. and Europe, they can be found at a number of retailers, including suppliers of industrial parts and safety products.
Honeywell is currently prioritizing the supply of N95 masks to the most affected areas to support the protection needs of front-line workers. Since reports of the coronavirus first emerged, we have coordinated resources and sold 20 million masks within China.
In addition, Honeywell pledged to donate $2 million worth of equipment to support hospitals in Wuhan, China, in the eastern province of Hubei.
The donation includes air and water purification systems, intensive care unit (ICU) air management solutions and scanning and mobile printing equipment. As part of the donation, Honeywell will also provide children's safety masks to Wuhan schools.
“Our employees extend their hearts to the people in the affected areas, and we are making every effort to ensure the supply of protective equipment to those who need it most,” said Scott Zhang, president, Honeywell China.
If you have questions about the virus and how to protect yourself, please consult health care professionals, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO).
