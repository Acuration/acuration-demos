The History of
Honeywell
From our founding in 1885, innovation has always been our legacy and our future.
1885
Invention of the furnace regulator
Considered the official beginning of the company that became Honeywell, in 1885, inventor Albert Butz patented the furnace regulator and alarm. He then formed the Butz Thermo-Electric Regulator Co. in Minneapolis and soon created a device he called the "damper flapper.” That invention was  a predecessor to the modern thermostat. The Consolidated Temperature Controlling Co. acquired Butz's patents and business, and by 1893, had renamed itself Electric Heat Regulator Co. In 1898, the company was purchased by W. R. Sweatt, who, by 1916, named the company Minneapolis Heat Regulator Company, expanded its product line and patented the first electric motor approved by Underwriters Laboratories.

1920
Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation formed
During World War I, Germany controlled much of the world's chemical
industry, causing shortages among the U.S. and its allies of critical
drugs and dyes. In 1920, publisher Eugene Meyer and scientist William
Nichols formed the Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation as a
partnership of five American chemical companies.

1969
Moon mission support
On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission. Honeywell was critical to that mission. For example, 16,000 Honeywell parts went into the 14 separate electronic devices that made up the Stabilization and Control Systems (SCS). Meanwhile, Honeywell pilots helped with flight testing.

1999
AlliedSignal acquires Honeywell
In 1985, Allied merged with Signal Companies, adding to its aerospace, automotive and engineered materials business. Then in 1999, Honeywell was acquired by AlliedSignal, who elected to retain the Honeywell name for its brand recognition. The headquarters were moved to the AlliedSignal headquarters in Morristown, N.J. Together the companies shared huge business interests in aerospace, chemical products, automotive parts and building controls. By the turn of the century, Allied had already bought Union Texas Natural Gas and aerospace and automotive company Bendix Corp.

2005-2016
Two decades of acquisitions
At the start of the 21st century, Honeywell continued to grow by acquiring businesses across industries. In 2005, we acquired Universal Oil Products, a leading international supplier and licensor for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical production and major manufacturing industries. Three years later, we added Metrologic Instruments, which made laser, mobile imaging and remote scanners. In 2016, Intelligrated came on board. They provide automation solutions for distribution centers and warehouses.
