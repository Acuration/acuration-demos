Honeywell Forge Connected Warehouse provides new capabilities to help organizations streamline operations and lower costs.

May 4, 2022
ATLANTA, May 4, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) today announced the Spring 2022 release of new offerings and enhancements to Honeywell Forge, the leading enterprise performance management software solution, designed to assist customers in accelerating the digital transformation of their operations. This class of offerings, which includes Honeywell Forge Connected Warehouse, will help organizations simplify operations and lower costs by providing increased visibility to data as well as real-time insights, monitoring and automation.
Launch of Honeywell Forge Connected Warehouse
"Our new Honeywell Forge Connected Warehouse offering brings a scalable and cloud-based solution to help distribution centers accelerate their productivity, predictability and transformation strategies," said Kevin Dehoff, president and CEO of Honeywell Connected Enterprise. "We are proud to also introduce several enhancements to our current software solutions across the aerospace, smart buildings and industrial sectors, enabling enterprises to optimize asset performance and drive operational savings."
Honeywell Forge Connected Warehouse provides organizations with two modules that provide real-time visibility across their warehouse site operations and advanced analytics to reduce unplanned downtime, address recurring challenges and automate legacy processes. The Site Operations module features a dashboard that indicates how sites are performing against plan and helps managers identify repetitive bottlenecks and proactively address issues that may impact performance. The interface, which is optimized for tablets, enables enterprise benchmarking, monitors areas such as picking and shipping and makes recommendations to achieve daily targets. Users can use the Honeywell Forge Connect edge solution to connect devices and integrate with standard warehouse systems.
"The environment in today's retail, e-commerce and supply chain logistics has led to an unprecedented demand for increased fulfillment performance," said Doug Henschen, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. "Nonetheless, awareness towards the state of the warehouse workers, their safety and their wellness and productivity drive innovation in automation. It's encouraging to see Honeywell Connected Enterprise embracing this vision and supporting automated action through the Honeywell Forge portfolio of SaaS applications."
Also available is the Asset Performance Management (APM) for Warehouse module, which enables maintenance teams to quickly collaborate on equipment issues that impact performance with remediation recommendations. Operations managers and maintenance managers can use rules-based analytics and asset modeling to identify and analyze trends. Predictive maintenance and asset health monitoring provide leaders with new capabilities to improve operational performance and increase asset availability. Pilot users experienced reductions in unplanned downtime and overtime costs by predicting failures.
"Honeywell continues to build and enhance connected solutions so our customers can succeed with their digital transformation, efficiency and sustainability goals," said David Trice, chief product officer and general manager, Honeywell Connected Enterprise. "Our new Honeywell Forge Connected Warehouse solution will enable our customers to meet pressing challenges in the supply chain environment with an operational system of record that leverages new insights from OT assets from across the enterprise. We also believe these enhancements to our existing offerings will drive more efficiency and add new operational capabilities across the industries we serve."
