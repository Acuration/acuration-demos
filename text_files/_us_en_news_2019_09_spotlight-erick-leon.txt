Spotlight: Erick Leon
Erick makes flights safe and efficient. As a systems engineer, he develops avionics systems, performing flight simulators and flight test benches.
September 29, 2019
Here’s what he has to say:
Describe your time with Honeywell and what is noteworthy to you
Within my first couple months, I was sent to support an onsite customer. It was nerve wracking, but prepared me to be courageous and built my confidence to continue to quickly deliver quality work.
I have been offered opportunities to learn other functions, which has helped me develop professionally.
Being a global company ensures that our projects continue to develop during off hours. I have had the pleasure of working with employees from many places, including India, Czech Republic, France, Brazil and China, where I have been able to learn more about the world and the people living in it.
What is the goal of your work?
I make future flight decks so that people can fly safer, faster and more efficiently. I’m working on systems that provide pilots with the necessary tools to always communicate with air traffic control. This is important to maintain a safe environment for all air traffic. More specifically, I worked on the G500 flight deck where I was able to learn how we can incorporate touchscreen tablets into avionics flight decks and how futuristic this makes airplane cockpits.
Are you involved in any non-profit business organizations focused on your field?
I am currently involved in the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I was a part of SHPE throughout my collegiate career holding multiple leadership positions. In addition, I was on the board of the SHPE Phoenix professional chapter.
How does it make you feel knowing you can change the world with your work?
Knowing that I can change the world with my work makes me feel proud that I can be part of a great team with a similar goal: to help people.  I always try to keep the future in mind when working because pilots will always have a new problem to deal with. Thinking ahead helps ensure we quickly address issues that arise. I would say that our goal is to one day make it very accessible to be able to fly. My vision is that flying will be like getting into your car and driving to work.
What are some of your interests outside of work?
In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, playing the trumpet, violin and guitar, trying new places to eat and traveling.
