Meet a #futureshaper: Eric Rice
Here's how he's turning warehouses into symphonies
June 13, 2019
When Eric Rice isn’t at work, you can catch him on a motorcycle or configuring do it yourself (DIY) electronics.
That adventurous and inquisitive spirit carries over to his role at Honeywell, where he helps automate distribution centers.
“We provide the conveyor equipment, software, and integration to get products you buy to your local store shelves or right to your door,” Eric said.
That’s more important than ever with ecommerce poised to keep growing.
Based in Cincinnati, here is his #futureshaper story.
Did you think you’d end up in a job like you’re in now?
No, I started as an engineer developing software and installing on customer systems.  I have had more diverse experiences than I expected with software development, leading our customer facing Technical Support team, and being able to bring a new product to market in product management.  There has been a lot of opportunity to grow with the company.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I wanted to be a pilot, but was always fascinated with technology and how things worked.  I love to see how software/technology and the real world can interact.  That is probably why I enjoy controls technology so much.  Making equipment come to life.
What do you do?
We automate distribution centers.  We provide the conveyor equipment, software, and integration to get products you buy to your local store shelves or right to your door.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day?
There is always a new challenge.  New problems to solve.  I like to make something better each day for our customers and our team.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell?
Honeywell is focused and developing and investing in new technology.
Why is the future important?
The future is what we make it!  We have to continually evolve to solve the problems of tomorrow.
How does your job make tomorrow better/safer than today?
We enable the next generation of commerce.  25 Billion packages a year ship from our equipment.  This will only increase as ecommerce continues to grow.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper has?
Vision
Application
Persistence
Accountability
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
We will see continued growth.  People will continue to buy goods and we will provide the systems to fulfill orders.  The labor market continues to be more competitive which will require more automation.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Look for needs.  Be flexible.  Constantly learn.  Act on feedback.  Be decisive.  Do the right thing when no-one is watching.
What do you for fun?
Time with family
Motorcycles
DIY electronics
Outdoors
