Honeywell To Provide Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant To EagleClaw Midstream Ventures
Honeywell To Provide Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant To EagleClaw Midstream Ventures
November 20, 2017
DES PLAINES, Ill., Nov. 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that EagleClaw Midstream Ventures, LLC will use UOP Russell modular cryogenic equipment to process 200 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas at its gas processing facility in the Permian Basin in Reeves County, Texas.
UOP Russell customized the gas processing plant for the West Texas location, including a modular design that reduces project schedules and delivers a custom, gas-specific plant with proven uptime and reliability.
"EagleClaw has chosen to go with UOP Russell for its last three plants -- totaling 600 million cubic feet per day -- due to excellent project execution and service offerings, and the advantages of integrating EagleClaw's existing fleet of UOP Russell plants," said Craig Ranta, business director, UOP Russell. "We're delivering a customized plant to match the rich feed gas composition in the basin, while the high NGL recovery makes EagleClaw more competitive capturing contracts from producers."
Cryogenic gas processing plants cool natural gas until the heavier and more valuable NGLs form into liquids. These liquids &endash; including propane, ethane and butanes -- can be used as fuels, fuel blending components and other valuable petrochemicals.
The plant is designed to accommodate the NGL-rich gas in the Permian's Delaware Basin. Its low capital and operating expense, coupled with high NGL recovery, allowed EagleClaw to offer gas producers more favorable processing terms, positioning the company to recover high levels of NGLs as prices for them continue to rise.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. production of ethane will increase from about 1.25 million barrels per day (b/d) last year to 1.7 million b/d in 2018. The increased ethane produced is forecast to be consumed by the U.S. petrochemical industry and exported to other countries.
EagleClaw Midstream Ventures, LLC is headquartered in Midland, Texas, and develops midstream infrastructure opportunities in the Permian Basin of West Texas. EagleClaw provides natural gas and crude oil producers with a wide array of midstream services including gathering, compression, treating, processing and transportation.
