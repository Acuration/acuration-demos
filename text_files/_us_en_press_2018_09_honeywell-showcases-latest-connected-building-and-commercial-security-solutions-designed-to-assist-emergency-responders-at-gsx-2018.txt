Honeywell Showcases Latest Connected Building And Commercial Security Solutions Designed To Assist Emergency Responders At GSX 2018
September 25, 2018
Honeywell solutions on display such as MAXPRO® Cloud enable early detection, faster response, and more
Latest integrated technologies strengthen Honeywell's continued efforts in its Connected Buildings roadmap
ATLANTA, Sept. 25, 2018 — Honeywell [NYSE: HON] will showcase Connected Buildings technologies that aim to minimize response times and eliminate human delays in critical situations at this year's Global Exchange Security Conference and Expo (GSX) in Las Vegas. The company will demonstrate products that help commercial buildings detect threats early, respond to incidents faster, centralize decision making, and allow management from anywhere. These solutions are part of Honeywell's Connected Buildings portfolio designed to turn buildings into business assets while keeping people and property safe.
“Time is the most critical component when it comes to protecting people, which means any security solution should be designed to remove the human delay,” said Mike Maher, general manager, Honeywell Commercial Security. “The technologies Honeywell will showcase at GSX are designed with one end goal in mind: enabling end users and law enforcement to respond faster to emergencies.”
Honeywell, for example, will highlight the importance of faster response times for end users across a range of markets, including schools and universities. While security cameras and access control deliver lockdown capabilities, the ability to initiate faster emergency response within an instant of detecting offenders before they gain entry into schools is essential. Honeywell technologies addressing this issue including MAXPRO® Cloud, Pro-Watch® and others; will be demonstrated at the conference.
Additional products featured at the booth include the latest from Honeywell's Commercial Security portfolio: NetAXS®123, Performance Series, VISTA, equIP®Series, WIN-PAK®, Vindicator.
