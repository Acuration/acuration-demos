Honeywell Connected Aircraft Software Reduces Fuel Use For Two National Carriers By Up To 5 Percent
Honeywell Connected Aircraft Software Reduces Fuel Use For Two National Carriers By Up To 5 Percent
August 10, 2017
ROLLE, Switzerland, Aug. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is helping reduce fuel use on 71 aircraft for two national carriers through its Connected Aircraft GoDirect' Fuel Efficiency software. The technology now being deployed at Brussels Airlines and Air Serbia is part of Honeywell's GoDirect suite of more than 50 connected aircraft services. Honeywell's offering uses data analysis, reporting and monitoring tools to identify fuel-saving opportunities that make flying more cost-efficient and better for the environment.
Honeywell's GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software collects, monitors and analyzes data for operators to help them optimize fuel efficiency across the fleet. With this technology, pilots are provided the most fuel-efficient flight paths that will reduce the amount of fuel used on every flight. Airlines can easily integrate the software into their current technologies to immediately benefit from customized reports based on individual needs, reducing fuel costs by up to 5 percent. Fuel use can account for 20 to 40 percent of an airline's operating costs, so even single-digit percentage improvements can save airlines tens of millions of dollars in fuel spending each year.
"One of the biggest pressures facing airlines today is improving operational efficiency while meeting very tight margins," said David Shilliday, vice president, Airlines —; Europe Middle East, Africa and India, Honeywell Aerospace. "Honeywell's longstanding experience in providing aircraft with a wide array of products and services helps us fully understand the challenges airlines face in reducing fuel use across all phases of flight planning. Honeywell's GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software is a simple technology upgrade that collects and reveals any fuel-efficiency gaps so the flight crew can take specific routes to cut fuel costs."
New customers include
Brussels Airlines deployed GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software on its fleet of 50 aircraft
Air Serbia deployed GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software on its fleet of 21 aircraft
These airlines join an expanding list of more than 30 global customers already using Honeywell's advanced software, including Jet Airways, Lufthansa, Etihad, Finnair, Japan Airlines, Turkish Airlines and others.
