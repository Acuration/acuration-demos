Meet a #futureshaper: José Gatica
He's making mining safer
September 9, 2019
José Gatica said the future will be the world our children inherit.
Today’s actions will impact that world, he said.
“If we can improve the quality of life today, they will have a better life tomorrow,” Jose said.
He looks toward the future in his own role at Honeywell, supporting mining clients.
Based in Santiago, Chile; here is his #futureshaper story.
Did you think you’d end up in a job like you’re in now?
Yes, business and commercial issues have always been of interest to me and it was part of my goals to get a position like the one I now have. In addition, my previous positions helped prepare me for this role in a better way.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I wanted to be a doctor and a fireman. I wanted to help people.
What do you do?
I’m in charge of seeking and detecting new opportunities for mining clients. I maintain contact with the customer and build a relationship with them, which I think is very important. My position also requires I have a complete vision of the portfolio of solutions we offer the customer.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day?
Honeywell is a good place to work principally and has a diversity of professionals, specialties and ages. My team is always available to support me when I need. I also like my role because I face different challenges each day.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell?
For me, Honeywell is a great place to work. Everyone can develop areas and is permanently concerned for making a better world. Honeywell prioritizes diversity. Everyone has a space to contribute ideas and teamwork is the key to our strength.
How does your job make tomorrow better/safer than today?
My job requires me to be conscious of how we can do better and act on it. Our mining clients have high safety standards and we can learn from them and transfer these standards to our daily work and life.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper should have?
A #futureshaper needs to be tolerant to change. Be versatile to adapt to these changes and be creative and accept ideas. Always be aware that what you do is a model for colleagues.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
I see a mining industry more automated, more efficient and operated at a distance with less exposure and risk to workers.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
My advice is that you think without limits, with your head in the sky but your feet on Earth. Understand you are a part of a team. Accept the best ideas.
What do you for fun?
I play with my son, watch movies and listen to music.
