Meet a #Futureshaper: Cavene Vanhorne Robinson
Cavene leads a team working to reduce harmful emissions from auxiliary power units (APUs), which provide reliable backup power for aircraft.
Cavene Vanhorne Robinson and her team work on technology critical for your safety in the air in the event of an emergency: auxiliary power units (APUs).
APUs provide the power necessary to keep aircraft running smoothly, from keeping lights on in the cockpit and cabin to providing strength to engine starters.
Cavene, a senior engineering program manager, is committed to making air travel more sustainable, starting with APUs.
For her and her team, that means testing APUs with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and innovating to bring hydrogen-powered APUs to market.
Get to know Cavene and her story as a Futureshaper.
What do you and your team do?
In short, we power airplanes. We make APUs, which are secondary power sources that will provide emergency power while in flight, if needed. APUs can power aircraft from drones and military aircraft to large-cabin business, regional and commercial airplanes.
What is your personal connection to sustainability?
My family diaspora is all over the world. We all fly to see each other. When I go home to Jamaica, the beach is receding. I don't want to go home to just an airstrip!
What does being a Futureshaper mean to you?
It means my opinion matters, that I'm empowered to make the changes I want to see, and that what I do every day makes a difference.
Meet other Futureshapers who are innovating to make our world smarter, safer and more sustainable.
