Honeywell's Enhanced Building Technology Offers New Interfaces To Help Improve Data Visualization And Decision-Making
Honeywell's Enhanced Building Technology Offers New Interfaces To Help Improve Data Visualization And Decision-Making
From the board room to the boiler room, Honeywell's Command and Control Suite release 200 connects building personnel with insights to enhance overall security and building operations
February 19, 2018
ATLANTA, Feb. 14, 2018 – Honeywell ( NYSE: HON), a global leader in connected buildings, today announced its latest smart building technology, Command and Control Suite release 200 (CCS R200), which connects building personnel with data analytics to help drive operational improvements and efficiencies. CCS R200 builds on the original Command and Control Suite by offering more user interfaces to bring building performance data to key personnel, when and where they need it - from building operators and managers to security incident response teams - helping to reduce operational costs, mitigate risk and enhance business continuity.
CCS R200 combines intelligent automation, advanced analytics and data visualization with the contemporary user experience of consumer home and mobile electronics, bringing simple, intuitive displays to building operations to enhance facility and security management in an easy-to-understand manner. The latest release brings the holistic integration, map-based visualization and incident workflows of CCS to the control room workstation, desktop PCs and windows tablets, extending the software's mobile, touch-optimized experience to more interfaces. This creates a seamless hub of information pulled from IT networks, building control systems and outside sources, which allows for better incident response and operational decision-making.
“The value of a building's data is dependent on how easily the right people can access and understand it. As today's operations become increasingly data-driven, it's imperative for organizations to ensure they're taking steps to make this data accessible and actionable to those who need it in order to do their jobs, such as security personnel, building operators and C-suite executives,” said John Rajchert, president of Building Solutions, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “That's why we chose to develop more interfaces and software mobility functions with CCS. We're providing additional ways for key personnel to tap into key building insights so they can keep systems up and running and optimize building operations.”
Building off the basic components of the original Command and Control Suite, CCS R200 is designed with the same ease of use as the Command Wall, which was designed as a collaboration and team decision-making tool, and features map-based visualization and navigation from a single intuitive touch screen. CCS R200 brings that same ease of use to core operational interfaces, the Command Station and Command Console, extending an organization's ability to turn complex data into easy-to-implement changes to enhance overall building operations.
The Command Station is a single window, single monitor interface, designed for a desktop PC, laptop and Windows tablet, and is often ideal for facility technicians, security guards and management as well as for casual use by occupants. It allows even inexperienced users to quickly understand the overall situation at a glance by providing unique insights in a straightforward manner, while allowing expert users the ability to drill down to technical detail and full system control.
The Command Console, in contrast, is a premium multi-window, multi-monitor interface designed for engineers, control-room operators, and building mangers and others who need to view insights from multiple systems and areas of a building simultaneously. It seamlessly integrates with Honeywell's Digital Video Manager console to access and provide a view of video footage and corresponding data for improved operational decision-making.
In addition to new interfaces, CCS R200 includes enhancements to the original system's Incident Workflow feature, which guides users through scripted responses to security incidents and other emergencies. The enhancements include map visualization to clearly locate an incident, such as a fire alarm going off, to quickly identify the exact location. Integrated with the underlying control system, workflows can be initiated by system alarms and procedure steps can include operator-initiated control actions such as announcement, equipment start up, door release and other actions depending on the needs of the incident. Additionally, with CCS R200, organizations can issue multiple Incident Workflows, which can be managed by different people in order to promote efficiency and overall security.
CCS R200 integrates with Honeywell's flagship building management platform, Enterprise Buildings Integrator (EBI), which helps facilitate the integration of security, comfort, life safety and energy systems among other functions. CCS R200 is available now.
