Kirloskar Adopts Honeywells Solstice® Ze Refrigerant for Breakthrough Chiller Line in India
Kirloskar Adopts Honeywells Solstice® Ze Refrigerant for Breakthrough Chiller Line in India
February 24, 2017
New environmentally preferable refrigerant supports government initiative to phase down high-global-warming refrigerants
NEW DELHI, February 23, 2017 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that Kirloskar Chillers, part of the Kirloskar Group, Pune-based engineering conglomerate, is using Honeywell's Solstice® ze (R-1234ze(E)) refrigerant in its new line of chillers manufactured in India. The chillers, which are large central air conditioning units, are now available for installation in both industrial and commercial buildings in India, Middle East, South East Asia and Europe.
Kirloskar's new “Make in India” chillers help the country deliver on its focus for next-generation cooling systems. India is one of the key signatories of the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which is focused on phasing down the use of high-global-warming hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Solstice ze is an environmentally preferable hydrofluoro-olefin (HFO) refrigerant developed by Honeywell that is available immediately as an option to support the Indian government's transition away from high-global-warming-potential refrigerants.
“We evaluated the range of options available for our latest generation of chillers, and Honeywell's Solstice ze is the ideal solution because it helps us meet environmental targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Prashant Joshi, vice president for Kirloskar Chillers. “Honeywell's technical expertise helped us during development of the first HFO-chiller produced in India.
Solstice ze is non-ozone-depleting with an ultra-low global warming potential (GWP) of less than 1, complying with global environmental standards and regulations. It is classified as A2L and is nonflammable below 30C. Solstice ze is safer to use than hydrocarbons or ammonia, which are either extremely flammable or highly toxic.
“Honeywell is committed to continuing to invest in the development of next-generation, lower-GWP solutions that make it easier for industries to adopt and use alternatives to higher-GWP refrigerants,” said Julien Soulet, managing director for Honeywell Fluorine Products in Europe, Middle East, Africa and India. “We are happy to help the Indian government by enabling an environment where innovative manufacturers like Kirloskar can introduce new energy-efficient products that benefit from our expertise in developing sustainable alternative refrigerants with reduced environmental impact.”
Kirloskar Chillers is an innovative provider of solutions for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R) with a comprehensive range of centrifugal and screw chillers from 50 TR to 2400 TR. It is introducing the first chiller with Solstice ze in India, designed to be the industry's most economical and competitive when assessed by performance and overall cost-effectiveness. Designed for a wide range of operating conditions, Kirloskar Chillers offers a combination of operating efficiency, design flexibility, reliability and serviceability.
Honeywell is a world leader in the development, manufacture and supply of refrigerants that are sold worldwide under the Solstice ® and Genetron ® brand names for a range of applications, including refrigeration, building and automobile air conditioning. Honeywell and its suppliers are in the middle of a $900 million investment program in technology development and new capacity based on Honeywell's hydrofluoro-olefin (HFO) technology, which helps customers lower their carbon footprint without sacrificing end-product performance.
Honeywell's family of Solstice-branded products includes refrigerants for stationary, commercial refrigeration and mobile refrigerants; liquid and gaseous blowing agents; solvents and propellants &endash; all based on Honeywell's hydrofluoro-olefin (HFO) technology that helps customers lower their carbon footprint without sacrificing end-product performance.
Worldwide adoption of Solstice products has resulted in the reduction of more than 35 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to date, equal to permanently eliminating emissions from more than 7.5 million cars.
