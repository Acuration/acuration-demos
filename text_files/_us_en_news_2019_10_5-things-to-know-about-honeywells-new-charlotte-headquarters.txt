5 Things to Know About Honeywell's New Charlotte Headquarters
5 Things to Know About Honeywell's New Charlotte Headquarters
North Carolina, here we come — check out our future corporate office and some of the perks to being in the 'Queen City'
October 1, 2019
Honeywell has broken ground on its Charlotte, North Carolina, headquarters.
Before raising symbolic shovels full of dirt to mark the occasion, N.C. Governor Roy Cooper, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, Mecklenburg County Commission Chairman George Dunlap and Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk commented on the significance.
“We are incredibly excited about construction beginning on our new headquarters, which symbolizes both the future of our company and our commitment to Charlotte and the surrounding region,” Darius said. “Today is also an opportunity to acknowledge the hard work and support of all those who made this day possible, from the Honeywell employees who are leading our transition efforts to our partners from the city, county and state who have made all of us feel so welcome to this vibrant community."
The Oct. 3 ceremonial groundbreaking follows the November 2018 announcement of the new headquarters building.
Here’s what you need to know about the new headquarters:
1.      The space
The 23-story office building will be built by Charlotte developer Lincoln Harris and construction is expected to be complete in 2021.
The building will be part of the Legacy Union site and will house 750 Honeywell employees during the next five years. It will include ground-floor retail, a rooftop terrace, a parking deck with about 800 spaces and Honeywell technologies for buildings.
“We couldn’t be any more pleased to formally welcome Honeywell to Charlotte and what has become the city’s most dynamic business address, Legacy Union,” said Lincoln Harris President Johno Harris.
“The addition of Honeywell to the roster of blue-chip companies headquartered here is further proof that Charlotte and the state of North Carolina offer a diverse business climate and unsurpassed quality of life that will lead to continued growth and opportunity."
2.      The people
Honeywell is a technology company that creates software and a range of products across industries, including aerospace, oil and gas, buildings and manufacturing. The headquarters will house Honeywell’s corporate functions, including human resources, IT, marketing and legal.
The Charlotte location also will serve as headquarters for Honeywell’s Safety and Productivity Solutions business, which makes products such as gear for first responders and factory workers, workplace scanners and mobile computers.
“Honeywell’s success is our success,” said Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles. “It’s going to allow Charlotte and all of our region, all of our state to be an international influence in the technology sector,” she said. “And those are the advantages that you would expect when a Fortune 100 tech giant moves to your city.”
3.      The location
Our new building in Charlotte’s Uptown center city district will be directly across the street from Bank of America Stadium, where the NFL’s Carolina Panthers play.  Charlotte is referenced as “The Queen City” named after Queen Charlotte who was married to British King George III.
“There’s a very bright future for Honeywell, for the city and state, and we’re very proud to be a part of it,” Darius said.
The governor said he has a CEO mission statement for the state: “I want a North Carolina where people are better educated, where they’re healthier, where they have more money in their pockets and they have opportunities to live lives of purpose and abundance,” Governor Roy Cooper said. “That is what I want and what is happening today will help to further that statement.”
4.       The convenience
Charlotte, which is in Mecklenburg County, is the 16th largest city in U.S. and is home to one of the top busiest airports in the world, which sits about 7 miles from our under-construction headquarters building.
“The county has a great quality of life, it’s affordable when compared to peer cities and it has something for everyone,” said County Commission Chairman George Dunlap, adding “the impact of this relocation will be felt throughout the community as secondary jobs are created and supporting investment occurs from hospitality and health to consulting services."
The new site will also be a few blocks from a light rail stop.
Mayor Vi Lyles said she has told Honeywell employees about the perks of Charlotte as they moved to the city.
“I’ve sat and talked with them about our school system, restaurants, venues, all of the fun things they can do with their family,” she said.
5.       The impact
In addition to bringing jobs and economic activity to Charlotte, Honeywell wants to make a positive impact on our community.
“We don’t want to just live and work here,” Darius said, adding “We really want to have a profound impact on the community.”
Just weeks after officially making Charlotte our new headquarters, we organized a Family Code-in at Druid Hills Academy (pictured above.) We also supported a space exploration exhibit at the science center Discovery Place museum. Honeywell plans to continue investing in STEM education, disaster relief and inclusion and diversity initiatives in the Charlotte area.
"Honeywell has already established itself as a true community partner," the mayor said. "And they dedicated their time and their talent to making Charlotte a better place to live."
