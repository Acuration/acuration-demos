The Future Is... Quantum Computing
The Future Is... Quantum Computing
President of our quantum business Tony Uttley explains how the quantum computer will transform industries.
The world's highest performing quantum computer is here.
That means businesses are a step closer to leveraging the technology to solve problems that once weren't possible using analog computers.
"Think about the highest performing supercomputer that exists on the planet," Tony said. "It would take it the age of the universe to try to do the same computations that you would be able to eventually do on a quantum computer."
Tony explains what quantum computing will mean for industries like aerospace, banking and health care.
