Producers Midstream Chooses Honeywell Cryogenic Technology To Recover Natural Gas Liquids
Producers Midstream Chooses Honeywell Cryogenic Technology To Recover Natural Gas Liquids
November 16, 2017
DES PLAINES, Ill., Nov. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Producers Midstream LP will use UOP Russell modular cryogenic equipment to process 200 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas at its gas processing facility in the Delaware Basin in western Texas.
Cryogenic units extract high-value natural gas liquids (NGLs) from natural gas streams by refrigeration to extremely low temperatures. These NGLs ethane, propane and butanes are typically used for heating or to manufacture plastics, chemicals and fuels. When the new plant enters service next year, it will serve gas producers in the Wolfcamp, Bone Springs and Avalon formations of the Delaware Basin.
"This plant is designed for the varying feed gases common in the Delaware Basin," said Craig Ranta, business director, UOP Russell. "Because it's so flexible, the plant can deliver top recovery rates with changing gas composition, and with minimal downtime."
The plant's key mechanical equipment allows it to run at different capacities to accommodate additional wells and changes in feed supply. The plant also can switch between ethane rejection and recovery modes as demand for ethane changes.
"Producers Midstream selected UOP Russell because of our ability to customize specific designs based on operating philosophies, vendor preferences and broad experience with changing feeds," Ranta added. "In addition, the plant can be assembled, shipped, and put into operation very quickly, allowing Producers Midstream to begin generating revenue much sooner."
UOP Russell's pre-engineered modular equipment fits together easily and efficiently, significantly reducing construction time and expense, and enhancing reliability after start-up.
Dallas-based Producers Midstream LP provides a full suite of turnkey midstream solutions to producers working in the Delaware Basin. The company is backed by Tailwater Capital LLC, a specialized middle market private equity firm focused on the energy industry.
UOP LLC (www.uop.com), a division of Honeywell International Inc., is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. UOP is part of Honeywell International Inc.'s Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions (www.honeywellprocess.com), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries.
