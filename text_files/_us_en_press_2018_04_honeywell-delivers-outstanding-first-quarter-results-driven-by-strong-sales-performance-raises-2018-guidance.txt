April 3, 2018

• Reported Sales Up 9%; Organic Sales Up 5% Driven by Aerospace, Intelligrated, and Process Solutions
• Operating Cash Flow of $1.1 Billion and Free Cash Flow 1 (Excl. Separation Costs) of $1.0 Billion, Up 30%
• Deployed Nearly $950 Million in Capital to Share Repurchases in the First Quarter
• Raising Full-Year Sales, EPS 2 and Free Cash Flow 3 Guidance to Reflect Stronger Expectations
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., April 20, 2018 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and raised its full-year sales, earnings per share2 and free cash flow3 guidance.
“Honeywell had a very strong start to 2018, with first-quarter results that were driven by exceptional sales and operational performance. Organic sales grew 5 percent, driven by strong demand for original equipment for commercial aviation; U.S. defense; continued sales and orders growth in the warehouse automation business, Intelligrated; and short-cycle demand in process automation. Segment margin expanded by 40 basis points as a result of our Commercial Excellence efforts and from the Honeywell Operating System, including material productivity and volume leverage. Earnings per share (excluding separation costs) were $1.95, up 14 percent year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range,” said Darius Adamczyk, President and Chief Executive Officer of Honeywell. “Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to aggressively deploy capital. In the first quarter, were purchased nearly $950 million in Honeywell shares.
“As a result of our strong first-quarter performance, the healthy demand environment, and our continued confidence in our ability to execute, we are raising our full-year organic sales guidance to a new range of 3 percent to 5 percent and our earnings per share guidance2 to anew range of $7.85 to $8.05. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance3 by $0.1 billion after a strong first quarter,” Adamczyk continued.
“We are making great progress in transformingHoneywell into a software-industrial leader. In the first quarter, we had significant new Connected product launches and commercial wins across our portfolio. The preparations to spin-off our Transportation Systems and Homes businesses are well underway, and we expect those to be complete by the end of the year. This is an exciting time to be a customer, shareowner, or employee of Honeywell, and I am confident in our ability to continue to outperform,” Adamczyk concluded.
A summary of the Company’s full-year guidance changes can be found in Table 1.
Honeywell will discuss the results during an investor conference call today starting at 7:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.
First Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the first quarter were up 9 percent on a reported basis and up 5percent on an organic basis. The difference between reported and organic sales primarily relates to the impact of foreign currency translation. The first-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.
Aerospace sales for the first quarter were up 8 percent on an organic basis driven by growth in commercial OE and U.S. defense, and strength in light vehicle gas and commercial vehicle turbochargers in Transportation Systems. Segment margin expanded 10 bps to 22.5 percent, with benefits from commercial excellence, productivity, and lower customer incentives partially offset by higher volumes of lower-margin OEshipments, inflation, and foreign exchange.
Home and Building Technologies sales for the first quarter were up 2 percent on an organic basis driven by demand for residential thermal solutions and thermostats, continued strength in ADI on a global basis, and strong backlog conversion in the energy vertical within Building Solutions. Segment margin expanded 50 bps to 17.1 percent, primarily driven by commercial excellence, the benefits from previously funded and executed restructuring, and material productivity.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the first quarter were up 3 percent on an organic basis driven by strong short-cycle demand in thermal solutions, smart energy, maintenance services, and field instrumentation in Process Solutions, and engineering and catalyst growth in UOP. Segment margin was unchanged at 20.5 percent, primarily driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence, offset by unfavorable mix, primarily in UOP; catalyst shipment timing; and foreign exchange.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the first quarter were up 6percent on an organic basis driven by strong organic sales and orders growth at Intelligrated and higher volumes in Sensing. Segment margin expanded 130 bps to16.0 percent, primarily driven by higher sales volumes and productivity net of inflation.

This release contains certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that we or our management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon certain assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. The forward-looking statements included in this release are also subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services and prices, as well as the ability to effect the separations. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward-looking statements, including with respect to any changes in or abandonment of the proposed separations. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This release contains financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Honeywell’s non-GAAP financial measures used in this release are as follows: segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, a measure by which we assess operating performance, which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in the Appendix; segment margin, on an overall Honeywell basis, which we define as segment profit divided by sales; organic sales growth, which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following transaction date, and impacts from adoption of the new accounting guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that arise solely due to non-comparable accounting treatment of contracts existing in the prior period; free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and which we adjust to exclude impact of separation cost and adjustments to the provisional charge related to Tax Legislation, if and as noted in the release; and earnings per share, which we adjust to exclude pension mark-to-market expenses, as well as for other components, such as separation costs, the provisional charge related to Tax Legislation, and adjustments to such provisional charge, if and as noted in the release. Other than references to reported earnings per share, all references to earnings per share in this release are so adjusted. The respective tax rates applied when adjusting earnings per share for these items are identified in the release or in the reconciliations presented in the Appendix. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Refer to the Appendix attached to this release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
