Flint Hills Resources To Use Honeywell Connected Plant Technology To Ensure Optimal Refinery Operation
Flint Hills Resources To Use Honeywell Connected Plant Technology To Ensure Optimal Refinery Operation
June 21, 2017
DES PLAINES, Ill., June 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Flint Hills Resources will use the Honeywell Connected Plant Process Reliability Advisor to provide ongoing monitoring of the refinery's CCR Platforming™ unit along with early detection and mitigation of performance issues before they become costly. The CCR Platforming unit produces a range of transportation fuels.
Process Reliability Advisor works by continuously feeding plant data through Honeywell UOP process and fault models to provide key performance information and process recommendations. It helps plants run more smoothly and detects problems before they happen to mitigate issues that impact production and plant profitability.
"Process Reliability Advisor is unique because it applies Honeywell UOP's deep troubleshooting experience and proprietary models to recommend corrective operational adjustments far sooner than has ever been possible before," said Zak Alzein, vice president for Honeywell UOP's Connected Performance Services business. "As a result, it can help plants run at the top of their capability."
Honeywell's Connected Plant technologies combine the company's unmatched industrial expertise, software and digital technologies to make customers' operations more reliable, profitable and secure than ever before possible. As part of Honeywell's Connected Plant portfolio, Process Reliability Advisor gives refineries, petrochemical and gas processing plants greater visibility into their operations, helping to identify and resolve problems that often avoid detection and hamper production, and preventing unplanned shutdowns for maintenance and repair that can deprive plant operators millions of dollars per year in lost productivity.
"Flint Hills chose Process Reliability Advisor because it enables them to apply Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions for data management and analytics to their operations," Alzein said. "This service can tie plant data to the right domain knowledge to gain new insights to improve operational reliability."
Honeywell also offers Process Optimization Advisor, which continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies Honeywell UOP process models to determine the economic optimization.
Based in Wichita, Kan., Flint Hills Resources is an independent company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc., one of the largest private companies in America. Flint Hills Resources' three refineries have a combined crude oil processing capacity of more than 600,000 barrels per day. The Pine Bend Refinery in Rosemount, Minn., was established as the Great Northern Oil Company in 1955, and delivers transportation fuels throughout the Midwest. The Corpus Christi East and West refineries produce jet fuel, low-sulfur gasoline and diesel.
