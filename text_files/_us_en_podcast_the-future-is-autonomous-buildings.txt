The Future Is... Autonomous Buildings
The Future Is... Autonomous Buildings
Smart buildings are learning to operate themselves, just in time for a remote-first world.
People typically spend up to 90 percent of their time in buildings. With the coronavirus pandemic, commercial buildings are operating with much fewer occupants.
That’s possible, in part, because of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which enable autonomous operations.
“We’re starting to see evidence, strong evidence, that the world is realizing that autonomous really matters for business continuity,” said David Trice, the chief product officer for Honeywell Forge, our enterprise software business. “Being able to make decisions and judgements that are automatically pushed to a facility, to make the change or updates, or turn things off.”
Those actions are critical at a time when people can’t visit a location to make those changes for you, he added.
Check out The Future Is… podcast to find out what the future for autonomous buildings looks like in a post COVID-19 world.
