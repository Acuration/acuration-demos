At NFPA 2018, Honeywell Becomes First To Deliver Ul-Listed Connected Building Solution For First Responders
At NFPA 2018, Honeywell Becomes First To Deliver Ul-Listed Connected Building Solution For First Responders
June 12, 2018
Honeywell’s Bi-Directional Amplifier strengthens communication during crucial moments to ensure safety of first responders and lives of those they rescue. The new solution bolsters Honeywell’s continued efforts to deliver greater integration as part of its Connected Buildings roadmap. ATLANTA, June 8, 2018 – Achieving greater building connectivity through fire detection and safety solutions will be Honeywell’s (NYSE: HON) focus at this year’s National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Conference and Expo in Las Vegas from June 10-14. The company will announce a new, code-compliant Bi-Directional Amplifier (BDA) that boosts first responders’ signals. Honeywell’s BDA solution is the first and only all-inclusive, fully integrated system on the market that not only meets but exceeds NFPA/IFC specifications and UL standards. Reliable radio coverage is essential for first responders during emergencies. However, 56 percent of fire departments have experienced a communications failure within a building during an emergency incident within the last two years. Honeywell’s BDA solution offers an easy-to-install product that boosts signals to provide more reliable in-building coverage in mission-critical situations. “First responders risk their lives every day. Our BDA solution boosts signals throughout a building, giving first responders reliable radio service, so they can minimize threats to lives – theirs and those they rescue,” said Samir Jain, general manager at Honeywell Fire Americas. “As we look to the future, Honeywell is working hard to provide integrated solutions, utilizing some of our most-trusted and best-known brands as well as developing new technologies. Our ultimate goal is to integrate hardware, third party API and other offerings as part of our global connected building roadmap to better serve our customers.” Also on display at NFPA will be the latest products from across Honeywell’s family of brands: Notifier, Honeywell Gamewell-FCI, Honeywell Farenhyt Series, Honeywell Silent Knight, Fire-Lite Alarms and System Sensor. These include new life safety innovations and technology that reflect the latest in NFPA regulations and UL standards, like next generation smoke detectors and a new Unified Notification Platform that helps people communicate critical information more efficiently in environments like K-12 schools, universities, hospitals, office buildings, hotels, transportation infrastructures, factories, industrial parks and military bases.
