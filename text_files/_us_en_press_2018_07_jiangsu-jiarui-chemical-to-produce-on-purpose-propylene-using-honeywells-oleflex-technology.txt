Jiangsu Jiarui Chemical To Produce On-Purpose Propylene Using Honeywell's Oleflex Technology
Jiangsu Jiarui Chemical To Produce On-Purpose Propylene Using Honeywell's Oleflex Technology
July 22, 2018
DES PLAINES, Ill., July 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that Jiangsu Jiarui Chemical Co., Ltd. will use Honeywell UOP's C3 Oleflex™ technology to produce 450,000 metric tons per year of polymer-grade propylene at its facility in the Taixing Industrial Zone in China's Jiangsu Province.
Honeywell will provide licensing, the process design package, proprietary and non-proprietary equipment, on-site operator training, technical services for startup and continuing operation, and catalysts and adsorbents for the project, which is Honeywell's 33rd award in China for Oleflex technology.
"Historically, propylene has been produced as a byproduct of making ethylene from petroleum, but with the influx of lighter feedstocks, the amount of propylene from these manufacturing processes is dramatically reduced," said John Gugel, president of Honeywell UOP. "The Oleflex process addresses the growing propylene supply gap by producing on-purpose propylene from propane, which is in abundant supply."
Honeywell UOP's C3 Oleflex technology uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert propane to propylene. Its low energy consumption, low emissions and fully recyclable, platinum-alumina-based catalyst system minimizes its impact on the environment, and has a lower cash cost of production and higher return on investment compared to other technologies. The independent reaction and regeneration sections enable steady-state operations, improved operating flexibility, and a high on-stream factor and reliability.
Honeywell UOP also licenses C4 Oleflex technology, which converts butanes to butylenes, the primary ingredient for making high-octane fuel additives and synthetic rubber. Including this project, Honeywell UOP's Oleflex technology has been selected for 52 out of 64 propane and isobutane dehydrogenation projects globally since 2011.
Since the technology was first commercialized in 1990, Honeywell UOP has commissioned 29 Oleflex units for on-purpose propylene and isobutylene production. Global production capacity of propylene from Oleflex technology now stands at approximately 6.8 million metric tons per year.
Jiangsu Jiarui Chemical Co. Ltd., is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jiangsu Sanmu Group. The company is a diversified large-scale trans-regional and multi-industry enterprise engaged in R&D, manufacturing and sales of synthetic resin, solvent, fine chemical material and related products.
Honeywell UOP (www.uop.com) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries.
