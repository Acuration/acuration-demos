Honeywell Lights Way For Singapore Airport Expansion
Honeywell Lights Way For Singapore Airport Expansion
February 16, 2017
SINGAPORE, Feb. 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced a multi-million dollar, multi-year contract to implement a new airfield ground lighting control and monitoring system at Singapore Changi Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest hub and one of the most frequented airports in the world. The Honeywell system will play a critical role in helping Changi Airport safely and efficiently accommodate the expected increase in aircraft traffic.
The project is part of expansion efforts at Changi Airport, which include the development of a three-runway system. The new Honeywell system will cover all three runways and associated taxiways, taxi lanes and apron lighting as well as facility control and management. Helping streamline operations and optimize ground traffic flow, Honeywell's advanced Individual Lamp Control and Monitoring System will allow the airport to get real-time information on approach and runway lighting lamp failures, including the precise location to facilitate fast response and repair.
"Since its opening in 1981, Changi Airport has been recognized for ensuring safety in its airfield," said Koh Ming Sue, managing director, engineering & development of Changi Airport Group. "The new Honeywell airfield lighting control and monitoring system serves as an important cog in our broader expansion plans to help upkeep our safety and efficiency performance even as air traffic demand grows beyond the capacity of our existing two runways."
"We are excited to have been chosen by Changi Airport Group and look forward to working with them to maintain the airport's high safety and efficiency record," said Raghu Seelamonthula, market director of Airport Systems, Honeywell Building Solutions. "Airfield ground lighting, as a visual aid for landing and taxiing, is an important element of an airport's equipment. Honeywell's airfield lighting control and monitoring have proven to be highly reliable with equally high availability rates in operations throughout the globe."
Lighting installations for approaches, runways, taxiways, and aprons enable pilots to navigate the complex surface layouts of modern airports. Honeywell's computerized control and monitoring system facilitates the operation and observation of these lighting installations, and ensures that safety requirements are met. This system provides workstations for tower and technical personnel to simplify daily operational processes and optimize maintenance activities.
Honeywell designs, manufactures and installs complete airfield ground lighting systems for airports. The systems range from individual lighting units to series circuit transformers and power supply systems to control and monitoring systems, including single lamp control and monitoring, routing systems, aircraft docking systems, and surface movement guidance systems.
