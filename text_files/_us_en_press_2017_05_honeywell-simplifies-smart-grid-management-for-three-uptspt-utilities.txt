Honeywell Simplifies Smart Grid Management For Three U.S. Utilities
Honeywell Simplifies Smart Grid Management For Three U.S. Utilities
May 25, 2017
ATLANTA, May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced it will provide three power providers in the United States with managed smart grid services that offer a simpler way to manage very technical smart grid networks, and enable improved electricity service and reliability for their customers. The Honeywell subscription services offer an alternative for smaller utilities, which typically have fewer IT resources, that choose not to own and manage their own advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) software. Managing AMI software is a resource-intensive task that many smaller utilities often struggle to accomodate.
The three managed services subscribers that will use Honeywell-managed and maintained smart grid software -- municipal utilities in the cities of Glenwood Springs, Colo., and St. John, Kansas, as well as Yakama Power in Toppenish, Wash. – will realize the full benefits of an AMI system, including reduced operating expenses and the ability to better serve customers through improved billing accuracy and faster outage recovery.
"Utilities have to provide power in a consistent and reliable way, but grid modernization makes this complex because it involves choosing the right smart grid framework and ensuring its ongoing management," said Nitin S. Kulkarni, president of Smart Energy, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. "This can be particularly challenging for smaller communities and their IT resources. Honeywell's expertise and connected services reduce risk and provide added resources to level the playing field for all utilities so they can focus on their core business."
Through the Honeywell managed services subscriptions, all three utilities will receive portal access and analytics for Honeywell's EnergyAxis® connected electricity meters. The meters will provide data on customer energy consumption to enable more accurate billing, and also help detect meter tampering and outages for faster power restoration.
"As a smaller utility, we have many of the same fundamental objectives as any large power provider, but the added obstacle of operating with often limited resources – especially when it comes to IT," said Jeff Williamson, utility director for the City of St. John, Kansas. "Honeywell's managed smart grid services help us more easily cover off on important network management tasks so we can focus on our ultimate objective of providing our customers with affordable and reliable power."
In addition to receiving EnergyAxis® connected electric meters and subscription access to the collected meter data, details for each of the managed services projects include:
City of Glenwood Springs, Colorado – Glenwood Springs sits at an elevation of about 5,700 feet on the western side of the Continental Divide, approximately 85 miles northeast of Grand Junction, Colorado. The Glenwood Springs Electric System's selection of Honeywell managed smart grid services follows a successful pilot project that tested the services. For the full project, the utility will use the services to streamline billing and better monitor and manage grid assets to serve the city's more than 9,900 residents. The services will integrate with the utility's existing meter data management (MDM) system, which is also from Honeywell.
City of St. John, Kansas – As a small community comprised of about 1,300 residents and located approximately 75 miles east of Dodge City, Kansas, St. John chose Honeywell managed smart grid services for enhanced billing readings as well as for the portal's enhanced monitoring capabilities. The additional insights from Honeywell's services will allow the utility to monitor grid resources and system performance to identify overloaded transformers and outages. The utility is also deploying Honeywell smart water meters in addition to electricity meters, and will leverage Honeywell meter installation services to expedite deployment.
Yakama Power – Located in Toppenish, Washington, Yakama Power sits in the fertile Yakama Valley between two mountain ranges, equal distance from Portland and Seattle. This service area, known for extreme weather conditions, is expected to benefit from Honeywell-managed smart grid services outage and restoration notifications. In addition to power metering for residential and agricultural customers, Yakama Power serves more than 30,000 members of the Yakama Nation.
Honeywell provides complete smart grid and energy management solutions that drive energy efficiency, operational improvements and cost savings for utilities, commercial and industrial customers, and consumers. Honeywell has more than 130 utility-managed EnergyAxis deployments worldwide, including 81 in the United States, as well as more than 20 managed services deployments.
