Honeywell Partners With Bluefletch to Help Companies Migrate Mobile Devices to Android
Honeywell Partners With Bluefletch to Help Companies Migrate Mobile Devices to Android
With support ending for popular legacy operating systems, Android allows for greater reliability and a longer operating lifecycle in retail and industrial facilities
September 2, 2019
CHARLOTTE, N.C., Sept. 3, 2019 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today it is collaborating with BlueFletch, a mobile development consultancy firm, to help companies migrate their mobile devices from legacy operating systems to the AndroidTM operating system.
Honeywell is now an authorized reseller of BlueFletch's award-winning custom app development and legacy migration services, offering retailers, manufacturers, and other industrial customers a specialized program to implement or enhance their enterprise mobile strategy.
BlueFletch has performed some of the largest legacy-to-modern Android operating system mobile migrations, working with companies including The Home Depot, JCPenney, Havertys and Academy Sports to help migrate more than 100 mobile apps and more than 100,000 devices.
“Microsoft will stop issuing security patches and software updates for rugged environments by 2020, leaving many companies with the challenge of migrating from legacy Windows devices to operating systems like Android to complete daily tasks,” said Taylor Smith, chief marketing officer of Honeywell’s Productivity Products business. “Our partnership with BlueFletch gives companies a great option for those requiring new applications but do not have the internal resources to replicate the years of business process development built into their existing applications.”
Less than five years ago, Windows was the most dominant operating system in rugged environments, with industry analysts stating four out of five facilities using it in 2014. Today, the Android operating system has become the standard for industrial mobile devices.
Using a “Think, Build, Prove” methodology, BlueFletch consults with companies and gives a roadmap on how to efficiently and quickly get apps onto the Android operating system. Once the discovery and analysis is complete, companies can use the firm’s skilled in-house designers, developers, project managers, and QA team to help get applications ported to the Android system – often in a few weeks. Once complete, the BlueFletch team will get a company’s internal teams up to speed developing modern mobile applications on the Android system.
“With the retirement of Windows CE, Android is the rugged enterprise platform of the future,” said Richard Makerson, CEO of BlueFletch. “For years, BlueFletch has helped our clients move fast and deliver results for mobility projects critical to the business, and we’re looking forward to helping Honeywell clients measure proof-of-concept mobile solutions to allow enterprises to prepare for what’s next.”
Honeywell helps companies confidently select, deploy and manage Android operating system devices and services. As part of the Google-led Android Enterprise Recommended Managed Service Provider program, Honeywell provides customers more confidence in deploying Android solutions and making sure their enterprise mobility deployment is consistent and current.
Honeywell provides customers with a comprehensive set of enterprise services that addresses every phase of the mobility lifecycle to help streamline operations and reduce IT-related costs. Honeywell globally manages more than 2 million devices, such as smartphones, tablets and ruggedized mobile computers.
Honeywell is one of the only companies that delivers both Android Enterprise Recommended mobile devices and managed services. Honeywell's validated devices are built on the company's Mobility EdgeTM Platform, a common hardware architecture and set of software tools that provide IT departments with an agile approach for deploying, managing and updating devices.
Mobile devices built on the scalable Mobility Edge Platform help extend product lifecycles by supporting current and future versions of the Android operating system. Honeywell is one of the only rugged mobile computer providers to commit to supporting through at least Android R.
