U.S. Vice President Recognizes Honeywell's Four-Decade Partnership With Indonesia's Aerospace Industry
U.S. Vice President Recognizes Honeywell's Four-Decade Partnership With Indonesia's Aerospace Industry
April 24, 2017
JAKARTA, Indonesia, April 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today held a signing ceremony for the purchase of 34 engines from PT Dirgantara Indonesia during U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Jakarta to meet with President Joko Widodo and Indonesian business leaders. The engine agreement is the largest aerospace contract between Honeywell and PT Dirgantara Indonesia to date, a testament to the strong, long-standing partnership that Honeywell has with Indonesia's aerospace industry.
Honeywell will supply its TPE331 turboprop engines for PT Dirgantara Indonesia's NC212i aircraft over the next four years and is expected to deliver the first six engines later this year, with the rest delivered through 2020.
Honeywell's TPE331 turboprop engines will support PT Dirgantara Indonesia's (PTDI) NC212i aircraft with faster takeoffs and climbs, and more efficient cruise speeds, while reducing fuel burn and related fuel and operating costs. In addition, as part of Honeywell's strategy for high-growth regions like Indonesia, Honeywell will provide maintenance and support training for six PTDI engineers to promote line-maintenance skills for the TPE331 and transfer technical knowledge to locally based companies. Before this agreement, Honeywell was selected to supply 11 TPE331 engines for PTDI's NC212-400 and NC212i fleet in 2015.
"Honeywell and PTDI have shared a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship for over 40 years, and we are optimistic that our partnership will continue to climb to greater heights. This is a testament to Indonesia's strong and positive relations with the U.S.," said Alex Pollack, president, Honeywell Indonesia. "Indonesia is a priority market and key high-growth region for Honeywell, and we are committed to empowering local companies like PTDI with technology and skills transfer as it expands its capabilities across the region. Our cooperation with PTDI keeps getting better every year. It is a mutual, synergistic partnership that has led to the delivery of a great aircraft, with a great engine performance, utilized around the world."
"This is the largest aircraft deal PTDI and Honeywell have ever signed, and we are proud to partner with Honeywell whose engines are well-aligned with our reliability and cost-efficiency needs. Honeywell's TPE331 engine is one of the most reliable and proven turboprop engines in the world, and meets our stringent requirements for selecting engines for our aircraft," said Budi Santoso, president director, PTDI. "We are confident that the agreement with Honeywell will further strengthen our capabilities as an aircraft manufacturer in the region."
Honeywell's diversified products and solutions have been distributed and installed in Indonesia since 1974. In 1992, Honeywell established its first Indonesian office, which maintains a network of local distribution companies. Today, Honeywell employs more than 1,200 employees in cities across the country, including Jakarta, Surabaya, Batam and Bintan.
In January 2017, Honeywell Indonesia participated in a workshop conducted by the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta for the Indonesia Aviation Working Group, which focused on upgrading Indonesia's aviation safety regulatory apparatus, and airline and airport security. The newly appointed Minister of Transportation, Budi Karya Sumadi, encouraged foreign investment and technical assistance with infrastructure development through public-private partnerships for "small airports" in such remote areas as Papua.
