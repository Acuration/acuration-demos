Honeywell Joins Clean Sky Joint Undertaking To Advance Green Aviation Technology Across Europe
Honeywell Joins Clean Sky Joint Undertaking To Advance Green Aviation Technology Across Europe
February 8, 2017
ROLLE, Switzerland, Feb. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has joined the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking, the largest European research program developing innovative technologies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions and noise levels produced by aircraft.
As a core partner of Clean Sky, Honeywell received funding worth 35 million euros to back the development of aerospace technologies in support of the initiative. The funding will further strengthen Honeywell's commitment to its European engineering centers, particularly in the Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom.
As part of its membership, Honeywell will undertake projects to develop priority technologies from cockpit solutions to health monitoring. It will also use the funding to advance its electromechanical actuators, which help improve aircraft performance and encourage lower operating costs.
"Honeywell is honored to join the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking as a core partner. We are committed to enhancing Honeywell technology to make a positive impact on the environment, while providing added value to help our customers drive their businesses forward," said George Papageorgiou, engineering director, Advanced Technology, Honeywell Aerospace. "We are eager to apply our significant expertise in aviation technology to develop innovative solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and noise levels produced by aircraft and help shape greener aviation across Europe."
"Ensuring the continued advancement of environmental sustainability and the competitiveness of the European aviation industry would not be possible without the strong support of key European aerospace innovation players, including leading industry suppliers such as Honeywell, research establishments, universities and small to medium-size enterprises," said Ron van Manen, Clean Sky 2 programme manager. "We are excited to welcome Honeywell as a new member of the Joint Undertaking and look forward to working together on projects that will enable cleaner and greener aviation and that will strengthen European industrial leadership. Honeywell's aerospace capabilities in the Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom will enable the development of new technologies and solutions in Europe through participation in the Clean Sky 2 Programme."
Aircraft manufacturers, including Honeywell customers Airbus, Dassault and Leonardo Aircraft, are involved in the development of new technologies as part of the Clean Sky 2 programme, including leadership in initial requirement assessment, testing and validation exercises. Ultimately, customers will benefit from a shorter supply chain and the added value of developing advanced technology closely with Honeywell, which will help increase their competitiveness and significantly reduce their product costs.
Honeywell has been awarded four Clean Sky 2 grants for projects with a duration of between four and eight years. Clean Sky is funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 framework program, which aims to shape the future of scientific research both across Europe and globally.
