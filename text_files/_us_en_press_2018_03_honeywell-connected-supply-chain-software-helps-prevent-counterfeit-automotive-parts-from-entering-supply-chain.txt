Honeywell Connected Supply Chain Software Helps Prevent Counterfeit Automotive Parts From Entering Supply Chain
Honeywell Connected Supply Chain Software Helps Prevent Counterfeit Automotive Parts From Entering Supply Chain
August 13, 2018
FORT MILL, S.C., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced its cloud-based, track-and-trace solution is being used by German automotive products companies to detect counterfeit products globally.
Honeywell collaborated with automotive aftermarket provider TecAlliance to develop the oneIDentity+ service platform, which authenticates and tracks individual components for major auto parts manufacturers. TecAlliance is providing its automotive customers with the platform, which assigns each component a specific digital identification label that can be tracked with a mobile device at all points from manufacturing to delivery.
The application runs on the Honeywell Movilizer cloud platform and provides end-to-end visibility and electronic documentation about where an item has traveled throughout the supply chain. It provides each product with a unique identifier code to allow the item to be tracked at any point – whether it is loaded onto a truck, unloaded at a distribution center or shipped to an end-user.
"Track-and-trace regulations and increasingly complex supply chain operations are driving the need for visibility all the way down to the individual component level," said Taylor Smith, president of Honeywell's Workflow Solutions business. "With our cloud-based authentication solution, we're providing our customers with an unparalleled degree of transparency and simplifying the process to comply with regulatory mandates. We can, for example, help mechanics ensure the automotive parts they are using came from the original manufacturer and were not switched for a counterfeit alternative at some point during the logistics process."
The oneIDentity+ service platform provides manufacturers, suppliers and dealers with a single, standardized system of clearly marked products that can be accessed via a mobile device at any time. It allows end users and stakeholders to review a serial number that verifies the identity of the component.
"Companies across many industries need a cross-company, flexible and standards-based service platform - not only in the automotive sector," explained Dr.-Ing. Daniel D√ºnnebacke, chief operating operator of oneIDentity+ at TecAlliance. "oneIDentity+ enables role-based delivery of information, documents and processes to meet the needs of businesses in an increasingly digital and mobile world."
Customs officials, for example, can scan a label to confirm that the item is an original component and has not been exchanged for counterfeit alternative. Users can also access a database of additional information such as product details and vehicle repair and maintenance data that can be used for mobile marketing activities.
Honeywell provides scalable track-and-trace solutions that can be adapted by companies to track products across a range of markets, including pharmaceuticals, baby food, tobacco and volatile materials. Honeywell is currently working with companies in the tobacco industry to help them comply with European Union regulatory directives, which will require tobacco companies to track every single tobacco product as it leaves the manufacturing plant and is bought by a consumer.
Honeywell Movilizer is a mobile application development platform used by companies with mobile workers who perform service, maintenance, sales, distribution and logistics activities. Partners and customers use Movilizer to create more than 500 unique applications for fleet management, field service, delivery, asset rental management, mobile order entry, as well as time and attendance reporting tasks. More than 200 multinational companies use the platform to conduct more than 3.5 million cloud transactions each day.
