Meet a #futureshaper: Soundari Arunachalam
Meet a #futureshaper: Soundari Arunachalam
She is making the utility experience of the future.
Soundari Arunachalam has been with Honeywell for nearly two decades.
As a principal systems engineer she works with her team to create energy meters and software for electricity, water and gas. That helps measure energy consumption of households, commercial establishments and industrial factories.
Based in Bangalore, India; here is her #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
An engineer! I come from a family of engineers. My brothers, cousins and uncles – all of them are engineers.
What brought you to Honeywell?
I got in through campus recruitment from Government College of Engineering, Coimbatore in the Southern part of India.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
Being challenged and witnessing amazing talent at work. Every day I learn personally and professionally.
Did you ever imagine you would end up in the job you are now?
Not really! I knew that I would stick to the technical field. But I did not know I would become an architect with end-to-end technical responsibility of a project, interacting with internal stakeholders and customers to define product roadmaps.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
The future of the energy industry will be driven by decentralized, distributed generation of energy. The energy grid will undergo welcome changes. Utilities will increase their digitization and cybersecurity initiatives.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
According to me, a #futureshaper should be confident, positive and committed. They should be a visionary and dare enough to enter the unknown.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Get out of your comfort zone. Embrace change. Keep learning and always look for progress.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I like to dance, shop, watch movies and read fiction.
