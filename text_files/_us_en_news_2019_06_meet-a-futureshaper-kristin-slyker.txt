Meet a #futureshaper: Kristin Slyker
Meet a #futureshaper: Kristin Slyker
Here’s how she’s making plans for takeoff before planes even land
June 9, 2019
Kristin helps make air travel safer, more comfortable, more predictable and better for the environment.
She oversees customers and partners for Honeywell Connected Enterprise Aerospace, leading the future of flight.
Kristin wants to shape a better future for the next generation. That includes her son, nieces, nephews and “those that will live with the things we decide and do today.”
Based in Phoenix, here is her #futureshaper story:
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?  I thought I would be a pediatrician.  My mind was changed by my uncle who was working in Information Technology as I entered university.  He had a fun job in a growing field and I got interested in it.  I have always enjoyed science.
What do you do? I am helping to make air travel safer, more comfortable, and more predictable.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day? Getting to work with fun, intelligent peers.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell? The breadth of inventions that we have produced that really make the world better – we are WAY more than just thermostats.  I wish my friends knew just how many things Honeywell makes that power the world around them.
How has Honeywell changed since you began working here?  Honeywell has evolved from being a primarily industrial company to a much more software-focused company.  We continue to improve our focus on growth.
Why is the future important?  I want to shape a better future for my son, nieces, nephews….those that will live with the things we decide and do today.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper has?  Passion, smarts, an ability to see the big picture, a practical thought process, an ability to take an idea and make it reality.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?  Flight will continue to become more and more automated, with a decreased carbon footprint, with the ability to increasingly meet passenger demands for a less chaotic, more reliable means to travel.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps? Try lots of things, expand your horizons.  Take some roles you never thought you would.  Take jobs that sound fun to you – it will give you energy to tackle them with passion and success.
What do you for fun?   Tennis, working out, time in northern Arizona, shopping, time with family, travel.
