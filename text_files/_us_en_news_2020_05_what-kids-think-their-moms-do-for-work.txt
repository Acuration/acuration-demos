What Kids Think Their Moms Do for Work
What Kids Think Their Moms Do for Work
Whether children are little, or adults themselves, their moms’ careers can be a mystery.
What does a vice president do? What about an engineer? Why are there so many meetings?
Now because of the COVID-19 pandemic, children who are schooling at home have seen their mothers in action, as parents work from home.
Here’s what some Honeywell moms have to say about their children’s reaction to watching them work.
Amanda King, Ed.D. vice president and general manager Aerospace connected secure solutions (pictured above)
Children: Grant, 5 and Lincoln, 3
What do your children say about your job, now that they have seen you in action?
My husband told them a couple years ago that “Mommy makes airplanes fly” to simplify what I do. They think that’s pretty awesome! Every time an airplane or helicopter flies by the house they race to the backyard and ask if it’s one of “Mommy’s airplanes”. We created Science Saturdays which range from chemical reactions to the wonder of flight to keep them interested in having a career in technology one day too.
Gillian Chandrasena, vice president of HR, Honeywell Building Solutions
Children: Liyoni, 7 and Roshan, almost 3
What do your children say about your job, now that they have seen you in action?
Liyoni regularly asks me if I EVER stop talking on the phone! She proudly commandeers any Honeywell swag as her own and can’t wait to visit the office again (promising to be very quiet and well behaved.) She was particularly impressed that President Donald Trump visited one of our facilities, and rather disappointed that I didn’t manage to get her an invite!
Jennifer Carpenter, vice president of HR for Safety and Productivity
Children:  Kaitlyn, 9 and Evan, 7
What do your children say about your job, now that they have seen you in action?
My kids are most interested in how I can sit in front of a computer all day and keep working; I can’t determine if they find that admirable or just plain crazy.  They keep telling me I have too many “meetings.” My daughter is also like a mini coach – she will call me out when I sound frustrated on a call or recognize me when the call sounded like “fun” (she hears laughter).  In a strange way, it has helped me reflect on how I communicate.
Angie Oberman, global general manager, Honeywell Building Technologies
Children: Kellen, 9
What do your children say about your job, now that they have seen you in action?
Most days, my son tells me he wants to be a Major League Baseball player so he never has to do conference calls! But he really does ask a lot of questions about what I do and what our business does. He is proud of me for being a “boss” and thinks our security solutions are something out of a movie. He’s very impressed! What always gets me is when I see him on his school laptop, hands hovered over the keys pretending to type furiously. He’ll look up at me, smile and say, “See Mom, I’m just as good as you!”
Udaya Shrivastava, chief technology officer, Honeywell Building Technologies
Children: Dhruv Shrivastava, 17
What do your children say about your job, now that they have seen you in action?
My son appreciates the “decisions” I make throughout the day between thinking in terms of business and instantly shifting towards technology. He understands that being a global leader is a job of impeccable caliber and the effect it has on our society. Fire hazards are always a consideration for when there’re new infrastructures around the world, and with Honeywell being at the forefront of the building technologies industry, what better way to serve the global community.
Guadalupe Valadez Eslava, advanced controls engineer, Honeywell Intelligrated
Children: Fernanda Abril Figueroa Valadez, 19 and Francisco Ivan Figueroa Valadez, 16
What do your children say about your job, now that they have seen you in action?
Fernanda said: “For me my mom is an inspiration. Her work is one that requires effort and needs to be 100 percent attentive to [customer] facilities.  My mom's perseverance, intelligence and audacity make her an essential part of the team she's on.”
Barbara Dean-Hendricks, vice president of business operations, Honeywell Building Technologies
Children: Kelli, 20 and Mike, 17
What do your children say about your job, now that they have seen you in action?
They knew I had an important job and made a lot of decisions, but now they say they really know. They like how I help people move roadblocks out of the way and help them be successful and when people call me for help. My son has asked a lot of questions on how I know what to do and how I make decisions, which has led to some interesting conversations. Definitely a new appreciation for how busy I am at work.
