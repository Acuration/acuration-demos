February 22, 2021
ATLANTA, February 22, 2021 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON), a global leader in connected buildings, announced today the launch of the Honeywell E-Mon Class 6000 product range, a new generation of multi-protocol-capable energy meters to provide fast, accurate tenant billing or to optimize a building’s energy use.

The Honeywell E-Mon Class 6200 energy meters are easy to use, with an app-guided installation process, commissioning and troubleshooting, as well as built-in cybersecurity to protect against attacks. The Honeywell E-mon Class 6200 submeters help protect data integrity, both on-site and online, with a lockable enclosure and encrypted communications to securely exchange data between the devices and app functions.
“The Honeywell E-Mon Class 6000 meters can help building owners better monitor, measure and manage energy use throughout a building in an easy-to-install and operate form,” said Mike Garceau, general manager of Building Management Systems North America, Honeywell. “With the intuitive E-Mon app, users can quickly commission the meters and feel confident in its reliable daily operation.”
Installers and planners benefit from straightforward, quick commissioning and troubleshooting via the E-Mon app. The app allows installers and planners to:

The app also allows facility managers and building owners to automatically take readings. The Honeywell E-Mon Class 6000 meters can be integrated into Honeywell applications quickly and seamlessly, using Interval Data Recorders, I/O modules or direct controllers.
The E-Mon app is currently available for Android only. Future versions within the E-Mon 6000 Series will include additional communication options, such as BACnet or Modbus.
