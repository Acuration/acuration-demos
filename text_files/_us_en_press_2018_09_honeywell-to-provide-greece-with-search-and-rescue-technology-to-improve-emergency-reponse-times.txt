Honeywell to Provide Greece with Search and Rescue Technology to Improve Emergency Response Times
Honeywell to Provide Greece with Search and Rescue Technology to Improve Emergency Response Times
September 24, 2018
FORT MILL, S.C., Sept. 24, 2018 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that it has signed an agreement with the Greek Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy to upgrade Greece's search and rescue operations using next-generation, satellite-based tracking technology.
Under the agreement, Honeywell will provide the Hellenic Center of Mission Control with eight satellite antennas, three rescue control systems, computer equipment, as well as installation, customization, training and technical support services for seven years. Using satellite signals, Honeywell's technology can precisely locate emergency distress beacons and coordinate the deployment of rapid response teams.
“By leveraging a network of ground-based antennas and medium earth orbit satellites, we can more precisely locate distress signals from emergency beacons,” said Mehrez Hached, director of business development for Honeywell's Global Tracking and Search and Rescue business. “This Honeywell solution will help the Greek National Search and Rescue Coordination Center and the Hellenic Coast Guard save lives by quickly identifying aircraft, ships and people in distress regardless of how remote their location.”
Honeywell will install the satellite antennas on sites operated by the Hellenic Air Force and deploy management and surveillance equipment to the Hellenic Coast Guard Headquarters in Piraeus, Greece. The technology incorporates the COSPAS-SARSAT system, an international satellite-based program for distress alert detection and information distribution.
Honeywell's search and rescue solutions are part of the company's Safety and Productivity Solutions business. Honeywell provides fixed antennas, terminals, consoles and software applications to quickly locate missing assets on land or at sea and minimize emergency response times. The company's software offerings include SARMaster Search, a full-featured incident management application used by frontline operators to coordinate rescue operations, which has helped save tens of thousands of lives.
Honeywell's tracking technology was incorporated into the European Space Agency's Galileo search and rescue program, a pan-European program designed to dramatically reduce emergency response times using geo-positioning satellites. Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS) provides products, software and connected solutions that improve productivity, workplace safety and asset performance for our customers across the globe.
