Honeywell And NASA Fuse Hip-Hop And Physics In STEM Education Show For Virginia Students
Honeywell And NASA Fuse Hip-Hop And Physics In STEM Education Show For Virginia Students
May 22, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) and NASA are bringing FMA Live! Forces in Motion, an award-winning hip-hop educational experience, to middle school students in Virginia this week. FMA Live! has already traveled to middle schools in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Washington, D.C., and is now making its way back to Virginia to conclude its 26th tour. Starting Monday, FMA Live! will perform in front of Virginia students at J.M. Dozier Middle School, Ethel M. Gildersleeve Middle School and will conclude the tour at Booker T. Washington Middle School.
Since 2004, FMA Live! has traveled nearly 112,000 miles to more than 1,200 schools and performed for 480,000 students in 48 contiguous U.S. states, as well as in Mexico and Canada. The one-of-a-kind show promoting science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) incorporates hip-hop music, dancers, student volunteers, and on-stage, interactive science experiments to demonstrate how physics is part of everyday life.
"FMA Live! is designed to encourage the kids of today to take an interest in becoming our future scientists and mathematicians," said Mike Kincaid, NASA's acting associate administrator for Education. "It is important for students to understand that creativity and personal style can be mixed in with a STEM education. With our long-term partner Honeywell, we are showing students that a career in a STEM-related field is within their grasp if they want to pursue it."
Each performance focuses on Newton's law of universal gravitation and three laws of motion. FMA Live! is named after Newton's second law of motion (Force equals Mass times Acceleration) and uses music videos and interactive scientific demonstrations to teach and inspire students to pursue STEM careers.
"With each school performance, Honeywell and NASA are helping to prepare more students to take an interest in STEM and become our future problem-solvers," said Mike Bennett, president, Honeywell Hometown Solutions. "The longevity of FMA Live! is a testament to how influential interactive STEM programs can be to students."
The FMA Live! Forces in Motion experience also features an online "Teachers' Lounge" that includes National Science Education Standards-based teaching resources including downloadable streaming videos, music from the show and a comprehensive educational guide with lesson plans. This digital tool maintains post-show momentum and can be incorporated into classroom learning objectives throughout the school year.
About FMA Live!
Using live actors, hip-hop songs, music videos, interactive scientific demonstrations and video interviews with scientists and engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the show teaches Newton's Three Laws of Motion and Universal Law of Gravity.
Honeywell and NASA created FMA Live! in 2004 to inspire middle school students to explore STEM concepts and careers. The program addresses Forces and Motion learning objectives outlined by the Next Generation Science Education Standards for students in grades 5‚Äí8.
Through Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the company has a number of award-winning programs focused on inspiring students at all grade levels to embrace STEM education. The company chose physics for FMA Live! Forces in Motion because studies have shown that the middle school years offer the best window of opportunity to get students interested in STEM careers.
