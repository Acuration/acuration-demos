Honeywell Expands Connected Aircraft Solutions To The Most Overlooked Part Of Aerospace: The Ground
Honeywell Expands Connected Aircraft Solutions To The Most Overlooked Part Of Aerospace: The Ground
April 3, 2018
PHOENIX, April 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is expanding its GoDirect® connected services to one of the last unconnected aerospace frontiers, the ground. A new agreement with global telematics company Pinnacle will enable the two companies to connect an airport's ramp service into one single, managed solution that provides airlines and ground handlers with real-time insights into vehicle activity anywhere at the airport. The result is better on-time performance, lower maintenance costs and greater fuel efficiency.
A connected ramp solution from Honeywell and Pinnacle creates a new way for airlines and airports to increase safety and efficiency. Telematics hardware on ground vehicles transmits data, which feeds into advanced software that give airlines and ground handlers actionable data at their fingertips. This combination of connectivity and telematics provides real-time insights into vehicle use and maintenance requirements, as well as exact locations of all ramp operations. Airlines and ground handlers can utilize predictive maintenance for ground support equipment and also see reduced fuel costs for planes due to quicker turnaround times on the ground.
"The ability to provide ramp operators with connected services combined with telematics creates a new connected ramp reality that addresses one of the last untapped areas in the aerospace industry," said Kristin Slyker, vice president, Connected Aircraft, Honeywell Aerospace. "We're ready to implement this new approach today for any customer ready to improve safety and operational efficiency on the ramp from the moment an aircraft lands until that same aircraft is airborne again."
Why Honeywell and Pinnacle?
Honeywell has more than 100 years of aerospace industry experience and a growing group of GoDirect connected services. Paired with Pinnacle's 15 years of research and development and deployment of telematics solutions for Airport Ground Support Equipment, the two companies have created a solution for airlines and airports to improve ground operations efficiency.
In addition, Honeywell and Pinnacle's connected ramp solution can deliver:
Up to 15 percent reduction in maintenance costs due to reduced vehicle requirements
10 to 45 percent reduction in the cost of damage due to improved safety adherence (e.g., speeding), location awareness, vehicle status (e.g., stairs locked in place), etc.
Up to a five-minute reduction in average aircraft turnaround time
