Next Generation of Total Connect HD Indoor and Outdoor Video Cameras offer smart home security through intelligent analytics for both dealers and homeowners
ATLANTA, Aug. 21, 2017 &endash; Honeywell (NYSE: HON), a leader in connected home technology, announces new Total Connect® HD Indoor and Outdoor Video Cameras designed to give homeowners even more control over their home. Professionally managed, the cameras allow homeowners on-demand access to high-definition video through the Honeywell Total Connect Remote Services application.
With built-in intelligent analytics, homeowners have increased insight into activity within their homes. For all three cameras, users can look in on their home and take a snapshot of activity, while the indoor cameras also allow users to hear and speak with those in the home. Additional advanced features include new QR code-based set up for a quick install, wide angle view, night vision, audio analytics, cloud storage, microSD card backup storage and pinch-to-zoom monitoring capabilities.
Designed for residential use, the new Honeywell Total Connect HD Indoor and Outdoor Video Cameras include:
Honeywell IPCAM-WIC1, designed for indoor use and offers high-definition video at up to 720p and monitors up to two detection areas.
Honeywell IPCAM-WIC2, an indoor high-definition video camera that provides video up to 1080p, monitors up to four detection areas and offers two-way audio.
Honeywell IPCAM-WOC1, secures outdoor spaces with high-definition video up to 1080p with a wide viewing angle to monitor driveways and walkways.
“This next generation of indoor and outdoor cameras provides added comfort for users by making it easy to check in on their children or pets while left home alone,” said Alice DeBiasio, vice president and general manager of Health, Fire and Security Software, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “Beyond convenience, the next generation of Honeywell Total Connect Video Services also offers more revenue and RMR opportunities for dealers, while meeting the demand of their customers.”
The Honeywell WIC1 is available to dealers now, with the WIC2 and WOC1 shipping in late summer and into fall 2017.
