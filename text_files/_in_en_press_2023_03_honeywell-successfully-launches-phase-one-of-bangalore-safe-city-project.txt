Honeywell Successfully Launches Phase One Of Bangalore Safe City Project
The project includes the installation of more than 7000 cameras in more than 3000 strategic locations across the city along with a state-of-the-art Command and Control Center for City Surveillance
28 March 2023
Bengaluru, March 28, 2023 – Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced it has successfully implemented phase one of the Bangalore Safe City project, which aims to secure a safe, efficient and empowering environment for women and girls through Honeywell’s smart and connected safety and security technology. The deployed solutions will aid in improving detection and response times for incidents through remote monitoring of public spaces and through real time data collection for future analysis.
The project includes the installation of more than 7,000 video cameras at more than 3,000 strategic locations within Bengaluru. These cameras are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) enabled systems. The AI-based video analytics platform will allow for analysis of video feeds from across the city.
"Honeywell's Bangalore Safe City project is an example of how technology can be used to help improve the safety and security of all Bangalore’s citizens, while at the same time helping city administrators make more informed choices in near real time. We are proud to have deployed Honeywell’s advanced technology solutions to make the city police one of the most technically advanced and complete the first phase of the project in record time,” said Ashish Modi, president, Honeywell India and Honeywell Building Technologies, Asia.
“We are happy to partner with Honeywell in this first-of-its-kind safe city project. Bangalore is home to more than 11 million people of which, half are women. Honeywell’s state-of-the-art, advanced technology solutions will strengthen the Bengaluru City Police by improving real-time monitoring capabilities to make the city more safe and secure for all,” said CH Pratap Reddy, Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru
The project will also set up numerous “Safety Islands,” which are well-lit and easily accessible public areas with uninterrupted surveillance. Women, girls, or other vulnerable populations can seek immediate assistance by contacting the department through an emergency call box at these locations. Additionally, 112 emergency calling will help establish a prompt incident response management system. The next phase of the project will focus on further integrating these systems and technologies to create a more seamless and connected smart city experience for the citizens of Bangalore.
