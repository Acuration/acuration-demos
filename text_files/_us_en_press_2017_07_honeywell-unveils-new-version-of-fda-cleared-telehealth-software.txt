Honeywell Unveils New Version of FDA-Cleared Telehealth Software
Honeywell Unveils New Version of FDA-Cleared Telehealth Software
July 19, 2017
ATLANTA, June 20, 2017 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced the launch of LifeStream 5.2, the latest version of its industry-leading, FDA-cleared telehealth software. Building upon a 15-year track record of innovation in delivering digital health technologies for healthcare systems, payers, employers, home health agencies, and patients, the newest version of LifeStream from Life Care Solutions enables clinicians to remotely monitor chronically ill patients, improving their quality of care and clinical outcomes, while reducing healthcare costs.“The launch of LifeStream 5.2 marks a significant milestone for Honeywell in bringing premier telehealth solutions that address the need to deliver greater value in healthcare at less cost,” said John Bojanowski, president of Life Care Solutions, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “Underscoring our commitment to those on the front-lines of healthcare and to creating a more sustainable healthcare system through connected technology, LifeStream 5.2’s enhancements were made with clinicians needs in mind to ensure patient oversight is efficient, clinical outcomes are improved and costly admissions are reduced.” In the United States, half of the adult population suffers from chronic conditions[1]. These conditions account for seven out of 10 deaths and 75% of all healthcare spending in the country[2]. A chronically ill, aging population, coupled with anticipated healthcare labor shortages[3], is making robust telehealth programs essential for healthcare organizations as the industry moves toward a value-based reimbursement model. Honeywell’s LifeStream software powers the Life Care Solutions suite of telehealth solutions, providing clinicians with an easy, comprehensive telehealth management offering, so they can concentrate on delivering the highest quality of care in a post-acute setting without overly burdening organizational resources and IT staff. The latest version delivers a number of comprehensive clinician-focused enhancements including:
A streamlined user interface with more efficient navigation and a mobile platform that is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection
An improved patient dashboard that allows clinicians to view expanded patient snapshots, prioritize patient care, respond to vital sign readings, and more efficiently evaluate patient trends
Advanced scheduling and reporting features that make it easier for clinicians to manage patient monitoring schedules and delivery timely reports
Enhanced default system settings that reduce configuration and deployment time by utilizing important features "out-of-the-box" and an improved user online help system
Unlike other remote patient monitoring solutions, Honeywell's telehealth solution is FDA-cleared which provides confidence in the data and value of the technology. Clinicians can remotely connect with patients to drive better care. Health system CFOs can reduce costs from hospital readmissions and associated staffing efficiencies. CIOs can connect to large patient populations over long distances without placing an onerous burden on organizational resources and IT staff. And most importantly, patients are empowered to work together with their caregiver to achieve desirable clinical results.“Honeywell telehealth solutions have been very effective in reducing onsite visits, allowing us to connect directly with valued patients in their home, while also improving clinical outcomes,” said Lynnell Hornbeck, manager of home health at MultiCare Health System, a not-for-profit health care organization based in Tacoma, Washington. Honeywell Life Care Solutions, part of Honeywell’s Connected Home portfolio, is a global leader in health management technologies and remote patient monitoring, providing the healthcare industry with integrated product and service solutions designed to improve the quality of patients' lives and reduce the cost of healthcare.  About Honeywell Home and Building Technologies Honeywell Home and Building Technologies (HBT) is a global business with more than 44,000 employees worldwide.
