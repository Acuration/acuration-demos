Honeywell Engine Receives Certification For Textron Aviation's Cessna Citation Longitude
Honeywell Engine Receives Certification For Textron Aviation's Cessna Citation Longitude
October 5, 2017
PHOENIX, Oct. 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell's (NYSE: HON) HTF7700L, the latest model in the HTF7000 family of engines, has now been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for the Cessna Citation Longitude, the upcoming super mid-size aircraft from Textron Aviation Inc., a Textron Inc. company. The HTF7000 engine family has a demonstrated track record of low cost of ownership and best-in-class reliability, providing operators with the optimal balance of performance and value.
The HTF7000 family is designed for on-condition maintenance, which means the HTF7700L's periodic inspections and standard maintenance are easily performed on-wing, reducing costly downtimes. Line replaceable components can be removed and replaced using common hand tools. The engine is designed to be environmentally friendly, with significant margin for all pollutants controlled by International Civil Aviation Organization committee on aviation environmental protection standards. The HTF7700L is backed by Honeywell's global support network, and with Honeywell's Maintenance Service Plan (MSP), operators enjoy predictable costs and improved dispatch reliability compared with non-MSP operators.
"Honeywell's HTF7000 family continues to lead the way in performance, reliability and cost of ownership as it continues to expand its presence across business aviation," said Brian Sill, president, Engines and Power Systems, Honeywell Aerospace. "The HTF7700L engine certification for the Citation Longitude aircraft marks another successful milestone for the HTF7000 family, adding to its growing heritage."
Honeywell's HTF7000 family has achieved more than 3.5 million flight hours, and is fast approaching the 2,000th production engine delivery in 2018, only 14 years after its first entry into service. This type certification marks the sixth application of the highly successful HTF7000 family of engines; variants of the engine family are also in service on the Bombardier Challenger 300 and Challenger 350, the Gulfstream G280, the Embraer Legacy 450 and Legacy 500, and now the Cessna Citation Longitude.
To learn more about Honeywell's HTF7000 engine family, visit Honeywell's website. Honeywell will be at the National Business Aviation Association at booth #N5100. Please visit Honeywell's booth to ask any questions.
