Honeywell Files Lawsuit Against Code Corporation Claiming Widespread Patent Infringement
Honeywell Files Lawsuit Against Code Corporation Claiming Widespread Patent Infringement
January 20, 2017
FORT MILL, S.C., Jan. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON), an industry leader in scanning and productivity solutions, today filed a lawsuit against Code Corp., a Salt Lake City, Utah-based company that manufactures bar code readers, in U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, accusing the company of widespread patent infringement.
The lawsuit alleges infringement of multiple patents related to Honeywell's bar code scanning technology. The patents involved in the lawsuit are for Honeywell innovations that make bar code readers easier to use and operate faster and more accurately.
"Honeywell has and continues to invest millions of dollars in developing new, innovative products and offerings," said Lisa London, president of Honeywell's Productivity Products business. "We welcome competition, but we have zero tolerance for those who infringe our intellectual property. Protecting patents is critical to ensuring a level playing field for all market players."
"We helped pioneer the bar code scanning market in the 1970s, and over the years our new innovations have helped thousands of retailers, distributors, healthcare organizations and industrial users achieve significant improvements in efficiency, speed and accuracy in their operations," London said. "Fair competition means respecting the patent rights of others."
The lawsuit seeks to prevent Code from using Honeywell's patented technology in its bar code readers, including the CR2600, and to recover damages caused by the infringement. The specific Honeywell patents involved are:
U.S. Patent No. 6,039,258: "Hand-held portable data collection terminal system"
U.S. Patent No. 6,249,008: "Code reader having replaceable optics assemblies supporting multiple illuminators"
U.S. Patent No. 6,491,223: "Autodiscriminating Optical Reader"
U.S. Patent No. 6,538,413: "Battery pack with capacity and pre-removal indicators"
U.S. Patent No. 6,607,128: "Optical assembly for bar code scanner"
U.S. Patent No. 8,096,472: "Image sensor assembly for optical reader"
