Sales of $9.2 Billion, Reported Sales Up 3%, Organic1 Sales Up 2%
Orders Up 10%, Backlog Up 8% Year Over Year to a Record Level of $31.4 Billion
Aerospace Sales Up 18%, Double-Digit Growth in Both Commercial Aviation and Defense and Space
Operating Margin Up 140 Basis Points to 20.9%; Segment Margin1 Up 80 Basis Points to 22.6%
Earnings Per Share of $2.27, Exceeding High End of Guidance Range
Deployed $2.0 Billion of Capital, Including Repurchasing 5.3 Million Honeywell Shares
October 26, 2023
CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced results for the third quarter that met or exceeded the company's guidance. The company also updated its full-year sales, segment margin2, and adjusted earnings per share2,3 guidance ranges.
The company reported third-quarter year-over-year sales growth of 3% and organic1 sales growth of 2%, led by double-digit organic sales growth in commercial aviation, defense and space, and process solutions. Operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 20.9% and segment margin1 expanded by 80 basis points to 22.6%, led by expansion in Honeywell Building Technologies. Earnings per share for the third quarter was $2.27, roughly flat year over year on a reported basis and up 1% year over year adjusted1. Excluding a 14-cent non-cash pension headwind, adjusted earnings per share1 was up 7%. Operating cash flow was $1.8 billion with operating cash flow margin of 19.6%, and free cash flow1 was $1.6 billion with free cash flow margin1 of 16.9%, driven by strong net income and collections.
"Honeywell executed through a challenging environment in the third quarter, meeting or exceeding guidance for all metrics and demonstrating once again our culture of execution and accountability," said Vimal Kapur, chief executive officer of Honeywell. "Organic1 sales growth was led by our Aerospace segment, where continued supply chain improvements enabled significant sales growth in both commercial aviation and defense and space. We also saw strong growth in other pockets of the portfolio, including double-digit organic sales growth in our process solutions business, and 20% organic sales growth in our Honeywell Connected Enterprise offerings. Orders growth of 10% in the quarter, led by strength in Aerospace and our other long-cycle businesses, drove our backlog to a new record level of $31.4 billion, up 8% year over year. Continued mix benefits combined with our laser focus on productivity across the Honeywell portfolio enabled us to expand margins in line with the high end of our guidance range. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and put our robust balance sheet to work in the third quarter by deploying $2.0 billion to dividends, high-return capex, M&A, and share repurchases, including more than doubling our share repurchases sequentially to 5.3 million shares. The result of all these efforts was increased adjusted earnings per share1 in the face of uncertain macroeconomic dynamics."
Kapur continued, "I am very excited about the future of Honeywell. Our portfolio is aligned to powerful megatrends: automation, the future of aviation, and energy transition, all underpinned by our robust digitalization capabilities. Our technologically differentiated portfolio of solutions and world-class Honeywell Accelerator operating system will enable us to capitalize on these trends and drive the profitable growth we outlined in our long-term financial framework."
As a result of the company's third-quarter performance and management's outlook for the remainder of the year, Honeywell updated its full-year sales, segment margin2, and adjusted earnings per share2,3 guidance. Full-year sales are now expected to be $36.8 billion to $37.1 billion with organic1 sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%. Segment margin2 is now expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.6%, with segment margin expansion2 of 80 to 90 basis points, up 10 basis points on the low end from the prior guidance range. Adjusted earnings per share2,3 is now expected to be in the range of $9.10 to $9.20, narrowing the range by 5 cents on both ends from the prior guidance range. Operating cash flow is still expected to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion, and free cash flow1 is still expected to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion, or $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion excluding the net impact of settlements signed in the fourth quarter of 2022. A summary of the company's full-year guidance changes can be found in Table 1.
Third-Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the third quarter were up 3% year over year on a reported basis and 2% year over year on an organic1 basis. The third-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.
Aerospace sales for the third quarter were up 18% year over year on an organic1 basis, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth, with strength in both commercial aviation and defense and space. Commercial aviation growth was led by robust aftermarket demand driven by increased flight activity, particularly in air transport, with commercial aftermarket sales up more than 20% year over year. Commercial original equipment sales also increased in the third quarter on increased deliveries, particularly in business and general aviation. Defense and space sales grew 18% year over year as supply chain improvements and strengthened orders enabled us to convert our strong order book into sales. Segment margin remained unchanged year over year at 27.5%, as higher volume leverage and commercial excellence were offset by cost inflation and mix pressure in our original equipment business.
Honeywell Building Technologies sales for the third quarter were flat on an organic1 basis year over year. Building solutions sales grew 4% organically driven by strong execution of building projects, particularly energy projects. Building products sales declined modestly on lower volumes of security offerings. Segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 25.2% driven by productivity actions and commercial excellence, partially offset by cost inflation.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the third quarter were up 3% on an organic1 basis year over year. HPS sales grew 11% organically, led by another quarter of double-digit growth in projects and lifecycle solutions and services. UOP grew 6% organically as a result of increased petrochemical catalyst shipments, and double-digit growth in sustainable technology solutions. Orders in our sustainable technology solutions business once again grew triple digits. Segment margin contracted 50 basis points to 22.1% as a result of lower volumes in advanced materials.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the third quarter decreased by 25% year over year on an organic1 basis. Sales declines were due to lower volumes in warehouse and workflow solutions, which continues to be impacted by softness in the warehouse automation market. However, our pipeline remains robust, which translated into double-digit year over year and over 50% sequential orders growth in the third quarter. Additionally, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in the aftermarket services business. Volume declines in productivity solutions and services also impacted sales as we continue to work through the impact of lower demand and distributor destocking. Segment margin contracted 120 basis points year over year to 14.5% driven by lower volume leverage, partially offset by productivity and commercial excellence.

1. See additional information at the end of this release regarding non-GAAP financial measures.
2. Segment margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Management cannot reliably predict or estimate, without unreasonable effort, the impact and timing on future operating results arising from items excluded from segment margin or adjusted EPS. We therefore, do not present a guidance range, or a reconciliation to, the nearest GAAP financial measures of operating margin or EPS.
3. Adjusted EPS and adjusted EPS V% guidance excludes items identified in the non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted EPS at the end of this release, and any potential future one-time items that we cannot reliably predict or estimate such as pension mark-to-market.
