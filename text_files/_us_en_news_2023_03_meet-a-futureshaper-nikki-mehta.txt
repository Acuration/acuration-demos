Meet a #Futureshaper: Nikki Mehta
Meet a #Futureshaper: Nikki Mehta
Nikki is developing software solutions to help customers assess, analyze and optimize their buildings' carbon footprint
Nikki Mehta loves the outdoors.
During a series of trips around the world, Nikki saw how climate change impacted the areas she had hiked years prior. The differences were drastic.
She wants her children and grandchildren to be able to have the same outdoor experiences in the places she's grown to love.
That's one of the reasons she's made sustainability a priority both personally and professionally.
At Honeywell, Nikki helps building owners and operators implement software to help them measure and reduce their buildings' emissions.
Get to know Nikki with a few quickfire questions:
How would you describe the work that you do?
Energy is at the heart of the climate challenge and key to the solution. Fossil fuels – coal, oil, natural gas – are used today to generate energy. When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon and methane, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing climate change.
Buildings are at the heart of this challenge. I work on solutions to help building owners reduce their current emissions by implementing technology that allows them to assess, analyze and optimize their building carbon footprint.
What's one way that you prioritize making real connections with others?
I set up coffee chats with colleagues and adhere to the rule of "no work talk."
What does it mean to be a Futureshaper?
It means challenging the status quo, asking the hard questions, creating a sense of urgency, and partnering with the broader sustainability community to tackle challenges together, one step at a time.
Meet other Futureshapers who are innovating to make our world smarter, safer and more sustainable.
