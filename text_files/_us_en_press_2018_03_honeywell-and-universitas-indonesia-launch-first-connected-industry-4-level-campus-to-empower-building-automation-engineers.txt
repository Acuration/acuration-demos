The university's engineering faculty is the first in the country to have its campus buildings connected with Honeywell Building Technologies
State-of-the-art lab helps students learn and develop software and hardware systems through Honeywell-provided modules
DEPOK, Indonesia, March 1, 2018: Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today launched Indonesia's first smart, connected control lab for the engineering center at Universitas Indonesia. The laboratory uses a state-of-the-art system and software from Honeywell Building Technologies to control various systems and facilities in the engineering campus buildings. The control lab also allows students and faculty to simulate, learn and develop smart building systems via Honeywell-provided modules and software.
“We are proud to be the first university in the country to have this great, state-of-the-art facility in our engineering program, and are grateful to Honeywell for their commitment and support in strengthening the quality of technical education in Indonesia,” said Prof. Dr. Ir. MuhammadAnis, M.Met., Rector, Universitas Indonesia.
“This facility is a great addition to our engineering programs it enables students to learn from the industry's latest technology in building automation and controls systems,” said Dr. Ir. Hendri DS Budiono, M.Eng, dean of the Engineering Faculty. “Upon graduation, students will be better equipped for the workforce and the industry.”
“As ASEAN's largest, Indonesia is a fast-growing nation where building construction is forecasted to continue to grow, and where demand for technically proficient, ready-for-work building solutions engineers is high,” said Roy Kosasih, Honeywell Indonesia President. “As a company that has been part of this nation's development for many years, Honeywell is pleased to continue to support Indonesia's growth by providing building technologies at Universitas Indonesia. This partnership will enable graduating engineers to apply their knowledge and skills to construct smart, connected buildings that are safer, more secure and highly efficient, with low carbon footprint, throughout Indonesia.”
The Honeywell-UI Smart Connected Engineering Campus ControlLaboratory is sponsored by Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the company's corporate citizenship initiative. Laboratory technologies include cloud-based Connected Building services, a building management system, smart building technology with visualization and intuitive interfaces, and an integrated fire and security system.
“We are committed to help enable the next generation of innovators in Indonesia as we know that innovation leads to new products and processes that sustain our economy. We believe that Honeywell's effort in promoting STEM education is making lasting impact in this country,” added RoyKosasih.
This undertaking is part of Honeywell's continued commitment in bolstering STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math)education in Indonesia, which also include having set up a control process technologies and solutions lab at Institut Teknologi Bandung in 2016 and annually providing scholarships for middle school teachers in Indonesia to attend a space academy in USA.
