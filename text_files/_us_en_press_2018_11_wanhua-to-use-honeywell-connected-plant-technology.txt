Wanhua To Use Honeywell Connected Plant Technology
Wanhua To Use Honeywell Connected Plant Technology
November 7, 2018
DES PLAINES, Ill., Nov. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Wanhua Chemical Group Co., Ltd. will use the Honeywell Connected Plant Process Reliability Advisor to provide prescriptive monitoring of its UOP C3 Oleflex' unit at its plant in Shandong Province in Eastern China. This is the first application of the Process Reliability Advisor service in China. Wanhua operates the world's largest Oleflex unit, which converts propane into 750,000 tons per year of propylene, the primary component in many plastic resins, films and fibers.
Process Reliability Advisor continuously feeds plant data through Honeywell UOP process and fault models with sophisticated software to provide key performance information and process recommendations. It helps plants run more smoothly and detects problems before they can affect production and plant profitability.
"Process Reliability Advisor is unique in the industry because it applies Honeywell UOP's proprietary process knowledge and deep troubleshooting experience to recommend operational adjustments much sooner and more accurately than has ever been possible before," said Zak Alzein, vice president, Connected Plant at Honeywell UOP. "Plants with this service can run consistently at the top of their capability."
Honeywell's Connected Plant technologies combine the company's industrial expertise, software and digital technologies to make customers' operations more reliable, profitable and secure than previously possible. As part of Honeywell's Connected Plant portfolio, Process Reliability Advisor gives refineries, petrochemical and gas processing plants greater visibility into their operations, helping to identify and resolve problems that often avoid detection and hamper production, and reducing unplanned shutdowns that can deprive plant operators millions of dollars per year in lost productivity.
"Process Reliability Advisor is a software-based service that combines a plant's data with UOP expertise," Alzein said. "This service can tie plant data to the right domain knowledge to gain new insights to improve operational reliability."
Honeywell UOP's C3 Oleflex technology is a propane dehydrogenation process that converts propane to propylene. Its low energy consumption, low emissions and fully recyclable, platinum-alumina-based catalyst system minimizes its impact on the environment, and has a lower cash cost of production and higher return on investment compared to other technologies. Honeywell UOP has licensed 35 Oleflex units in China since 2011.
Wanhua Chemical Group Co., Ltd. is a leading manufacturer propylene and isobutane and derivatives. Its main products are isocyanate (MDI, TDI, ADI), propylene, propylene oxide (PO), tert butyl alcohol (TBA), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), acrylic acid/acrylic ester (AA/AE), n-butanol and neopentyl glycol (NPG), liquefied propane, liquefied butane, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
