Honeywell and Eindhoven University of Technology Complete Transformation of Atlas Building Into One of the World’s  Most Sustainable Educational Buildings
Honeywell and Eindhoven University of Technology Complete Transformation of Atlas Building Into One of the World’s  Most Sustainable Educational Buildings
Upgrades expected to reduce approximately 80% of greenhouse gas emissions
and result in up to 60% energy savings in lighting
October 23, 2019
The Hague, Oct. 24, 2019 – Honeywell and the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) recently completed state-of-the-art facility upgrades in the Atlas Building, expected to reduce approximately 80% of greenhouse gas emissions from the university’s operations and result in up to 60% energy savings in lighting. In terms of climate, appearance, light, air quality and acoustics, the building has been awarded the highest BREEAM rating, making it one of the most sustainable educational buildings in the world and one of the top three most sustainable buildings in the Netherlands.
“We worked with Honeywell to make significant upgrades in the building, which was designed in the 1960s, to help our students, staff and visitors continue their best work in an optimal environment, while making the most efficient use of energy resources,” said Thijs Meulen, energy management and building automation, Eindhoven University of Technology. “When initiating the project in 2014, we set clear objectives to meet modern safety requirements, reduce energy consumption and transform the building into a more sustainable facility that increases overall user productivity.”
Honeywell technology helps Atlas function as a ‘living lab’
Honeywell installed building control technology to help meet the energy savings objectives and transform the building into a ‘living lab’. Honeywell’s building management system provides single-point monitoring and control of HVAC, lighting, energy management, and incorporates chiller and sea water heat rejection controls. Honeywell uses the Business Intelligence Model to collect data and present findings in an understandable way to the TU/e facility manager via an app. Erik Wellemans, regional general manager, Honeywell Building Solutions: “We offer our customers improved comfort on site by making it easier to regulate the temperature and to book meeting rooms.” The basic structure has been organized in such a way that promotes TU/e’s ability to make continuous adjustments to further optimize the systems for a period of 20 years.
Smart building with user productivity benefits
The building provides 4,000 places for students, student organizations and research laboratories, with spaces that are typically multi-functional and can be used and shared in a flexible way. Tijs Meulen: “We went beyond many prescribed health and safety requirements and introduced sensory and psychological benefits that contribute to health and user productivity. The building paved the way towards a standard that largely hadn’t been developed or introduced at that time.”
Working towards energy neutral campus
The Atlas Building is part of TU/e’s larger campus sustainability ambitions. The University’s objective is to become 30% more energy efficient in 2020 compared to 2005. Recently, Honeywell completed an energy efficiency project in the TU/e Helix Building and will continue to work on innovation and renewal in buildings across the campus. In 2021, the Laplace Building will be renovated in a similar way and in 2023, the Gemini building will follow. The goal is to make the TU/e campus 50% energy-neutral by 2030 and to help users take full advantage of the comfort of the TU/e buildings.
Atlas Building featured in Honeywell’s global ‘Iconic Buildings’ campaign
The Atlas building currently serves as a flagship project in Honeywell’s Iconic Buildings campaign, highlighting the TU/e as a sustainable university focusing on sustainability in education. The campaign highlights some of the world’s most symbolic and widely-recognized buildings using Honeywell technologies to perform critical day-to-day functions.
