Our Commitment To Customers During the Covid-19 Outbreak
In 2020, the global coronavirus outbreak has created an increasing number of challenges to individuals, families, communities and companies. It’s a unique situation we find ourselves in, as most of us have never experienced a health crisis of this scale.
Throughout all the recent developments, Honeywell was working hard to uphold the commitments made to supporting your business. We are very focused on protecting the health and safety of our workforce while maintaining the ability to keep serving you.
With more than 100 years of domain expertise in the industries we serve, we are here to continue to help you adjust to whatever may happen next.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
1.	How is Honeywell’s leadership responding to Covid-19?
Honeywell has activated its global, cross-functional incident management team, including our Honeywell medical team. Our teams meet daily and provide guidance for our businesses and employees in response to the latest COVID-19 news and local and regional directives. All Honeywell sites have plans in place with specific roles and responsibilities relating to this health crisis.
2.	Will Covid-19 impact Honeywell’s supply chain?
Honeywell continues to monitor the COVID-19 coronavirus situation and its impacts globally. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and will work with customers and suppliers to evaluate and address any potential supply chain disruptions.
Many country, regional and local governments already have, or may soon implement, certain requirements, such as general shutdowns, restricted travel, localized quarantines or mandated health screenings. Honeywell continues to comply with all instructions from official bodies.
3.	What is Honeywell doing at our sites?
Out of an abundance of caution for the health of our employees and to support local government initiatives to stem the spread of the virus, Honeywell has implemented several precautions at various sites around the world. These include, but are not limited to:
·         Transitioning onsite visitor meetings to virtual conference or postponing such meetings altogether where necessary or where the meeting is not business-critical
·         Limiting visitor site access to business-essential purposes
·         Introducing temperature checks at certain sites where permissible or mandated
·         Enabling employees to work from home where required or necessary
·         Continuously updating travel guidance, according to newest developments
·         Complying with all local health authority guidance or regulations, including requesting employees to comply with self-quarantine requirements if necessary
4.  Who will receive masks made at the Rhode Island  and Arizona plants?
Honeywell will deliver these masks for the Strategic National Stockpile to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, who will then distribute to hospitals, emergency responders, critical infrastructure and other front-line healthcare protection needs.
5. How do I inquire about masks and personal protective equipment (PPE)?
If you are in government, healthcare, a non-profit or critical infrastructure, fill out this form.

6. How is Honeywell making sure masks get to healthcare workers?
We are communicating a set of principles to our stakeholders to ensure our personal protective equipment (PPE) products are being placed quickly and cost-effectively in the hands of those most in need – including first responders and medical professionals.
