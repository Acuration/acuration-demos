Our New Headquarters: By The Numbers
There's a new building lighting up the Charlotte skyline -- here's a look at how this futuristic office adds up.
Welcome to our new global headquarters.
The new office, which is located in Uptown Charlotte at the Legacy Union site, is home to Honeywell’s corporate team members, including human resources, IT, marketing and legal, as well as our Safety and Productivity and Solutions business.
