Honeywell Introduces New Ultra-Fine Denier Medical Grade Bio Fiber for Cardiovascular and Orthopedic Devices
New technology enables smaller, lighter and more durable minimally invasive surgical device design
21 February 2023
India, February 21, 2023 – Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) has announced the addition of a new ultra-fine denier fiber to its Spectra® Medical Grade (MG) BIO fiber portfolio. Spectra® Ultra Fine (UF) BIO fiber, now available in 25 decitex (dtex), enables minimally invasive cardiovascular and orthopedic device design and helps increase device longevity, given it is a stronger fiber compared to polyester, nylon or other technologies used.
Compared with conventional polyethylene fiber, Honeywell’s Spectra MG BIO fibers are made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is ultra-lightweight, ultra-high strength and manufactured through a patented gel spinning process, providing a biocompatible material that has superior resistance to chemicals, water, fatigue, friction and abrasion. Honeywell’s portfolio of Spectra MG BIO fibers are 15 times stronger than steel by weight and three times stronger than polyester by volume. Spectra MG BIO fiber has received ISO 13485 certification for manufacturing, adhering to the highest quality management standard in the medical device industry, such as providing customers with end-to-end manufacturing lot traceability.
“The introduction of Spectra UF BIO fiber in 25 dtex demonstrates Honeywell’s ongoing commitment to building a collection of medical grade fibers that support a wide range of medical device needs,” says Zachary Murnane, medical fiber global business manager for Honeywell Spectra. “Access to this technology is critical to enabling continued innovation that makes cardiovascular and orthopedic procedures safer and more successful for patients worldwide. Honeywell continues to be a leading provider to healthcare companies helping to drive innovation in the life sciences industry.”
Hitesh Mehta, general manager, Advanced Materials, Honeywell India, said, “Spectra’s properties allow for improved productivity in many ways, especially within the life sciences industry. Spectra’s superior fiber strength, thin size and durability makes it a resourceful and appropriate material for use in invasive surgical procedures. The usage of the new ultra-fine denier medical grade bio fiver will lead to better outcomes for patients, improved quality of care and healthcare delivery.”
Honeywell’s new Spectra UF BIO fiber in 25 dtex will be commercially available globally within Q1 2023. A Spectra Ultra Fine BIO fiber in 10 dtex will be available later in the first half of 2023.
