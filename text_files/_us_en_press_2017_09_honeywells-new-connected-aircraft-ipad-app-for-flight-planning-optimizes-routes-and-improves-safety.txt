Honeywell's New Connected Aircraft iPad App For Flight Planning Optimizes Routes And Improves Safety
Honeywell's New Connected Aircraft iPad App For Flight Planning Optimizes Routes And Improves Safety
September 14, 2017
PHOENIX, Sept. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has released its latest flight planning application for the Connected Aircraft, GoDirect' Flight Bag Pro, to business aviation pilots. Pilots can create and file flight plans for easy reference, calculate and compare aircraft cruise modes to increase performance, and access real-time weather updates to ensure the aircraft arrives at the destination on time. GoDirect Flight Bag Pro is available via an iPad app, and versions for other tablets are in development.
"This pilot-designed and pilot-approved technology simplifies flight planning and provides access to important flight information anytime," said Kiah Erlich, director, Flight Services, Honeywell Aerospace, and a pilot herself. "With real-time information made possible by in-flight connectivity, pilots using GoDirect Flight Bag Pro on a Connected Aircraft can stay informed of the best routes and weather conditions to get to their destinations safely and on time."
GoDirect Flight Bag Pro's simple, intuitive interface works on both domestic and international flights. For access to the app, pilots only need an annual subscription to GoDirect Flight Services and an active Honeywell account.
"I just ran my first flight plan and it's a huge improvement over the last app," said Justin Stimpson, a captain and aviation safety officer at RJL Aviation, which was a beta trial customer of Flight Bag Pro. "Now I can make adjustments to the flight plan with fewer steps after it's been filed, and it makes for a better operational experience with the constantly changing schedules that can be associated with corporate aviation."
Flight Bag Pro, available to GoDirect Flight Services customers, is part of Honeywell's GoDirect family - the industry's most complete portfolio of more than 50 value-adding aviation services and applications that provide operators, flight crews and maintenance teams with critical information to control their services and network. Honeywell has a broad range of flight planning services, including GoDirect Flight Sentinel, which helps bring those apps and services together by serving as a flight department's premier partner, providing a range of proactive services that enhance safety and save time and money, all while improving flight efficiency.
Top Pilot Benefits of GoDirect Flight Bag Pro:
Flight Plan Overview: To view an upcoming flight route, pilots can type in or paste a route from a website, email or text message into the app. Pilots can also view frequently cleared and optimized routes for best aircraft performance. With in-flight connectivity, pilots can even make adjustments while in the air.
Flight Bag Pro Performance Calculator: Calculate multiple cruise modes and determine the most efficient flight by comparing speed, flight level, time, fuel, cost of the trip and more.
Trip Kit: Package all of the trip documents into a Trip Kit to view during flight. Access the latest weather information for your destination such as icing, winds and temperature, even prior to takeoff.
Flight Schedule Updates: Pilots can receive real-time updates to flight schedules when information is released from air traffic control with a pre-departure clearance, when filing status changes, or when weather conditions change.
To learn more about Honeywell's GoDirect Flight Services, visit Honeywell's website for GoDirect Flight Planning and GoDirect Flight Bag Pro information. We also welcome you to join Honeywell at the National Business Aviation Association show in Las Vegas Oct. 10-12. We will demo apps and answer questions in booth #N5100.
