Honeywell Hosts 2022 Investor Conference, Provides Updated Growth And ESG Strategy, And Enhances Long-Term Financial Framework
Honeywell Hosts 2022 Investor Conference, Provides Updated Growth And ESG Strategy, And Enhances Long-Term Financial Framework
March 3, 2022
CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 3, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) will host its annual investor conference at the company's Charlotte, N.C., headquarters today. The leadership team will provide details on the company's strategic priorities that will drive the next phase of growth led by accelerating transformation efforts, major breakthrough initiatives, increasing software and recurring sales mix, and end-market tailwinds.
The company will speak with investors today about the following:
The strength of the Honeywell Value Creation Framework
Anticipated growth acceleration and enhanced margin expansion
Upgrades to the company's long-term financial framework, combined with higher capital deployment commitments
An even stronger alignment to improved environmental, social, and governance outcomes and disclosures
Reaffirming first quarter and full-year 2022 guidance
"While 2021 was another difficult year as we navigated through the prolonged pandemic and significant supply chain challenges, our relentless focus on operational execution, value creation framework, and investments in disruptive technologies have positioned us well to address the world's increasing demand for digital transformation, process technology, and sustainable solutions," Adamczyk said. "Today, we turn our focus to the next phase of Honeywell's growth, including driving innovation that builds on our long-standing expertise in controls, automation, and software, and successful breakthrough initiatives, such as Quantinuum and Sustainable Technology Solutions, which have now graduated into freestanding, high-growth businesses.
"Looking ahead, our rigorous operating principles, end market tailwinds in higher margin businesses, and increasing impact of innovation will drive higher margin expansion off of a structurally lower fixed cost base," continued Adamczyk. "We have a track record of disciplined, high-return capital deployment, and we are increasing our capital deployment commitments to achieve faster growth and innovation, while delivering significant value to our shareholders, now and in the future."
Adamczyk added, "Importantly, we recognize the crucial role we play in enabling the energy transition, and we will continue to lead that evolution as our investment priorities remain focused on innovative solutions that improve environmental and social outcomes for customers. Building on that strong foundation, we intend to strengthen our overall ESG commitments during our discussion today.
"We are raising our long-term financial framework, including our organic growth, margin expansion, and long-term segment margin targets, to reflect our confidence in Honeywell's ability to accelerate growth and deliver value for shareholders. This is an exciting time to be part of Honeywell, whether you are an employee, a customer, or a shareowner," Adamczyk concluded.
