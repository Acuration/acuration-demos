Honeywell Reduces The Complexity And Cost Of Automation Projects With Experion PKS Release 520.1
Honeywell Reduces The Complexity And Cost Of Automation Projects With Experion PKS Release 520.1
Solution incorporates new features and functionality, user experience enhancements and Windows support
November 10, 2021
HOUSTON, November 10, 2021 -- Honeywell today announced the latest release of its Experion Process Knowledge System (PKS), delivering new process automation functionality for end users. Experion PKS Release 520.1 (R520.1) lays the foundation for Experion PKS Highly Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Honeywell’s next-generation control technology.
Experion PKS HIVE enables automation projects to be deployed in a more flexible and resilient manner by decoupling control system elements that are traditionally engineered, configured and deployed in a hierarchal manner. In turn, the standardization and optimization of projects is enabled, while simplifying lifecycle and support management. The modular flexibility of the R520.1 allows Experion PKS HIVE to scale to fit any size of automation project. This can reduce the time, cost and impact of late changes associated with project design, delivery and implementation.
“The R520.1 solution can be implemented seamlessly and incrementally across a customer’s current installed base, leveraging existing investments,” said Jason Urso, Chief Technology Officer, Honeywell Process Solutions. “It delivers higher levels of system resiliency and availability while reducing the overall cost of automation projects.”
In addition, Experion PKS R520.1 introduces several Experion Batch features including the capability to host batch history directly on the Experion server and a new reporting tool that allows process engineers to easily create and manage reports. The solution also features electronic work instructions that allow users to digitize processes, reduce operator entry error, increase data integrity and feed into the electronic batch record.
R520.1 also introduces the updated version of the C300 controller with several upgrades.
ControlEdge Unit Operations Controller (UOC) enhancements include simplified processes to create complex control strategies with custom algorithm blocks that run directly on the UOC and OPC Unified Architecture connectivity to devices directly on the UOC. There are also numerous user experience improvements that increase operator responsiveness and simplify workflows.
R520.1 can be applied to end users spanning the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, power generation, life sciences, pulp and paper, mining minerals and metals, specialty chemicals and renewable energy sectors.
