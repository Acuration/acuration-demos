Meet a #futureshaper: Elie Khatami
Meet a #futureshaper: Elie Khatami
She's digitizing the customer experience
March 8, 2020
Elie Khatami goes into every day believing nothing is impossible.
She joined Honeywell through a university rotation program and is now the customer and product support vice president for Honeywell Aerospace. She’s responsible for the Europe, Middle East Africa and India region.
Elie supports every type of aircraft operator, from airlines to private jets to helicopter owners.
Based in Rolle, Switzerland; here is her #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I had a dream to be a global, international business woman.
What brought you to Honeywell?
Aerospace. Long before the internet, aerospace technology took us to the next “higher level in the clouds.” I travel a lot and have always been fascinated with this industry and its ever-evolving technology.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
The quest to beat the constant challenges and never-ending customer expectations. To aspire to inspire before I expire.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
We are working to shape the customer and product support future with digitization and technology. Digitalization will provide information to the customer - the way they want it, when they want it and where they want it even while they are on the runway or in the air.  We are revolutionizing aerospace support expectations by providing proactive solutions for customers before the problem occurs.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Don’t be afraid to take intelligent risks. Find the right company, take that entry-level position and learn what you are passionate about – whether it is engineering, operations, sourcing, customer support, business IT or HR - just go for it.  Keep an open mind and learn, learn and learn. Deliver good results. Your confidence, enthusiasm and excitement will enable you to move around.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I am more active in outdoor sports. I am an avid hiker, runner and skier. I accomplished Mont Blanc hike last August.
