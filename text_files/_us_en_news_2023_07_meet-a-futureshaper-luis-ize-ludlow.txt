Meet a #Futureshaper: Luis Ize Ludlow
Meet a #Futureshaper: Luis Ize Ludlow
Luis empowers operations to run more efficiently, including in transportation, supermarkets, the pharmaceutical industry and beyond.
Technology helps us keep things cool – from supermarket refrigerators to the cars and trucks you drive – in a more energy-efficient way.
Solutions such as low global-warming-potential (GWP) refrigerants, known as the Solstice® line of products, make those advancements possible.
Luis Ize Ludlow, General Manager of Honeywell  Advanced Materials in Latin America, is driving the adoption of low-GWP alternatives to harmful refrigerants that contribute to the Ozone layer, as well as more efficient alternatives for pharmaceutical packaging.
Get to know Luis and his Futureshaper story.
What is your personal connection to sustainability?
Since I was a kid, my parents brought me to a farm and we spent a lot of time really disconnecting and spending time with family. When my kids were growing, I started bringing them to the farm and teaching them how to be more sustainable. And my interest in sustainability continued growing because it was not just something that I believe, but it was something that was now part of my family.
What's your advice for people early in their careers?
Be humble, learn from your mistakes, continue learning and developing, and get used to being uncomfortable.
What does being a Futureshaper mean to you?
A Futureshaper leads the way, understanding where they can have the most significant impact on the quality of life of our communities by solving complex problems. A Futureshaper will look beyond and create new technologies and business models, develop people, and ensure that they are contributing to improving the future of humanity.
Meet other Futureshapers who are innovating to make our world smarter, safer and more sustainable.
