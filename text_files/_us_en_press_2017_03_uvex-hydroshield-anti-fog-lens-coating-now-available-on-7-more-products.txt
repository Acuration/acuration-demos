Uvex Hydroshield‚ Anti-Fog Lens Coating Now Available On  Seven More Products Due To Popular Demand
Uvex Hydroshield‚ Anti-Fog Lens Coating Now Available On  Seven More Products Due To Popular Demand
March 16, 2017
SMITHFIELD, R.I. — March 4, 2017 — Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced it has expanded the number of eye protection products available with Uvex HydroShield™anti-fog lens coating by seven new offerings, due to popular demand.
The unrivaled performance of HydroShield is newly available on the UvexFlex Seal Goggle® in Clear lens; UvexStealth OTG® in Clear, Gray and Amber lenses; and in three more lens tints on UvexLivewire®: Amber, SCT Gray and LowIR. HydroShield is also available on top-selling Uvex styles including Hypershock®, Genesis®, GenesisXC®, Protégé®, and Stealth®.
Now, with more than 80 Uvex items and 13 lens tints featuring HydroShield, there’s a safety eyewear solution that delivers the longest-lasting, most consistently clear anti-fog performance — and is ideally suited for virtually any indoor or outdoor work environment.
“Fogging’s not only the leading challenge eye protection users face, it’s also a significant hazard that employers can’t afford to overlook,” said Wanda Sanchez-Miller, senior product marketing manager for Honeywell Industrial Safety. “By outfitting workers in one of the many popular Uvex styles now available with HydroShield, employers reduce the hassle and risks of fogging for their workforce – while supporting productivity and their bottom line.”
Uvex HydroShield effectively eliminates fog 60 times longer and resists scratching two times longer* than any other Uvex coated product – even in the hottest, wettest, most demanding conditions. Its performance significantly exceeds EN166, the most stringent anti-fog standard in the world. The unrivaled dual-action coating is permanently bonded to the lens to withstand extended wear and repeated washings without wearing off. All HydroShield anti-fog coated products meet ANSI Z87.1-2015 and are certified to the requirements of the CSA Z94.3 standards, except Hypershock. Genesis, Genesis XC and Protégé also meet the military ballistic impact resistance requirements for eyewear(MIL-PRF-31013, CLAUSE 3.5.1.1). All Uvex lenses offer 99.9% ultraviolet protection.
Uvex HydroShield anti-fog coated safety eyewear from Honeywell is available now through major safety equipment distributors in the Americas. Contact the Honeywell Industrial Safety customer care department at 800-430-5490 (U.S.) or 888-212-7233 (Canada) for more information about Uvex HydroShield anti-fog coated safety eyewear and where it may be purchased. Uvex brand safety eyewear is offered for sale by Honeywell Industrial Safety exclusively in the Americas.
