The Future Is... Cheering on Sports
The Future Is... Cheering on Sports
The Carolina Panthers Chief Operating Officer Mark Hart explains how the NFL team made changes to welcome fans back.
The coronavirus pandemic halted professional sports teams in the spring of 2020 as the virus  spread around the world.
“It was something that I don’t think anybody in pro sports, let alone corporate America, really understood and had to deal with,” said Mark Hart, vice president and chief operating officer of Tepper Sports Entertainment, which operates the Carolina Panthers NFL football team and Bank of America Stadium.
When football season launched, the Carolina Panthers had to completely change game day to help with social distancing among fans.
“The challenge of bringing fans back in the stadium, it was a tough one,” Mark said.
To find out how they overcame the challenge, listen to the latest episode of The Future Is… podcast.
Listen to the conversation on Apple, Google, iHeartRadio, Spotify, Stitcher or TuneIn.
