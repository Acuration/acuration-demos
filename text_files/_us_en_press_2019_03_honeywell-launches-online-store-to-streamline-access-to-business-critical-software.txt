Honeywell Launches Online Store to Streamline Access to Business-Critical Software
Honeywell Launches Online Store to Streamline Access to Business-Critical Software
March 5, 2019
FORT MILL, S.C., March 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced the launch of the Honeywell Marketplace, an online hub for enterprises to find and purchase innovative software solutions, technologies and services to help improve their productivity and increase efficiency.
The Honeywell Marketplace is an enterprise app store that enables customers to discover, evaluate and download business-critical software for a wide range of industries, including distribution centers, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and transportation and logistics.
The site features solutions from Honeywell as well as dozens of third-party software vendors. Examples of software currently available include asset tracking, point-of-sale software for retailers, push-to-talk communications, medical tracking for hospitals and password management for mobile devices.
"In the past, IT managers would spend countless hours researching and evaluating specific enterprise software solutions to solve their business challenges," Peter Howes, president of Honeywell's Productivity Products business. "Today, we have streamlined that entire process &endash; from searching to purchasing and deployment. Our customers want the same easy-to-use shopping and downloading options that they experience with consumer-focused mobile app stores."
Users can search for software by industry, application vendor, operating system or other key attributes. They can download demos and browse screenshots the available software.
"A retailer, for example, may need different solutions for enabling customer checkout, tracking mobile devices, managing inventory, routing returned merchandise and communicating with store associates," said Howes. "We're providing a single source, optimized for mobile devices, to find and purchase these solutions and more."
Available apps include Honeywell's Guided Work Solutions for voice-directed activities in distribution centers and the GoalPost' labor management system, which offers detailed analytics on worker performance.
The Honeywell Marketplace also provides software vendors a flexible approach to building their applications and connecting with customers, which can lead to increased sales opportunities. Software vendors can conduct transactions directly through the online store to simplify the ordering and deployment processes. The Honeywell Marketplace manages the billing process, which eliminates the need for software vendors to invest in costly backend payment and invoicing systems.
Vendors who offer direct purchase and downloading from the Marketplace will have their apps reviewed by Honeywell software engineers, which includes a cybersecurity testing and validation process.
To access the Honeywell Marketplace and view software solutions, please visit marketplace.honeywell.com.
