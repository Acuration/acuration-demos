Honeywell Wins Medtech Breakthrough Award for Health Care Technology Innovation
Honeywell Wins Medtech Breakthrough Award for Health Care Technology Innovation
CT40 XP Health care mobile computer named “Best Clinical Administration Hardware Device” for its versatility, data security capabilities
May 6, 2021
CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 6, 2021 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced its CT40 XP Health care (HC) mobile computer received top honor in the “Best Clinical Administration Hardware Device” category at the fifth annual MedTech Breakthrough Awards.
The awards program, conducted by MedTech Breakthrough, recognizes the top companies, technologies and products in the global health and medical technology market. This year’s program attracted more than 3,850 nominations from nearly 20 countries around the world.
The CT40 HC is an all-purpose mobile computer for frontline medical workers and other health care professionals that simplifies, streamlines and helps error-proof health care delivery and access patient data securely. The ergonomic, lightweight and simple to use mobile computer includes Honeywell’s 2D imager that quickly and accurately reads 1D and 2D barcodes on virtually any medium – vials, syringes, IV Bags, patient wristbands and more. The high-resolution 13-megapixel color camera lets mobile workers document in electronic health records or digital patient chart.
“Honeywell is empowering health care nurses, administrators and other staff with a versatile productivity tool that is purpose-built for health care, from construction to capabilities to data security,” said James Johnson, managing director, MedTech Breakthrough. “With an impressive list of capabilities, the CT40 XP HC also offers health care providers with the longest mobile device lifecycle in the industry. Honeywell is a pioneering innovator in the health care technology space, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to recognize the Company this year in the 2021 MedTech Breakthrough Awards program.”
The mobile computer is certified for the FIPS 140-2 Level 1 security requirements to protect patient data – the highest level of data security in its class. The AndroidTM Enterprise Recommended device is built on Honeywell’s Mobility Edge platform, which has one of the longest security lifecycles in the industry.
The mobile computer is also approved for use with Cerner’s CareAware Connect, Epic’s Rover and Lawson’s SCM Suite, allowing health care workers to view patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans and more.
“Health care workers on the frontlines need to ensure patient care is error-free, and we designed the CT40 HC to be easy to operate while giving clinicians all the information they need to coordinate patient care with other team members,” said Kevin Dehoff, president of Honeywell’s Productivity Solutions and Services business. “We’re pleased to be recognized among other innovative health care and medical technology innovators in the annual MedTech Breakthrough Awards and this demonstrates our commitment to help health care workers as their roles evolve.”
MedTech Breakthrough is a part of Tech Breakthrough, a leading intelligence and recognition platform for global technology innovation and leadership. The mission of the MedTech Breakthrough Awards is to honor excellence and recognize the innovation, hard work and success in a range of health and medical technology categories, including Robotics, Clinical Administration, Telehealth, Patient Engagement, Electronic Health Records (EHR), mHealth, Medical Devices, Medical Data and many more.
Honeywell delivers innovative solutions to provide quality patient care in organizations of all sizes. The Company was the first in the barcode industry to introduce disinfectant-ready housings to help with cleaning protocols in the health care space.
