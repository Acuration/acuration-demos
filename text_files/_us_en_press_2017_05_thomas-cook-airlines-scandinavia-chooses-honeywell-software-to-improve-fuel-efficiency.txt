Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia Chooses Honeywell Software To Improve Fuel Efficiency
Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia Chooses Honeywell Software To Improve Fuel Efficiency
May 9, 2017
ROLLE, Switzerland, May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia has chosen Honeywell's (NYSE: HON) GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software to boost fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. The Honeywell GoDirect solution, one of more than 50 flight support, connectivity and maintenance services offered by the company - provides a full range of data analysis, reporting and monitoring tools to help the Copenhagen-based charter airline identify and communicate ways to improve fuel savings across its fleet of 14 aircraft. The software upgrade meets the requirements needed under the European Union Emissions Trading System.
GoDirect is Honeywell's industry-leading offering of services and applications designed to provide aviation operators, Ô¨Çight crews and maintenance teams with data management software and analytics tools that enhance their aircraft capabilities. Although results achieved by the GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software will vary by aircraft and airline, existing users have documented fuel savings of up to five percent annually. This can translate into tens of millions of dollars in annual savings for airlines with larger fleets.
"As the aviation industry continues to focus on reducing fuel use, dedicated fuel management software is critical for airlines to optimize the operational efficiency of their fleets," said David Shilliday, vice president, Airlines, EMEAI, Honeywell Aerospace. "With the busy summer travel season rapidly approaching, we are working closely with Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia to help it increase its fuel-saving initiatives and identify opportunities for more efficient travel, such as pre-planning flights and taking shorter routes "
Honeywell's Fuel Efficiency software includes more than 100 standard analysis reports and integrates with existing airline computer systems through a user-friendly data interface. Airlines can quickly deploy the solution and use existing or customized reports and dashboards to monitor and display progress of fuel-saving efforts.
Following Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia success with GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software, the solution is now in use across the entire Thomas Cook Group fleet, with 94 aircraft in total.
