Meet a #futureshaper: Jolana Dvorska
She is teaching aircraft to land in zero visibility.
Jolana Dvorska has always had a passion for engineering and technology.
“In fact, growing up I always wanted to build robots,” said Jolana, an avionics architect in Europe. “So working on some of the world’s most advanced aerospace technologies was a natural fit for me.”
Based in Brno, Czech Republic; here is her #futureshaper story.
What do you do?
The computers and systems pilots used to fly aircraft, which are called avionics, are very complex. My job is to design some of these systems and make it easier for aircraft to fly, even in difficult weather conditions, or when the airspace is becoming very congested.
The technologies we work on make aircraft fly more efficiently, reduce the impact of flights on communities on the ground, and help bring people together faster.
What brought you to Honeywell?
I have always liked flying and airplanes, and I’ve always liked math and engineering. I knew I wanted a career in engineering! During university, I was looking at navigation and that brought me to the aerospace industry and, ultimately, to Honeywell.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
Flying in our business jet test aircraft, to put the solutions we develop through their paces, is definitely a highlight! Every day is different, with new challenges waiting to be solved. But above all else, what’s great is the people. I am fortunate to work with some of the brightest scientists and engineers around, on cutting-edge technologies that are making a positive impact on how our world works. Being able to say you do this for a job, and work with the amazing people I work with every day, is really cool.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
The future is looking really exciting, as we are entering a new era of Urban Air Mobility within aviation. We’re taking the work we continue to do in traditional aviation in areas like autonomy and environmental efficiency, and we’re applying it to emerging sectors like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and flying taxis. Through our work, we see a future that will allow people to connect more efficiently between, and even within, cities, using air travel.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
I think a relentless drive to overcome challenges to deliver solutions that have a positive impact on our world. But I also think that a #futureshaper can pull together the best skills and ideas from a team of great minds. In the fields we work in you need an amazing team that works in harmony to make incredible things.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
I’d tell them to follow their passion and really try to find a job they find meaningful and fun. To know your work is making a positive difference gives you additional motivation and will help you grow your career and develop new skills even faster.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I love baking, as well as spending time outside hiking and skiing. With such a fast-paced career, it’s important to get out and let your brain slow down for a while. Although there is a part of me that would still love to spend my free time flying!
