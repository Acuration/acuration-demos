Honeywell To Lead Facilities Management At New Footscray Hospital
Honeywell To Lead Facilities Management At New Footscray Hospital
Project part of Plenary Health consortium to support development of the largest single health infrastructure investment in the state of Victoria
Building services contract, anchored by Honeywell Forge Enterprise Performance Management software, will help improve the facility’s operational efficiency and maintenance approach
April 7, 2021
MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, April 7, 2021 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON), a global leader in connected buildings, today announced it will be the facility services provider for the $1.5 billion new Footscray Hospital project, the largest single health infrastructure investment in the state of Victoria. The project entails Honeywell providing hard facilities management and the installation of building management products including the Honeywell Forge Enterprise Performance Management software to help create a more efficient and more secure facility, backed by a 25-year service contract.
Honeywell Forge will allow the new Footscray Hospital to conduct condition-based maintenance to reduce unplanned reactive work and lower energy costs with a machine learning solution that continuously studies a building’s energy consumption patterns and automatically adjusts to optimal energy saving settings without compromising occupant comfort levels. Honeywell will also protect the facility’s operational technology (OT) environment with a suite of cybersecurity solutions to proactively monitor and maintain its systems, including cybersecurity monitoring and remote management.
“It is a rare privilege to deliver such a significant project, one that will ultimately transform access to health services in Melbourne’s west,” said Paul Crowe, Plenary chief investment officer. “In bringing this project to life, the community is our focus and we look forward to delivering this hospital for patients and families, for staff, and the people of the western suburbs. We look forward to working closely with the Victorian Government and Western Health to deliver this much-needed and critical piece of health infrastructure.”
The new hospital will feature more than 500 beds, enabling care for almost an additional 15,000 patients and allowing an extra 20,000 people to be seen by the emergency department each year. It will also deliver more outpatient, palliative care and mental health services, ensuring the community can access quality care closer to home.
“We are pleased to be selected as the party responsible for the Management and Life Cycle of Building Services within the new Footscray Hospital for the next 25 years,” said Keith Fisher, vice president and general manager of services, Honeywell Building Technologies. “Our team is focused on creating a seamless Facility management experience that allows the Footscray team to have better insight into the facility’s performance to drive continued improvement that starts with the construction process. Our offering for the hospital also integrates our cybersecurity solutions to create a safer OT environment, coupled with a fully digitized maintenance solution that’s backed by our experienced services team.”
The hospital is being delivered as a public-private partnership, with Western Health as the public operator of all clinical services and Plenary Health consortium contracted by the Victorian Government to finance, design, construct and maintain the hospital for 25 years following construction completion.
The Plenary Health consortium comprises Plenary Group as sponsor, investor and asset manager; Multiplex as builder; Honeywell and Compass Group as facilities and maintenance managers; and Sojitz Corporation as investor.
Honeywell has worked in Australia for more than 30 years, supporting commercial buildings, healthcare, critical infrastructure and justice and corrections projects. The company is experienced in total asset management and public private partnership projects.
