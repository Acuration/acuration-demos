Honeywell Honored at Executive Women of New Jersey
Honeywell Honored at Executive Women of New Jersey
The Executive Women of New Jersey (EWNJ) honored Honeywell for having three or more women on its board of directors
October 28, 2019
Executive Women of New Jersey (EWNJ) recently recognized 29 public companies in the state, including Honeywell, for having three or more women on the board of directors. Honeywell’s board of directors includes Linnet Deily, Deborah Flint, Grace Lieblein and Robin Washington.
EWNJ is an executive women's network in New Jersey that supports and showcases the advancement of women to top leadership positions and promotes gender diversity in the boardroom. This recognition is part of the organization’s efforts to ensure that women have equal access.
“EWNJ is thrilled to present this year’s list of the 30 companies that are leading the way on women’s representation in senior governance as part of our fourth report on gender diversity in New Jersey,” stated Barbara E. Kauffman, president of EWNJ and EVP & COO of Newark Regional Business Partnership. “This year, we have the highest number of Honor Roll companies to date and it shows that while there is still much more work to be done, our efforts are working. The undeniable impact of women’s leadership is being more fully recognized by the private sector in New Jersey. We salute all of our Honor Roll companies and look forward to partnering with them as we continue in pursuit of our mission to increase the number of women on corporate boards and in senior governance.”
“This year’s list reflects the progress companies have made since 2017 when our last list was published with 22 companies,” added Anna María Tejada, Esq., president-elect of EWNJ, co-chair of “A Seat at the Table,” and partner at Kaufman Dolowich & Voluck, LLP. “We applaud these companies’ progress toward inclusion and diversity, and as quantified in EWNJ’s research, New Jersey’s business environment is stronger.” Honeywell Advanced Materials President George Koutsaftes accepted the award on behalf of the company. "A Seat at the Table Honor Roll" Corporate Gender Diversity award was presented in Iselin, NJ. This is the second time Honeywell was recognized at this biennial event.
