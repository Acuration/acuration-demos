Meet Those with #CoolCareers
Meet Those with #CoolCareers
On World Refrigeration Day #WRD21, we caught up with those who help industries stay cool.
Refrigeration makes modern life possible.
Solstice® Refrigerants are widely used,  and provide low or reduced global warming potential versus the alternatives.
Here are some of the researchers, engineers, and other leaders who invent, make, and commercialize Honeywell Solstice Refrigerants, and help keep our homes and cars cool in hot weather; our food supply from spoiling during transportation, and our vaccines safe at cryogenic temperatures.
Ali Bergeron
Based: Geismar, Louisiana
What do you do?
I manage two refrigerant units.
Why does refrigeration matter?
Apart from allowing us the luxury of having air conditioning in our cars and homes, as well as to extend the life of certain foods, refrigeration is necessary to keep vital medicines such as insulin and vaccines viable for people all over the world.
What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Don’t doubt your abilities and take advantage of every opportunity afforded to you along the way – even if it means taking a chance in a role you may not have seen yourself in.
Elizabet Vera Becerra
Location: Buffalo, New York
What do you do?
I research and test new heat transfer fluids in equipment which give cold temperatures like the machines that makes ice cream or the refrigerators in our houses or the systems that provide cooling when it is too hot outside.
Why does refrigeration matter?
Refrigeration helps to conserve in safe conditions, food in our houses and during transportation (from the farms to the supermarkets.) It also helps preserve prescription pills from pharmaceutical plants to pharmacies and hospitals.
What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Be willing to accept that it is going to be teamwork, you will work with many people of different areas of knowledge. Learn different areas in science: thermodynamics, chemistry, physics, mathematics, instrumentation, algorithms and basic business principles.
Tafa Magaya
Based: Morris Plains, NJ
What do you do?
I am Director of Offering Management in Fluorine Products, which means I make sure that we achieve both short- and long-term revenue and margin targets.
Why does refrigeration matter?
Refrigeration helps to preserve many important things, so we can transport them safely and, or preserve them for later consumption or use.
What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
I’d tell them to be themselves, know what you want, and go for it.  Work hard, but never compromise your principles in the process
Victor Alvarado
Based: Geismar, Louisiana
What do you do?
I am an engineer for the Solstice YF production. I do the math behind the scenes and come up with cool ideas to make the production better and safer!
Why does refrigeration matter?
Refrigeration is what makes us able to have cool tech, literally. It helps with the AC in your car, homes, school, etc.
What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
For engineering you need a good balance of creativity and knowledge. If you think you would like coming up with ways to make something better and be fully involved with how to make it, then maybe engineering is for you! Work hard in school, focus on your math and science, and give it your all. That’s how good engineers are born.
Sunita Rai Singh
Location: Morris Plains, NJ
What do you do?
I work with cool R&D people and smart business development folks who work day in and out to develop and commercialize technologies that keep this planet cool, safe and sustainable.
Why does refrigeration matter?
As the climate gets hotter, and urbanization spreads to the growing population, there is going to be a need for more comfortable living and willingness to pay for these comfort solutions. So much of urbanization and supply chain is now dependent upon the ease of keeping food fresh longer, storing and moving medicines and drugs farther, making habitat comfortable even in sever weather conditions, and all of this is made possible because of available refrigeration technologies developed by innovative companies like us.
What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
I wanted to work for a company that had a direct and tangible impact on making this planet safer and sustainable and at the same time was an exciting place to be with all its innovations, so I chose to join Honeywell. If you value innovation and like to contribute towards making this planet better, join Honeywell team!
