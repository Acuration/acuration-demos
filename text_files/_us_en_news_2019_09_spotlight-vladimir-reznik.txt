“Work hard and you will have opportunities to progress."
October 2, 2019
Here’s what else he had to say about his career.
Describe your role.
We support different countries around the world in building efficient oil and gas refining solutions to help drive economic performance. We make automation products and solutions that increase economic growth for large oil and gas companies, improving the quality of life for people with safer and more efficient solution. It’s neat to think that Honeywell is part of every single day worldwide, as people are filling up their cars.
How did you get into sales and sales management?
After attending university, I joined Honeywell as a sales support engineer and moved into an account manager position before being promoted. The combination of a technical and sales background helped me advance to become the Regional General Manager in 2016 for our Performance Materials and Technology business across Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Turkey. Thereafter, I was promoted to my current position as the Regional Business Leader across these countries.
What attracted you to working at Honeywell?
It’s a global company where you can apply your ideas and knowledge to change the world and drive the market as a global automation leader.
How has the company helped you grow?
Honeywell provides valuable tools for personal development. I work with a wide range of customers, and the company helps me gain technical knowledge of products and solutions, marketing and economic expertise.
What do you enjoy most about your role?
Having responsibility and autonomy helps me drive business and improve my personal development every day.
What are your interests outside of work?
When I’m not working, I spend time with my family and friends. We enjoy karting, Formula1 racing and hockey. I love travelling and visiting new places I’ve never been before.  Honeywell has allowed me to grow in that area, too.
What’s the last book you read?
The Art of War by Sun-Tzu.
What’s the coolest project you’ve worked on at Honeywell?
After Honeywell acquired Elster, I was a part of the integration team charged with creating one combined business. This project allowed me to meet very interesting and experienced people and build my own expertise.
What advice do you have for people considering a career in sales at Honeywell?
Work hard and you will have opportunities to progress.
