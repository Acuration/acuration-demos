Thieves Can't Make The Cut When It Comes To New Slash-Resistant Backpack Made With Honeywell Spectra
Thieves Can't Make The Cut When It Comes To New Slash-Resistant Backpack Made With Honeywell Spectra
May 4, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that the same Spectra® fiber technology used in protective vests for law enforcement is now available to shield the belongings of everyday consumers from thieves who slash bags to steal items.
Consumers who want to keep their belongings safe can now buy a theft-resistant drawstring backpack called the Flak Sack, designed by Loctote Industrial Bag Company. As seen on ABC's "Shark Tank," the Flak Sack is the world's first cut-resistant bag designed for travel and daily use. Now, it will be enhanced with Spectra—the same fiber technology used in bullet-resistant vests. Flak Sack utilizes Spectra in a unique fabric construction called FLAKnit™ created by Tuff-N-Lite®, a division of Supreme Corp., a leading textile and fiber technology company. Yet, despite this durability, Flak Sack is flexible, making it ideal for a range of situations such as travel, hiking and everyday use such as commuting to work.
Pound for pound, Spectra is 15 times stronger than steel, yet light enough to float. Every day, soldiers and police officers put their lives on the line while protected by Spectra in their vests, vehicles and helmets. The same life-saving fiber technology is applied to the Flak Sack fabric, which has one of the highest cut-resistance levels ever recorded* for industrial and commercial fabrics. If a bag is torn, whether by accident or malicious intent, its owner is likely to lose some of its contents. Spectra helps prevent this possibility.
Additional security features, such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) blocking material, a heavy-duty brass and steel lock, and break-resistant, steel-reinforced nylon straps ensure that Flak Sack has the best combination of features to protect against theft. This is especially beneficial to help consumers protect travel essentials, such as passports, visas, medications or credit cards. The Flak Sack is also formulated to be water-resistant, ensuring that contents not only stay secure, but also dry.
"After my belongings were stolen on vacation, I was determined to create the most secure consumer bag possible," said Don Halpern, founder and CEO, Loctote Industrial Bag Company. "I spent countless hours researching materials and concluded that Spectra was the best high-performance fiber in the industry. No other fiber can provide Spectra's level of cut resistance and also be soft, comfortable, lightweight and breathable."
Supreme Corp. has manufactured high-tech textiles and highly cut-resistant fabrics under the Tuff-N-Lite brand since 2006. These fabrics are designed for a range of high-performance applications in areas such as sportswear, police and military clothing, and safety gear.
"Honeywell Spectra enables us to realize our mission of creating the industry's best high-performance textile products, whether they be composite yarns or cut-resistant fabrics," said Matt Kolmes, CEO of Supreme Corp. "We look forward to continuing to work with the Honeywell Spectra team to supply top-quality materials to innovative companies like Loctote."
Spectra fiber is made from ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene using a patented gel-spinning process. The versatile material is used in a wide variety of applications including ballistic-resistant armor, professional fishing lines, industrial-strength ropes and increasingly in performance textile applications such as the Flak Sack.
"Spectra is one of the strongest manmade fibers available, making it ideal for many high-performance situations," said Sanjay Sharma, VP and GM, Packaging and Composites at Honeywell. "Honeywell's groundbreaking technology and extensive R&D ensure that Spectra is the next-generation material of choice for breakthrough applications like the new Flak Sack bag. Spectra offers the most diverse features and benefits to help manufacturers and designers turn product fantasies into realities."
Honeywell maintains an active Spectra fiber and ballistic materials research program focused on continuous improvement and development of high-performance materials. For more information about Spectra fiber, visit www.honeywell-spectra.com.
