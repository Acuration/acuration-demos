Honeywell Expands Line Of Fire-Lite Addressable Fire Alarm Control Panels
Honeywell Expands Line Of Fire-Lite Addressable Fire Alarm Control Panels
March 28, 2018
‚Ä¢ Fire-Lite Endurance Series panels offer built-in dual path communications, programmable buttons and support for combined fire and CO addressable detection ATLANTA, Mar. 26, 2018 &endash; Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is expanding its line of Fire-Lite addressable fire alarm control panels to give safety professionals more options for designing small to medium-sized fire systems. The Fire-Lite Endurance Series offers two new fire alarm control panels &endash; the ES-50X and ES-200X &endash; that feature dual-path communications, programmable buttons and support for combined fire and CO addressable detection.
The Endurance Series offers more communication options with the choice of built-in IP and POTs for dual communications, as well as cellular side-cars for extended backup and added reliability. Both panels offer four programmable buttons to perform routine tasks quickly, and feature a USB port for easy programming and firmware updates.
The new panels offer simplified SWIFT® wireless operations featuring a built-in wireless display driver and annunciator saving the dealer time and money on installations. SWIFT® wireless systems simplify installation and are ideal for difficult-to-wire applications such as historically protected structures, buildings with high ceilings or other complex structures that require costly wiring.
“Reliability with simplicity is an important combination when it comes to protecting lives,” said Susan Adam, marketing director for fire systems, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “More options sometimes means more complexity for life safety professionals, but the Fire-Lite portfolio's simplicity is a big reason for its large and loyal customer base. The new Endurance Series panels reflect that legacy as the next-generation of addressable fire alarm control panels.”
