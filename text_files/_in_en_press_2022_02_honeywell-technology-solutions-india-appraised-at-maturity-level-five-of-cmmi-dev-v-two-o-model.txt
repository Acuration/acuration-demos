BENGALURU, February 23, 2022 – Honeywell Technology Solutions (HTS) India, the engineering and technology development arm of Honeywell, was recently appraised at Level 5, the highest maturity level of the CMMI Institute’s Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) ® DEV V2.0. The benchmark appraisal, conducted by CMMI transition partner KPMG in December 2021, places HTS India in an exclusive group of organizations that are executing agile projects at CMMI V2.0 Maturity Level 5.
Samuel Pratap, president, HTS, said, “Honeywell is committed to building excellence in its software capability. Using CMMI DEV V2.0 Maturity Level 5 best practices in software and system engineering are critical to creating products that are intuitive, reliable and meet current and emerging customer needs.  Our world-class software teams are developing better products, faster, and at a lower cost through improving standards, processes and procedures.”
CMMI is a performance enhancement model consisting of collected best practices that guide organizations to improve key capabilities and elevate performance. HTS’ appraisal at CMMI DEV V2.0 Level 5 represents a commitment to high quality software development processes and delivery standards, and translates into far superior and highly reliable solutions for Honeywell’s customers.
“We view being certified as CMMI DEV V2.0 Maturity Level 5 as an important differentiator, providing us with a competitive advantage that will help us achieve our long-term business objectives,” added Pratap.
The CMMI DEV V2.0 Maturity Level 5 appraisal enhances HTS’ capability to develop and deliver new products for Honeywell and to lead the company’s East-for-East localization strategy. The appraisal reinforces HTS’s culture of continuous improvement, customer commitment and process maturity and enables Honeywell to bid for projects and contracts that demand CMMI certification. In addition, CMMI V2.0 also allows HTS to:
