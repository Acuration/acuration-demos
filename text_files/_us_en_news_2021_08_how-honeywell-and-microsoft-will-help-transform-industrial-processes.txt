Where: Anywhere the internet reaches.
The impact: With Honeywell’s revolutionary data-driven approach to industrial processes and Microsoft’s expertise in building ubiquitous storage and computing clouds, industrial customers will be able to respond to their greatest challenges.
What kind of challenges? For a start, big ideas like carbon reduction, workforce development and workplace safety.. But the way to get there is by marrying IT with OT: information technology with a unified base of operational technology, building an ecosystem so all of a company’s systems can work from the same pool of data.
