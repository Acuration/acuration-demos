Meet a #futureshaper: Hector Chinolla
Here's how he's making firefighters safer
June 1, 2019
While first responders protect us, Hector Chinolla helps protect first responders.
An engineer, he oversees materials production for safety gear, including for firefighters.
That important role keeps him coming to work every day.
“All the hard work and the daily challenges we face ourselves are all focused on providing the end user safety and protection when they are putting their lives at risk to save others,” Hector said.
Based in Dayton, Ohio, here’s his #futureshaper story:
Did you think you’d end up in a job like you’re in now? I would have never imagined I would be leading the materials team for one of the top brands in turnout gear.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up? Ever since I was a child, I wanted to follow the same tradition in the family over the last three generations and work in the cattle business in my hometown.
What do you do? I work to have the right materials at the right time and right amount on the production floor to satisfy customer requirements.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day? The fact that all the hard work and the daily challenges we face ourselves are all focused on providing the end user safety and protection when they are putting their lives at risk to save others.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell? Honeywell knows that the key to providing a great quality product is investing and developing their own team.
How has Honeywell changed since you began working here in 2010? Honeywell continues to evolve along with the needs of the market. I have never found myself under the same structure, using the same procedures and processes over a long period of time. This is what it takes to improve what we do and how we shape where we need to be.
Why is the future important? If you are not working on strategies and actions today to get us where we want to be in five years, then you are already late. It is the only way to stay on top of this fast-paced, changing market.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper should have? A flexible mindset to adapt to constant change, a passion for winning and a zealot for growth.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry? We continue to challenge ourselves and find ways to be better, even when performing above our goals.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?  Keep in mind opportunities are always disguised as challenges. Make the most of them every time.
What do you for fun? Fishing, tennis and spending time with my family.
