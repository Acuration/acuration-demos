Honeywell Resolves Claims with Garrett Motion Inc.
Honeywell Resolves Claims with Garrett Motion Inc.
January 10, 2021
CHARLOTTE, N.C. – January 11, 2021 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today issued the following statement regarding Garrett Motion Inc.’s court-supervised Chapter 11 proceedings and Garrett’s acceptance of the Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) presented by Centerbridge Partners and Oaktree Capital Management (the “Plan Sponsors”) along with Honeywell.
We are pleased that Garrett has agreed to the Plan presented by Centerbridge and Oaktree, along with Honeywell, which is supported by a majority of Garrett’s equity holders and the ad hoc group of Garrett noteholders. Under the agreement, Garrett will be recapitalized and well positioned to meet its obligations, including those to Honeywell, and will avoid costly litigation. We believe this is the right path forward that maximizes value for all stakeholders and positions Garrett for long-term financial and operating success.
As part of the Plan, Honeywell’s claims under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement (“IRA”) and Tax Matters Agreement (“TMA”) are satisfied and resolved by the following:
Honeywell will receive total payments of approximately $1.21 billion, comprising:
An initial cash payment of $375 million at the effective date when Garrett emerges from bankruptcy; and
New Series B Preferred Stock with a payment of approximately $35 million due in 2022 and annual payments of $100 million from 2023 through 2030. In addition, the Series B Preferred Stock has a number of other features that benefit Honeywell, while maintaining flexibility for Garrett.
All existing and pending litigation will be resolved and Honeywell and Garrett will mutually release each other from the claims asserted in all pending legal actions.
Honeywell will have the right to elect one of 7 Garrett board members until the value of the remaining payments on the Series B Preferred stock is below $125 million.
By receiving larger cash amounts earlier through both the upfront payment and the Series B Preferred Stock payment schedule, Honeywell has preserved the net present value of its Plan payments from the October 2020 proposal at a lower total nominal payment amount from Garrett over a shorter time period.
Honeywell is pleased to have resolved its claims and the pending legal actions in a favorable way for both Honeywell’s and Garrett’s stakeholders. Honeywell looks forward to Garrett’s exit from bankruptcy and its continued success as a standalone company.
