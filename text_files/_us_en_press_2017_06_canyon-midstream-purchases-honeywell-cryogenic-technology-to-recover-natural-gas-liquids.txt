Canyon Midstream Purchases Honeywell Cryogenic Technology to Recover Natural Gas Liquids
Canyon Midstream Purchases Honeywell Cryogenic Technology to Recover Natural Gas Liquids
June 14, 2017
DES PLAINES, Ill., June 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Canyon Midstream Partners II, LLC will use UOP Russell modular cryogenic equipment to process 200 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas at its Redcliff Midstream gas processing facility in Woodward County, Okla.
Cryogenic units extract high-value natural gas liquids (NGLs) from natural gas streams by refrigeration to extremely low temperatures. These NGLs &endash; ethane, propane and butanes &endash; are typically used for heating or to manufacture plastics, chemicals and fuels.
"This shop-fabricated and pre-engineered plant is customized to process the unique feed gas composition in northwestern Oklahoma," said Craig Ranta, senior business leader, UOP Russell. "The combination of pre-engineering and customization means that we can deliver this technology for site-specific applications using modular platforms that can be built and enter service very quickly, and operate with high reliability."
When the Redcliff Midstream facility enters service early next year, it will serve producers in Oklahoma's "STACK Play," named for natural gas fields in the Sooner Trend, Anadarko Basin and Canadian and Kingfisher Counties.
Unique aspects of this plant include its single-stage high-pressure compressor and customizations to the brazed aluminum heat exchangers, both of which reduce capital and operating expense while delivering high recovery of NGLs.
"Canyon Midstream selected this design due to its performance and compelling value, combined with quick delivery and the proven track record of the technology," Ranta added. "This plant also shows the flexibility of our technology platform to work with specific gas compositions that may change from site to site."
UOP Russell's pre-engineered modular equipment can readily be tailored to customer specifications and shipped to remote locations. Modules fit together easily and efficiently, significantly reducing construction time and expense, and enhancing reliability after start-up. This enables customers to more quickly begin processing gas and earning revenue.
