India's Jet Airways Joins Growing List Of Airlines Adopting Honeywell's Flight Efficiency Services
February 16, 2017
MUMBAI, India, Feb. 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has been selected by India's Jet Airways to provide its GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software, a part of the GoDirect Flight Services family of Connected Aircraft technologies, to reduce fuel use and costs for the airline. The offering provides a full range of data analysis, reporting and monitoring tools for enhanced fuel conservation.
Honeywell's GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software analyzes data from more than 100 reports that integrate with existing airline systems through a user-friendly data interface. The service offers fuel-saving recommendations, which airlines can quickly deploy into existing or customized analytics reports and dashboards. Honeywell's technology will also help lower carbon emissions from international flights, in accordance with recent changes to the Paris Agreement on reducing greenhouse gases. Existing users of the software have reported fuel savings of more than 2 percent annually.
"Typically, fuel consumption accounts for as much as 20 to 40 percent of an airline's operating costs," said Jason Wissink, senior sales director, Connectivity Services, Honeywell Aerospace. "Flight efficiency services are an important part of the global aviation industry, helping airlines reduce costs significantly and help regulate emissions, which India has committed to reducing. Our GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software is flexible enough to integrate with Jet Airways' existing aircraft systems, enabling fast deployment and the ability to support fleet growth."
Jet Airways joins an expanding list of global customers already using this innovative software, including Etihad Airways, Finnair, Japan Airlines and Turkish Airlines.
