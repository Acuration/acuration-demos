Honeywell Unveils Next Generation Turbo Technology  to Help Improve Vehicle Emissions and Performance
Honeywell Unveils Next Generation Turbo Technology  to Help Improve Vehicle Emissions and Performance
October 5, 2018
Honeywell's newest gasoline turbocharger optimizes performance and helps reduce CO2 and NOx emissions
First announced application used in new BMW 2.0L gasoline engine
FRANKFURT / Sept. 13, 2017 /Honeywell (NYSE:HON), the leading global developer of automotive turbochargers, announced today its newest gasoline turbocharger technology developed to improve power and torque and aid in the reduction of vehicle emissions will debut on the new BMW 2.0L engine program announced at the 67th Annual IAA Cars event in Frankfurt.
The new technology represents Honeywell's third generation gasoline turbocharger architecture that has been updated and designed for twin-scroll, 4-cylinder engines that are 1.5liters and larger. The new generation has shown representative increases in power from 90kW/L to more than 100kW/L and in torque from 175Nm/L to more than200 Nm/L over the previous generation technology.
One of the new advances comprising the third generation architecture is a new wastegate with a Honeywell-developed mono-block arm and valve. This one-piece design replaces a traditional three-piece valve reducing noise by 5 to 10 decibels and improving fuel economy by up to 0.5 percent. In addition the unique valve design provides better controllability and 50 percent less wear due to repetitive motion against the turbo housing. Coupled with electric actuation, the new wastegate valve is also having a positive effect on reducing the time needed to engage the catalytic converter for managing engine emissions associated with cold start conditions within gasoline engines.
“Global automakers are relying on Honeywell to help them manage the increasing emission targets for CO2 and particulate emissions, and our third generation gas turbo technology helps them achieve those goals, without sacrificing performance,” said Chief Technology Officer Craig Balis, Honeywell Transportation Systems. “We have plenty of innovations available and on the horizon for gas and diesel applications – as well as hybrid and fuel cell powertrains.”
Honeywell is also showcasing its newest Two Stage Wastegate-VNT diesel engine turbocharger. This combination of turbo technologies debuts in the Opel Astra 1.6L engine and provides enhanced performance across a wide range of engine speeds. This diesel architecture adds electric actuation for faster response. The compact side-by-side design of this two-stage turbocharger increases power density up to 17 percent and torque by 10 percent over the industry standards providing excellent dynamic response and acceleration. This system also helps reduce NOxby up to 20 percent and CO2 emission by 10 percent over industry standards.
Honeywell is also showing its Two Stage Electric Compressor for fuel cell powertrains. Used by Honda Motor Company for its hydrogen-powered Clarity Fuel Cell vehicle, Honeywell's compressor represents a fusion of aerospace and automotive competencies offered at a lower cost structure and quality level that matches the needs of the automotive industry in advancing zero-emissions vehicles.
Honeywell has achieved an automotive first by adapting its existing air foil bearing technology from its aerospace portfolio. These bearings are cooled by themachine's own compressed air eliminating the potential for poisoning the fuel cell with any oils or greases and helping ensure zero emissions.
