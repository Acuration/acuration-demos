What is the Quantum Volume metric?
Quantum Volume is a metric that can be used to express the effectiveness of a given quantum computer. The larger the quantum volume, the more complex problems that can be solved. Read more here.
What is full connectivity and why is it important?
Full connectivity means that any qubit can interact directly with any other qubit without a need for intermediary qubit interactions. This enables significantly deeper quantum circuits and more advanced algorithms.
What is Mid-Circuit Measurement and how can it be used?
Mid-Circuit Measurement is a unique feature that allows qubits to be selectively measured at a point other than the end of a quantum circuit.  The quantum information of a measured qubit collapses to a classical state (zero or one), but the non-measured qubits retain their quantum state.  Based on the measured qubit, users can decide what actions to take further in the circuit.  Essentially, it is a quantum “IF” statement.
Once a qubit has been measured, it can be reinitialized and reincorporated into the quantum circuit to be reused for additional operations.  In this way, larger systems can be modeled with smaller numbers of qubits.
What is the benefit of high-resolution rotations?
Honeywell systems use laser-based gates to enable precise rotations within single-qubit gate operations, rather than requiring a multi-step, composite operation to produce the same rotation angle.  This allows for greater efficiency of operations within a circuit’s depth.
What is a typical wait time in the queue?
Quantum jobs submitted into Honeywell’s queue are executed based on an equitable queueing system that grants multiple parties fair access to the system.
What tools are available for simulation?
There are several open-source simulation tools currently available on the market that can be leveraged for algorithm development.
Honeywell offers a Syntax Validation tool, which allows users to test their code through all compilation steps and ensure coding bugs are eliminated prior to spending HQCs on system access.
What support is available for developing algorithms and circuit design?
We encourage you to engage a quantum algorithm developer to help design your circuits. We are open to providing guidance on adapting your circuits to take advantage of Honeywell’s differentiated features.
