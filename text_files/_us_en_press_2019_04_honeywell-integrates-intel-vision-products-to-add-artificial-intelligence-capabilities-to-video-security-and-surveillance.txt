Honeywell Integrates Intel® Vision Products To Add Artificial Intelligence Capabilities To Video Security And Surveillance
Honeywell Integrates Intel® Vision Products To Add Artificial Intelligence Capabilities To Video Security And Surveillance
April 9, 2019
ATLANTA, April 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced a first-of-its-kind technology integration with Intel that will enable new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in its MAXPRO® connected security platform. The new security platform, which will support MAXPRO Network Video Recorders (NVR) and Video Management Systems (VMS), will incorporate Intel® Vision products that enable advanced analytics, deep learning and facial recognition capabilities. These greatly enhanced security solutions will drive cost and time savings by significantly reducing false alarms and will meet compliance requirements such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through identity anonymization.
"Ensuring the security of commercial buildings and the safety of those within them has always been Honeywell's top priority," said Pete Lau, President, Commercial Security, Honeywell. "With emerging technology like analytics, facial recognition and deep learning, Honeywell and Intel are connecting buildings and protecting people like never before."
Advances in security and surveillance technology have increased demand for high-definition video and imaging offered by Internet Protocol (IP) cameras. The video surveillance global market is estimated to exceed $68 billion by 2023. At the same time, the technology to properly process the surge in vision data has lagged. End users require a solution that combines both building security and IT systems to address the challenge.
The integration of Intel Vision Products into the Honeywell MAXPRO NVR and VMS products will result in solutions that enhance site security and operator productivity. These integrated, customizable products will accelerate the processing time of each video stream and increase the number of cameras that can stream in real time through a single device. The adoption of Intel® Vision Accelerator Design products will provide Honeywell's security offerings with advanced AI capabilities with computational efficiency, allowing them to analyze video data with improved detection accuracy.
"With rapid advances in AI technology fueled by the influx of enormous amounts of visual data, our customers are presented with powerful new opportunities in multiple areas including edge video analytics and security," said Jonathan Ballon, Vice President, Intel Internet of Things Group. "The Honeywell MAXPRO solution, powered by Intel Vision Products, allows customers to process and analyze visual data in near real-time to make decisions faster, drive faster time to results and help ensure secure buildings, campus environments and banking institutions."
Beyond the software and hardware integrations, the partnership will also leverage the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit, which fast tracks the development of computer vision and deep learning inference into vision applications. Through the toolkit, end users can accelerate computer vision performance, shorten vision solution development, and streamline deep learning inference and deployment.
The toolkit's deep learning capabilities will support Honeywell's Face Recognition analytics, providing another layer of detail in the software that allows it to learn faces of known entities in an organization. The software is also capable of removing face recognition data it doesn't recognize in compliance with GDPR requirements.
Honeywell will join the Intel IoT Solutions Alliance (ISA) and participate in Intel IoT RFP Ready Kits. A global organization comprised of more than 250 technology companies, ISA is dedicated to the development of scalable IoT and machine internet solutions. Intel IoT RFP Ready Kits are focused technology offerings that solve a class of market problems, have been deployed and tested in the field, and provide bundled hardware, software and support. The technology is designed to grow with customer requirements.
Honeywell MAXPRO and Face Recognition are among a suite of vision security solutions alongside Xtralis LoiterTrace, an image analysis tool that identifies and tracks suspicious activity, and Xtralis IntrusionTrace, a video analytics program for real-time intrusion detection. The solutions suite is ideal for high traffic, sensitive environments including enterprise campuses, pharmaceutical companies, and banking and financial institutions.
