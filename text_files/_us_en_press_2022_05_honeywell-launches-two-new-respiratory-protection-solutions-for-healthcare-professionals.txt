Honeywell Launches Two New Respiratory Protection Solutions For Healthcare Professionals
Honeywell Launches Two New Respiratory Protection Solutions For Healthcare Professionals
The new N95 respirator is designed for healthcare professionals with smaller facial features
The new filtered, reusable half mask respirator allows healthcare workers to wear it comfortably for hours
These new product offerings expand a best-in-class personal protective equipment portfolio and enable an ecosystem of improved safety and protection of human health
May 5, 2022
CHARLOTTE, N.C., MAY 5, 2022 -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) announced today two new NIOSH-certified respiratory offerings to help meet the needs of healthcare workers. The new products expand Honeywell’s personal protective equipment (PPE) portfolio for healthcare professionals, incorporating the company’s decades of expertise producing respiratory-protection solutions.
As the next generation of the surgical N95 respirator, Honeywell designed the DC365 Small Surgical N95 Respirator to help protect frontline workers who need a smaller sized surgical N95. This new product increases Honeywell’s robust PPE offerings, designed to better suit frontline workers with smaller facial features, offering a more secure fit to keep them and their surroundings safe, and solving a challenge faced within the healthcare industry, particularly affecting women[1].
Designed for heightened levels of filtration efficiency, secure fit and breathing comfort in a variety of clinical settings, the new half mask respirator (RU8500X series) is a solution that healthcare workers can wear for hours during long shifts. Due to its filtered exhalation valve and a HEPA P100 filter, this reusable respirator allows for high performing protection (99.9%) and provides source control to the wearer and those around them.
“At Honeywell, our experienced team of researchers and designers are dedicated to uncovering end user needs so that they can do their jobs more effectively and, most importantly, safer,” said Morgan Kurk, President of Honeywell’s Personal Protective Equipment business. “We understand that the healthcare community today needs respiratory protection that they can wear comfortably for hours and that there is not a one-size-fits all solution. With these two new products, we’re expanding our offerings to be more reflective of the unique needs of professionals across the healthcare industry.”
Hospitals and healthcare settings are challenging work environments that contain bacteria, viruses and chemicals that can impair the health of doctors, nurses and first responders. Given the rapid evolution of needs within the healthcare industry and the increased call for innovative solutions, these two new products complement the existing Honeywell portfolio by ensuring every frontline healthcare worker can have the right respiratory PPE for their role regardless of their size.
As one of the world’s largest producers of respiratory protection for frontline workers, Honeywell’s solutions help protect lives and workplaces through reliability, efficiency and accuracy. Alongside the small sized surgical N95 and half mask respirator for the healthcare setting, Honeywell offers a robust portfolio of PPE including reusable eye protection, disposable nitrile gloves and face shields all designed to provide protection to frontline workers in clinical settings globally.
