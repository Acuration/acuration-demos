Honeywell Software Upgrade Empowers Connected Aircraft Capabilities In Cockpit And Cabin
Honeywell Software Upgrade Empowers Connected Aircraft Capabilities In Cockpit And Cabin
October 12, 2017
LAS VEGAS, Oct. 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has released an upgrade to its popular CNX-900 router that allows business aviation operators to reap the benefits of wireless database loading. Connected Aircraft equipped with Honeywell's Primus Epic avionics system can now remotely stage their flight navigation databases onto aircraft from Honeywell's secure server. This simple software upgrade alleviates the manual hassle and logistics of getting the database to the aircraft, thus enhancing the data-loading experience for operators and maintainers while also giving passengers more flexibility in their connectivity options.
"Traditionally, operators had to bring equipment onboard or strategically plan missions to be home every time they needed to load a database. Now, with Honeywell's CNX-900 router, the database can be stored on the CNX-900 over Wi-Fi or cellular remotely anywhere in the world, and customers can easily initiate loading of database," said John Peterson, senior director, GoDirect Connectivity and Flight Support Services. "These types of aircraft upgrades demonstrate our commitment to deliver advanced services in the cabin and cockpit that help business aviation operators enjoy significant time and cost savings."
Today, aircraft in a hangar need to physically connect a laptop to a data loader to transfer their databases. That transfer also involves logistics such as preparing databases onto media that need to be carried to the aircraft prior to commencing loading activities. Now, operators can save the time normally spent setting up equipment and scheduling flights around database loading. In addition, they can save the thousands of dollars needed to fly a maintenance crew to a site if data-loading equipment is unexpectedly required.
Offering one of the most advanced routing software application suites available today, Honeywell's CNX-900 cabin network router provides a reliable, consistent and secure in-flight wireless connection while also enabling business aviation operators and passengers to control their costs. With this new feature, Honeywell is the only hardware provider that helps operators have a seamless experience with database loading into a Primus Epic flight deck while also providing a cabin router, all from one box. Aftermarket upgrades are available for business jets already equipped with Primus Epic, including Gulfstream G650 aircraft. Offerings for other platforms will soon be available.
To learn more about Honeywell's cabin network capabilities, visit Honeywell's website for information on the CNX-900 router and the GoDirect services platform. We also welcome you to come by Honeywell's booth #N5100 at NBAA 2017 to ask any questions about our remote database feature.
