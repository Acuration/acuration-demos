Honeywell Mobile Computers Earn U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency Cybersecurity Certification
Honeywell Mobile Computers Earn U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency Cybersecurity Certification
Security Technical Implementation Guide approval allows mobile devices to operate on U.S. Department of Defense networks
April 8, 2021
CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 8, 2021 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that four of its mobile computers have received Security Technical Implementation Guide certification from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Honeywell is the first rugged mobile computer provider with advanced data capture capabilities to achieve this accreditation.
This certification and validation gives U.S. Department of Defense workers the opportunity to use the CK65, CT60 XP, CT40 XP and CN80G mobile computers to increase productivity and error-proof workflows.
“The U.S. Department of Defense cybersecurity requirements are among the most stringent in the world,” said Kevin Dehoff, president of Honeywell’s Productivity Solutions and Services business. “This is a milestone years in the making to be able to work closely with the U.S. Government to provide efficiencies to their workflows. This accreditation also reinforces our commitment in the Android mobile device space that our devices can meet and exceed the strictest of cybersecurity standards.”
Commonly referred to as STIGs, the DISA is responsible for setting cybersecurity standards to help prevent unauthorized access and malicious attacks by fortifying and protecting information systems and software.
The multi-year testing and validation process included meeting and passing a series of requirements conducted by independent organizations to ensure its security capabilities. More information about our STIG approval can be found here.
The mobile devices are now listed on the Department of Defense’s “Approved Products List.” This catalog lets a potential Department of Defense customer know these mobile computers have addressed all the cybersecurity and information assurance requirements and can be plugged into the Department of Defense network.
All four approved mobile computers are built on Honeywell's Mobility EdgeTM platform, offering an integrated, repeatable and scalable approach to workflow automation based on a common hardware and software platform. Mobility Edge provides unbeaten product lifecycle and is currently the only mobile computer platform that guarantees compatibility through Android 12 across all devices.
