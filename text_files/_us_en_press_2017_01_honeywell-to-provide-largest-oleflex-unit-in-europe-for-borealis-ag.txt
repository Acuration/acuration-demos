Honeywell To Provide Largest Oleflex Unit In Europe For Borealis AG
Honeywell To Provide Largest Oleflex Unit In Europe For Borealis AG
January 30, 2017
DES PLAINES, Ill., Jan. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that Borealis AG selected Honeywell UOP's process technology for a proposed plant in Kallo, Belgium, that converts propane into propylene, a primary ingredient for making plastics.
Borealis proposes to use Honeywell UOP's C3 Oleflex technology to produce a targeted 740,000 metric tons per year of polymer-grade propylene. When completed, it will be UOP's third C3 Oleflex unit &endash; and the largest -- in Europe.
"Demand for propylene in Europe continues to rise at the same time the supply from refineries and steam crackers is beginning to slow down," said Mike Millard, vice president and general manager of Honeywell UOP's Process Technology and Equipment business. "Oleflex technology is an on-purpose, reliable route to fill propylene supply gaps and support derivative production in Europe."
In addition to technology licensing, Honeywell is providing the basic engineering design as well as services, equipment, catalysts and adsorbents for the plant.
Honeywell UOP's Oleflex technology uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert propane to propylene and is proven to have the lowest cash cost of production and the highest return on investment compared with competing technologies. Its low energy consumption, low emissions and fully recyclable, platinum-alumina-based catalyst system minimizes its impact on the environment. The unique process design maximizes operating flexibility and on-stream reliability.
In addition to the C3 Oleflex process, Honeywell UOP also licenses C4 Oleflex technology, which converts isobutane to isobutylene, the primary ingredient for making high-octane fuel and synthetic rubber.
Honeywell UOP's Oleflex technology has been selected for 37 out of 44 projects globally since 2011, including propane (C3), isobutane (iC4) and mixed C3/ iC4 service.
Borealis is a leading provider of innovative solutions in the fields of polyolefins, base chemicals and fertilizers. With headquarters in Vienna, Austria, the company currently has around 6,500 employees and operates in over 120 countries. A feasibility study for the Kallo plant is under way, with final investment decision expected in the third quarter of 2018 and potential start-up of the plant in the second half of 2021.
Honeywell UOP (www.uop.com) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. Honeywell UOP is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions (www.honeywellprocess.com), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries.
