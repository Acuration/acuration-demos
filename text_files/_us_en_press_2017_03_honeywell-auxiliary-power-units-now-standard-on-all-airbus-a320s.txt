Honeywell Auxiliary Power Units Now Standard On All Airbus A320s
Honeywell Auxiliary Power Units Now Standard On All Airbus A320s
March 22, 2017
PHOENIX, March 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Airbus has designated the Honeywell (NYSE: HON) 131-9A auxiliary power unit as standard equipment for its A320 family of aircraft‚ it is no longer just a selectable option for airlines. Honeywell's auxiliary power unit is now recognized as the gold standard for the A320 family that provides significant fuel savings and demonstrated reliability.
"Reducing operating costs while offering customers the best air travel experience possible continues to be key for airlines," said Brian Sill, president, Engines and Power Systems, Honeywell Aerospace. "Together, Honeywell and Airbus are offering A320 series customers an APU with best-in-class operational efficiency enabling more efficient, safe and comfortable travel experience for airline passengers."
Honeywell recently shipped its 5,000th 131-9A auxiliary power unit (APU). This puts the number of production APUs from the 131-9 family at more than 11,000 units, with more than 100 million total flight hours. The 131-9 series auxiliary power unit has been selected by airlines for the majority of narrow-body aircraft. Its proven reliability helps reduce delays and flight cancellations, allowing airlines to stay on schedule so that their customers can reach their destinations on time.
About Honeywell APUs
The 131-9 family is unique because it features an electronic control box that integrates advanced, plain-English troubleshooting logic and health-monitoring capabilities for intuitive maintenance. The 131-9 APU's best-in-class operational efficiency, along with Honeywell's global network of customer support managers and technical engineers operating in over 30 countries, helps customers achieve on-time flight schedules.
Honeywell invented the first APU in 1948 and is still the largest producer of gas turbine engines across the globe. The company has produced more than 95,000 APUs, and has more than 36,000 in service today across more than 150 regional, executive, commercial and military applications, including both fixed wing and rotary wing.
An APU is a critical component of an aircraft. It is a small gas turbine engine that provides electrical power for starting an aircraft's main engines, and runs air conditioning and other systems while the plane is on the ground. The APU allows passengers to enjoy a comfortable cabin environment while waiting for takeoff. It also provides primary or backup electrical power for environmental, cockpit and hydraulic systems during flight.
