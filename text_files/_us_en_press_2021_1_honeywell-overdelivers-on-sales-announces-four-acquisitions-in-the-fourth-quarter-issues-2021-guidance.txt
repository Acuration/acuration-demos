January 29, 2021
CHARLOTTE, N.C., January 29, 2021 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 that exceeded investor expectations, as well as its outlook for 2021.
The company reported a fourth-quarter year-over-year sales decline of 6%, down 7% on an organic basis, and a full-year sales decline of 11% on a reported and organic basis. For the full year, operating margin contracted 120 basis points and segment margin contracted 70 basis points, with earnings per share of $6.72 and adjusted earnings per share4 of $7.10, above the high end of our guidance.
“We finished a challenging 2020 with another quarter of sequential improvements in sales growth, margin expansion, and adjusted earnings per share,” said Darius Adamczyk, chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell. “Our focus on delivering differentiated solutions drove double-digit organic sales growth in our defense and space, warehouse automation, personal protective equipment, and recurring connected software businesses for the second consecutive quarter. We continued to prudently reduce costs in the quarter, bringing our full-year total fixed cost savings to $1.5 billion. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.07, flat year-over-year on an adjusted basis1 and above the high end of our guidance. We also continued our focus on generating cash and achieved 170% adjusted free cash flow conversion2 in the quarter. For the year, we generated $6.2 billion in operating cash flow with 130% conversion and $5.3 billion in free cash flow with 105% adjusted free cash flow conversion5.
“Honeywell’s strong balance sheet put us in a good position to weather the challenges of 2020 while investing for future growth. We invested in high-return capital expenditures, repurchased $3.7 billion of Honeywell shares, completed three acquisitions, made six new investments within Honeywell Ventures, and announced our 11th consecutive dividend increase. Even with this level of cash deployment, we ended 2020 with $15.2 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand,” Adamczyk said.
The company also announced its outlook for 2021. Honeywell expects sales of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion, representing year-over-year organic growth of 1% to 4%; segment margin expansion of 30 to 70 basis points; earnings per share of $7.60 to $8.00, up 7% to 13% adjusted3; operating cash flow of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion, and free cash flow6 of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. A summary of the company’s 2021 guidance can be found in Table 1.
Adamczyk concluded, “I am very proud of the way Honeywell responded to the crisis in 2020. We quickly focused on liquidity, cost management, and execution, while rapidly innovating and ramping up production of a wide array of offerings to help the world recover, including critical personal protective equipment. We also remained focused on growth and investing in new markets and technologies. We entered 2021 with positive momentum following two quarters of sequential improvement. I am confident we are well-positioned for the economic recovery and will continue to perform for our shareowners, our customers, and our employees in the short and long term.”
Fourth-Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the fourth quarter were down 6% on a reported basis and down 7% on an organic basis. The fourth-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.
Aerospace sales for the fourth quarter were down 19% on an organic basis driven by lower commercial aftermarket demand due to the ongoing impact of reduced flight hours and lower volumes in commercial original equipment, partially offset by double-digit growth in Defense and Space. Segment margin expanded 150 basis points to 27.6% driven by productivity actions and commercial excellence.
Honeywell Building Technologies sales for the fourth quarter were down 4% on an organic basis driven by timing of Building Solutions projects and lower demand for security products and building management systems, partially offset by growth in commercial fire. Building Solutions orders were up double digits year-over-year, driven by large project bookings in the Americas and Europe. Segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 21.4%. Margin performance was driven by commercial excellence and productivity actions.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the fourth quarter were down 12% on an organic basis driven by continued delays in Process Solutions automation projects as well as volume declines in smart energy and thermal solutions, and lower gas processing projects, catalyst shipments, licensing, and engineering due to softness in the oil and gas sector in UOP, partially offset by return to growth in Advanced Materials driven by demand for fluorine products. Segment margin contracted 380 basis points to 18.7% driven by the impact of lower sales volumes and mix, partially offset by productivity actions.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the fourth quarter were up 27% on an organic basis driven by double-digit Intelligrated and personal protective equipment growth as well as strength in productivity solutions and services. Orders were up double digits year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter, driven by strong personal protective equipment and productivity solutions and services orders growth. Backlog remained at a record high. Segment margin expanded 260 basis points to 15.3% driven by productivity actions and higher volumes.

This release contains financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Honeywell’s non-GAAP financial measures used in this release are as follows: segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, a measure by which we assess operating performance, which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in the Appendix; segment margin, on an overall Honeywell basis, which we define as segment profit divided by sales; organic sales growth, which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation, and acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following transaction date; free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and should the proposed reorganization plan contemplated in the plan support agreement signed by Garrett be confirmed, free cash flow definition would be revised to include cash payment from Garrett to Honeywell under such proposed reorganization plan; adjusted free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and which we adjust to exclude the impact of separation costs related to the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett, if and as noted in the release; adjusted free cash flow conversion, which we define as adjusted free cash flow divided by net income attributable to Honeywell, excluding pension mark-to-market, adjustments to the charges taken in connection with the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge, non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from Garrett, net of proceeds from settlement of related hedging transaction, and 2Q20 favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions, if and as noted in the release; and adjusted earnings per share, which we adjust to exclude pension mark-to-market, adjustments to the charges taken in connection with the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge, non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from Garrett, net of proceeds from settlement of related hedging transaction, and 2Q20 favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions, if and as noted in the release. The respective tax rates applied when adjusting earnings per share for these items are identified in the release or in the reconciliations presented in the Appendix. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Refer to the Appendix attached to this release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
