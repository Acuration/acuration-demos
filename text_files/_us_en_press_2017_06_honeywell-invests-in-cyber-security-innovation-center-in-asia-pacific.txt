June 8, 2017
SINGAPORE, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) Process Solutions (HPS), with the support of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), will establish a new industrial cyber security center of excellence (COE) for Asia Pacific in Singapore. The COE will feature a state-of-the-art cyber security research and development lab, an advanced training facility and a security operations center that provides managed security services.
"Honeywell's major investments in new industrial cyber security technologies, services, and advanced research &endash; including this new center of excellence in Singapore &endash; will further strengthen our ability to secure and protect industrial assets, operations and people," said Jeff Zindel, vice president and general manager, Honeywell Industrial Cyber Security. "The COE will provide a world-class innovation platform for smart industry, critical infrastructure protection and securing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in the Asia Pacific region."
The new facility in Singapore, which is the first for Asia Pacific, is a further expansion of Honeywell's global network of innovation centers. The lab will be used for proprietary research and development of new cyber security technologies and products, hands-on training and certifications, and testing and validation of industrial cyber security solutions. It will enable rapid development and introduction of innovative cyber security solutions to the regional and global markets.
The facility will also deliver managed industrial cyber security services to help users reduce the risk of security breaches and proactively improve their security posture. Managed services include continuous security and performance monitoring and alerting, security asset management, and incident response with 24 hour expert support 365 days a year.
"As part of Singapore's push toward Advanced Manufacturing and a digital economy, EDB has been actively partnering with the industrial and infrastructural sectors to embrace the potential of digitalization," said Ms. Fong Pin Fen, director for Cities, Infrastructure & Industrial Solutions at EDB. "A key component of success in our efforts is cyber security. Critical systems will have to be protected and on this note, we are pleased to support Honeywell in the opening of its new Industrial Cyber Security COE, which will help the industry remain secure as it embarks on its digital transformation."
The COE will be located at Honeywell's office in Singapore's Changi Business Park and is expected to open by the end of 2017. In addition, Honeywell is opening a similar facility in Dubai this year. Honeywell's first cyber security lab is based in Atlanta.
