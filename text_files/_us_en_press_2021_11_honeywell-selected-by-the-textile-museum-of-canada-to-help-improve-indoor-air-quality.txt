Honeywell Selected by the Textile Museum of Canada to Help Improve Indoor Air Quality
Honeywell Selected by the Textile Museum of Canada to Help Improve Indoor Air Quality
Museum using high-efficiency air filters and UV-C light to support its efforts to enhance the visitor experience
November 4, 2021
TORONTO, November 4, 2021 — Textile Museum of Canada (the Museum), the only museum in Canada dedicated to exploring the human experience through textiles, is working with Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) to create a healthier museum environment by installing new technologies to improve the indoor air quality (IAQ) of its space. The Museum selected Honeywell to deploy a custom solution featuring high-efficiency filters (MERV-13) and ultraviolet (UV-C) lights installed in the building’s HVAC equipment.
Located in downtown Toronto, the Museum delivers programs and exhibitions dedicated to textile arts from local, national and international contemporary artists. The space includes exhibition areas, a learning and makerspace where visitors can buy donated fabric, and a gift shop. Honeywell has been providing mechanical and automation services to the museum for more than 10 years.
The solutions were selected to not only help create a healthier museum environment but also to help preserve the Museum’s collection. A benefit of installing the technology within the building’s HVAC equipment means the Museum can avoid damage to the collection caused by increased light exposure.
“We’re committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all visitors,” said Emma Quin, Director and CEO, Textile Museum of Canada. “In addition to the other health and safety policies we have implemented, these new air quality solutions will help the public feel confident and secure when they visit the Museum.”
Along with the health protocols implemented and aligned with local recommendations, such as limited capacity on a timed-entry basis, face covering requirements, and in accordance with the province’s vaccine certificate policy, requiring all visitors aged 12 and older to show proof of vaccination along with valid ID, the improvements to the Museum’s IAQ will help provide visitors and employees of the Textile Museum of Canada with the comfort of knowing they are in a healthier environment.
“We’re excited to continue our work with the Textile Museum of Canada to help create a custom solution to improve the air quality of their space and support the return to in-person operations,” said Laura Laltrello, vice president and general manager, Services - Honeywell Building Technologies.
Honeywell's Healthy Buildings solutions which integrate air quality, safety, and security technologies along with advanced analytics to help building owners improve the health of their building environments, operate more cleanly and safely, comply with new guidelines, and help reassure occupants. Honeywell’s advanced indoor air quality portfolio can help improve occupant well-being, meet energy efficiency goals, and importantly, change the way that occupants experience a building.
