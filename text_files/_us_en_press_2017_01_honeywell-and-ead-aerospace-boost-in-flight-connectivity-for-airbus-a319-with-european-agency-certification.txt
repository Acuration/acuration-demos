Honeywell And EAD Aerospace Boost In-Flight Connectivity For Airbus A319 With European Agency Certification
Honeywell And EAD Aerospace Boost In-Flight Connectivity For Airbus A319 With European Agency Certification
January 12, 2017
ROLLE, Switzerland, Jan. 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) received European Aviation Safety Agency certification for its JetWaveTM high-speed satellite communications hardware on the Airbus A319. The certification allows JetWave to be installed and used on the A319 aircraft, providing passengers, pilots and operators with access to Inmarsat's Global Xpress Ka-band service, GX Aviation – the only high-speed wireless network that covers the entire globe while achieving speeds similar to those experienced at home or in the office.
Honeywell's equipment gives users access to a stable "Wi-Fi in the Sky" experience allowing them to easily surf the net, check email, download large files, shop online, make video calls and access movies on demand without a drop in service, even when flying over oceans. Several leading global airlines have committed to Honeywell's JetWave hardware and the Inmarsat network, in addition to other business jet manufacturers.
EAD Aerospace, an Eclipse company, which works closely with Honeywell, obtained the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification to install JetWave on the A319. As the exclusive hardware that allows aircraft to connect to GX Aviation, JetWave enables pilots to access online services and allows passengers to browse the internet, check emails, and stream music and videos throughout their flight. Operators and maintenance personnel can also benefit from real-time updates to maximize flight efficiency and safety.
"Our JetWave hardware is designed with ease of installation and maintenance in mind to ensure reliable cabin connectivity as well as a consistent Wi-Fi in the Sky experience for users," said James MacDougall, director, Product Marketing, Honeywell Aerospace. "With this certification from EASA, we look forward to providing Airbus A319 operators, pilots and passengers with access to the ultimate broadband solution for the skies."
The EASA certification follows Honeywell's first Airbus A319 installation as part of a VIP project in October 2016, which featured state-of-the-art technologies and custom-made interior fittings. Previously, JetWave has also received certification from both EASA and the Federal Aviation Administration for safety, environmental and installation standards.
