Meet a #futureshaper: Charlotte Loomis
Here's how she's making brains for ears
July 17, 2019
Charlotte Loomis knows that little foam earplugs have a big impact on protecting workers from hearing loss.
Charlotte champions our ear protection line, which enables workers to clearly hear important communication but blocks out dangerous noises.
“We keep people safe and that is a pretty amazing accomplishment to achieve,” Charlotte said.
Based in San Diego, Cali., here is her #futureshaper story.
Did you think you’d end up in a job like you’re in now?
Yes, I figured out early on that I love business, especially the business of marketing manufactured goods. I did not expect to become an expert in personal protective equipment. I love this product line, because it makes a tangible difference in workers’ lives. We keep people safe and that is a pretty amazing accomplishment to achieve.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
As a kid I was always fascinated with how things work and why.  At museums and historical sites, I spent more time watching the tour guide explain things than I did looking at the exhibits. So, it’s no surprise that I’m now working with people explaining how things work and, most importantly, why.
What do you do?
I act as the bridge between the customer/user of the product we are developing and the engineers that are designing/producing the product. I represent the customer’s perspective.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day?
Helping customers choose, specify, use and appreciate our products. To reach customers effectively, we must mobilize a lot of details and people in all sorts of processes, procedures and information.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell?
I wish people knew how many ways Honeywell touches everyday life. I’ve mapped my personal life in terms of Honeywell: I scan my gym membership card on a Honeywell scanner, I board a plane whose cockpit and air control is managed by a Honeywell system, the plane lands by the guidance of ground crew members that are protected by Honeywell products and I visit my elderly parents in a facility with a security-controlled entrance that uses a Honeywell system. Honeywell is an omniscient guide and protector in our lives.
How has Honeywell changed since you began working here?
Honeywell is defining itself for the future with the Internet of Things. I’m proud that Honeywell is changing.
Why is the future important?
The future is important for all generations. The world and its inhabitants are all changing. We won’t be the same in ten years.
How does your job make tomorrow better and safer than today?
We make workers safe. My job is changing to make industries better with more data. With that data our customers can make better decisions for their biggest asset, their workforce.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper should have?
Be open minded. Be willing to be uncomfortable with the unknown or out-of-the-box thinking. Embrace that what we do today will impact the future, so take a strong position to own those actions.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
The workplace – including what we think of as less technical industries (smoke stack, manufacturing), will use data and the Internet of Things every day, seamlessly, to run their business.
What do you for fun?
Downhill skiing with my husband Jim and son Spencer is at the top of my list. We have skied the most in Colorado and Utah. And we love spending the holidays with our extended family.
