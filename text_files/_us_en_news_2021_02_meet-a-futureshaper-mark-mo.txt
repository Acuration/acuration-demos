Meet a #futureshaper: Mark Mo
Meet a #futureshaper: Mark Mo
He's making burners cleaner.
Mark Mo leads engineers.
“Innovation is in everything we do,” Mark said. “We do not just develop new solutions, but we work with marketing to think about the long-term trends of our technology and identify future offering.”
Based in Suzhou City, China; here is his #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I was born in the mountains. When I grew up, I wanted to be an engineer to develop agricultural machinery so that the farmers could work more efficiently.
What brought you to Honeywell?
I’ve always wanted to be a pioneer who makes a difference with the power of innovation, which is the culture of Honeywell!
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
Honeywell has an extraordinary culture that values innovation. There are many fellows and scientists, who are willing to discuss with you and support you on any problems and challenges.
Did you ever imagine you would end up in the job you are now?
Yes. I’ve always dreamed of developing solutions that benefit human life and solve social problems.
What do you do?
My job is to design and manufacture innovations that generate heat, including an ignition spark, flame monitor, controls to “cook” steel, glass, or ceramic as part of the manufacturing process.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
A thousand years ago, humans generated heat from burning wood. Now, we can control the burning process safely and smoothly. In the future, auto controls, artificial intelligence and smart controls will be used in industry applications. The devices will be deeply integrated and smart controlled. It will be part of an unmanned factory, the burning process will be more efficient and auto-controlled with less or even zero pollution.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
A #futureshaper should have a global vision, embrace or value the existence of differences, have a conscious sense of innovation and dare to question. They should also cultivate values, morals and have a profound humanistic quality.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Have enough curiosity in everything, not just in the task assigned! Technology has no boundaries. You need to learn from various fields to see how it can be applied to current work.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I like running and climbing mountains on weekends and looking for inspiration from nature.
