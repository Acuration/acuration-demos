Honeywell Launches Maxpro® Cloud Integrated Security Platform In Europe Designed Specifically For SMB Customers
Connected building platform on the Cloud designed for small-to-medium businesses
integrates access, intrusion and video surveillance
Runcorn, UK, February 26, 2018 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced its MAXPRO Cloud platform – the integrated security offering designed specifically for small-to-medium-sized (SMB) businesses – will be available in Europe. MAXPRO Cloud is hosted on Microsoft Azure® and integrates access, intrusion and video surveillance data into a single user interface. With support for single or multiple locations, MAXPRO Cloud provides a new tool to secure facilities while simplifying security operations.
MAXPRO Cloud is a flexible and scalable platform which enables customers to achieve more efficient safety and security, reduces IT infrastructure costs, and streamlines operations by empowering small-to-medium business owners to efficiently operate and access data from their access, intrusion and video systems. For example, a business with multiple sites can use MAXPRO Cloud to make decisions on access control remotely from a smartphone, instead of having to spend time accessing a desktop computer at one particular location. In addition, because the system is cloud-hosted there is no additional server or software to buy and manage. MAXPRO Cloud gives installers the opportunity to create new recurring monthly revenue from cloud hosted systems, while providing an integrated security platform with lower installation and service costs.
“With remote access management, SMBs no longer have to face costly downtime waiting for the correct person with the key to open facilities,” said Alessandro Araldi, vice president of global product management, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “Enabling customers to remotely monitor their environments through the cloud with Microsoft Azure, businesses can protect their critical assets through a cost-effective solution.”
Additionally, the MAXPRO Cloud application programming interface (API) will be available on the Honeywell Developer Portal allowing Honeywell’s developer community to create custom apps. The Honeywell Developer Portal provides a comprehensive development environment, with state-of-the-art tools and APIs to enable and accelerate the creation of new services and innovative applications fully integrated with Honeywell platforms.
