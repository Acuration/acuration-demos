Honeywell and Lufthansa Technik Create World's Largest Maintenance Repair and Overhaul Capability for Airbus A350 Fleets
Honeywell and Lufthansa Technik Create World's Largest Maintenance Repair and Overhaul Capability for Airbus A350 Fleets
November 13, 2017
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Nov. 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has signed Lufthansa Technik as a licensed component repair center and exclusive global asset provider for all Honeywell components and the HGT 1700 APU on Airbus A350 aircraft. Under the agreement, Lufthansa Technik will offer A350 operators around the world an unequaled experience with maintenance, repair and overhaul services for all Honeywell components, including auxiliary power units.
"We are delighted to extend our relationship with Honeywell with this new agreement, which provides a gateway to quicker and more reliable services for our customers," said Robert Gaag, vice president, Corporate Sales EMEA, Lufthansa Technik. "Honeywell's best-in-class design and engineering knowledge base combined with our continuous repair improvement philosophy and world-class asset management services provides us with everything we need to respond to a range of maintenance, repair and overhaul needs."
Lufthansa Technik's highly efficient asset availability solutions, combined with its broad range of in-house maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) capabilities, provide operators with a variety of services ranging from single component MRO to more integrated, flight-hour based "nose-to-tail" asset availability solutions. As Honeywell's Aircraft on Ground (AOG) service provider, A350 operators can expect immediate, "one phone call" access to exchanges and rental assets via Lufthansa Technik's global logistics footprint.
"The groundbreaking design of the Airbus A350 demands an equally impressive maintenance, repair and overhaul solution to ensure fleets remain operational and efficient," said David Shilliday, vice president, Airlines, for the Europe, Middle East, Africa and India, Honeywell Aerospace. "With our continued support, Lufthansa Technik has a winning combination of technology and expertise to offer an unparalleled customer experience."
Since the A350's entry into service in late 2014, Lufthansa Technik has had two years of operational experience managing six in-service A350 fleets with more than 50 in-service aircraft. The new agreement extends Honeywell's longstanding relationship with Lufthansa Technik as a Honeywell-licensed repair facility for mechanical, avionic components and hydro-mechanical units, and demonstrates its commitment to reduce aircraft downtime, providing faster turnaround and getting aircraft back in service.
