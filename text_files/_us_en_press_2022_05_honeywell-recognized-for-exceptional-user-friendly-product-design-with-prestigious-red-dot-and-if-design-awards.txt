Honeywell Recognized For Exceptional User-Friendly Product Design With Prestigious Red Dot And iF Design Awards
Honeywell Recognized For Exceptional User-Friendly Product Design With Prestigious Red Dot And iF Design Awards
With a continued focus on accessibility and user-centric design, nine Honeywell products were honored among thousands of entries
May 3, 2022
CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 3, 2022 -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) announced today it was selected as a winner of 11 product design awards, marking recognition for the company by two of the largest and most industry-recognized award programs, the Red Dot and iF Design Awards. Showcasing innovation, functionality and longevity in design, these product-specific accolades celebrate Honeywell’s ongoing dedication to providing a best-in-class user experience that supports workplace and worker safety.
Since 2017, Honeywell has won more than 50 international design awards which recognize the skills of the Honeywell User Experience (HUE) team, a collaborative group of designers around the world who partner to drive value in the design process. The HUE team is dedicated to creating user-focused solutions by combining insights from and observations of key customers with deep domain knowledge, comprehensive understanding of technologies and a co-design approach with users from start to finish.
“Honeywell’s experience and user-centric approach is a core component within designing products and digital solutions,” said Pete Holdcroft, director of User Experience Design, Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions. “We continuously provide value by understanding the needs of users, customers, installers, maintainers, channel partners and employees to design intuitive, desirable and differentiated end-to-end experiences.”
The Red Dot Design Award is one of the world’s largest design competitions, awarded each year to organizations that distinguish their business activities through design. Expert juries in the areas of Product Design, Communication Design, and Design Concepts award Red Dot designations.
Similarly, the iF Design Award has been a global marker of quality design since 1952 and is internationally recognized as a symbol of design excellence. This year’s iF awards were highly competitive, with nearly 11,000 entrants competing for recognition.
Winning products from Honeywell include:
The CT30XP Mobile Computer (Red Dot and iF Design winners), an intuitive device with a sleek and modern feel that is easy to learn to use. The HUE design process resulted in one-piece device construction instead of two-piece, allowing the product to be smaller, lighter and pocketable for users in healthcare and soft-goods retail.
The H700 Safety Harness (Red Dot and iF Design winners), a fall protection device with a patented one-step trauma relief mechanism. The HUE design team incorporated “voice of the customer” feedback and user experience tests of material breathability and thermal conductivity into the design of the product to help ensure the harness not only keeps workers safe but also comfortable and productive when working at great heights.
The BEATS Platform (Red Dot winner), a building management system that provides customers with ease of installation, maintenance and scalability. The platform uses an open system that can be integrated with cloud-based analytics to provide insights into energy use and occupant well-being.
The BW Pod (Red Dot winner), a gas detector enclosure that enables workers to assess gas exposure risk without damaging their detectors. Through the HUE design and testing process, the team discovered the need for devices that could go into deeper wells and withstand harsher conditions. The resulting technology is rugged enough to handle these environments and helps save workers time on pre-entry checks.
The EDA5S Handheld Computer (Red Dot winner), a device for the retail sector that leverages a scan engine powerful enough for fast barcode reading in the field. The HUE design process resulted in a smaller battery so the device could be slimmer and easier to carry for an entire retail shift.
The TC500A-N Commercial Connected Thermostat (Red Dot winner), a connected thermostat that small and medium-sized buildings can use to help them meet commercial building code compliance and rigorous energy efficiency standards. Features include fast and easy commissioning, the flexibility of wired or wireless connectivity, integration with existing building management systems, high user security and integrated energy-saving features for rooftop and heat pump units.
The Vertex Compliance Toxic Gas Monitoring System (iF Design winner), a technology that detects ultrasensitive gases in high-tech operations, such as semiconductor foundries, to help companies protect their employees and assets.
The Transmission Risk Air Monitor (iF Design winner), a device using proprietary technology to measure carbon dioxide levels in an indoor area, like a classroom, and alerts the user when conditions are present that may increase the risk of potential exposure to airborne virus transmission.
Genesis XP Flexible Presentation Scanner (iF Design winner), a hands-free scanner for today’s retail world that offers faster scanning speed and a larger scanning area for increased business productivity and a smooth payment experience at the point-of-sale.
