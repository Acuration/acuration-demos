Meet a #futureshaper: Maribel Wilson
Here's how she's making aerosols 99.9% safer for the planet
May 28, 2019
Maribel oversees technology for our Advanced Materials business in Morris Plains, NJ.
At Honeywell since 1998, she knows firsthand what qualities someone makes the future should have: “Hunger to change the world. Courage to pursue it. Humility to realize they cannot do it alone.”
Here’s her #futureshaper story.
Where did you go to school?
Vanderbilt University, Chemical Engineering; Cornell University Master of Business Administration.
Did you think you’d end up in a job like you’re in now?
No, it isn’t anything I have envisioned but that is what has been good about Honeywell. You get called on to experience things that you might not have thought of on your own.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
For a while I wanted to be a lawyer. I always knew I wanted to be a mother.
What do you do?
I lead a team of inventors. They come up with ideas for new products that solve customer problems. You might not see the products we make but we are in a lot of things you experience every day and you might not know are there.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day?
Bringing new products to market with a team of people that are passionate about what they do. Being better than the competition.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell?
I wish they knew the breadth of what we offer and how we are evolving each day.
How has Honeywell changed since you began working here?
It has always been results-oriented. I believe now it is much more customer focused. Our goals are not set by what we achieved the last quarter or year but in the context of the market trends.
Why is the future important?
It is important because in order to adapt or be ready for it, you must think about it. The future is inevitable, it is how you prepare for it that makes the difference or changes it.
How does your job make tomorrow better/safer than today?
We develop offerings that focus on societal and individual benefits. Whether it is for macro trends such as climate change or offerings that ensure service men and women are safe.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper should have?
Hunger to change the world. Courage to pursue it. Humility to realize they cannot do it alone.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
I think it will change faster than we think. We will see a few disruptive technologies that will really impact how we look at our markets today.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Seek and accept feedback. Work hard at whatever task you are given. Be open to things you might not have considered on your own.
What do you do for fun?
I spend time with my family and friends.
