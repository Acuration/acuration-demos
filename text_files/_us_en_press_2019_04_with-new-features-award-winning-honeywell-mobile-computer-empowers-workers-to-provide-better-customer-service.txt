With New Features, Award-Winning Honeywell Mobile Computer Empowers Workers to Provide Better Customer Service
With New Features, Award-Winning Honeywell Mobile Computer Empowers Workers to Provide Better Customer Service
Next-generation Mobility Edge device utilizes new audio and design capabilities, providing one solution for in-store retail demands
May 3, 2019
FORT MILL, S.C., May 3, 2019 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) recently unveiled an enhanced version of its award-winning, go-to mobile computing solution for retail store associates and highly-mobile workers.
The next-generation Honeywell DolphinTM CT40 mobile computer is a full-touch device for retail, light transportation and logistics and direct store delivery applications. The CT40 is built on Honeywell's Mobility EdgeTM platform, offering the longest security lifecycle in the industry.
Mobility Edge provides a unified hardware architecture and set of software tools that streamline deployment and management of mobility solutions. The scalable platform, which guarantees support through AndroidTM R, enables IT departments to develop and certify a software application a single time before deploying to enterprise mobile devices.
The new, enterprise-class CT40 is now push-to-talk and VoIP ready, eliminating the need to have multiple devices for in-store communications and inventory management. The mobile computer can now empower store associates with solutions like Theatro, pioneers of the world’s first voice-controlled mobile app platform for the hourly workforce, and Optoro, the world’s leading returns optimization platform.
“Retailers need to give associates the right tools to support a superior, in-store experience,” said Taylor Smith, chief marketing officer of Honeywell’s Productivity Products business. “We’ve listened to our customers and have enhanced the CT40 with the highly-mobile, retail store associate in mind, providing them with one powerful mobile computer to improve productivity.”
The CT40 is validated by Android Enterprise Recommended, a Google-led initiative that helps businesses confidently select, deploy, and manage Android devices and services best suited to their enterprise needs.
The mobile computer can be connected to Honeywell Operational Intelligence, an intuitive, cloud-based, software solution that systematically tracks, manages and optimizes mobile computers – across all locations – throughout the operational lifecycle and the return-to-manufacturer authorization process.
Honeywell Operational Intelligence is among the many apps available in the Honeywell Marketplace, an enterprise software store designed to provide businesses with direct access to solutions developed by Honeywell and third-party partners, including Theatro and Optoro.
The CT40 recently won two world-renowned awards for product design: The mobile computer won an iF Design Award in the product design discipline and a Red Dot Design Award in the Industrial Equipment, Machinery and Automation category.
