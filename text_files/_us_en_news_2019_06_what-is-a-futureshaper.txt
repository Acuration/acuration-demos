Here's how our employees around the world say they make the future
June 9, 2019
From creating the force that propels air taxis, to building software that makes facilities more efficient, a #futureshaper makes tomorrow better.
Our team members from around the world defined what being a #futureshaper means to them.
Here’s what they say.
