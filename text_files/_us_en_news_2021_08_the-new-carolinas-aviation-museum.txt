The New Carolinas Aviation Museum
Landing Soon: The New Carolinas Aviation Museum
Get the facts behind the new facility, which will inspire with the miracle of flight and the possibilities of STEM
The Carolinas Aviation Museum (CAM) is preparing for takeoff.
In the state where flight began, there’s plenty of reason to celebrate the history of what made it possible and look to the future.
Here are the details.
Background: A Smithsonian affiliate, the Carolinas Aviation Museum opened in 1991. The museum has operated as a “museum without walls,” offering virtual exhibitions and community programs funded by Honeywell since vacating its original location in 2019. The new museum will focus on STEM education and engagement, celebrate North Carolina as the birthplace of aviation and immerse visitors in the history and possibilities of flight. “We are looking forward to once again connecting in person with the region, contributing to Charlotte’s cultural tourism and economic growth, and providing impactful hands-on learning opportunities in STEM that will help address economic mobility,” said CAM President Stephen Saucier.
Where: On airport grounds at Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT), right next to a historic hangar that will be refurbished.
Honeywell’s Investment: “The new museum will provide students with invaluable educational experiences that help open the door to careers in STEM fields, including aviation,” said Honeywell Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk.
A $1.5 million donation will sponsor:
Innovation Nation: A main gallery that presents the history of aviation as a testament to humankind’s capacity for creativity and imagination. This includes US Airways Flight 1549, the ‘Miracle on the Hudson’ plane. Honeywell’s 131-9A auxiliary power unit (APU), played a critical role in enabling the Airbus aircraft to touch down safely in 2009.
Maker Space: Youth can experience aviation through interactive, hands-on activities.
Career Center: It will also be a resource for students and adults to connect with careers in STEM.
Who: The museum expects to host 100,000 visitors, including 15,000 students.
When: The plan is to begin construction in early 2022 and open in 2023.
