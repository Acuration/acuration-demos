FAQs
HOW ARE THE DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT-OF-POCKET ALLOWANCES APPLIED TO MY RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN?
The deductible is the amount an eligible person pays each year before the comprehensive medical plan pays any portion of a claim. The out-of-pocket maximum is the maximum amount any person need pay in covered comprehensive medical expenses each year. Once the out-of-pocket maximum is reached, the plan pays 100% of covered expenses for the rest of the calendar year.
WHEN WILL THE MEDICAL ID CARDS/PRESCRIPTION DRUG CARDS BE MAILED? WHAT IF I DON’T RECEIVE MINE AND I HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL
Your insurance will be effective the first of the month of your retirement. If you don’t receive your new cards and need care, you can have the hospital, doctor, or pharmacy call the insurance company for verification of coverage.
WHY IS MY PREMIUM MORE THAN JOE’S? HE RETIRED FROM ANOTHER DIVISION OF HONEYWELL.
Premiums are based on many variables, i.e., age, years of service, whether you were an hourly or salaried employee, location of plant, and the year in which you retire. Therefore, your coverage and the composition of the group covered by your plan may be different from Joe’s.
IF I DEFER MY MEDICAL AT THIS TIME, CAN I ENROLL IN THE FUTURE?
This is determined on an individual basis please call the Honeywell Retirement Service Center at 1-800-526-0744.
WHEN I OR MY DEPENDENT BECOME MEDICARE ELIGIBLE OR TURN AGE 65, WHAT CHANGES
You must enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, as this will become your primary coverage. Further information will be mailed to you approximately three months before your 65th birthday.
I WANT TO ENROLL IN A HONEYWELL-SPONSORED MEDICARE HMO. WHAT DO I DO?
If you’re eligible to enroll in a Medicare HMO, you must contact the Honeywell Retirement Service Center at 1-800-526-0744 directly and request a Honeywell group enrollment package. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires that your application be received by the HMO no later than the 20th of the month before coverage begins. For example, if you want your coverage to begin January 1, 2010, the HMO must receive your enrollment form by December 20, 2009.
I’D LIKE TO CANCEL MY HONEYWELL SPONSORED MEDICAL COVERAGE. CAN I DO SO OVER THE TELEPHONE?
Yes, However, Honeywell does require 30 days notice. Please note that if you are canceling coverage with a Medicare HMO, you must also contact the Honeywell Service Center at 1-800-526-0744 to obtain a MHMO disenrollment form and mail it to the Honeywell Service Center. Honeywell does require 30 days notice.
