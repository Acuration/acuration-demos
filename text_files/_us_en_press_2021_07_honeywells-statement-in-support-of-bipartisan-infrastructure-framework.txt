Honeywell’s Statement in Support of Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework
July 15, 2021
Honeywell issued the following statement today in support of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework:
Honeywell supports the bipartisan efforts to make significant investments in our nation’s infrastructure, including roads, bridges and energy modernization, to improve U.S. competitiveness and foster safety and prosperity for countless Americans. We are encouraged by the hard work on both sides of the aisle to find compromise on this important issue and are hopeful it can be a foundation for continued bipartisan action in support of long-term economic growth.
