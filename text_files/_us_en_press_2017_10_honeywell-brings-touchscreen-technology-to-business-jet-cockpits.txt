Honeywell Brings Touchscreen Technology To Business Jet Cockpits
Honeywell Brings Touchscreen Technology To Business Jet Cockpits
October 10, 2017
LAS VEGAS, Oct. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Through its Primus Epic portfolio of cockpit solutions, Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is now bringing advanced touchscreen technology to business jet cockpits. The Honeywell touchscreen forward displays will provide pilots with a more efficient and more enjoyable pilot experience by allowing them to interact with the cockpit just like they do with consumer electronic devices, but in this case getting easy access to flight management, communications, checklists and weather information.
Having just received a Federal Aviation Administration technical standard order late last month, Honeywell's new DU-1310 touchscreen will provide flight crews with more control of the cockpit by enabling the forward displays with touchscreen functionality as an alternative to a cursor control device or joystick. Touch screens can significantly improve operational efficiency in the cockpit, with much faster navigation through the commands and data. Previously, pilots could only perform the same operations using a cursor control device or joystick. By using a touchscreen, pilots can cut in half the time required to input data and control cockpit functions.
"Pilots today expect the same high-tech functionality in the cockpit that they use in their everyday lives, and touchscreens are at the top of that list," said Jeff Merdich, vice president, Cockpit Systems, Honeywell Aerospace. "Much like our position on in-flight Wi-Fi, we believe in giving pilots the same experience as they have at home or in the office."
Honeywell's new DU-1310 touchscreen primary flight display and multifunction display is a drop-in replacement for the DU-1310 displays currently installed in Primus Epic cockpits. The new display will also reduce weight on the aircraft by three pounds per display. In addition, with Honeywell's Avionics Protection Plan, operators can protect against a significant unplanned expense.
To learn more about Honeywell's touchscreen technology for the Primus Epic cockpit, visit Honeywell's website for information on the DU-1310 cockpit display. Honeywell will also be at the National Business Aviation Association show in Las Vegas at booth #N5100 Oct. 10 – 12. Please visit Honeywell's booth to view the display and ask any questions.
