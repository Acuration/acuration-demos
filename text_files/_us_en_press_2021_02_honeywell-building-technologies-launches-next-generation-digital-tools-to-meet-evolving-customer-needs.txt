Honeywell Building Technologies Launches Next-Generation Digital Tools To Meet Evolving Customer Needs
New learning system enhances customer training experience across product categories
New eCommerce portal improves buying process with personalized, real-time information
February 22, 2021
ATLANTA – February 18, 2021 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON), a global leader in connected buildings, today unveiled two virtual platforms designed to improve its customer experience touchpoints and better meet customers’ needs. The platforms, My Honeywell Buildings University, a new online learning management system to expand customer training, and MyBuildings. Honeywell.com, a new eCommerce portal that delivers a more seamless purchasing journey, are focused on the channel partner audience including distributors, system integrators and commercial customers.
“We’re creating an end-to-end digital ecosystem with the aim to make it easier for our customers and channel partners to do business with Honeywell,” said Andy Kupsco, vice president of customer experience for Honeywell Building Technologies. “These new tools are the first capabilities in our new digital, customer-centric experience focused on providing better product education and training as well as simplifying the buying process. We’ve worked hard to deliver comprehensive, personalized and easy-to-use platforms that answer our customers’ most pressing needs.”
My Honeywell Buildings University – Enhancing the customer training experience
MyHoneywellBuildingsUniversity.com helps customers develop skills and gain knowledge associated with Honeywell Fire, Security and Building Management System (BMS) products. The interactive online learning platform offers unprecedented access to Honeywell’s industry expertise and certified training courses through a curated library of on-demand content that delivers recommendations tailored to the individual customer.
Customers can browse a global catalogue of training modules, access on-demand training and self-help videos, register for instructor-led sessions and review training history. The platform provides users with more visibility into the breadth of Honeywell’s training resources and control of their individual training journey.

MyBuildings.Honeywell.com – Simplifying the customer buying experience
MyBuildings.Honeywell.com is a new eCommerce portal that provides customers with a more direct buying process through access to holistic, real-time information. The platform is easy for customers to use, customize and access, and streamlines the end-to-end purchasing journey so they have more time to focus on driving business value.
The one-stop portal allows customers to browse products from the Honeywell product catalogue, check pricing and availability, place an order, check the latest order and shipment status, as well as submit and track support cases. Each customer will have a personalized dashboard with real-time information.
