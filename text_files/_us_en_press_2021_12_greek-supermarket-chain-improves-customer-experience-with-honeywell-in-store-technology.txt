Greek Supermarket Chain Improves Customer Experience With Honeywell In-Store Technology
Greek Supermarket Chain Improves Customer Experience With Honeywell In-Store Technology
Metro AEBE using Honeywell’s latest mobile computers to help store associates provide superior shopping experiences
Supermarket chain continuing digital transformation journey to enhance efficiency and operational visibility through technology
December 14, 2021
CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 14, 2021 -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) announced today that Metro AEBE, one of the largest supermarket chains in Greece, has selected its mobile computers and software to help associates in enhancing its in-store experience.
Metro will deploy Honeywell’s ScanPal EDA52 mobile computers in its 120 stores throughout the country, providing store associates with real-time store data to help tell customers in an instant where items are located or if certain inventory is in stock all without leaving the customer’s side.
“We were looking for a hardware solution to help our associates perform daily tasks, and Honeywell’s ScanPal EDA52 gives our team a tool to deliver the great customer experience our customers expect,” said George Voutiras of Metro AEBE.
The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce growth across the globe, leaving many retailers searching for options to deliver immediate satisfaction to consumers’ changing needs. Mobile computers are critical tools used by operations and mobile workers to allow for faster, smarter and more effective work. With these devices, workers can access operational data through barcode scanning, complete picking and packing operations through voice-guided solutions and communicate with other workers to ensure tasks are complete.
“Grocers like Metro need mobile devices that can help them deliver a consistent, high-quality experience across channels to their customers,” said Horst Mollik, GM of Honeywell’s Productivity Solutions and Services’ European business. “The ScanPal EDA52 mobile computer is much more than just a hardware device – it’s a highly-integrated solution that helps enable retail associates to deliver a seamless customer experience throughout the day.”
Designed for retail, logistics, manufacturing, healthcare and public service spaces, the ScanPal EDA52 is Honeywell’s latest enterprise-class mobile computer that provides reliable and secure connectivity between customer-facing workers and backend systems.
The grocer is deploying Honeywell’s EDA52 through Mobile Technology, a Honeywell Platinum Performance Partner that specializes in the installation of comprehensive solutions including mobile computers, RFID equipment, voice-enabled devices and more.
Honeywell’s Productivity Solutions and Services business creates mobile computers, printers, and data capture devices that help improve worker productivity in thousands of companies of all sizes around the world. Honeywell helped pioneer the barcode scanning market, and over the years its new innovations have helped retailers, distribution centers, transportation and logistics, and healthcare organizations achieve significant improvements in efficiency, speed, and accuracy in their operations.
