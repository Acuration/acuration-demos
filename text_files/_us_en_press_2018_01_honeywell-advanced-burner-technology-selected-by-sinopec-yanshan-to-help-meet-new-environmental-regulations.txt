Honeywell Advanced Burner Technology Selected By Sinopec Yanshan To Help Meet New Environmental Regulations
Honeywell Advanced Burner Technology Selected By Sinopec Yanshan To Help Meet New Environmental Regulations
January 31, 2018
SHANGHAI, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) UOP announced today that its Callidus® low-nitrogen oxides (NOx) burner technology has been selected by Sinopec Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (Yanshan) to help meet China's new NOx emission regulations.
More than 400 burners used in Yanshan's ethylene process units have been revamped and achieved reductions of 40 to 50 percent of NOx emissions from ethylene furnaces. In addition, Honeywell UOP is providing these process units with engineering, performance verification testing, burner fabrication and service.
Under new government standards in China, emissions of nitrogen oxides from industry furnaces are required to drop from 150 to less than 100 milligrams per cubic meter this year. These pollutants are the primary cause of acid rain and increased surface ozone concentration, which have serious and direct impacts on public health and the environment.
"Our record of project experience around the globe can help Sinopec comply with new environmental regulations and gain economic value by improving their return on investment without sacrificing performance or the environment," said Henry Liu, vice president and general manager, Honeywell UOP China. "Since we opened a new research and test facility in China in 2015, we have developed low-emission and energy efficient combustion technology for customers in China and across Asia."
Among the technologies Honeywell UOP developed to meet new emissions standards are high-performance low-NOx Callidus process burners. These burners are designed to meet NOx reduction requirements for fired heaters in refinery and petrochemical plants, where space is limited and temperatures typically reach 1200 degrees Celsius.
Callidus burners can be customized to meet requirements of all types of applications, including refinery heaters, reformers, ethylene crackers, coker units, and CCR (continuous catalytic reforming) and propane dehydrogenation process heaters.
As a subsidiary of Sinopec Group, Sinopec Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Co., Ltd. processes more than 10 million tons of crude oil and produces more than 800,000 tons of ethylene products annually. The company was established in 1970 and operates one of China's first modern, large-scale integrated refining and petrochemical complexes.
Honeywell UOP (www.uop.com) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. Honeywell UOP is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions (www.honeywellprocess.com), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries.
