Honeywell Incorporates Integrated Video Capability Into Telehealth Platform Allowing Healthcare Professionals To Treat Patients In Their Homes
Honeywell Incorporates Integrated Video Capability Into Telehealth Platform Allowing Healthcare Professionals To Treat Patients In Their Homes
March 5, 2018
HONEYWELL INCORPORATES INTEGRATED VIDEO CAPABILITY INTO TELEHEALTH PLATFORM ALLOWING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO TREAT PATIENTS IN THEIR HOMES
LifeStream Video Capabilities will be demonstrated in Booth 3408 at HIMMS 2018 in the Sands Expo Center, March 5-9 in Las Vegas
ATLANTA, March 5, 2018 – Honeywell ( NYSE:HON), a leading Connected Home solutions provider, today announced that their telehealth software platform, LifeStream, will feature fully integrated video communication that will enable individuals with chronic conditions to meet with their doctors and nurses face to face without having to leave their homes. It will help healthcare professionals improve the care for their patients, reduce hospital readmissions and streamline their clinical workflows.
While in-person interaction between patient and caregiver promotes open discussions and helps clinicians visually determine their patient's adherence to a healthcare plan, the use of video provides a similar outcome plus it offers convenience for patients and greater efficiency for care providers. The latest software update of LifeStream (version 5.3) fully integrates video interaction right from the LifeStream dashboard.
“The latest software update of LifeStream with integrated video marks a significant milestone for Honeywell in bringing improved telehealth solutions to market that address the need to deliver greater value in healthcare at less cost,” said Scott Harkins, vice president and general manager, Connected Home, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “LifeStream's enhancements were made with clinicians needs in mind, to ensure remote patient care is efficient, clinical outcomes are improved and costly hospital readmissions are reduced.”
Honeywell developed the new feature using the vidyo.io communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS), a leading embedded video collaboration platform. The vidyo.io CPaaS provides patented layering and routing technology allowing mobile, real-time video to be reliably transmitted across variable Wi-Fi networks and the public Internet. This technology facilitates a high-quality patient experience even in low bandwidth scenarios and rural environments.
"Remote patient care has been shown to deliver better long-term patient outcomes due to higher compliance with discharge instructions and enhanced access to healthcare providers," said Sam Waicberg, senior vice president of Business Development at Vidyo. "Obviously, better outcomes for patients is the key factor, but add in the resulting decrease in readmissions which reduces healthcare costs overall, and it is clear that this is just good public policy. Honeywell's adoption of vidyo.io for its LifeStream telehealth platform increases the scale of Vidyo's ability to deliver this critical healthcare benefit to patients and providers alike."
Vidyo is a leader in integrated video collaboration for businesses that require the highest quality, real-time video communications available to directly embed into their business processes. Millions of users around the world visually connect every day with Vidyo's secure, scalable technology and cloud-based services. Vidyo has been awarded over 170 patents worldwide and is recognized by industry analysts for its cloud platform and APIs.
