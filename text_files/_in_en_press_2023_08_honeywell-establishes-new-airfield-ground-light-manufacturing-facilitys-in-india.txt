Honeywell Establishes New Airfield Ground Light Manufacturing Facility in India
The latest technology solution is designed to help streamline airport operations and make aircraft landings safer and more efficient
22 August 2023
Gurugram, August 22, 2023: Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced the launch of its Airfield Ground Lighting (AGL) manufacturing facility in Gurugram, India. AGL is a Make in India product engineered and manufactured completely in India. AGL plays a crucial role in airport operations and is subject to comprehensive safety and compliance regulations by global aviation standards and regulatory bodies.
Honeywell’s AGL’s will be manufactured at its 41,000-square-foot facility in Gurugram; the solution represents the entire set of ground-installed luminaires and related ancillaries that helps an aircraft land and find their way to the stand – helping enable uptime even in adverse weather conditions.
The Honeywell range of low-wattage, LED based lighting solutions help airports improve operations and maintain compliance, while also helping to decrease their energy use and adding to the longevity of the assets. The Honeywell LED lights are designed to have better durability, longer lifespan, and deliver enhanced energy savings.  It also has improved visibility, increased ease of replacement and requires less maintenance, helping to optimize an airport’s operational costs. These LED lighting solutions are more advanced and cost-effective replacement to conventional halogen lamps for AGL needs. [1]
“As Honeywell, we are delighted to step up the manufacturing line for advanced airfield ground lighting system which is a completely designed, developed and manufactured in India.  These highly advanced solutions are key to meet the airports need for balance in compliance, safety, and environmental standards. The new Honeywell LED lighting solution for runways and taxiways, along with our extensive range of other aviation solutions, will not only help airports address these challenges, but also help improve safety and efficiency for airfield ground lighting operations.” - said Ashish Modi, president, Honeywell India.
The rapidly growing Indian aviation industry is expected to invest up to $12 billion into the sector and reach up to 220 airports by 2025 - up from the current 148.[2] Honeywell range of solutions and expertise in sustainable aviation practices will help play a pivotal role in this infrastructure growth journey as the demand for aviation peaks.
The Honeywell AGL solutions being developed and engineered in India are Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified and compliant to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards. The lights manufactured use a patented design of three-light window, offer operational flexibility and high structural stability catering to the load stresses by aircraft. The unique sixwindow design increases uptime by reducing dirt and rubber deposits. Approximately 50% less rubber deposits, decreased water, and dust accumulation as well as reduced potential landing induced electronic failures. It also helps in longer light lifecycle and less mechanical damage from snow plowing and sweeping equipment; lower number of spares across variants reducing inventory; and higher operational reliability in all-weather conditions.
This initiative aligns with the 'Make in India' program, showcasing Honeywell commitment to domestic manufacturing and technological advancement. Honeywell's strong commitment to domestic manufacturing and technological prowess not only caters to the escalating demand for airfield ground lighting but also reinforces the country's self-reliance in state-of-the-art aviation technology. With a focus on sustainable aviation practices, this effort is set to drive India's progress in aviation infrastructure.
The successful rollout of the first batch of FAA-certified LED Airfield Ground Lights from the Gurugram unit demonstrates Honeywell’s dedication to both India's aviation sector and the 'Make in India' ethos.
The complete engineering and technology that caters to the needs of airports were incubated and developed by the Honeywell Technology Solutions team in India.
