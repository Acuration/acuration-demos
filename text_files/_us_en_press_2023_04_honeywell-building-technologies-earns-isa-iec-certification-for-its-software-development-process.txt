Honeywell Building Technologies Earns ISA/IEC Certification for Its Software Development Process
Honeywell Building Technologies Earns ISA/IEC Certification for Its Software Development Process
April 11, 2023
ATLANTA, April 11, 2023 – Honeywell Building Technologies (Nasdaq: HON) (HBT) recently earned ISA/IEC 62443-4-1 Process Certification for its software development lifecycle. ISA/IEC 62443-4-1 certification underscores HBT’s commitment to following best practices and standards in developing secure, cyber-resilient products.
The ISA/IEC 62443 standards define requirements and processes for implementing and maintaining electronically secure industrial automation and control systems. The certification standards set best practices for security and provide a way to assess the level of security performance. They require a holistic approach to cybersecurity, which includes bridging the gap between operations technology and information technology, as well as between process safety and cybersecurity. Implementation offers a significant level of assurance that products developed by the organization are resilient to cyber threats.
“We start with a secure- and privacy-by-design approach for every product we develop. Our aim is to strengthen the environment into which our products are placed,” said Udaya Shrivastava, vice president and chief technology officer, HBT. “Obtaining this level of certification is a testament to the commitment of the HBT product cybersecurity team to integrate security throughout every step of the product design process.”
One of only 19 companies to gain this certification,i Honeywell is further demonstrating its commitment to protecting the world we work and live in.
As part of the certification process, an ISA/IEC assessor conducts a deep dive into the company’s defined processes and compares them against the criteria of the 62443 standard. Projects are picked at random and inspected with the intention of gathering substantial evidence to confirm whether the declared processes are being followed. This thorough assessment can take several months.
Honeywell’s certificate can be found here: HBT Certificate (62443-4-1).
