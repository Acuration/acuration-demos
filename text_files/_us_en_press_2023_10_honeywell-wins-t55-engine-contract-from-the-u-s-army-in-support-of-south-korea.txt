Honeywell Wins T55 Engine Contract from The U.S. Army in Support of South Korea
Honeywell Wins T55 Engine Contract from The U.S. Army in Support of South Korea
More than 40 engines for Chinook helicopters will be supplied for South Korea
October 9, 2023
PHOENIX, Oct. 9, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced it has received an order for 41 T55-GA-714A engines to support South Korea's procurement of new CH-47F aircraft as part of an effort to replace its older CH-47D aircraft. The order and supply of the T55 engines is managed through the office of U.S. Army Foreign Military Sales.
Honeywell's T55 engine is a world leader in powering heavy lift helicopters. Over 1,000 CH-47 helicopters powered by T55s are operated today by militaries and civil aviation entities around the world. Honeywell's latest T55-GA-714A engine configuration produces nearly 5,000 shaft horsepower, powering Chinook aircraft up to 170 knots even in demanding operating conditions.
"We have a longstanding relationship with South Korea, and we appreciate the opportunity to continue supporting them on their new CH-47F Block I Helicopters with our latest T55-GA-714A engine configuration," said Dave Marinick, president, Engines and Power Systems, Honeywell Aerospace. "The latest contract to supply 41 T55 engines is a testament to South Korea's confidence in our battle-proven engines. To date, our T55 engines have logged some 12 million hours of operation on the Boeing CH-47 and MH-47 Chinook helicopters."
Honeywell first delivered the T55 engine to the U.S. Army in 1961 at 2,200 shaft horsepower for the CH-47A helicopter. Since then, the engine's power has more than doubled to a 5,000-shaft horsepower class engine with ongoing development designed to increase the potential output further while improving maintainability, reliability and reducing operating costs.
Honeywell continues to evolve and improve the T55 family of engines with our development work on the T55-GA-714C. The next generation 714C engine grows to a 6,000-shaft horsepower class engine, while consuming 8% less fuel than the current T55.
Please visit Honeywell at AUSA, Booth #6841 in Halls D and E, to learn more about how we're helping support the U.S. Army and its allies.
