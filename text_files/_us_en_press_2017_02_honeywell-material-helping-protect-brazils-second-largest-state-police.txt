Honeywell Material Helping Protect Brazil's Second Largest State Police
Honeywell Material Helping Protect Brazil's Second Largest State Police
February 13, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Feb. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that its Gold Shield® ballistic composite materials are being used by Glagio do Brasil to create ballistic protective vests for Brazil's second largest police force, located in the state of Minas Gerais.
Global law enforcement agencies are increasingly transitioning to body armor that is more protective, lighter weight and more flexible. The materials should be comfortable enough to wear in regions with varied weather conditions, and they must also be concealable beneath officers' uniforms.
Gold Shield enables Glagio do Brasil's vests to have the durability and strength that meet the strenuous requirements of military vest applications, which can equal or exceed those set for law enforcement vests. Due to Honeywell's patented Shield technology, Gold Shield outperforms woven aramid products in protecting against various types of trauma such as multi-hit, ballistics and backface.
"We sought a high-performance material from which we could produce vests that provide military-grade protection, while also being lighter and more comfortable than current models," said Luiz Paulo Lopes, general manager of Glagio do Brasil Ltda. "With Honeywell Gold Shield, we can incorporate the most innovative armor technology into our products to help protect the brave officers of Minas Gerais."
Glagio do Brasil manufactures protective equipment for several branches of Brazil's law enforcement and military, including the Federal Police, Federal Highway Police and the Brazilian Army, Navy and Air Force.
"Honeywell's global supply of ballistic composite materials helps ensure that law enforcement agencies and militaries have access to the world's leading armor technology," said Greg Davis, global business manager for body protection, Honeywell Packaging and Composites. "Gold Shield is the optimal material for law enforcement vests that helps ensure Brazil's police officers are protected from ballistic threats, while also being able to move comfortably under a variety of conditions."
Honeywell Gold Shield ballistic composite products take advantage of Honeywell's unique Shield technology, which is capable of combining a variety of aramid fibers and resins to meet specific performance requirements in soft and hard armor applications. Gold Shield and Spectra Shield products have been widely adopted and proven for the most advanced armor applications globally, from bullet-resistant vests, breast plates and helmets to combat vehicles and military aircraft – all of which require lightweight solutions and superior performance.
