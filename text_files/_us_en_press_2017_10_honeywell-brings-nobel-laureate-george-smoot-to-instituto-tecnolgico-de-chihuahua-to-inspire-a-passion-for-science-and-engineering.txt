Honeywell Brings Nobel Laureate George Smoot to Instituto Tecnologico de Chihuahua to Inspire a Passion for Science and Engineering
Honeywell Brings Nobel Laureate George Smoot to Instituto Tecnologico de Chihuahua to Inspire a Passion for Science and Engineering
October 26, 2017
CHIHUAHUA, Mexico, Oct. 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Professor George Smoot, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in physics, inspired more than 10,000 students and faculty at Instituto Tecnolegico de Chihuahua (ITCHih) today as part of the Honeywell Initiative for Science & Engineering (HISE). This was the first time Honeywell's (NYSE: HON) global program has come to ITCHih.
The program, sponsored by Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the company's corporate citizenship initiative, aims to inspire students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and achieve their career goals. Since 2006, HISE has benefited thousands of students and teachers around the world.
Professor Smoot received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which helped further the Big Bang theory of the universe.
"The students here today are at the beginning of an incredible journey of learning and discovery," said Professor Smoot at his lecture. "I encourage all of you to pursue the opportunities that excite you the most. In doing so, you will make a great impact on society."
The laureate's lecture also was video streamed to several campuses across Mexico, including Universidad La Salle, Universidad Autonoma de Chihuahua, Universidad Tecnologica de Chihuahua, Tec Milenio, Tecnologico de Chihuahua II, and Tecnologico de Monterrey.
The event marks the eighth time the program has been delivered to a university in Mexico. It has previously been delivered to Universidad Autenoma de Baja California and CETYS University in Mexicali, the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Mexico City, and the Instituto de Tecnolegico in Monterrey. Honeywell also has presented HISE to universities in the Czech Republic, China, India, Malaysia, and Romania.
"On behalf of ITCHih and the state of Chihuahua, I am proud to welcome Professor Smoot to our campus today," said ITCHih Director Jos√© Rivera Mejea. "We have a strong partnership with Honeywell, and HISE has further enriched it. Together, we are investing in a future workforce that can help Mexico address the technological challenges that lie ahead."
"The Chihuahuan youth have the talent to stand out in the fields of science and engineering," said Alejandra de la Vega Arizpe, Chihuahua's Secretary of Innovation and Economic Development. "Initiatives such as this, promoted by Honeywell, motivate students to realize that they can give more of themselves both professionally and personally. We are grateful to Honeywell for sharing this experience with our young people, reinforcing the commitment that both the state government and private enterprises have to them."
Yesterday, Prof. Smoot and members of Honeywell and ITCHih attended a luncheon with Javier Corral Jurado, Governor of the State of Chihuahua, and members of state and local governments.
"At Honeywell, we are blending physical products with software solutions to link people and businesses to the information they need to be more efficient, more productive, and more connected. Our innovations demonstrate the value that comes from having a highly educated, highly motivated workforce that is well-grounded in science, math and engineering disciplines," said Craig Breese, President of Honeywell Latin America. "By offering students the opportunity to learn from a Nobel laureate and interact with Honeywell engineers, we hope to inspire these students to pursue careers in STEM."
Honeywell Hometown Solutions supports STEM education around the world by inviting local middle school science and math teachers to the Honeywell Educators at Space Academy at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala., each year. Honeywell also closely cooperates with universities through programs such as engineering lectures, collaborative projects, student events, lab visits and internships.
Smoot is an astrophysicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and physics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Among his many honors, Smoot has received the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, the Albert Einstein Medal, and the Gruber Prize. A popular laureate, Smoot has appeared in several TV shows and commercials, including "The Big Bang Theory."
