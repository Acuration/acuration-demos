Honeywell And Wolters Kluwer Team Up To Help Employees Safely Return To The Workplace
Honeywell And Wolters Kluwer Team Up To Help Employees Safely Return To The Workplace
Collaboration will combine Honeywell's IIoT connected devices and safety software with Wolters Kluwer's risk and environmental, health and safety management software
Offerings will help customers in asset-intensive industries protect workers, adhere to compliance requirements and facilitate business continuity
October 7, 2020
HOUSTON, Oct. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) and Wolters Kluwer today announced a collaboration to integrate Honeywell's Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) connected devices and safety software with the risk and environmental, health and safety (EHS) software from Enablon, a Wolters Kluwer business. The collaboration is designed to enable enterprises in asset-intensive industries to improve their risk, safety and operational excellence programs.
The collaboration enables customers to monitor their EHS performance, receive early warnings about issues from their Honeywell equipment and take proactive steps to help prevent incidents and improve safety compliance.
"With companies concerned about making a safe return to their facilities, we are offering a solution that aims to provide peace of mind to management in terms of both safety and compliance to keep up with ever-changing health and environmental regulations," said John Rudolph, president, Honeywell Process Solutions. "Our new reality requires innovative solutions that enable both business continuity and help protect the health of their employees."
Given the heightened uncertainty of today's business environment, companies have an urgent need for a more holistic, integrated, enterprise platform to operationalize real-time data collected from human and machine input. By leveraging this data, companies can use actionable intelligence through the integration of technologies to mitigate safety risk and remain compliant with regulations.
Scenario – How it could work in today's environment:
Before visiting the facility, Honeywell's Digitized Workforce Management software provides an electronic questionnaire which, when complete, provides an access code and time of arrival to reduce the need for transfer of paper documents and improve social distancing.
At the entryway, the connected safety software solutions allow Honeywell's artificial intelligence-driven elevated body temperature monitoring solutions to conduct non-invasive, preliminary screenings of personnel entering a facility.
The system also detects if individuals are wearing the required personal protective equipment needed for entering the building and if they are doing so properly, in compliance with safety regulations.
These data points and other manual data points are then reported to the Enablon EHS software.
Through a dashboard view, management can monitor workers to ensure that they remain compliant with rapidly changing health and safety regulations. The EHS solution also allows frontline operations employees to carry out measurements, checks and recordings directly in the field, without the need to walk back and forth to a control room.
By combining Honeywell's connected safety portfolio and with Enablon's software suite, customers can eliminate errors in recorded data and improve hands-on-tool time for operators.
"Our goal is to help predict and prevent accidents and out-of-compliance events before they happen," said Chirag Shah, senior director, Product Management at Wolters Kluwer's Enablon business. "To do this, companies need to act on data that comes directly from equipment and assets as well as data from workers and contractors in the field. Combining real-time human and machine data in an integrated solution will enable our joint customers to achieve the benefits of a digitized operation. By joining forces with Honeywell, we are helping our customers leverage the benefits of a true Industry 4.0 solution."
Besides monitoring the health and safety of employees, the solution can also deliver environmental benefits. Today, industries must comply with environmental permits containing hundreds of specific requirements. The technology can monitor, control and report back on the health of these controls. Honeywell's stationary and mobile solutions can be configured directly from the local environmental and regulatory permit conditions within local jurisdictions, providing early warning alerts to prevent non-compliance.
