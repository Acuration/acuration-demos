ESG Report 2023: By the Numbers
ESG Report 2023: By the Numbers
Get the highlights from the 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report, focusing on how Honeywell integrates ESG principles into its strategy, culture and innovation.
Having a sound Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) foundation is increasingly important for businesses and investors, as it reflects how a company manages its environmental impact, social responsibility and ethical conduct.
Honeywell’s 2023 ESG Report documents the progress made in these areas and how they impact our operations, employees, shareholders and communities.
From using the latest technologies to complete innovative remediation projects that better our communities to investing in programs aimed at increasing access of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education, commitment to ESG is at the core of being a Futureshaper.
Here are some of the key figures we shared in this year’s ESG Report:
1,250 metric tons – The approximate greenhouse gas reductions made in 2022 when Honeywell completed 38 projects across its portfolio to upgrade its compressed air and gas systems
60% – Allocation of 2022 new product research and development investment that was directed toward ESG-oriented outcomes1

More than 80 – Jobs and internships offered to students through the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) in 2022 through the NSBE and Honeywell Integrated Pipeline Program, part of a three-year partnership that focuses on STEM education for youth, collegiate scholarships and professional development
