Honeywell Delivers 225 Million N95 and Surgical Masks in December
Honeywell Delivers 225 Million N95 and Surgical Masks in December for Health Care and Government Use
- N95 respirators and Surgical masks delivered to health care systems as well as federal and state governments
- Company significantly increased production capacity and expanded operations to help address increased demand for PPE
CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 11, 2021 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) achieved a significant milestone by delivering more than 225 million face masks in the month of December to help protect workers in response to the increased demand for respiratory protection products.
Honeywell delivered the N95 respirators and disposable, surgical face masks to multiple locations in the U.S. for health care systems, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the company shipped millions of masks to state and local governments in support of their response to COVID-19 and for their personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles.
“We are honored to play a part in providing much-needed PPE to those workers responding to the pandemic in the U.S.,” said Praveen Reddy, president, Honeywell’s Personal Protective Equipment business. “Honeywell has made significant investments to expand our capacity to produce N95 masks and other respiratory products in the U.S. and globally.”
Honeywell produces a range of respiratory protection products for workers, including NIOSH-certified N95 masks, flat-fold single-use masks and elastomeric half-masks with replaceable cartridges.
By steadily increasing production capacity, the company has the ability to produce hundreds of millions of face masks for health care and other critical needs.
In April, Honeywell rapidly started up new N95 mask production operations at multiple facilities in the U.S. The company was able to begin operations in just five weeks by accelerating a process that could normally take up to nine months. The operations were initially capable of producing 20 million masks per month, and Honeywell has steadily increased capacity throughout the year.
“We are proud of our employees for their hard work to produce, test, package and ship the millions of masks in order to meet this incredible milestone,” said Reddy. “These masks, produced here in the U.S., can help protect those health care workers, first responders and others who are working tirelessly on the front lines.”
