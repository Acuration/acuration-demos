Meet A #Futureshaper: Danielle Sinte
Meet A #Futureshaper: Danielle Sinte
Danielle is an engineer developing emissions management technologies to help companies reduce their carbon footprint.
Many organizations are prioritizing sustainability, as our Environmental Sustainability Index highlights. Companies with industrial operations are looking for ways to continuously monitor for gas leaks and identify opportunities to reduce emissions.
That's where emissions management technologies can be beneficial.
Danielle Sinte is one of the Futureshapers engineering emissions management solutions that help organizations get a real-time measure of their greenhouse gas emissions.
Meet Danielle and get to know her #Futureshaper story.
What do you do at Honeywell?
I am a senior advanced application engineer working in the emissions management team. With the products my team and I work on, I help companies benchmark their emissions and take corrective action accordingly.
What advice would you give to someone earlier in their career who wants to pursue a similar path in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)?
Learn as much as you can and get a lot of hands-on experience. Embrace failure and constructive feedback and use it as a catalyst for growth and improvement.
What does being a Futureshaper mean to you?
It means helping people shape the world into a better place through innovation and breakthrough technology. When I think about being a Futureshaper, I always think about my daughter because I want to leave a better world for her and transfer that legacy to her.
Meet other Futureshapers who are innovating to make our world smarter, safer and more sustainable.
