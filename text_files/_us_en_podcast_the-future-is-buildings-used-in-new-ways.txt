The Future Is... Buildings Used In New Ways
The Future Is... Buildings Used In New Ways
COVID-19 immediately changed how we use buildings and the future will depend on how flexible those uses can be.
The coronavirus pandemic changed how we use buildings in just a matter of days.
Offices are empty.
Warehouses are running 24/7.
College dorms and convention centers transformed into field hospitals.
In the midst of the pandemic, The Future Is… podcast host Joe Toubes sat down with Himanshu Khurana, the vice president and chief technology officer of Honeywell Building Technologies, to discuss these changes.
They also explored what it will take for people to go back to work.
“It’s not just being ready for the inflow of people,” Himanshu said. “It’s also the continued dynamics, because until a cure for COVID is found and disseminated, things may change again.”
