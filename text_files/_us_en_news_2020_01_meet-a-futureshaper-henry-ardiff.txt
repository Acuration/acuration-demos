Meet a #futureshaper: Henry Ardiff
Meet a #futureshaper: Henry Ardiff
He is making materials that save lives.
As a child Henry Ardiff wanted to be a centerfielder for the New York Yankees.
After Little League, he realized his plodding speed, mediocre batting average and warning track power would probably hold him back.
Fortunately for him, he was good at math and science.
Now, Henry is a principal scientist who works to make special materials to help stop bullets.
“My expertise is in coatings, machinery and processes. So, my job is to look for new materials and manufacturing techniques, then determine new ways to improve the performance of our products,” he said.
Based in Colonial Heights, Virginia; here is his #futureshaper story.
What brought you to Honeywell?
I came into the fold as part of a 1997 merger between Gomar-National Industries, the private plastic film converting company where I worked, and AlliedSignal, the predecessor of Honeywell.
How long have you been at Honeywell?
I have technically been with Honeywell for 22 years, but my tenure is approaching 39 years.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
I am part of a very small team of researchers, and we regularly raise the performance bar in our markets. Over the last fifteen years, we completely disrupted an armor industry that was accustomed to the status quo, or to small incremental improvements. Clearly, I am working with a special group of folks here!
Did you ever imagine you would end up in the job you are now?
To be honest, I never imagined jobs like this one existed. At Honeywell, I get to use a wide variety of my beloved materials, machinery and sciences to solve important, real-life problems. That includes keeping people safe and helping them return home to their families.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
A #futureshaper pays attention to everything and learns to see patterns and connections. A #futureshaper understands the science surrounding a problem, but they don’t get bogged down in being a perfectionist. A #futureshaper must sometimes balance the conflict between doing what they’re told and solving the problem at hand. They realize that they can either work to optimize a mediocre process, or they can build a completely new one.
Why is Honeywell a great place to work?
At Honeywell, we are encouraged to work at the boundaries of what is possible. We are also given the tools and support that we need. Often, impressive breakthroughs happen in very ordinary environments. It is amazing what can happen when bright, motivated people deviate from the playbook and take educated risks.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I like to recall stories from my misspent youth and when time permits, I write them down. I also enjoy singing karaoke on occasion, but I spend the most time running recreationally. My family enters a few races each year, so we have that in common, but usually I trail the field!
