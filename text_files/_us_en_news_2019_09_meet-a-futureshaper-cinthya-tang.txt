Meet a #futureshaper: Cinthya Tang
Spotlight: Cinthya Tang
Cinthya Tang is a software engineer. She makes the computers that keep the International Space Station operational and the flight software that helps the Orion crew navigate to Mars.
September 9, 2019
Here’s what she said about her career:
Describe your role.
I have been given more responsibilities throughout my years at Honeywell. My colleagues can trust that I can get the job done in an efficient manner. I am now capable of being a backup for different roles for more experienced people in my organization.
I’ve worked on human space crafts and the International Space Station. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with both hardware and software. I am also given the opportunity to present status updates to major customers, including NASA.
How did you get your start?
I got my start as an intern with Honeywell’s Space Department in Glendale, AZ in 2016. Following my internship I was offered a full-time position. I absolutely love the people I work with. I come in with a smile on my face and get to enjoy working with everyone.
How does your job make tomorrow better than today?
Innovations in space applications stimulate advances in science and technology for the future.
What business or employee groups are you part of?
I am a member of the Society of Women Engineering (SWE) and Women in Honeywell Engineering Network (WHEN). Working in a field where the number of women is increasing, I think it’s important to support each other and to communicate what we learn along the way.
What are your interests outside of work?
I dance for Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock Dance Company. I perform at Alice Cooper charity events such as Christmas Pudding and Celebrity Golf Tournament.
