Honeywell Helps Top Spray Foam Insulation Producer Meet Evolving Needs of Builders in North America
Honeywell Helps Top Spray Foam Insulation Producer Meet Evolving Needs of Builders in North America
April 3, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., April 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that Demilec, one of North America's largest manufacturers of spray foam insulation, has introduced a new product formulated with Honeywell's Solstice® Liquid Blowing Agent (LBA). Demilec's Heatlok® HFO High Lift spray foam insulation system is now available to customers for use in commercial and residential wall insulation.
Indoor heating and cooling can account for 48 percent of energy use in a typical U.S. home, according to the Department of Energy, and can be even higher for large, commercial buildings. The spray foam insulation industry is transitioning to next-generation products that help building owners and home owners further improve energy efficiency and lower energy costs, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions 99.9% over the previous generation of products. Blowing agents are a critical ingredient in foam insulation, allowing the foam to expand and enabling its excellent insulating performance, which in turn affects energy use. Unlike other types of insulation, closed cell spray foam provides a unique combination of outstanding thermal insulation and air sealing performance, which can lead to higher energy efficiency. For example, in comparison with fiberglass, spray foam offers twice the insulation value1 and superior energy efficiency.
Solstice LBA has an ultra-low GWP of 1, which is 99.9 percent lower than HFCs and equal to carbon dioxide. Solstice LBA offers several other added benefits, as well. It can provide a higher yield, reduce clogs in the spray guns the installation teams use, create better consistency of the foam itself, and it can provide better adhesion. To meet increasing worldwide demand, Honeywell's Solstice LBA world-scale manufacturing plant in Louisiana started up in May 2014.
"Solstice LBA is a very important part of Demilec's future, serving thousands of customers in the U.S. and Canada, and growing. We've made a commitment to transition all of our closed-cell foams to this blowing agent and this technology over the next 18 months," said Paul Valle, president, Demilec. "We are seeing growing acceptance of spray foam by architects, builders, and homeowners. They recognize the value of a well-sealed building insulated with spray foam. I think Solstice LBA will become a key differentiator as people demand a more comfortable living space with greater energy efficiency."
The launch of Heatlok HFO is a milestone for Demilec as it transitions its closed-cell foam product line from hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) blowing agents with high global-warming-potentials (GWPs) to alternatives with ultra-low GWP such as Solstice LBA. The transition is occurring well ahead of regulations calling for a phaseout of HFCs and positions Demilec for growth with innovative products.
"With a strong presence in the United States and Canada, Demilec is highly respected when it comes to spray foam innovation and environmental commitment," said Laura Reinhard, global business manager for spray foam, Honeywell. "We look forward to working with Demilec in transitioning its closed-cell foams to Solstice LBA, beginning with the new Heatlok HFO."
Solstice LBA is nonflammable (ASTM E-681) and is not a volatile organic compound per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Solstice LBA is listed as an acceptable substitute for HFC blowing agents under the EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program.
Solstice LBA is used in a variety of rigid foam insulation applications, including residential and commercial refrigeration equipment, spray foam insulation, and insulated metal panels, as well as flexible foam applications, such as molded foam, and integral skin.
