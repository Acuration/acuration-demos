Inside the COVID-19 Care Centers in India
Inside the COVID-19 Care Centers in India
With hospitals overwhelmed, here’s how healthcare facilities were built to help communities across India when it mattered most.
By mid-May 2021, officials in India were reporting at least 400,000 new COVID-19 infections a day, and the country reached a new daily record of 4,529 deaths.
The surge overwhelmed India’s hospitals and healthcare facilities.
Communities needed more healthcare facilities and vital resources like personal protective equipment (PPE) and oxygen to care for patients.
In response, Honeywell worked with government partners in Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka and Uttarakhand to establish COVID-19 care centers – facilities furnished with PPE and equipment needed for local and state hospital workers to care for patients infected with the coronavirus.
Honeywell Hometown Solutions India Foundation, our non-profit organization supporting India, partnered with multiple non-governmental organization (NGO) partners, including Americares and Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society (SEEDS), to bring to life healthcare facilities in five states across India.
Here’s a look inside the COVID-19 care center in Pune, India.
The center in Pune, as well as facilities in Delhi, Gurugram, Nainital, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Maharashtra, were designed to treat non-critical COVID-19 patients.
They are equipped with beds, oxygen supply, PPE kits and medical consumables (including syringes, gowns, catheters, tubing and more).
Facilities in Maharashtra and Karnataka were furnished with equipment to treat COVID-19 patients in critical condition.
These included beds, ventilators, defibrillators, multiparameter monitors (which display patients’ vital signs), X-ray machines and BiLevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) machines.
Working with NGO partners, part of our response to COVID-19 in India included addressing the need for oxygen by setting up 10 oxygen generation plants across four states: Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Haryana. These fully automated plants supply state-run hospitals with oxygen for patients, which is vital for those in critical condition.
The Impact: By the Numbers
As part of the COVID-19 Relief Program, we committed approximately $3 million to support communities in India during the pandemic, including supplying private and government-run hospitals with the following:
More than 2 million masks
More than 9 million meals
10,000 N95 respirators
2,500 PPE kits
12,000 hygiene kits
1,000 oxygen concentrators
10 ventilators
10 oxygen generation plants
