The Future Is… Carbon Neutral
The Future Is… Carbon Neutral
Chief Sustainability Officer Evan van Hook goes behind the scenes of how we’ll reach the goal.
Evan explains what it will take to have neutral CO2e (Carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions from our facilities and operations by 2035.
But the story doesn’t stop with just that pledge.
Evan also explains how we’ll analyze our supply chain and continue to innovate to help the planet.
“One of the things that's been so exciting at Honeywell is our engineers and scientists develop products that truly impact the world around us and our customers,” Evan said.
