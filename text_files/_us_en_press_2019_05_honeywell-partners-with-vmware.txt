Honeywell Partners with VMware to Provide an Integrated Digital Workspace Platform
Honeywell Partners with VMware to Provide an Integrated Digital Workspace Platform
May 24, 2019
FORT MILL, S.C., May 24, 2019 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is helping enterprises better manage access of business-critical resources to devices by becoming an authorized reseller of VMware’s industry-leading digital workspace platform, VMware Workspace ONE.
As part of the arrangement, and in cooperation with VMware, Honeywell will offer enterprises Workspace ONE on its Mobility Edge™ mobile computers and devices. Additional Honeywell devices will be included in the future. Many industries including retail, distribution centers transportation and logistics providers use Workspace ONE for its integrated digital workspace capabilities.
Workspace ONE is an intelligence-driven digital workspace platform that simply and more securely delivers and manages any app on any device by integrating access control, application management, and unified endpoint management. The Workspace ONE platform allows organizations to evolve siloed cloud and mobile investments, enabling all employees, devices, and things across the organization to accelerate their digital transformation journey with a platform-based approach.
For mission-critical rugged endpoints like Honeywell’s Mobility Edge devices, Workspace ONE specifically enables IT with low-touch enrollment and configuration, complete app lifecycle management, and the ability to proactively support and remotely troubleshoot devices in the field.
“Companies need to evolve to the rapid adoption of modern applications combined with the sudden rise of powerful, affordable mobile devices in today’s work environment,” said Taylor Smith, chief marketing officer of Honeywell’s Productivity Products business. “With Workspace ONE running on our Mobility Edge devices, workers can quickly access business-critical resources and applications whenever and wherever they need to while the enterprise can be confident in the robust security measures in place.”
Honeywell’s Mobility Edge provides a unified hardware architecture and set of software tools that streamline deployment and management of mobility solutions. The scalable platform, which guarantees support through AndroidTM R, enables IT departments to develop and certify a software application a single time before deploying to enterprise mobile devices.
Mobility Edge mobile computers and devices are used in many industries including retail, warehouse and distribution centers, transportation and logistics, and more. They are validated by Android Enterprise Recommended, a Google-led initiative that helps businesses confidently select, deploy, and manage Android devices and services best suited to their enterprise needs.
“Honeywell’s Mobility Edge platform, powered by Workspace ONE, will help enterprises, operating in variety of environments and industries, more securely and efficiently manage devices out in the field. Ultimately this means that employees who rely on accessing business-critical apps to get their job done will be able to do so seamlessly – a true win-win for IT and employees,” said Adam Rykowski, vice president of product management, End User Computing, VMware. “We’ve been working with Honeywell directly over the past several years to deliver a ruggedized experience for business-critical use cases, and we look forward to expanding our collaboration with this agreement.”
This reseller agreement is the continuation of a long-standing relationship between Honeywell and VMware. The two companies have collaborated to deliver a cloud-based management solution for ruggedized devices, and Honeywell has extended its Operational Intelligence solution by combining its Sentience data cloud with Workspace ONE.
Workspace ONE will soon be offered in the Honeywell Marketplace, an enterprise app store designed to provide businesses with direct access to software and solutions developed by Honeywell and third-party developers. To access the Honeywell Marketplace and view software solutions, please visit marketplace.honeywell.com.
