Honeywell Helps Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum Optimize Facility Operations
Honeywell Helps Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum Optimize Facility Operations
May 13, 2019
Honeywell technology helps Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an anticipated 20 percent to comply with EU requirements
Upgrades expected to result in a 30 percent increase in overall energy efficiency
Madrid, May 14, 2019 – Honeywell and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid have completed extensive facility upgrades that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions tied to museum operations by an estimated 20 percent, removing more than 720 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, and helping the museum meet the EU’s 2020 climate and energy-conservation directives. The comfort and building management systems improvements also trimmed the museum’s electricity consumption by nearly 30 percent while reducing water use and heating-oil expenses, by 12 percent and 38 percent, respectively.
“Our primary concern is providing an optimal environment for our visitors and the priceless artwork displayed,” said Alberto Hernández, Maintenance Manager at Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum. “We also want to do our part as a global citizen, and support the EU and world’s efforts to address climate change. All of this needs to happen while making financial decisions that ensure the museum’s longevity, and working with Honeywell has allowed us to strike a balance and meet all three priorities.”
When the project commenced in 2018, museum leaders had a clear set of objectives: reducing energy and operational costs by accurately predicting potential failures and malfunctions; modernizing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems to improve comfort levels; and improving preservation conditions for the more than 1,000 works of art housed within the museum.
To meet these goals, Honeywell designed and implemented a project that included renovations to the facility’s chillers, cooling towers and primary air-treatment units. The company’s engineers also installed Honeywell Enterprise Buildings Integrator, a building management system (BMS) that integrates heating and cooling technologies, providing a single point of access to monitor and manage those systems.
Honeywell conducted the work under tight timelines to avoid disturbance to the guest experience, building operations and art preservation. The latter was particularly important as the museum’s works of art — collected over seven decades and displayed across the facility’s more than 24,000 square meters of space — require precise environmental conditions.
“These types of projects are challenging yet rewarding because we help to make improvements critical to the organization’s long-term success while continuing to accommodate guests, staff and protecting key assets every day,” said David Beltrán, Southern Europe General Manager, Honeywell Building Solutions. “The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum has set a standard for what it means to be energy efficient and sustainable — both from an operational and environmental perspective.”
In addition, Honeywell Outcome Based Service analyzes the building’s energy consumption parameters, helping to provide enhanced visibility into operational behaviors throughout the museum and predict potential failures, inefficiencies or maintenance issues before they occur.
Since the museum opened in 1992, Honeywell has helped the museum maintain its physical environment.
The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum is being featured as part of Honeywell’s Iconic Buildings campaign that highlights some of the world’s most symbolic and widely recognized buildings using the company’s technologies to perform critical day-to-day functions. Honeywell has successfully executed similar projects at a variety of facilities such as the White Oak Federal Investigation Center in the United States and the Neinver centers in Spain and Portugal.

About Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum in Madrid
The Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum, located in the center of Madrid, is an art gallery of ancient and modern masters, inaugurated in 1992. The old Palacio de Villahermosa was remodeled to become this prestigious museum. More than 1,000 paintings, collected over seven decades by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, are exhibited in more than 24,000 square meters. The collection presents works from the primitive Italians to the experimental avant-garde and pop art. Later, the Museum was expanded to house the Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum receives about 1 million visitors a year.
