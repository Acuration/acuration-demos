Meet a #Futureshaper: Robby Kester
Robby Kester developed technology to help companies detect invisible methane leaks and give them actionable insights to stop them in their tracks.
Robby Kester is helping take action to stop and prevent methane and other gas leaks.
Methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at warming the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
That makes continuous monitoring for methane leaks at industrial sites increasingly critical, and advancements like the ones Robby and his team bring to life are designed to help companies do that more effectively.
Tell us about the technology you work with.
Honeywell's gas cloud imaging technology continuously monitors, pinpoints gas leaks and alerts operators as they happen. By visualizing the otherwise invisible gas cloud, operators can immediately analyze and stop the leak. In addition, by responding to a leak as soon as it occurs, oil and gas companies can reduce harmful emissions from polluting the environment.
What inspires you?
I am passionate about making the world a better place and working on sustainability has been incredibly rewarding. Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry is so important for future generations.
Get to know other #Futureshapers at the helm of technologies that are helping to create a safer and more sustainable world.
