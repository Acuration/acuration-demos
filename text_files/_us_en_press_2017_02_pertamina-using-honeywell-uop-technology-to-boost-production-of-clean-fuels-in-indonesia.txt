Pertamina Using Honeywell UOP Technology To Boost Production Of Clean Fuels In Indonesia
Pertamina Using Honeywell UOP Technology To Boost Production Of Clean Fuels In Indonesia
February 1, 2017
DES PLAINES, Ill., Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced that PT Pertamina (Persero) will use Honeywell UOP technology to produce high-octane gasoline blending components and jet fuel at its Balikpapan refinery in Kalimantan Timur, Indonesia.
The agreement includes licensing and engineering for a CCR Platforming' unit with a capacity of 33,000 barrels per day to produce cleaner-burning high-octane motor fuels and a Unionfining' hydrotreating unit with a capacity of 47,000 barrels per day to produce kerosene jet fuel.
"The CCR Platforming unit at Balikpapan will be the eighth unit that Honeywell UOP has licensed to Pertamina, and the backbone of Pertamina's supply of high-octane gasoline," said Mike Millard, vice president and general manager, Process Technology and Equipment at Honeywell UOP. "This technology provides the highest possible yield of these fuels, while also producing 1.2 million tons a year of the petrochemicals paraxylene and benzene."
According to government sources, Indonesia's gross domestic product is growing by 5.2 percent per year, while its population of 260 million people are growing by 1.2 percent annually. As a result, gasoline demand in Indonesia currently is rising by 4 to 5 percent per year, straining its ability to meet domestic demand for refined products.
The technologies provided by Honeywell UOP will help Indonesia meet that growing domestic demand while upgrading to Euro IV clean fuel specifications and phasing out production of 88 RONC gasoline.
As part of the same project, Pertamina awarded Honeywell UOP with a contract to expand capacity of its existing Unicracking' units at Balikpapan to 60,000 barrels per day. These units provide eastern Indonesia's domestic supply high-quality diesel fuel.
For more than 60 years, Honeywell UOP has been a leading provider of reforming solutions that produce high-octane, low-sulfur gasoline. More than 250 Honeywell UOP CCR Platforming units have been commissioned worldwide since the technology was introduced in 1971. When combined with Honeywell UOP's portfolio of best-in-class catalysts, the CCR Platforming process produces high-octane reformate, which is used to produce gasoline, and as a source for aromatics.
Honeywell UOP also is the world's leading provider of distillate hydrotreating technology, with more than 300 units licensed globally. The UOP Distillate Unionfining' process improves the quality of middle distillate feedstocks -- including kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel oils -- to meet ever more stringent fuel regulations.
PT Pertamina (Persero), together with its subsidiaries, engages in oil, gas, renewable, and new energy businesses in Indonesia and internationally. It was founded in 1957 and is headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia. Having worked with Pertamina since 1974, Honeywell UOP also is currently installing a modular CCR Platforming unit at the company's Cilacap refinery that will allow Cilacap to produce 91,000 barrels per day of 92 RON-C gasoline.

Honeywell UOP is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions (www.honeywellprocess.com), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries.
