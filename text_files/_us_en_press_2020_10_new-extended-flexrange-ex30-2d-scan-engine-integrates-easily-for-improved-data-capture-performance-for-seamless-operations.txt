Honeywell’s New Extended Flexrange™ Ex30 2d Scan Engine Integrates Easily For Improved Data Capture Performance For Seamless Operations
Honeywell’s New Extended Flexrange™ Ex30 2d Scan Engine Integrates Easily For Improved Data Capture Performance For Seamless Operations
The EX30 2D Imaging Scan engine delivers flexibility in data capture devices reading barcodes at near and far distances switching seamlessly across the full scanning range
October 14, 2020
Charlotte, N.C., Oct. 14, 2020 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced the new Extended FlexRange™ EX30 2D Scan Engine that offers the most flexible solution for OEM applications whether you need to scan near or far. The new EX30 has a slim form factor, is easy to integrate and is perfectly positioned for the next generation of mobile devices, handheld scanners, kiosks or medical diagnostic devices.
It allows operations to seamlessly read barcodes or packaging labels from as close as 4 inches and up to 66 feet away using an innovative auto-focus lens mechanism that enables it to change focus within milliseconds.
The Extended FlexRange EX30 2D Scan Engine uses the latest technology for a fast auto-focus lens mechanism that allows for the quick capture of near and far range images without latency. By enabling fast, accurate and efficient scanning, seamlessly between distances, this new scan engine helps improve user workflow performance and allows for efficient execution of a variety of tasks from one device.
“As workers in retail, healthcare and the supply chain increasingly rely on using mobile devices to maximize productivity, scan engine technology is providing the flexibility of using a single device for all data capture needs. The new EX30 scan engine has an embedded auto-focus lens mechanism that enables fast, aim-and-scan operation from one device,” said Lori Haggart, general manager of optical engines and software at Honeywell's Sensing and Internet of Things business. “This new 2D Scan Engine not only allows for scanning of barcodes near and far in one device, but also boasts a compact set of dimensions allowing for an easier fit into slimmer devices.”
The EX30’s electrical interface is fully compatible with Honeywell’s N670X, N660X and N360X Series fixed-focus compact imager scan engines reducing integration time and increasing design flexibility. It can easily be embedded into mobile devices running under an operating system by using the resources of the device’s main processor. It can be powered with the new Honeywell Gen7 DB Decoder Board allowing for easy integration into non-OS devices such as drones, mobile accessories and sleds. This decoder board provides operators with complete barcode symbology support, fast motion tolerance, and aggressive scanning of all barcode types, even poorly printed or read directly off smartphone screens.
With decades of experience in scanning and decoding, Honeywell continues to connect the physical and digital worlds by providing innovative solutions. Our engineering expertise coupled with a robust and flexible portfolio of scan engines helps design engineers solve the most complex design challenges.
