Meet a #futureshaper: Nicole James
She's helping packages arrive faster.
Nicole James predicts that automation and data insights will drive industries in the next three to five years.
“We will continue to evolve with the aid of machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics,” said Nicole, a senior director of offering management for software and voice.
Based in Alpharetta, Georgia, here is her #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
Growing up I wanted to be an attorney.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
Driving innovation, creating solutions, meeting with customers to understand their needs, working with very smart people and executing on our strategies gets me excited about coming to work every day.
Did you ever imagine you would end up in the job you are now?
I have always been a “big” thinker, aspiring to be an example to many, so yes, I actually envisioned where I am today and where I would like to be in the future.
What do you do?
Here’s a good way to think about what I do, if you can imagine herding cats.  My goal is to organize the stampede, however, everyone has their own agenda.  I have a talent of bringing people together for a common cause, to provide a valuable solution.  This is what my work consists of on a daily basis.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
A #futureshaper has to be fearless, unwavering, passionate, smart and in a constant mode of learning in order to succeed.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
The advice that I would give someone following in my footsteps would be to study your craft all the time. Determine that you can overcome any situation. Believe in yourself, knowing that you are great every day.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I am a sports fanatic, so when I am not working, you can find me either watching a game, playing a game or driving one of my boys to a game!
