Honeywell Joins Android Enterprise Recommended Program for Managed Service Providers
Honeywell Joins Android Enterprise Recommended Program for Managed Service Providers
February 19, 2019
FORT MILL, S.C., Feb. 19, 2019 --Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that it has been validated for the Android Enterprise Recommended program for managed service providers.
Honeywell provides customers with a comprehensive set of enterprise services that addresses every phase of the mobility lifecycle – from device selection to managing security concerns to recycling and disposition – to help streamline operations and reduce IT-related costs. Honeywell globally manages more than 2 million devices, such as smartphones, tablets and ruggedized mobile computers.
The GoogleTM-led Android Enterprise Recommended Managed Service Provider program is designed to give customers more confidence in deploying AndroidTM solutions and making sure their enterprise mobility deployment is consistent and current. Customers of Honeywell's enterprise mobility services benefit from device selection, deployment and management services as well as 24/7 technical support.
“As companies are growing and investing in their mobile workforce, they are looking to managed services providers to help them better deploy and manage their devices and software,” said Peter Howes, president of Honeywell's Productivity Products business. “We offer scalable, end-to-end solutions to allow our customers to focus on their core business. Customer look to us to deliver technical expertise starting with the procurement process all the way through servicing the mobile devices and managing the telecommunications spend.”
As part of the Android Enterprise Recommended program, validated managed services providers are trained on the latest best practices from Google to help customers simplify their mobility programs, allowing for agile and efficient growth using Android.
As a mobility services provider in the program, Honeywell provides customers with:
Technical expertise and leadership with dedicated personnel trained by Google on implementing and supporting Android
Experience with Android Enterprise Recommended enterprise mobility management systems
A commitment to staying current on the latest Android product features and training requirements
A close working relationship with Google for planning and escalation issues
In addition to managed services, Honeywell offers rugged mobile computers that are validated for the Google-led Android Enterprise Recommended program for rugged devices. Honeywell is one of the only companies that delivers both Android Enterprise Recommended mobile devices and managed services. These mobile computers – which are used by workers in distribution centers, transportation operations and retail stores – meet strict technical specifications and extended lifecycle support requirements.
Honeywell's validated devices – the CT40, CT60 and CN80 – are built on the company's Mobility EdgeTM Platform, which is a common hardware architecture and set of software tools that provide IT departments with an agile approach for deploying, managing and updating devices. Mobile devices built on the scalable Mobility Edge Platform help extend product lifecycles by supporting current and future versions of the Android operating system. Honeywell is one of the only rugged mobile computer providers to commit to supporting at least two letter upgrades beyond Android Pie on their devices.
