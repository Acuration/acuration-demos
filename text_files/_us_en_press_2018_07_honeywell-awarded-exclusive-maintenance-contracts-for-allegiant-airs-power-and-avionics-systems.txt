Honeywell Awarded Exclusive Maintenance Contracts For Allegiant Air's Power And Avionics Systems
Honeywell Awarded Exclusive Maintenance Contracts For Allegiant Air's Power And Avionics Systems
July 23, 2018
PHOENIX, July 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has been selected by Allegiant Air to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services for its auxiliary power units and select avionics components across its fleet of new Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft. The agreement also includes the replacement of non-Honeywell auxiliary power units (APUs) with Honeywell's 131-9A version, ensuring commonality across the Allegiant fleet. By choosing Honeywell's trusted aircraft technology and maintenance services, Allegiant will fly some of the most reliable and up-to-date aircraft anywhere.
"This strategic decision will increase the longevity of our aircraft and ensure our fleet is equipped to provide our passengers with a seamless travel experience from gate to gate," said Scott Sheldon, executive vice president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, Allegiant Air. "These upgrades not only make maintaining our new fleet easier and more efficient, they also bring extra reliability to our aircraft. That translates to reduced delays and an overall better experience for passengers."
Allegiant will benefit from Honeywell's highly-efficient APU, the 131-9A, through lower maintenance costs, enhanced reliability and annual fuel savings of $7,000 to $13,000 per aircraft. The 131-9A will also help reduce flight delays and cancellations, creating a more pleasant flying experience for Allegiant's customers. In addition, the airline will enjoy direct support with Honeywell's APU and cockpit technology maintenance and service offerings. All maintenance, repair and overhaul work for avionics and APUs will be completed at certified Honeywell facilities.
"Our agreement with Allegiant strengthens our ties with a growing airline, providing them with Honeywell's award-winning technology that provides the highest APU reliability in the industry and improves the customer experience," said Ben Driggs, president, Americas, Honeywell Aerospace. "The technologies and services we are providing the airline today will propel them into the future, helping them better compete in an already fiercely competitive industry."
About Honeywell APUs
APUs are primarily used to power an airplane during ground operations, providing electricity, air conditioning, main engine starting and more. They can also provide backup electrical power during flights.
Honeywell engineered the first APU in 1948. The company has produced more than 100,000 APUs and has more than 36,000 in service today across more than 150 regional, executive, commercial and military platforms, including both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.
Honeywell recently shipped its 6,000th 131-9A APU. This puts the number of production APUs from the 131-9 family at more than 13,000 units, which have operated for more than 100 million total flight hours. The 131-9 series APU has been selected by airlines for most narrow-body aircraft and features a unique electronic control box that integrates advanced, plain-English troubleshooting logic and health-monitoring capabilities for intuitive maintenance. This helps increase its already-proven reliability to reduce delays and flight cancellations, allowing airlines to stay on schedule so their passengers can reach their destinations on time.
