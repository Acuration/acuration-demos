Futureshaper
Cavene Vanhorne Robinson
Cavene Vanhorne Robinson
Senior Engineering Program Manager
Cavene is powering down harmful radiation in the aviation industry.
A creative person at heart, Cavene grew up in Jamaica and used to make toys out of scraps and paper, and little else. This resourceful creativity led her to what she does today for Honeywell: redesigning and removing radioactive materials from aircrafts. Just this year, she and her team put in service the first high tension radiation-free exciter (the part that delivers high voltage to the igniter in an engine). The sky’s the limit for Cavene.
