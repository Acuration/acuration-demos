Honeywell Theatro Partner to Develop Mobile SaaS Solutions for Retailers
Honeywell Theatro Partner to Develop Mobile SaaS Solutions for Retailers
January 14, 2019
FORT MILL, S.C., Jan. 14, 2019 &endash; Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that it is partnering with Theatro, pioneers of the world's first voice-controlled mobile app platform for the hourly workforce, to create joint Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions that empower retail store associates.
With this agreement, Honeywell will become an official reseller of Theatro's SaaS subscription services to complement the Honeywell In-Store Connected Retail Solutions portfolio.
The joint solutions will enable a seamless service experience for subscribers on Theatro's SaaS platform, whether they access the service from a Theatro Communicator or from a Honeywell Mobility EdgeTM device. As part of the agreement, Theatro will optimize its mobile application software for use on Honeywell mobile devices. By working together, Theatro and Honeywell will ensure users experience the same high-quality voice communications on Wi-Fi networks whether on their Theatro Communicator or Honeywell Mobility Edge device.
Theatro's voice-controlled mobile applications, employee location capability, and analytical insight apps are designed to enable a more engaged, informed and efficient in-store workforce. The integration with Honeywell will allow in-store associates equipped with Honeywell devices to leverage Theatro's unique intelligent, in-ear virtual assistant and voice applications to collaborate with colleagues and access enterprise information systems at the speed of voice. Ultimately, this additional functionality will allow hourly workers to respond to customer inquiries more effectively and efficiently, without breaking eye contact with a customer.
“Today's brick-and-mortar retail operations must deliver on customer demand for a seamless experience with reduced staff and increased competition,” said Peter Howes, president of Honeywell's Productivity Products business. “Honeywell's hardware combined with Theatro's proven software will help associates provide the right information at the right time, providing immediate satisfaction to customers.”
“Building an efficient and rewarding in-store experience requires substantial collaboration among store associates and in-store systems,” said Chris Todd, CEO, Theatro. “This partnership between Theatro and Honeywell will enable retailers to build enterprise-wide communications and collaboration networks to get the best out of their hourly workforce. We're excited for Honeywell to be an official reseller of our software solution and we look forward to the opportunity to assist Honeywell customers in delivering a winning store experience today and tomorrow.”
Honeywell and Theatro will offer live demonstrations of the joint solutions in the Honeywell booth #3257 and Theatro booth #1517 at the NRF Big Show Jan. 13-15.
