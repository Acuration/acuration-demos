Honeywell Gives Cargo Airplanes Improved View, Safety While Flying In Hazardous Skies
Honeywell Gives Cargo Airplanes Improved View, Safety While Flying In Hazardous Skies
May 2, 2017
PHOENIX, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) will provide the commercial and military versions of its innovative 3-D weather radar solution to Lockheed Martin for use on its new LM-100J Super Hercules commercial freighter.
With Honeywell's IntuVue RDR-4000 and 4000M Weather Radar systems, the Lockheed Martin LM-100J will benefit from the same ease of use and early warning of weather hazards - such as lightning, hail and turbulence - available in commercial airliners and business jets. The radar enables pilots to operate in difficult environments to support cargo transport, oil and gas operations, firefighting, medical evacuation, search and rescue, humanitarian relief missions, and more. Getting a better picture of weather ahead can make flying more secure, shorten flight times or delays, and protect airplanes and precious cargo from costly damage due to hail and other extreme weather.
Weather conditions around the globe can be severe, and the LM-100J is expected to operate in those conditions. Honeywell's IntuVue RDR-4000 currently helps thousands of commercial aircraft across the world manage the financial and safety impact of thunderstorms, hail and turbulence that cost the commercial airline industry more than $100 million annually.
Honeywell adapted the advanced technology from the IntuVue radar into the RDR-4000M to support the unique operating conditions of cargo aircraft like the C-130, C-17 and LM-100J. Its capabilities include high-resolution ground mapping for better awareness of ground features in difficult visual conditions, a 65 percent lighter system than legacy radars, and five times the reliability compared with weather radars installed today on most C-130s. These benefits have made the IntuVue RDR-4000M a popular retrofit choice for C-130 operators.
"Regardless of why you're flying, whether it's for civil or military purposes, weather does not play favorites. Hail and wind shear from thunderstorms are damaging and can easily ground a mission," said Bob Smith, president, Mechanical Systems & Components, at Honeywell Aerospace. "Honeywell's IntuVue RDR-4000 is pioneering the way to give pilots and operators access to clear skies, no matter how bad the weather. With technical advancements like turbulence detection out to 60 nautical miles and the use of live 3-D data and high-resolution ground mapping, our system makes sure pilots have the best information to fly safer, smarter and more efficiently around hazardous conditions."
"Operators around the world will rely on the LM-100J to go where other commercial freighters won't fly to and can't reach to deliver vital supplies and cargo. Weather will always be a major factor and consideration for LM-100J operations," said George Shultz, vice president and general manager, Air Mobility & Maritime Missions at Lockheed Martin. "Honeywell's IntuVue radar provides LM-100J pilots with a more complete picture of the weather that impacts their flight. IntuVue gives pilots the necessary data and forecasts so that they can best navigate flight paths without negative impacts to delivery timelines. The system also ensures a safer flying environment for LM-100J crews, which is of paramount importance. IntuVue's capabilities and technological advantages will truly enable the LM-100J to deliver goods anywhere at any time."
Key Features of the IntuVue RDR-4000M Weather Radar
Enhanced weather detection. The IntuVue RDR-4000M automatically collects a complete 3-D scan of all weather and terrain up to 320 nautical miles ahead of the aircraft and up to 60,000 feet above ground level. The system also features an advanced hazard feature that predicts hail and lightning out to 160 nautical miles and extended range turbulence up to 60 nautical miles.
High-resolution ground mapping. The IntuVue RDR-4000M map mode provides detailed images of features such as shorelines and bridges, and allows for easy identification of urban areas to better inform pilot actions and decisions.
Skin paint mode. The IntuVue RDR-4000M system can be set to a skin paint mode, enabling a pilot to detect and navigate to another aircraft in reduced visibility due to darkness, clouds or rainfall. This mode helps support missions such as aerial refueling.
Honeywell's RDR-4000M Weather Radar is delivering the best information possible for greater efficiency, safety and performance in both the civil and military sectors. In addition to the weather radar system, Honeywell also sells more than 50 GoDirect services and applications, many of which focus on weather and reducing fuel costs.
