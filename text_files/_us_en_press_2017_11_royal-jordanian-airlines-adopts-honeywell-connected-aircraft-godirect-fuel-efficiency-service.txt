Royal Jordanian Airlines Adopts Honeywell Connected Aircraft GoDirect Fuel Efficiency Service
Royal Jordanian Airlines Adopts Honeywell Connected Aircraft GoDirect Fuel Efficiency Service
November 13, 2017
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Nov. 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell's (NYSE: HON) Connected Aircraft GoDirect' Fuel Efficiency software has been selected by Royal Jordanian Airlines to reduce fuel usage on its fleet of 24 aircraft. The innovative software is part of Honeywell's GoDirect suite of more than 50 Connected Aircraft services. Honeywell's offering uses data analysis, reporting and monitoring tools to identify fuel-saving opportunities that make flying more cost-efficient and better for the environment.
Through an intuitive interface, Honeywell's GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software integrates existing airline systems with more than 100 ready-made analysis reports. This allows airlines to deploy the solution and immediately begin using customized reports based on individual stakeholders' needs, which can reduce fuel costs by up to 5 percent. Although fuel efficiency results can vary by aircraft and airline, fuel consumption can account for 20 to 40 percent of an airline's operating costs. Even single-digit percentage improvements in fuel savings can save tens of millions of dollars per year.
"There's huge potential for Honeywell's Fuel Efficiency software to push our efforts toward running cost-efficient operations at all levels using different tools, among which is this innovative software. It will also help us work toward Jordan's pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," said Stefan Pichler, president and CEO, Royal Jordanian. "The technology also fully complies with the European Union emissions trading system legislation, among many other software-based fuel-savings recommendations for each flight."
"One of the biggest pressures facing airlines today is improving operational efficiency while meeting very tight margins," said David Shilliday, vice president, Airlines, EMEAI, Honeywell Aerospace. "Our GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software makes this possible by integrating many different data sources to save fuel, lower environmental impact and ultimately cut fuel costs with a simple software upgrade."
GoDirect is Honeywell's industry-leading portfolio of services and applications that provide business aviation operators, crews and maintenance teams with the information they need to control their services and network. Royal Jordanian joins an expanding list of global customers already using Honeywell's innovative GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software, including India's Jet Airways, Japan Airlines, Finnair and Turkish Airlines.
