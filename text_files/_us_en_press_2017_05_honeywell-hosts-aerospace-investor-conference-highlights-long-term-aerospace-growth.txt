Honeywell Hosts Aerospace Investor Conference; Highlights Long-Term Aerospace Growth
Honeywell Hosts Aerospace Investor Conference; Highlights Long-Term Aerospace Growth
May 19, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., May 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) will hold its Aerospace Investor Showcase today in Morristown, N.J. The Company will highlight its expectations for accelerating long-term organic growth in Aerospace due to increasing demand for its industry-leading technologies, wins on key OEM platforms, and broad portfolio of connectivity and service offerings.
"Since 2010, Honeywell has invested over $18 billion in Aerospace, and those investments are yielding returns, with a 75 percent win rate on new OEM platforms that we project are worth more than $55 billion in cumulative revenues to Honeywell over their platform lives," said Tim Mahoney, president and chief executive officer of Honeywell Aerospace. "Our industry-leading installed base, innovative new technologies, and improving end markets are expected to drive a 3-4 percent average growth rate over the next five years in Aerospace, with a long-term segment margin target of 25 percent."
"Connectivity will drive 'decoupled' growth, an Aerospace aftermarket sales strategy not bound by traditional aviation flight hours or aircraft production cycles," continued Mahoney. "We anticipate that more than 5,000 planes will be equipped with Honeywell broadband technology by 2018, bringing passengers and pilots the same reliable, high-speed Wi-Fi you get at home thanks to our JetWave' satellite communications technology."
"In addition to the unprecedented number of big wins and double-digit growth in our services and connectivity portfolio, our long-term performance will be driven by mid-market carrier wins in high-growth regions, improving dynamics in the defense sector, and the eventual recovery of the business aviation market," Mahoney concluded. "We are optimistic about the Aerospace business, and proud of our continuing legacy of leadership and innovation."
Honeywell Aerospace products and services are found on virtually every commercial, defense and space aircraft. The Aerospace business unit develops innovative solutions for more fuel-efficient automobiles and airplanes, more direct and on-time flights, safer flying and runway traffic, along with aircraft engines, cockpit and cabin electronics, wireless connectivity services, logistics, and more.
