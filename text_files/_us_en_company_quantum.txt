Our Quantum Technology Enables High-Quality Qubits
Defined in nature by their atomic structure, our trapped-ion qubits can be uniformly manufactured and controlled more easily and quickly compared to alternative qubit technologies that do not directly use atoms. This is why we use the term “Nature’s Qubit”, for our systems - our qubits are all identical and defect-free.

Capability
High fidelity and high qubit count with error rates at the leading-edge of industry capability
Reconfigurability
Dynamic qubits that can be rearranged and interacted to improve algorithm opportunities
Robustness
A century of control systems excellence for precise and stable operation
WHY HONEYWELL
Our Approach Stems from Our Heritage
After more than 130 years of innovation, our strengths in science, engineering and research, along with our domain and software expertise, allow us to offer our partners and customers a competitive edge.
Trapped-ion quantum computers use numerous, individual, charged atoms (ions) to hold quantum information. Our systems use electromagnetic fields to hold (trap) each ion so it can be manipulated and encoded using microwave signals and lasers.
The complexity of these control systems is aligned to our expertise, because we’ve been building them for decades. As a leader in hardware, software and intuitive user interfaces, we have the end-to-end capabilities necessary to design, build, and integrate critical subsystems and components to facilitate trapped-ion technology.
