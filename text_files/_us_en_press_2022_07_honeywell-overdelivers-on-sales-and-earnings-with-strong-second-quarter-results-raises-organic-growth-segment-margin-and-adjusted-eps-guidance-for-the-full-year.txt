Honeywell Overdelivers on Sales and Earnings with Strong Second Quarter Results; Raises Organic Growth, Segment Margin, and Adjusted EPS Guidance for the Full Year
Sales Growth and Margin Expansion in Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, and Performance Materials and Technologies
Reported Sales up 2%, Organic Sales up 4%, Exceeding High End of Guidance Range
Earnings Per Share of $1.84, Adjusted Earnings Per Share1 of $2.10, Exceeding High End of Guidance Range
Orders up 12%; Backlog2 up 12% to $29.5 Billion, Led by Our Long-Cycle Businesses
Deployed $2.3 Billion in Capital, including $1.4 Billion to Share Repurchases
July 28, 2022
CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 28, 2022 -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced results for the second quarter, which met or exceeded the company's guidance. The company also raised the low end of its full-year organic growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges and raised its full-year segment margin guidance range.
The company reported second quarter organic sales growth of 4%, or 7% excluding the impact of lower COVID-mask volumes and the wind down of operations in Russia,3 exceeding the high end of the company's guidance range. Operating margin contracted by 20 basis points to 17.9% primarily due to an additional charge related to Russia. Segment margin expanded by 50 basis points to 20.9%, or 80 basis points excluding the year-over-year impact of Quantinuum. Adjusted earnings per share1 was $2.10, up 4% year over year and 2 cents above the high end of the company’s guidance range. Operating cash flow was $0.8 billion, down 38% year over year, and free cash flow was $0.8 billion, down 43% year over year, due to higher working capital as expected ahead of anticipated volume growth in the back half.
“Honeywell met or exceeded guidance for all metrics in the second quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop,” said Darius Adamczyk, chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell. “Organic sales grew 4% led by strong double-digit growth in our commercial aerospace, building products, advanced sensing technologies, and advanced materials businesses. Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, and Performance Materials and Technologies all grew organically and expanded margins in the quarter. While we recognize macro crosscurrents are clouding the global economic growth outlook, we remain confident in our demand outlook for the back half of the year with orders up 12% year over year and closing backlog2 of $29.5 billion, up 12% year over year, led by our long-cycle businesses, which will help drive growth for quarters to come. We once again demonstrated our operational agility by staying ahead of the inflation curve, enabling us to expand margins and beat the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance. We also continued to execute on our capital deployment strategy, deploying $2.3 billion in the quarter, including $1.4 billion of share repurchases.”
Adamczyk continued, “As we have shown, our rigorous operating principles enable us to mitigate external challenges and deliver results that maximize shareholder value. The continued recovery of our key commercial aviation, defense, energy, and non-residential end markets, our commercial excellence, and our technologically differentiated portfolio of solutions will allow us to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities and remain highly resilient amid ongoing uncertainties.”
As a result of the company’s second-quarter performance and management’s outlook for the remainder of the year, full-year sales are now expected to be in the range of $35.5 billion to $36.1 billion, up 5% to 7% organically, or up 7% to 9% excluding the one-point impact of COVID-driven mask sales declines and one-point impact of lost Russian sales. Segment margin expansion4 is now expected to be in the range of 30 to 70 basis points, including an approximate (30) basis point impact from investments in the Quantinuum business. Adjusted earnings per share4,5 is now expected to be in the range of $8.55 to $8.80. Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.9 billion, and free cash flow is expected to be $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion. A summary of the company’s full year guidance changes can be found in Table 1.
Second-Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the second quarter were up 2% year over year on a reported basis and 4% year over year on an organic basis. The second-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.
Aerospace sales for the second quarter were up 5% year over year on an organic basis. Commercial aftermarket demand improved in the second quarter as flight hours continued to increase, resulting in approximately 20% growth in both air transport aftermarket and business and general aviation aftermarket. Business and general aviation original equipment grew double digits, while air transport original equipment grew over 25% year over year as we continue to see strong build rates. Growth in commercial aerospace was partially offset by lower defense volumes. Segment margin expanded 80 basis points to 26.5% in the second quarter, led by commercial excellence partially offset by cost inflation.
Honeywell Building Technologies sales for the second quarter were up 14% on an organic basis year over year driven by strength in both building products and building solutions. Orders were up double digits for the second consecutive quarter, led by building projects, building management systems, and security products. Segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 23.5% due to pricing actions partially offset by cost inflation.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the second quarter were up 10% on an organic basis year over year despite an approximately 3% headwind from Russia. Sales growth was led by solid pricing and greater volumes in advanced materials, as well as strength in petrochemical catalyst shipments and thermal solutions, which both grew over 20% in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by lower equipment volumes and lost Russian sales in UOP. Segment margin expanded 150 basis points to 22.3%, primarily driven by price actions partially offset by cost inflation.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the second quarter decreased 10% on an organic basis year over year as strength in advanced sensing technologies and productivity solutions and services was offset by lower personal protective equipment and warehouse automation volumes. Excluding the impact of lower COVID-mask volumes, organic sales decreased by 5% in the quarter. Advanced sensing technologies grew 25% and productivity solutions and services grew 19%, demonstrating excellent execution in a difficult supply constrained environment. Segment margin contracted 140 basis points to 12.6%, primarily driven by lower volume leverage, cost inflation, and a one-time write-down of excess COVID-related mask inventory, partially offset by pricing and a favorable licensing agreement with a competitor.

Honeywell will discuss its second-quarter results and updated full-year guidance during an investor conference call starting at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time today. A live webcast of the investor call as well as related presentation materials will be available through the Investor Relations section of the company’s website (www.honeywell.com/us/en/investor).

1Adjusted EPS and adjusted EPS V% exclude charges and the accrual of reserves related to foreign exchange revaluation, inventory reserves, the write-down of other assets, impairment of property, plant and equipment, employee severance, and a tax valuation allowance, related to the initial suspension and wind down of our businesses and operations in Russia, expenses related to UOP matters, changes in fair value for Garrett equity securities, and a non-cash charge associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables following Garrett's emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2021.
2Effective March 31, 2022, performance obligations exclude contracts with customers related to Russia as collectability is not reasonably assured. Backlog V% includes prior year revisions to reflect a prior period correction, which had no impact on our results of operations.
3Lost Russian sales is defined as the year-over-year decline in sales due to the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia. This does not reflect management’s estimate of 2022 Russian sales absent the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia.
4As discussed in the notes to the attached reconciliations, we do not provide guidance for margin or EPS on a GAAP basis.
5Adjusted EPS guidance excludes charges and the accrual of reserves related to outstanding accounts receivable and contract assets, impairment of intangible assets, foreign exchange revaluation, inventory reserves, the write-down of other assets, impairment of property, plant and equipment, employee severance, and a tax valuation allowance, related to the initial suspension and wind down of our businesses and operations in Russia, expenses related to UOP matters, and any potential future one-time items that we cannot reliably predict or estimate such as pension mark-to-market.
6Adjusted EPS V% guidance excludes charges and the accrual of reserves related to outstanding accounts receivable and contract assets, impairment of intangible assets, foreign exchange revaluation, inventory reserves, the write-down of other assets, impairment of property, plant and equipment, employee severance, and a tax valuation allowance, related to the initial suspension and wind down of our businesses and operations in Russia, expenses related to UOP matters, pension mark-to-market, changes in fair value for Garrett equity securities, a non-cash charge associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables following Garrett's emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2021, gain on the sale of the retail footwear business, and any potential future one-time items that we cannot reliably predict or estimate.
7Adjusted free cash flow conversion is free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures plus cash receipts from Garrett) divided by adjusted net income attributable to Honeywell. Adjusted net income attributable to Honeywell excludes charges and the accrual of reserves related to foreign exchange revaluation, inventory reserves, the write-down of other assets, impairment of property, plant and equipment, employee severance, and a tax valuation allowance, related to the initial suspension and wind down of our businesses and operations in Russia, expenses related to UOP matters, changes in fair value for Garrett equity securities,  and a non-cash charge associated with a reduction in value of reimbursement receivables following Garrett's emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2021.

Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Certain metrics presented on a non-GAAP basis represent the impact of adjusting items net of tax. The tax-effect for adjusting items is determined individually and on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Appendix attached to this release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
