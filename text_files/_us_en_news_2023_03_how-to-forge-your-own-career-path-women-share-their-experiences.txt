How to Forge Your Own Career Path: Women Share Their Experiences
How to Forge Your Own Career Path: Women Share Their Experiences
Women who are a part of career advancement programs at Honeywell share perspectives on professional growth – from embracing non-linear journeys to working with mentors and sponsors.
Being an innovator often means carving your own path.
Maybe that means approaching an obstacle from a different perspective or by utilizing existing technology for a new application.
In your professional life, this could translate to taking on a new project that excites you or expressing interest in a new challenge.
But how do you actually take that leap?
“Take responsibility and initiative to reach out and connect with people that are in a role you are interested in,” says Erika Kauffman, a finance director.
“When given the opportunity to share your perspective, do so,” says general counsel Dionne Hamilton.
Paola Hernandez, a communications leader, says: “Think about where your skills and talents meet the needs of society.”
Erika, Dionne and Paola are members of this year’s Diversity Career Advancement Program (DCAP) and Women’s Career Advancement Program (WCAP) cohorts. The programs are designed to empower a class of participants through workplace training and development, as well as through expanding their internal networks for promotional opportunities. Participants are also paired with executive sponsors to help advocate for them and their career aspirations.
In light of Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day, get inspired by Erika, Paola and Dionne’s insights on taking charge of your professional growth.

How can women forge their own career paths?
Take responsibility and initiative to reach out and connect with people that are in a role you are interested in, to understand their responsibilities, background and skills they needed in their career growth to get to that point. And then speak with your supervisor or mentor on how you can develop those skills so you can be ready for the next opportunity.
Tell us about how the Women’s Career Advancement Program is helping you make an impact.
It has already been impactful for me by connecting me with people of diverse backgrounds and roles. I have already learned of new potential opportunities. And personally, I have learned more about Inclusion and Diversity and how it benefits us all to embrace diversity in our teams.
Dionne Hamilton – General Counsel
How can women forge their own career paths?
Keep focused on your objective, seek advice and input from those who have been successful in their journey, take on a high visibility assignment, and when given the opportunity to share your perspective, do so.
The path is not necessarily an upward linear trajectory. There may be curves, and sometimes downward slopes to get on a different path, to reach that overarching objective. No journey is the same. Know that others have helped to forge that path and are there to help along the way.
Tell us about how the Diversity Career Advancement Program is helping you make an impact.
At the end of the first DCAP session I attended, I was asked to summarize the program in one word. I chose “intentional.” The participants, sponsors and organizers are all focused on an intentional mission to increase diversity within Honeywell at the higher levels of the enterprise. That is enormously inspiring to me. During the program and immediately thereafter, I expanded my Honeywell network exponentially. With that network, my past and current experience – and by implementing my individual development plan – DCAP has set me up for greater success at Honeywell which is impactful for me both personally and professionally.
Paola Hernandez – Communications Senior Director
How can women forge their own career paths?
I would start by getting to know yourself better. Looking back, I wish had spent more time learning more about myself and what I enjoy doing versus just following a standard path. If you sit down with yourself first and evaluate where you see yourself in five to 10 years, that’s a good place to start. Think about where your skills and talents meet the needs of society.
I knew since I was in college that a career in communications was the right fit for me because I’ve always been outspoken, I like to write, I am a very good planner and am a detailed-oriented person. These are all attributes that have contributed to my successful career in communications. I would also say that relationships are very important. Don’t burn bridges, treat everyone with respect, and always do the best job you can regardless of the circumstances you may find yourself in.
Tell us about how the Diversity Career Advancement Program is helping you make an impact.
The DCAP program has been incredibly refreshing. I had the opportunity to meet and learn from really smart and committed individuals at Honeywell. I also especially enjoyed listening to external speakers who helped reinforce the importance of being an inclusive leader. As I grow my professional as well as ministerial leadership skills, this is certainly a priority. Having come from a Hispanic background with limited financial resources and role models, my perspective may be different from someone who never went through that experience. This highlights how important it is for us to approach people as individuals, and this program brought this to light in a simple yet impactful way.
