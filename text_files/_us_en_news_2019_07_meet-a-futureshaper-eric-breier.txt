Meet a #futureshaper: Eric Breier
Here's how he's making big data make sense
July 28, 2019
Eric Breier leads design teams around the world to make software that helps people do their jobs better.
Working with talented designers and researchers motivates him.
He works on software with a focus on the future.
“The products we make have a clear and direct impact on reducing energy consumption, reducing waste and making the workplace a safer place for workers around the world,” Eric said.
Based in Atlanta, here is his #futureshaper story.
Did you think you’d end up in a job like you’re in now? I always knew I wanted to do something in a creative field, but couldn’t have imagined this.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up? A lot of different dreams…a pilot, a race car driver, an astronaut, a comic book artist, an inventor just to name a few.
What do you do? I lead design teams around the world who make software that helps people do their jobs better.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day? What doesn’t!? Working with amazingly talented designers and researchers. Working with customers and helping to make their work easier. Seeing the world. This job has it all.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell? How much true impact we have in the world. We’re a critical part of so many businesses that impact our world and it's so exciting to be a part of shaping the future.
How has Honeywell changed since you began working here? I really just started my work here with Honeywell but we’re already learning and making better decisions to realize our vision.
Why is the future important? Because it represents the dream of achieving the very best of what is possible.
How does your job make tomorrow better/safer than today? The products we make have a clear and direct impact on reducing energy consumption, reducing waste and making the workplace a safer place for workers around the world.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper have? Creativity, Grit, Optimism, Empathy.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry? In the future, the user interfaces we build today will evolve into even faster, more direct connections between man, machines and the world around us. At the risk of sounding like a sci-fi nerd, I suspect we’ll be fully and seamlessly integrated.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps? Stay creative. Be Humble. Always ask for forgiveness over permission and trust that your perseverance will pay off. Be great at what you can control and listen more than you speak. Be your own harshest critic and always challenge yourself. Have a blast while you’re doing it!
What do you for fun? Play games with my wife and kids. Run. Hike. Explore the world.
