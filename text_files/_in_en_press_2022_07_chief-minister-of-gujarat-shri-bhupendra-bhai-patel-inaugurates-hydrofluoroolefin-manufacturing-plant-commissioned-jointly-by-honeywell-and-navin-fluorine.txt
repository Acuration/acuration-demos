Dahej, July 12, 2022: Today, Honeywell and Navin Fluorine, part of the Padmanabh Mafatlal Group, hosted an opening ceremony at a plant in Dahej, Gujarat, which has begun manufacturing Honeywell’s Solstice® zd in India. Shri Bhupendrabhai Patel, Chief Minister of Gujarat, inaugurated the plant virtually and Ken West, President of Honeywell Advanced Materials; Rajesh Rege, President of Honeywell India; Vishad Mafatlal, Executive Chairman of Navin Fluorine; and Radhesh Welling, Managing Director of Navin Fluorine, were in attendance with other dignitaries. Solstice zd is a hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) that has various applications, including blowing agents for foam insulation and refrigeration liquid for chillers.
The portfolio of next generation products has a global warming potential (GWP) of one and no ozone depletion potential, thereby helping customers lower their carbon footprint and improve energy efficiency without sacrificing end-product performance. Honeywell has already invested more than a billion dollars in research, development and new capacity for its Solstice technology, having anticipated the need for lower-GWP solutions to combat climate change more than a decade ago.
“An increasing number of countries including India have pledged to adopt environmental regulations that will help make the future safer and more sustainable. As demonstrated through our collaboration with Navin Fluorine, Honeywell is committed to helping these countries in their environmental transformations by providing energy efficient, low-GWP, ready-now solutions that lower greenhouse gas emissions,” said Ken West, President of Honeywell Advanced Materials.
“Honeywell is focused on developing solutions that enable our customers to reduce their carbon footprint. The opening of this manufacturing facility with Navin Fluorine will help us increase our global supply of Solstice zd and support our customers’ environmental goals. This reflects our continued investment and commitment in India,” said Rajesh Rege, President of Honeywell India.
“Navin Fluorine has managed to successfully complete this large project through three tough phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting up this plant in around two years is a demonstration of our strong technical capabilities and our commitment to growing our partnership with Honeywell,” said Radhesh Welling, Managing Director of Navin Fluorine.
