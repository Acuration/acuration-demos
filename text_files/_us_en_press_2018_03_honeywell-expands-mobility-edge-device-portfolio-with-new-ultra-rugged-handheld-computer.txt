Honeywell Expands Mobility Edge Device Portfolio with new Ultra-Rugged Handheld Computer
Honeywell Expands Mobility Edge Device Portfolio with new Ultra-Rugged Handheld Computer
March 12, 2018
FORT MILL, S.C., March 12, 2018 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced a next-generation ultra-rugged handheld computer built on the company's Mobility Edge PlatformTM. The Dolphin' CN80 is a hybrid device that incorporates both a traditional keypad and a large touchscreen interface to give users flexibility for quickly inputting data. The handheld computer, which runs the AndroidTM operating system, is designed for demanding environments, including distribution centers, field mobility applications such as pickup-and-delivery and direct store delivery, and offers options for cold storage or hazardous location environments. “Workers in distribution centers or out in the field rely on their mobile devices to provide rapid data entry at high transaction rates,” said Lisa London, vice president of marketing and offering management for Honeywell's Productivity Products business. “For many of our customers who work in challenging locations or who have applications that rely on keyed shortcuts to speed data entry, a physical keypad remains a popular option for capturing mission-critical information.” The new handheld computer features a vivid 4.2-inch touchscreen display along with a choice of either a numeric or a QWERTY keypad. In addition, the CN80 features: Enhanced 1D and 2D scanning/data capture options with the ability to read bar codes from as close as 6 inches to as far as 50 feet‚ an ultra-rugged design with the ability to withstand multiple drops onto concrete from 8 feet and 2,000 tumbles from 3.3 feet‚ strong battery life to support long shifts, extended talk-times and heavy GPS usage
The CN80 is the latest device to run on Honeywell's Mobility Edge Platform, which comprises common software and hardware architecture and a suite of device tools. The platform supports four generations of the Android operating system. The scalable architecture allows customers to develop, test and certify an application just once before deploying it to multiple device types across the enterprise, allowing companies to accelerate deployments, optimize device performance and extend the total product lifecycle to provide a lower overall total cost of ownership.
“Our customers need to minimize the cost and time associated with deploying and maintaining mobile solutions to keep their workers connected,” said London. “With the Mobility Edge Platform, we help simplify software deployment to our customers' fleet of devices and provide them with a much longer lifecycle for their mobile technology investments.” Honeywell's technology helps distribution centers, logistics providers and postal organizations maximize productivity and efficiency while keeping workers safe and connected.
