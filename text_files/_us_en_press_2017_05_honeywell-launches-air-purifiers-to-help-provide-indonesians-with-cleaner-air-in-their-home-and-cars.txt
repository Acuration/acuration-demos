INDONESIA, May 17, 2017 – Taking an important step towards a cleaner today and a healthier tomorrow, Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today outlined their vision for cleaner and healthier living, and introduced two new high performance indoor air purifiers for homes, cars and institutions, at a launch event at the Kempinski Hotel, Jakarta. Speaking at today’s launch, Alex Pollack, president, Honeywell Indonesia said “Indoor air pollution causes illnesses that lead to premature deaths caused by respiratory diseases every year. Many families are unaware of the harmful air pollutants that thrive in our homes, cars and offices. Being indoors does not keep us safe from this hazard – furnishings, cleaning agents, cooking fumes, pet fur and accumulated dust all have a harmful effect on our health. At Honeywell, we are committed to ensuring a healthy and comfortable air environment for every Indonesian family at home and even on the go.” Studies have shown that the air pollution levels in Jakarta stand at 45 μg/m3, more than four times the threshold set by the World Health Organization and three times higher than the government’s standard. In Indonesia, the typical car commuter spends more than five hours a day sitting in his car in heavy traffic, inhaling vehicular emissions and in-car pollution. According to the Indonesian environmental health studies air pollution causes 2.8 million lost work days annually along with 1.3 million absences at school, 9,000 hospitalized patients and at least 165,000 premature deaths.
Dino Asvaintra, vice president and general manager, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies, Greater China / High Growth Region Home business, said “Across emerging markets, the average consumer is worried about three key issues – air pollution, water pollution and food safety. At Honeywell, we are committed to using advanced technology to ensure clean air, pure water and effective smart home solutions are available to every family. The Air Touch® purifier is designed and technologically engineered to keep your family comfortable and save energy while protecting you, all the way.” A leading global, smart home brand in the indoor air purifier space, Honeywell’s Air Touch® air purifier cleans indoor air with Honeywell’s patented HiSiv™ technology filter, HEPA filter, and a pre-filter, delivering a three-layer combination that eliminates large dust particles, PM 2.5, bacteria, formaldehyde, harmful gasses and total volatile organic compounds. The Honeywell Air Touch® home air purifier range is available in two colors, champagne gold and classic white, featuring a unique drawer type design, which makes removal and filter replacement extremely easy. The Air Touch® filter can be used up for up to 3,000 hours, subject to usage and air quality, and an indicator will inform you when the filter replacement is needed. The air quality level is displayed in an LED panel, with a touch pad for ease of control. The air purifier consumes 7.5W at lowest fan speed and 52W at highest fan speed, supporting an energy efficient home. The Honeywell Move Car Air Purifier is compact, made with flame retardant material and purifies 3 cubic meters of air inside the car in just 15 minutes. The high grade HEPA filter removes dangerous PM2.5 pollutants while the double layer active carbon filter removes odor, dust, smoke, other fabric pollutants, and toxic gases like SO and NOx caused by vehicle emissions on the street. Honeywell is one of the leading brands globally in the indoor air purifier space with one of the widest portfolios, cutting edge technology, and a combination of intuitive and user-friendly design principles that provide powerful performance and deliver cleaner indoor air efficiently.
