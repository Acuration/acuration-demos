What to Expect as an Intern at Honeywell
What to Expect as an Intern at Honeywell
These students are spending the summer solving problems and discovering their future career paths
July 23, 2019
Think your internship will be getting coffee and filing paperwork? Not at Honeywell. Our interns roll up their sleeves and get hands-on with technology.
Here are a look at what our more than 800 interns across North America are up to.
Olivia Barron, mechanical engineering intern in Des Plaines, Ill.
School: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
Project: I work with the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA). This group designs and delivers technology for hydrogen purification. I collaborate with team members creating specifications and performing calculations for the specialized equipment.
What is your favorite part of the internship? Attending the Women in Networking events. They provide a good opportunity to learn more about different areas of the company through presentations and networking.
What would you tell future interns to expect from a summer internship at Honeywell? Future interns can expect to be flooded with new information on the technical side and about working in industry in general.
Jessie Berry, human resources intern in Fort Mill, S.C.
School: University of Minnesota Twin Cities
Project: Review current Honeywell benefits and how they are marketed to our employees and candidates and from there make recommendations on how they can be improved.
What is your favorite part of the internship? Working on a team with other HR interns across the country has been a very cool experience.
What would you tell future interns to expect from a summer internship at Honeywell? To work on projects that have a real impact on the business, gain insight from interactions with top leaders throughout the company, and overall, learn a lot from your experiences and the people around you.
Kathrine Gibson, software engineering intern, in Deer Valley, Ariz.
School: Gonzaga University
Project: After a problem has been figured out by a customer, our design team tries to come up with a solution and then code that solution. My role is to preserve that software in its state where there're no bugs, so in the future if they need to go back and revert to a certain state, they have the preserved software.
Favorite Part: I've already been touching applications that are going directly to customers, and I'm learning a lot from it, which will help me in whatever job I decide to take in the future.
What would you tell future interns to expect from a summer internship at Honeywell? Expect to be challenged with exciting projects. Also expect to meet some of the best coworkers.
Khanh Nguyen, engineering intern in Houston
School: University of Houston
Project: I am working on the development of a training module for engineers on how to read process industry diagrams and use that information to build effective console displays for process plant operators following industry standards and best practices.
What is your favorite part of the internship? I have been given assignments that constantly put me in learning mode and motivate me to go to work every day.
What would you tell future interns to expect from a summer internship at Honeywell? To work with people and get the resources and mentoring that you need. You are driving your career so make sure that you take the initiative to build your professional network, seek opportunities and ask to be involved.
Kiana “Ki” Platte, health, safety & environmental (HSE) intern, in Phoenix
School: Boise State University
Project: I work every day to improve work place health and safety.  Whether it’s relaying additional information to a tier meeting, or holding a one-on-one evaluation with an employee, there are no two days alike.
What is your favorite part of the internship? My team! They are always ready to help, reliable, and show genuine commitment.
What would you tell future interns to expect from a summer internship at Honeywell? Future interns should be flexible and always willing to lend a hand! Twelve weeks is not that long, and if you want to gain a lot, you have to be willing to take on a lot.
Shaun Turek, mechanical engineering intern, in Baton Rouge
School: Louisiana State University
Project: My role is assisting customers with tests for control systems that include controllers, digital inputs, digital outputs, analog inputs, and analog outputs.
What is your favorite part of the internship? Being put into a new environment and the challenge of learning new hardware is my favorite part.
What would you tell future interns to expect from a summer internship at Honeywell? You can expect to learn a lot through hands on experience and an encouraging attitude from permanent staff.
