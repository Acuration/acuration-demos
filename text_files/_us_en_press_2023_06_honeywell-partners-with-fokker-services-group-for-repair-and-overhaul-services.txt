Honeywell Partners with Fokker Services Group for Repair and Overhaul Services
June 22, 2023
PARIS, June 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) and Fokker Services B.V. (Fokker) have signed a memorandum of agreement whereby Fokker has been authorized as a Service Center & Channel Partner for Honeywell pre-cooler control valve (PCCV) repair and overhaul services. The agreement, announced at Paris Air Show 2023, will provide airline operators with a wider choice of component repair services.
The PCCV is already used on the Boeing 737NG. Through its Amsterdam center, Fokker will offer full disassembly, assembly, test, repair and overhaul services to customers across the globe. This collaboration serves as an expansion of the existing repair authorization for Honeywell avionics and mechanical components, enabling Honeywell and Fokker to venture into new product lines together.
"By collaborating with Fokker, we are expanding operators' choices for their component repair needs. Honeywell is proud to partner with Fokker to not only strengthen our existing repair authorization but also open new avenues to explore together," said Maria Sanchez, Senior Sales Director, Airlines Aftermarket, Honeywell Aerospace. "With Fokker's expertise and its Amsterdam facility offering a comprehensive range of services, airline operators can now benefit from a broader range of options, ensuring the highest standards of quality and efficiency in component repair services."
"We are pleased to enhance our partnership with Honeywell as the chosen partner for B737NG PCCV aftermarket support. Our unique value chain, customized product portfolio and customer-centric approach enable us to provide added value to airlines and engine shops in their pneumatic accessories' maintenance," said Menzo van der Beek, CEO of Fokker Services Group. "As our collaboration with Honeywell grows, we will continue to explore new opportunities and expand our service offerings to further benefit the channel partner network."
