Honeywell To Provide Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant To Navitas Midstream Partners
Honeywell To Provide Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant To Navitas Midstream Partners
July 10, 2018
DES PLAINES, Ill., July 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that its UOP Russell business will provide a gas processing plant to Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC. The 200-million-cubic-foot-per-day nameplate capacity plant will remove natural gas liquids (NGLs) from natural gas produced from several counties in the Midland Basin.
Honeywell's solution includes design and supply of a UOP Russell modular cryogenic plant with refrigeration and dehydration units. The plant includes a Honeywell UOP MolSiv™ unit, which removes impurities and water to ensure high gas quality. The plant design streamlines project schedules and is customized for the unique gas composition in the Midland Basin.
"Navitas Midstream has selected UOP Russell technology because we can customize pre-engineered equipment, which speeds delivery and assures greater reliability and familiarity with the units," said Neil Eckersley, UOP Russell general manager at Honeywell. "We're delivering a plant that's designed for the rich feed gas composition in the basin and that recovers NGLs at high rates with consistently high uptime."
Cryogenic gas processing plants cool natural gas until the heavier and more valuable NGLs form into liquids. These liquids – including propane, ethane and butanes -- can be used as fuels, fuel blending components and other valuable petrochemicals.
The plant is designed to accommodate the NGL-rich gas in the Midland Basin. Its low capital and operating expense and high NGL recovery enable Navitas to meet producer processing needs, while also ensuring downstream pipeline specifications are met.
Honeywell's pre-engineered modular equipment can be tailored to customer specifications and shipped to remote locations. Modules fit together easily and efficiently, significantly reducing construction time and expense, and enhancing reliability after start-up. This enables customers to more quickly begin processing gas and earning revenue.
Navitas Midstream Partners, LLC is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, and develops midstream infrastructure opportunities in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Navitas is focused on existing and emerging resource plays to offer a full slate of services, from wellhead to market.
