Meet a #futureshaper: Jan Šulc
Meet a #futureshaper: Jan Šulc
He is shaping the future of flying.
When completing his internship – Jan Šulc knew he loved being a project engineer.
Now he does what he loves and works on projects he is passionate about.
Based in Olomouc, Czech Republic; here is his #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
My father runs a company that designs and manufactures plastic scale models of airplanes. During my childhood, we traveled a lot and visited convention shows, aviation museums, meeting enthusiasts historians, pilots and vets. Therefore, I have deep respect for history and a passion for aircraft engineering. So naturally, I wanted to become a pilot.
Where did you go to school? What did you study?
I studied aeronautics and astronautics at the faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague.  In my first year of my master's program, I had the chance to complete a study abroad at the Indonesian Institute of Technology in Bandung. It was an invaluable experience that helped me realize the strength and importance of cultural diversity.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
The new challenges I face everyday and hunger for continuous improvement makes me excited to go to work. I also enjoy finding opportunities for improvement, being able to ideate ways to solve problems and finally solutions.
What do you do?
I design or find the right tools and procedures for our aerospace aftermarket engineering team in Europe so we can better manage our tasks and deliver on our projects.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
People will continue increasing their demands for flexibility and speed in transportation. The demand for flexibility might be very well satisfied with affordable personal airborne transportation vehicles. These will be invented in the world of IoT and advanced navigation and control AI systems could operate in both public transport and private sector. Commercial aviation might experience a reborn of hypersonic transportation as soon as the appropriate materials and propulsion systems become affordable for massive production.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
A #futureshaper embraces change, sees a challenge as an opportunity, seeks creative solutions and fosters an enviroment of inclusivity.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I enjoy spending time outdoors on hikes with my family, burying my nose in a good fantasy or sci-fi book and playing video or board games.
