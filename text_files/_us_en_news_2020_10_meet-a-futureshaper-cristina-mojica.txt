Meet a #futureshaper: Cristina Mojica
Meet a #futureshaper: Cristina Mojica
She’s optimizing the cash position at Honeywell and around the world
Cristina Mojica combines her passion for finance with improving processes.
She counts on the diversity of people and their ideas to affect change.
Based in Atlanta, Georgia; here is her #futureshaper story.
How would you describe your work environment?
The Honeywell work environment allows you to grow. It gives you a lot of challenges, but also helps you and gives you the tools you need to succeed. In the Atlanta office, our culture is very diverse. You have age differences, ethnicity differences and people from different regions. But everyone’s really collaborative and working together. It’s a place where you see a ton of diversity but it just feels like you’re part of a team.
How is diversity making a difference?
I feel that finance has been, and still is in many companies, a very male-driven function. Honeywell is one of the few places where I’ve seen more females… and I haven’t been the only female in the room at a lot of the big board meetings. I believe promoting diversity to help advance careers is very important for minorities and women. It helps us get a seat at the table or just get in the door. It allows you to demonstrate that you’re offering a different perspective that adds value.
We’re not just taking North American people and putting them all over the place. We truly have a global team that is based in different regions and includes people from different regions. Because of that, we get a better understanding of, for example, how collections works.
Our diversity offers opportunities to improve and see how techniques from other regions can be leveraged to greater success elsewhere. For example, we’ll take what we know from the Middle East, and try those techniques on the US past due collections to see if payments can be realized.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
A Carebear
What do you do?
I help manage cash for the Honeywell Building Solutions business to ensure we collect from our customers and pay our vendors and our employees timely.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
Someone who wants to help make improvements and is willing to do the hard work to do so.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
Hiking with my dog, baking and traveling during non-COVID times.
What does diversity mean to you?
I think it is being open to different ideas and seeing the value that differences bring to a team.
How can Honeywell leverage employee networks?
I think they are a great resource to bring new hires into the company and help create supportive networks for employees. When employees feel supported and part of a group everyone benefits.
