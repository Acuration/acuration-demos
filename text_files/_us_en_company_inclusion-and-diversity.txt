Inclusion & Diversity
Inclusion
& Diversity
Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) is a foundational principle at Honeywell, both because it’s the right thing to do and because it is a fundamental enabler for our business. We actively recruit, develop and retain talent from diverse backgrounds and cultures who bring different experience, perspectives, abilities and ideas. We foster an inclusive environment in which all employees feel valued, respected and accepted.
Inclusion and Diversity is more than a commitment to us, it is the way we work.

Who We Are
From Our Leaders
“Honeywell is endlessly focused on inclusion and diversity as a foundational principle of our company and how we conduct our business. At the most basic level, this is the right thing to do but it’s also more than that. Diversity and inclusion are core to our success, now and in the future. Having diverse perspectives and an inclusive culture is critical to every piece of our business, and especially to innovation as it enables the most effective solutions to today’s biggest challenges that Honeywell is solving every day.”
Vimal Kapur, Chief Executive Officer
“From recruitment to employee experience and partnership, Honeywell fully embraces diversity and inclusion. Our culture of belonging empowers us to show up as our whole selves – allowing respect to flourish and innovation to thrive. This is how we deliver the best outcomes for our customers and make our communities stronger.”
Sandra Barbosa, Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer
Support for the Equality Act
Inclusion and diversity are essential to Honeywell’s success as a global enterprise. We support protections for LGBTQ+ individuals under the Equality Act because we believe in the importance of creating a fair work environment built on equality, respect and achievement.
Commitment to Reconciliation in Australia
In Honeywell’s third Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP), we detail our commitment to driving equal opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through increased business relationships, educational opportunities and recruiting efforts.

*As of December, 2021 unless otherwise indicated. Excludes Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) and Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) workforces. Sandia and KCNSC are U.S. Department of Energy facilities. Honeywell manages these facilities as a contract operator and does not establish or control their human resource policies. API represents Asian or Pacific Islander. Executives represents executive-band employees.
Honeywell’s 2021 EEO-1 Report (adjusted to exclude Sandia and KCNSC workforces) is available here.  The EEO-1 Report mandates the use of specific categories, definitions, and methodologies, which differ from how we organize, characterize, and manage our workforce.  We believe the representation data presented on our website above, in our ESG Data Sheet, and elsewhere in our public disclosures more accurately reflect the diversity of our global workforce and the effectiveness of our inclusion and diversity program.
