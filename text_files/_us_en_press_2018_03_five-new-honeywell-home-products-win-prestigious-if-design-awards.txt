Five New Honeywell Home Products Win Prestigious iF Design Awards For Innovation, User Design
March 8, 2018
Lyric C1 and C2 Cameras, Whole-House Humidifier, Instant Water Heater and Aqua Touch Desktop Instant-Heating Water Purifier selected from more than6,400 entries from 54 countries by independent experts
ATLANTA, March 9, 2018 — Honeywell (NYSE: HON), a leader in a broad range of solutions for Connected Homes, today announced that five of the company’s recently introduced products have won 2018 iF Design Awards in recognition of their outstanding innovation and user-focused design.
An independent jury of 63 design experts from 20 countries selected five different home awareness, home comfort and convenience products for 2018 product design awards as part of the iF International Forum (iF) Design competition. The Honeywell products were chosen from a field of more than 6,400 entries from 54 countries based on their innovation, usability, ergonomic design and design quality, as well as aesthetic and emotional appeal.
“Honeywell’sstrong design heritage began more than 60 years ago when Henry Dreyfuss designed the original Honeywell T86 Thermostat – the Round as it’s often called,” said Doug Beaudet, vice president, Global Experience Design, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “The Round had an elegance that afforded the user an intuitive operation and pleasing aesthetic that fits in with any decor. These new award-winning designs carry on that great tradition. Fast-forward more than a century –and thousands of patent and design innovations around the world – and Honeywell is continuing to give our customers elegantly designed products that are worthy of the iF design awards.”
The iF Design Award is among the most prestigious and largest design competitions in the world. Held annually since 1953, the competition attracts thousands of entries to select the world's best products for their exceptional design.
The Connected Home products that were awarded iF design awards include:
Honeywell C1 Wi-Fi Camera – for homeowners wanting to keep an eye on their home while they are away, the C1camera offers 720p HD video at 135-degree wide-angle viewing.
Honeywell C2 Wi-Fi Camera – an enhancement of the C1 camera, this device incorporates sound and motion detection, and offers a futuristic design that blends well into any home decor. Honeywell Advanced Electrode Humidifier –a whole-home humidifier that is simple to use by homeowners and can be installed and serviced quickly by professional heating, ventilation and air conditioner (HVAC) contractors. This patent-pending humidifier is the industry’s only duct-mountable solution, and its innovative and versatile design allows it to be installed in very tight quarters.
Honeywell Aqua Touch Desktop Instant-heating Water Purifier – advanced, reverse osmosis (RO) hot water purifier for consumers in China that provides purified water for feeding newborn babies, cleaning bottles, and is also very useful for instant hot tea. The purifier features a very compact and slim design that saves counter space and does not require a direct water tap connection, so it can be placed in any room in the home.
Honeywell Instant Water Heater – a simply designed water heater that accompanies Honeywell’s line of Aqua Touch under-sink water purifiers to give Chinese consumers instant hot water (max. temperature to 95‚ÑÉ). The compact and user-friendly design can fit in small places, is simple to clean and the water temperature is easily adjusted with a front-mounted knob.
