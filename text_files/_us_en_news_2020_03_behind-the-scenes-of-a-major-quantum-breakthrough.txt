Behind the Scenes of a Major Quantum Breakthrough
Behind the Scenes of a Major Quantum Breakthrough
Here’s what it means for solving the world’s toughest challenges.
It’s almost time. By the middle of 2020, we’re releasing the most powerful quantum computer yet.
Thanks to a breakthrough in technology, we’re on track to release a quantum computer with a quantum volume of at least 64, twice that of the next alternative in the industry.
We have demonstrated our quantum charge coupled device (QCCD) architecture in a scientific paper. That major technical breakthrough accelerates quantum capability.
That means the world will be able to begin undertaking problems that were impractical to tackle with traditional computers.
“There are a number of industries that will be profoundly impacted by the advancement and ultimate application of at-scale quantum computing,” said Tony Uttley, President of Honeywell Quantum Solutions.
Why our quantum computer is the most powerful
Our quantum solutions business has been at the forefront of the industry.
A team of more than 100 scientists, engineers and software developers has been working to develop quantum computers along with the algorithms to solve customers’ problems.
Quantum computers use qubits, which are quantum computing bits, to process information in a unique way that leverages the properties of quantum physics.
Our quantum computer will be the most powerful available because it will have at least double the quantum volume of alternatives. Quantum volume is a metric that considers the number, connectivity and low error rate of qubits.
And we plan to increase that volume rapidly.
J.P. Morgan Chase will use our quantum computer
J.P. Morgan Chase wants to develop new ways for quantum computing to help the financial services company support its customers.
They’re partnering with us to figure it out.
Other partnerships include two strategic investments by our venture capital fund, Honeywell Ventures, in quantum software and algorithm startups Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC) and Zapata Computing.
In addition, many industries can leverage the technology.
“Quantum computing will enable us to tackle complex scientific and business challenges, driving step-change improvements in computational power, operating costs and speed,” said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk. “Materials companies will explore new molecular structures. Transportation companies will optimize logistics. Financial institutions will need faster and more precise software applications. Pharmaceutical companies will accelerate the discovery of new drugs."
Here’s what will happen next
We will have several ways organizations can use our quantum computer.
Some enterprise partners prefer to work with us directly. Others prefer support from ecosystem companies that develop specific quantum algorithms and software based on intended use cases.
We are partnering with Microsoft as a part of the Azure Quantum offering. It allows end users will be able to make use of Azure classical computing resources while also accessing Honeywell’s quantum computer.
