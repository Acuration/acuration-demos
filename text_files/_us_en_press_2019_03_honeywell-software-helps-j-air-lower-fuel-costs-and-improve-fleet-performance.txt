Honeywell Software Helps J-Air Lower Fuel Costs And Improve Fleet Performance
Honeywell Software Helps J-Air Lower Fuel Costs And Improve Fleet Performance
March 7, 2019
TOKYO, March 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has been selected by J-Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan Airlines, to provide its GoDirect' Flight Efficiency analytics software to help the airline access detailed analyses of flight data to improve flight efficiency, reduce fuel consumption and ultimately drive better decisions that can increase the airline's profitability and on-time performance.
"Jet fuel accounts for a significant portion of an airline's operating expenses, so it's crucial for us to have an in-depth understanding of fuel consumption across all of our airlines and fleets," said Kosuke Kuroda, manager, Fuel Group, General Procurement, Japan Airlines. "With Honeywell's GoDirect Flight Efficiency software, we'll be able to make data-driven decisions that increase profits through more efficient flight routes and better visibility into operational controls that can result in increased fuel efficiency compared with what Japan Airlines is currently experiencing."
As part of the agreement, J-Air will use Honeywell's GoDirect Flight Efficiency across 32 aircraft in its Embraer E170 and E190 fleet. Japan Airlines began using the service in 2017, and with nearly 200 aircraft enrolled from J-Air and Japan Airlines combined, the airline group is now the biggest customer for Honeywell's GoDirect Flight Efficiency in Asia Pacific. The airline group can now consolidate its data to drive operational efficiencies and lower environmental impact through reduced fuel burn.
Honeywell's GoDirect Flight Efficiency is a software application that integrates seamlessly with existing aircraft components to provide clear analysis reports and real-time insights to inform fuel-saving decisions. The software's user-friendly interface and reports help pilots and flight operation crews improve flight-planning capabilities, expand their knowledge of operations and learn from previous flights. Existing users of the solution have reported fuel savings of up to 5 percent.
"There's immense pressure on airlines to find ways to make better use of their assets and increase profitability. A key focus area is fuel, which can account for over a quarter of their operating costs," said Brian Davis, vice president, Airlines, Asia Pacific, Honeywell Aerospace. "GoDirect Flight Efficiency is a part of the Honeywell GoDirect software platform, which is scalable for the smallest of regional carriers to the largest of global fleets. This is especially beneficial for airline groups like Japan Airlines that can use the service to identify fuel savings specific to smaller, regional airlines and implement larger company initiatives that improve overall operations."
GoDirect Flight Efficiency brings together Honeywell's flight-data analytics platform with its growing suite of trajectory optimization tools to help unlock savings from data-driven decision-making. The service is already used on nearly 3,000 aircraft across the globe — including those from International Airline Group, Gulf Air, Etihad Airways, KLM and Lufthansa.
Honeywell's GoDirect services platform is the industry's most complete portfolio of more than 50 value-adding and expandable aviation services that provide operators, flight crews and maintenance teams with critical information to control their services and network, which can help airlines to increase safety, efficiency and profitability.
