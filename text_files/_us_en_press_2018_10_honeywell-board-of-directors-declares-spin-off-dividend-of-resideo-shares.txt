Honeywell Board Of Directors Declares Spin-Off Dividend Of Resideo Shares
Honeywell Board Of Directors Declares Spin-Off Dividend Of Resideo Shares
October 2, 2018
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Oct. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a pro rata dividend of Resideo Technologies, Inc. common stock, to be made effective at 12:01 a.m. EDT on October 29, 2018, to Honeywell's shareowners of record as of 5:00 p.m. EDT on October 16, 2018, the record date.
Each Honeywell shareowner of record will receive a distribution of one share of Resideo common stock for every six shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Honeywell that it holds on the record date. The distribution is subject to certain conditions.
"Today's announcement marks the final phase of the portfolio transformation we announced in October of last year. The Garrett spin was completed on October 1, and Resideo is expected to be an independent, publicly traded company by the end of this month, which is earlier than anticipated," said Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk. "Once this final phase is complete, Honeywell will be more focused, with businesses that offer multiple platforms for growth and margin expansion, an even stronger balance sheet for aggressively deploying capital, and a continued focus on delivering outstanding returns for our shareowners."
Adamczyk said, "Resideo is well-positioned for future growth and success as a standalone company, with decades of experience in the home comfort and security industries, best-in-class technologies, a long-term agreement to use Honeywell's world-renowned brand, and an experienced management team focused on innovation and speed to market."
It is anticipated that when-issued trading on the New York Stock Exchange in Resideo common stock will begin on or about Monday, October 15. On Monday, October 29, Resideo common stock will begin regular-way trading on the NYSE under the symbol, "REZI."
The Resideo leadership team will host an investor conference at 9 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, Oct. 10, 2018, in New York City. A real-time audio webcast of the presentation can be accessed at www.honeywell.com/investor, where related materials will be posted prior to the presentation and a replay of the webcast will be available for 30 days following the presentation.
