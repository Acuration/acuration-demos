Honeywell Reports Eps Of $1.53, Adjusted Eps Of $1.26;  Delivers $1.5 Billion Of Operating Cash Flow
Honeywell Reports Eps Of $1.53, Adjusted Eps Of $1.26;  Delivers $1.5 Billion Of Operating Cash Flow
Delivered $500 Million of Cost Savings in the Quarter; Funded Over $250 Million of Repositioning to Drive Further Savings in Second Half and 2021
Generated $1.5 Billion of Operating Cash Flow, $1.3 Billion of Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Conversion1 of 140%; Further Strengthened Balance Sheet
Reported Record High Orders and Backlog in Safety and Productivity Solutions Driven by Triple-Digit Growth in Intelligrated and Personal Protective Equipment
Launched Numerous Innovative Healthy Offerings to Address COVID-19-Related Customer Needs
July 23, 2020
CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 24, 2020 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced results for the second quarter of 2020, which were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility.
The company reported a second-quarter sales decline of 19%, down 18% organic, operating margin contraction of 550 basis points, and segment margin contraction of 280 basis points, with adjusted earnings per share2 of $1.26.
"The second quarter was a challenging one, but we executed on the three things that will enable us to weather this downturn: aggressively managing cost, driving sales growth where demand is strong, and investing in exciting new technologies that, through careful attention to customer and end-user needs, will help keep people safe when they get back to the workplace, back to play, back to travel, and back to life," said Darius Adamczyk, chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell.
"In terms of cost management, we delivered $500 million in savings from the first phase of cost actions we announced earlier this year, and we funded over $250 million of repositioning in the quarter. In addition, we developed a second phase of cost actions that, when combined with our previously announced plan, will generate $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of cost savings during 2020. We further enhanced our financial flexibility this quarter by issuing $3 billion of bonds at attractive rates, reducing our term loan from $6 billion to $3 billion, and fully drawing the remaining balance. We ended the quarter with $15.1 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand and an overfunded pension plan,” Adamczyk said.
“We also remain focused on driving sales growth in areas that have not been as impacted by the current downturn. In the second quarter, our businesses serving the defense, warehouse automation, and personal protective equipment industries exhibited outstanding performance. Orders for Intelligrated were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up triple-digits year-over-year, positioning the business for continued growth. We committed approximately $250 million of incremental growth capital expenditures compared to our previous allocated budget for new projects to accelerate our investments in personal protective equipment, Intelligrated, and other growth areas,” Adamczyk continued. "With an exceptional, diverse portfolio of technologies that improve safety and help our customers to be more efficient, Honeywell is uniquely equipped to support our customers in the post-COVID world. We are actively investing in and introducing new solutions, such as an efficient and effective ultraviolet light cleaner for aircraft, temperature and PPE compliance monitoring solutions, technologies that can help building owners comply with new hygiene and social distancing policies, and a new pharmaceutical packaging system for bottles and vials that preserves shelf-life and drug efficacy.
“Our focus on sales, cost, and optimizing working capital, combined with our diverse portfolio and strong balance sheet, will enable Honeywell to adapt to and execute through the downturn. I am confident we will emerge well-positioned for the economic recovery to come," concluded Adamczyk.
Due to the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain and market disruptions, Honeywell previously announced that it has suspended providing full financial guidance until the economic impact of COVID-19 stabilizes. The company expects ongoing top-line challenges due to the current market conditions, particularly in the aerospace and oil and gas sectors.
Second-Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the second quarter were down 19% on a reported basis and down 18% on an organic basis. The difference between reported and organic sales primarily relates to the impact of foreign currency translation. The second-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 1 and 2.
Aerospace sales for the second quarter were down 27% on an organic basis driven by lower commercial aftermarket demand due to steep declines in flight hours, reduced volumes in commercial original equipment, and the 737 MAX impact in air transport original equipment, partially offset by continued strength in the Defense and Space business. Segment margin contracted 510 basis points to 20.8% driven by lower volumes and sales mix.
Honeywell Building Technologies sales for the second quarter were down 17% on an organic basis driven by lower demand for security, building management, and fire products, and delays in Building Solutions projects in key verticals. Segment margin expanded 50 basis points to 21.2%. Margin performance was driven by commercial excellence and productivity actions.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the second quarter were down 17% on an organic basis driven by volume declines in products, including thermal solutions and smart energy, in Process Solutions; lower gas processing projects, catalyst shipments, and licensing due to softness in the oil and gas sector in UOP; and lower automotive refrigerant volumes in Advanced Materials, partially offset by strength in specialty products. Segment margin contracted 460 basis points to 18.9% driven by the impact of lower sales volumes, partially offset by productivity actions.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the second quarter were up 1% on an organic basis driven by double-digit Intelligrated growth and demand for respiratory personal protective equipment, partially offset by lower short-cycle sales volumes in sensing and IoT, productivity products, and gas sensing. Record high bookings of $0.7 billion in PPE and $1.2 billion in Intelligrated drove orders growth up approximately 90% year-over-year. Backlog was up over 100% year-over-year, including an all-time high Intelligrated backlog of over $2 billion. Segment margin expanded 150 basis points to 13.8% driven by productivity, net of inflation, and commercial excellence.

The forward-looking statements included in this release are also subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and COVID-19 public health factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services and prices. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, and other developments, including the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward-looking statements.

This release contains financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Honeywell’s non-GAAP financial measures used in this release are as follows: segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, a measure by which we assess operating performance, which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in the Appendix; segment margin, on an overall Honeywell basis, which we define as segment profit divided by sales; organic sales growth, which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation, and acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following transaction date; free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures; adjusted free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and which we adjust to exclude the impact of separation costs related to the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett, if and as noted in the release; adjusted free cash flow conversion, which we define as adjusted free cash flow divided by net income attributable to Honeywell, excluding separation costs related to the spin-offs and the impact of the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions, if and as noted in the release; and adjusted earnings per share, which we adjust to exclude the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Refer to the Appendix attached to this release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
