Peruvian Navy Selects Honeywell Next-Generation Tracking Technology to Coordinate Search and Rescue Operations
Peruvian Navy Selects Honeywell Next-Generation Tracking Technology to Coordinate Search and Rescue Operations
Middle Earth Orbit Search and Rescue ground station system designed to improve emergency response times via satellite systems
May 6, 2021
CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 6, 2021 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced it has signed an agreement with the Peruvian Navy to enhance their search and rescue capabilities using Honeywell’s next-generation satellite tracking technology. The Navy is tasked with monitoring and performing rescue operations and track and locate important assets including downed planes and missing ships for nearly 6.3 million square kilometers of the Pacific Ocean.
Under the agreement, Honeywell will provide the armed forces branch with its Middle Earth Orbit Search and Rescue (MEOSAR) ground station system, which includes satellite antennas, rescue control systems, software and computer equipment. Honeywell will also provide installation, customization, training and technical support services. By leveraging this network of antennas and satellites, the Peruvian Navy can more precisely locate distress signals from emergency beacons.
“Our global tracking solutions help governments and emergency response teams save hundreds of lives around the globe each year, and our MEOSAR system can help the Peruvian Navy save lives by quickly identifying aircraft, ships and people in distress regardless of how remote their location is,” said Kenneth Deville, general manager of Honeywell’s Global Tracking business.
Honeywell’s technology incorporates the COSPAS-SARSAT system, an international satellite-based program for distress alert detection and information distribution. Supporting dozens of organizations worldwide, Honeywell continues to be a leader in the deployment of systems helping the COSPAS-SARSAT network.
With the MEOSAR system acquisition, the Peru Navy has Honeywell’s full global tracking technology suite which includes lower earth orbit and geostationary earth orbit ground station networks.
Honeywell’s Global Tracking business delivers reliable and affordable solutions to provide companies with greater visibility and operational control and helps governments and emergency response teams save lives. The business has more than 35 years of experience delivering end-to-end search and rescue and high-value asset tracking solutions including satellite ground stations, mission control centers, rescue coordination centers, satellite modems and airtime solutions and software.
Honeywell’s tracking technology is being used by the Greek National Search and Rescue Coordination Center and the Hellenic Coast Guard, and was incorporated into the European Space Agency's Galileo search and rescue program, a pan-European program designed to dramatically reduce emergency response times using geo-positioning satellites.
