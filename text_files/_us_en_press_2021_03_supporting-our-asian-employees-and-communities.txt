Supporting our Asian Employees and communities
Supporting our Asian Employees and communities
The following message was sent to all Honeywell employees on March 26, 2021.
March 26, 2021
Honeywell stands united in the shared outrage at the escalating anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents targeting Asian communities, including those that occurred in Atlanta, headquarters city to two of our businesses, last week. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found that anti-Asian American hate crimes reported to police rose 149% between 2019 and 2020, following the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic. We denounce anti-Asian racism as we do racism of any kind and continue the call for social and racial justice everywhere.
Within Honeywell, we have a zero-tolerance policy for racism toward any ethnicity. We are committed to maintaining an inclusive and safe working environment for all. We stand for tolerance, acceptance, inclusion, and celebration of the strength that diversity brings to society and to our company.
Listening and Taking Action
Because of recent incidents in the U.S., we are committed to hosting a series of listening sessions so leaders can hear directly from our Asian American employees over the next several weeks. SBG leaders will be sending out invitations to the upcoming listening sessions. Our goal is to ensure that all employees feel that they are respected and valued at Honeywell.
Between now and May, which is Asian Pacific Heritage Month, Honeywell will launch an Asian Employee Network to join the growing set of networks that foster camaraderie and mentorship, promote best practice sharing across the company, and advise Honeywell leaders on actions to take to make the company more inclusive. You do not have to be Asian to join this new network. Employee Networks are open to all Honeywell employees regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, and allies from different backgrounds are encouraged to join to share and learn about different perspectives. We have been pleased to see the dynamic role our networks have played in growing their membership and hosting events and activities that offer new perspectives and create shared community experiences.
Remember, if recent events are causing you personal pain or stress, you can reach out to your manager or contact our Employee Assistance Program to access resources available to you.
Please join us in standing together with our Asian communities against hate in all its ugly forms. Ahead of Stop Asian Hate rallies taking place in the U.S. and other countries this weekend, we ask that all of you continue to fully embrace our principle of Inclusion and Diversity and treat every colleague with the utmost respect every day.
Darius Adamczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Anne T. Madden, Senior Vice President and General Counsel
