The Future Is... Rooted in Environmental, Social and Governance
The Future Is... Rooted in Environmental, Social and Governance
Anne Madden, Honeywell's Senior Vice President and General Counsel, discusses the progress Honeywell is making on its environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and shares insights on executing meaningful ESG strategies.
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies enable companies to be good stewards of their communities, execute sustainability commitments and report on their progress.
That's how Honeywell views ESG: as a foundational framework for the way we do business and work to build a more sustainable future.
Honeywell's 2023 ESG Report highlights the progress we've made in the past year.
"Environmental, social and governance are all critical components of a vibrant, healthy and importantly, sustainable approach to running our company," said Senior Vice President and General Counsel Anne Madden in conversation with Laura Kelleher, our Chief Marketing Officer, on the podcast.
