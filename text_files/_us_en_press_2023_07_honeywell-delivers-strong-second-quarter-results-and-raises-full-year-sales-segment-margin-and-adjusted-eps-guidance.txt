Earnings Per Share of $2.22 and Adjusted Earnings Per Share1 of $2.23
Aerospace Reported Sales Up 15%, Organic1 Sales Up 16%, Led by Over 20% Growth in Commercial Aviation
Backlog Up 4% to a Record Level of $30.5 Billion
Operating Margin Up 270 Basis Points to 20.6%; Segment Margin1 Up 150 Basis Points to 22.4%
Announced Three Acquisitions Aligned with Strategic Portfolio Shaping Priorities
July 27, 2023
CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced results for the second quarter that met or exceeded the company's guidance. The company also raised its full-year organic1 growth, segment margin2, and adjusted EPS2 guidance ranges.
The company reported second-quarter year-over-year sales growth of 2% and organic1 sales growth of 3%, led by double-digit organic sales growth in commercial aerospace, process solutions, and UOP. Operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 20.6% and segment margin1 expanded by 150 basis points to 22.4%, with expansion in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Honeywell Building Technologies, and Aerospace. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.22, up 21% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share1 was $2.23, up 6% year over year. Operating cash flow was $1.4 billion and free cash flow1 was $1.1 billion, driven by strong net income and improved working capital.
"Honeywell performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, meeting or exceeding guidance for all metrics," said Vimal Kapur, president and chief executive officer of Honeywell. "Organic1 sales growth was underpinned by double-digit growth in our commercial aerospace, process solutions, and UOP businesses. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in commercial aerospace, and strength in our overall Aerospace portfolio continues to support Honeywell's short-term and long-term growth outlook. Our backlog remains at a record level, ending the second quarter at $30.5 billion, up 4% year over year. Our continued focus on commercial excellence enabled us to remain ahead of the inflation curve and expand margins beyond the high end of our guidance range. These operational efforts enabled us to grow adjusted earnings per share1 6% year over year to $2.23 despite a 15-cent non-cash pension headwind. Our strong balance sheet allowed us to execute on our capital deployment strategy with meaningful portfolio updates, deploying $2.1 billion in the quarter to dividends, M&A, share repurchases, and high-return capex. We invested in multiple new technologies and adjacencies utilizing our robust M&A playbook, including completing our acquisition of Compressor Controls Corporation for approximately $700 million."
Kapur continued, "Honeywell's Accelerator operating system continues to drive outstanding results and maximize shareowner value as we navigate a challenging macro environment. This operating system, along with continued growth in our key end markets and our technologically differentiated portfolio of solutions, is enabling us to raise our full-year 2023 guidance."
As a result of the company's second-quarter performance and management's outlook for the remainder of the year, Honeywell raised its full-year sales, segment margin2, and adjusted earnings per share2,3 guidance. Full-year sales are now expected to be $36.7 billion to $37.3 billion with organic1 sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%. Segment margin2 is now expected to be in the range of 22.4% to 22.6%, with segment margin expansion2 of 70 to 90 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share2,3 is now expected to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.25, up 5 cents on the low end from the prior guidance range. Operating cash flow is still expected to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. Free cash flow1 is still expected to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion, or $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion excluding the net impact of settlements signed in the fourth quarter of 2022. A summary of the company's full-year guidance changes can be found in Table 1.
Second-Quarter Performance
Honeywell sales for the second quarter were up 2% year over year on a reported basis and 3% year over year on an organic1 basis. The second-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.
Aerospace sales for the second quarter were up 16% year over year on an organic1 basis, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth, led by sustained strength in commercial aviation. Commercial aftermarket demand remained strong as flight hours continued to recover in air transport, enabling commercial aviation aftermarket sales growth of over 25%. Commercial original equipment sales grew approximately 15% year over year in the quarter. Defense and space sales grew for a second consecutive quarter as we worked through our robust backlog. Segment margin expanded 120 basis points to 27.7%, driven by commercial excellence and higher volume leverage partially offset by cost inflation.
Honeywell Building Technologies sales for the second quarter were flat on an organic1 basis year over year. Building solutions grew 2% organically as a result of continued growth in services. Building products sales declined 1% organically as growth in our fire offerings was offset by softer volumes in security and building management systems. Segment margin expanded 200 basis points to 25.5% due to commercial excellence and productivity actions, partially offset by cost inflation.
Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the second quarter were up 7% on an organic1 basis year over year. HPS sales grew 11% organically, with strength in projects and in lifecycle solutions and services. UOP grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter, up 11% organically as a result of continued strength in gas processing solutions and refining catalyst shipments. In advanced materials, growth in fluorine products was offset by expected softness in electronic materials, leading to flat organic growth in the quarter. Segment margin contracted 60 basis points to 21.7% as favorable price / cost was more than offset by challenges in advanced materials, including lower volumes and the previously communicated disruption in one of our plants.
Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the second quarter decreased 21% on an organic1 basis year over year. Sales declines were led by lower volumes in productivity solutions and services and warehouse and workflow solutions, which continues to be impacted by softness in the warehouse automation market despite double-digit growth in the aftermarket services business. Segment margin expanded 410 basis points year over year to 16.7%, driven by productivity actions and commercial excellence, partially offset by lower volume leverage and cost inflation.

2Segment margin and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

We therefore, do not present a guidance range, or a reconciliation to, the nearest GAAP financial measures of operating margin or EPS.
3Adjusted EPS and adjusted EPS V% guidance excludes items identified in the non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted EPS at the end of this release, and any potential future one-time items that we cannot reliably predict or estimate such as pension mark-to-market.
