July 9, 2018
Pilz to assume broad responsibilities for integrated supply chain, including procurement; will build on HOS Gold foundation to drive operations and working capital improvements
Pilz comes to Honeywell with two decades of operations and supply chain experience from firms such as SpaceX, Amazon, Henkel and Clariant
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., July 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Torsten Pilz has been named Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer. Pilz will report to Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk and serve as a Company Officer. He most recently served as Vice President, Supply Chain, for SpaceX and, prior to that, was Vice President, Worldwide Operations, for Amazon.
While leading in a newly created position for Honeywell, Pilz will assume broad responsibilities for the integrated supply chain, including procurement, and will drive improvements in plant efficiency and working capital while continuing to enhance quality and delivery to customers' expectations.
"The integrated supply chain is a critical enabling factor for Honeywell's continued growth. Bringing Torsten onto our team will allow us to build on our strong HOS Gold foundation to drive further improvements in our operations and global supplier relationships to better serve our customers," Adamczyk said. "Torsten has a track record over the past two decades of driving operational improvements and delivering outstanding results for a variety of companies with complex global supply chains. He is the right person to help Honeywell continue our transformation into a premier software-industrial company by simplifying our manufacturing footprint and enhancing our ability to execute with speed and precision across our operations."
For the past one and half years, Pilz served as Vice President, Supply Chain, for SpaceX, where he was responsible for all supply chain activities, including planning, purchasing, material management and logistics. He built and developed a team that supported dozens of launches a year as well as the development and production of the Falcon and Falcon Heavy Rockets, the Dragon Spacecraft and the SpaceX' satellite program. Prior to that, Pilz served four years as Vice President, Worldwide Operations, at Amazon, where he led the execution and expansion of the global Consumables and Ultrafast eCommerce segment, including brands such as AmazonFresh, AmazonPantry, AmazonCampus and Prime Now.
Before Amazon, Pilz spent eight years at Henkel AG & Co. in a series of progressively larger roles in Germany and the U.S., culminating in his assignment as Senior Vice President, Global Operations, and Chief Executive Officer, Schwarzkopf & Henkel Production Europe GmbH, where he led global operations for the Beauty Care Division. Pilz also served as a Senior Consultant, Life Science, Consumer and Chemical Industry, at Strategy& in Germany and the U.S., and he held several progressively larger production management roles at Clariant AG Frankfurt. He earned B.S. and M.S. degrees followed by a doctorate in chemical engineering at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.
