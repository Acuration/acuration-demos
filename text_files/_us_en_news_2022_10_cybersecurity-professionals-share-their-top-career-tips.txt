Cybersecurity Professionals Share Their Top Career Tips
Cybersecurity Professionals Share Their Top Career Tips
Ever wondered what it's like to work in cybersecurity? Meet four #futureshapers who share what they do and how you can pursue a similar career path.
Cybersecurity is ever-evolving, especially as threats against industrial control systems and operational technology environments are becoming more potent and frequent.
In fact, experts at Cybersecurity Ventures predict that by 2031, a new ransomware attack on a consumer or business could occur every two seconds.
In light of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we asked #futureshapers to share what their jobs in cyber entail and how you can break into the industry.
Joshua McCray - Cybersecurity architect and engineer
Charlotte
(Pictured above)
What do you do?
I manage technologies that impact the security of digital identities – in other words, information about a person that exists online. It is our mission to ensure that any specific identity has access to the right resources within the correct time and context. I get the opportunity to contribute to exciting projects that aid in the overall goal of protecting our company from threats.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to pursue a career in cybersecurity?
Stay curious. We work in a profession that operates on a constantly evolving landscape. Possessing the skill to explore the unknown will go a long way in both your personal growth and your ability to keep pace with new threats.
Vrushali Asar - Cybersecurity architect and engineer
Atlanta
What do you do?
I work as a cybersecurity architect and engineer, dealing with informational technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity. Operational technology consists of the management of a plant, factory or other industrial facilities. OT cyberattacks are more fatal and emergency-demanded than IT incidents, and that's what drives me in working in this department.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to pursue a career in cybersecurity?
Expect to learn a lot. Just as a doctor is familiar with the existing viruses and diseases, something new can always come up. It’s the same with cybersecurity, so if you enjoy the scope of surprise and are excited about solving problems, this is a great industry for you.
To prepare, I recommend building up your experience in a broad technology field, such as software engineering, and then tailoring your expertise to cybersecurity by pursuing related certifications.
Torrance Mosley - Portfolio management director
Atlanta
What do you do?
My responsibilities include providing program and process management governance in an effort to manage the successful delivery of our global industrial cybersecurity product, services and solutions. I have the opportunity to lead programs that provide industrial cybersecurity solutions that include secure remote network access, threat detection services, provision of secure media exchange platforms, as well as anti-virus patch management.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to pursue a career in cybersecurity?
With the mechanism of cyber threats changing constantly, one has to be willing to stay connected to the vulnerabilities customers in the market face. You should be willing to adapt your delivery of cybersecurity products and service features to meet the demands of the market.
Overall, it's an interesting industry that presents continuous challenges and opportunities.  As a company's assets become more networked and digitized, there will be a greater need to secure all aspects of access to these networks and the data. A career in cybersecurity allows one to play their part in protecting or keeping "the bad guys away" from valuable business and personal data, which can be a personal motivator in your career.
Saad Shedid - Lead project engineer
Dharan, Saudi Arabia
What do you do?
I lead a team of more than 15 engineers to design solutions for our customers to help them administer enterprise cybersecurity in a simple, centralized way.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to pursue a career in cybersecurity?
Never stop learning. Read books and listen to podcasts on cybersecurity and take steps to further your learning by pursuing certifications.
A degree says that you have the foundational education, but the certification says that you have specific knowledge related to the task.
For more stories about cybersecurity, listen to this podcast episode about how operational technology cybersecurity threats have evolved, and read this guide decoding common industrial cybersecurity terms.
