The Future Is... Automation Technology at Shell
The Future Is... Automation Technology at Shell
Technology powers the future of the company
Automation and digitalization will play key roles in allowing Shell to thrive in the future, said executive Bert Natalicchio.
“We create efficiencies by providing validated data analysis and visualization to people in real time and we increase productivity,” Bert said.
Technology ensures stable and reliable operations, said Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies President Rajeev Gautam. That allows Shell to operate at peak performance.
“We're helping them run their assets even better when we're using predictive technology and the database.”
