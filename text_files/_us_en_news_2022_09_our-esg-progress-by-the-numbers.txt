Our ESG Progress: By the Numbers
Our ESG Progress: By the Numbers
ESG isn’t an initiative that starts and ends – it's the foundation on which we solve problems. See our progress so far with these highlights from our 2022 report.
From pioneering temperature control in buildings in the late 19th century to developing industrial-grade software that enables leaders to maintain and monitor critical infrastructure – tackling some of the world’s toughest challenges through innovation has been at the core of our business for more than 100 years.
Our 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report highlights the progress we’ve made so far toward meeting our corporate sustainability pledges, establishing programs to strengthen our communities and upholding the highest standards of accountability in all areas of our operations.
Here are some of the key figures we shared in this year’s report:
Greater than 90% – Amount by which Honeywell has reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas intensity since 2004
160 million – Gallons of water saved in water-stressed regions since 2013 due to more than 180 water stewardship projects conducted at Honeywell sites.
6,100 – Sustainability projects completed since 2010
70% – Approximate energy efficiency improvement since 2004

60% – Approximate amount of Honeywell’s new product research and development spending in 2021 that was directed toward ESG-oriented outcomes
10 million – Buildings worldwide that are using Honeywell solutions and services to promote healthier, more efficient environments and experiences for occupants
295 million metric tons – Amount of carbon dioxide that the use of Solstice® low-global warming potential refrigerants, aerosols, has helped avoid releasing into the atmosphere; equivalent to the potential emissions from energy used by more than 26 million homes for one year

185 million – The estimated number of vehicles that will contain the low-global warming potential refrigerant Solstice® yf (R-1234yf) to power their air conditioning systems
$2.5 million – Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education-related scholarship funds Honeywell donated this year to various community recipients. Among those programs is a $1 million gift to North Carolina’s Central Piedmont Community College to establish the Honeywell STEM Scholars Academy. This program aims to increase diversity among students enrolled in STEM curriculum at the college by providing them with scholarships, support services and career exploration opportunities.

10,000 – Approximate number of students served each year thanks to labs established by Honeywell at seven universities in Turkey, Romania, Mexico and Indonesia
$1 million – Funds Honeywell employees raised that benefitted on-the-ground aid and employee support in Ukraine
3,000 acres – Approximate amount of land Honeywell has remediated and restored over the last 18 years. Remediation projects have included transforming sites formerly owned or operated by Honeywell into productive community spots. Examples include rivers that house diverse wildlife, green spaces home to sports fields and playgrounds, shopping centers, and waterfront areas for community gatherings.
