Honeywell To Provide Cockpit Technologies For 7-Seater Lilium Jet
Honeywell To Provide Cockpit Technologies For 7-Seater Lilium Jet
Compact fly-by-wire system and avionics will help ensure smooth, comfortable, emission-free passenger air travel
June 9, 2021
PHOENIX, June 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) has been selected by Lilium to develop the 7-Seater Lilium Jet's avionics and flight control systems. The compact fly-by-wire system will act as the flight control system on the all-electric 7-Seater Lilium Jet, responsible for controlling its moveable parts, including the 36 control surfaces and ducted fans that provide its high levels of maneuverability in every stage of flight.
Honeywell, one of the first major aerospace manufacturers to create a dedicated Urban Air Mobility business unit, has designed a flight control system that draws on its decades of experience providing such systems for commercial airliners. This system, which has been tailored for the Lilium Jet's unique design, will play a crucial role in ensuring smooth, comfortable and emission-free air travel for passengers.
"The avionics and flight control computers from Honeywell will be a key element for the Lilium Jet's electronic architecture," said Yves Yemsi, chief program officer, Lilium. "Honeywell will integrate an advanced flight deck tailored for the Lilium Jet as the central interface to the pilot with a vehicle management computer and a high integrity flight controls computing platform to provide a state-of-the-art fly-by-wire solution for the Lilium Jet."
Alongside the flight control system, Honeywell is delivering the next-generation integrated avionics system, which will provide a simplified user interface for the pilot to fly the Lilium Jet. The selection of Honeywell's next-generation Urban Air Mobility avionics system is the result of ongoing collaboration between Lilium and Honeywell to converge on the specific technical requirements suitable for the Lilium Jet. The avionics system is designed to reduce training time and will support operation by a single pilot, freeing up greater passenger capacity.
"At Honeywell, we believe in the promise of the Urban Air Mobility segment, and we see its enormous potential to bring about a new age of aviation and forever transform the way we think about flight and transportation," said Stéphane Fymat, vice president and general manager of Urban Air Mobility, Honeywell. "Lilium shares that vision with us, which has enabled us to forge a fantastic relationship. We're extremely excited for our avionics to be on board the Lilium Jet, where they will help ensure not only safe operation, but also make it easier for pilots to fly and provide a more comfortable journey for those onboard."
In addition to its selection as a provider of the flight control system for the 7-Seater Lilium Jet, Honeywell is also participating in the common stock PIPE offering in connection with Lilium's SPAC transaction.
"Honeywell has a decades-long track record of developing and certifying avionics and safety systems for leading aerospace companies and has worked alongside Lilium to develop a bespoke solution for our aircraft," Yemsi said. "We are proud that Honeywell is not only joining our roster of world-class aviation partners, but also as one of our investors as we prepare to launch commercial operations in 2024."
Following Toray Industries, Aciturri and Lufthansa Aviation Training, Honeywell is the latest in a series of world-class Lilium suppliers whose technology and services have been certified in aerospace around the world for decades. It is joined by infrastructure leaders, such as the Tavistock Development Company, and Ferrovial, a leading airport operator, which have provided approximately $200 million in commitments to support the development of up to 14 vertiports in Florida.
