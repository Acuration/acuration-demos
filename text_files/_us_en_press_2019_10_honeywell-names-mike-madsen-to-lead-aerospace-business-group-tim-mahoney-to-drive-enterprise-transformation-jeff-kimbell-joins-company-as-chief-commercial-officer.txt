Madsen, 56, succeeds Tim Mahoney, who held the role for the past 10 years and has been named Senior Vice President, Enterprise Transformation. In his new position, Mahoney, 63, will have broad responsibilities for Honeywell Digital, the company's global, cross-functional digitization initiative that is driving improvements in customer service and efficiency.
Madsen and Mahoney will work closely over the coming weeks to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. Both will serve as company officers, reporting to Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk and based in Phoenix, Ariz.
Honeywell Aerospace is a technology and services leader with products and services found on virtually every commercial, defense and space aircraft in the world.

He is an extremely effective leader and change agent who is passionate about the aerospace industry and serving customers at the highest level," Adamczyk said. "Under Mike's leadership, we expect continued acceleration in our development of advanced technologies that blend hardware and software to create more fuel-efficient aircraft, more direct and on-time flights, and safer skies and airports.
"We are fortunate to have someone with Mike's level of experience and extensive exposure to our end markets ready to take the helm of Honeywell Aerospace, and equally fortunate to have the benefit of Tim's expertise and continued presence on our senior leadership team that will help ensure we transition the role comprehensively and seamlessly," Adamczyk said. "I would like to thank Tim for his multiple decades of leadership which placed Honeywell at the forefront of the aerospace industry. Tim is taking on an extremely important Enterprise Transformation role as we continue the process of digitizing and modernizing our global support functions across the board. We have a big opportunity in front of us to enhance core processes to greatly benefit our customers, employees and all Honeywell stakeholders. We have made substantial progress to date and anticipate Tim will accelerate our efforts and generate even more value."

He also led development activities on a wide range of products ranging from solar dynamic power systems to cryogenic valves, launch vehicle actuation systems and aircraft pneumatic components.
