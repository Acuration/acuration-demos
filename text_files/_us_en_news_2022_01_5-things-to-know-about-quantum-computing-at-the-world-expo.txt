5 Things to Know About Quantum Computing at the World Expo
5 Things to Know About Quantum Computing at the World Expo
The World Expo in Dubai is the first to feature quantum technology.
Since 1851, the World’s Fairs, now known as World Expos, have brought people together to innovate, collaborate and solve important problems.
The theme for this year’s World Expo, currently taking place in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, is “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future.” Quantinuum’s trapped-ion quantum computing technology, Powered by Honeywell, is one of a handful of breakthrough technologies chosen to showcase American innovation at the global event.
“Quantum computing will disrupt our world and enable us to solve critical challenges that we can’t with today’s technology," said Tony Uttley, president of Quantinuum.
Honeywell’s quantum computing division recently combined with Cambridge Quantum to form Quantinuum. Honeywell is majority owner of the new company, which aims to accelerate the development of this disruptive technology and deliver real-world, quantum solutions faster.
Here's what to know about the World Expo, quantum computing and our involvement in the global event:
1. This is the first World Expo to showcase quantum computing.
Visitors to the USA Pavilion take a 25-minute journey along a moving walkway and experience an immersive exhibit about how American ingenuity is shaping the future.  Themed “The Sky is No Longer the Limit,” the exhibit showcases the System Model H1 quantum computing technology and its potential to help humans solve problems considered too complex for classical computers.
2. Dubai is the first Middle East country to host the World Expo.
The first World’s Fair took place in London in 1851. It is held every five years and much like the Olympics, countries vie to host the event. In 2013, Dubai became the first country in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA) region selected to host a World Expo.
3. The World Expo site in Dubai covers more than 1,000 acres.
The USA Pavilion houses four buildings and is home to more than 20,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor exhibition space.
4. There are expected to be 25 million visits to the Expo during its six-month run.
More than 4 million people are expected to explore the USA Pavilion.
5. Honeywell is an official sponsor of the USA Pavilion.
The USA Pavilion is also showing some of our most advanced security and access control systems.
