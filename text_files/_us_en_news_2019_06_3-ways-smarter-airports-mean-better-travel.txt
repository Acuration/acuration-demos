3 Ways Smarter Airports Mean Better Travel
3 Ways Smarter Airports Mean Better Travel
More people are traveling than ever before – here’s how behind-the-scenes technology is transforming the journey
July 1, 2019
If you feel like airport security lines have gotten longer and baggage claim more crowded, you’re right. In 2018, global passenger traffic was up 7.4 percent per the International Air Transport Association (ATA).
No matter how busy, the goal of an airport remains the same – moving people around quickly and safely.
At any given time, a small army of personnel works to ensure a successful travel experience. That includes airport security, air traffic controllers, engineers and technicians. And so many systems are involved, including thousands of access controlled doors and cameras, tens of thousands of temperature sensors, energy meters and fire detectors along with flights information and emergency response systems.
Luckily, airports are also getting smarter. Our Honeywell NAVITAS software, uses data to enhance operations. It integrates disparate information into one system that harnesses the power of IoT connectivity in one place, in near real-time. That gives key decision makers a bird’s-eye view into everything that’s happening across airport operations.
The result: better connected data, insights and processes that ensure safe and on-time performance.
Here are some ways central intelligence at airports makes a difference:
1. Faster security
Thanks to real-time insights, airports can adjust quickly. If there’s a surge in passenger traffic, it’s easier to staff up security check points. Centralized management and control leads the integrated groundwork for helping keep airports safer, more comfortable and efficient.
2.  Safer journeys
At airports, safety is always a priority. Data from IoT-enabled security systems help facilitate quicker and more precise responses to any issues that arise through a terminal. For example, if a fire detector is activated or a security point is breached, the airport may need to be evacuated. This can be costly and logistically difficult.
Before initiating an action, the airport team must evaluate the risks by examining the area with CCTV to verify the threat, cross-correlating with other sensors (such as temperature) to validate the extent of the issue and prepare staff for a potential emergency. In the case of an evacuation, the staff are better equipped to control and orderly exit through controlled security doors.
3. More comfortable waiting
Stuck at the gate? Stay comfortable. Sensor-based IoT combined with data analytics can help monitor equipment health and performance and notify personnel of potential issues – before they threaten entire airport operations. This includes the heating and cooling equipment running so that passengers waiting at gates are always comfortable.
