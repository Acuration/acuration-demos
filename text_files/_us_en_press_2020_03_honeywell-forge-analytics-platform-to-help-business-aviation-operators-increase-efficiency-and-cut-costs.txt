March 16, 2020
ATLANTA, March 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is bringing an unprecedented level of clarity and control to business aviation flight departments with the introduction of Honeywell Forge. The data-driven analytics platform provides a full suite of mission-management capabilities in the areas of connectivity, flight operations, navigation databases and maintenance, empowering flight departments to improve operational inefficiencies.
Honeywell Forge provides business aviation customers with an easy-to-use, integrated dashboard that sends real-time alerts on connectivity issues and flight plan changes. With full visibility into their services, customers can use the platform to tap into data that helps flight departments troubleshoot and fix issues as soon as they arise. Based on these insights, Honeywell Forge can improve the passenger connectivity experience, help manage profitability and give flight departments a better understanding of their fleet.

Software enhancements will help customers oversee their entire operation, improve how they manage their fleet and reduce operational costs while improving the passenger experience.

Real-time insights and actions to address connectivity issues, changes in flight plans, navigation database availability and maintenance events — improving operational inefficiencies and ultimately lowering costs
