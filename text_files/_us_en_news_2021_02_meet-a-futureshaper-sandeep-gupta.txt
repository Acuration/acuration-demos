Meet a #futureshaper: Sandeep Gupta
Meet a #futureshaper: Sandeep Gupta
He’s making process plants more efficient.
As a child, Sandeep Gupta always wanted to be a scientist. He wanted to invent new technology that would make life simple. He dreamed about making video phones or electricity that would go uninterrupted.
Now, he is a senior manager for technology services with Honeywell UOP.
Based in Delhi, here is his #futureshaper story.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
Honeywell promotes an amazing ecosystem of knowledge management, innovation and creativity, with some of the brightest brains in the industry as our colleagues. The opportunity to learn from and share with the best and the brightest inspires me to work with Honeywell.
Did you ever imagine you would end up in the job you are now?
Honeywell has nurtured my growth from a design engineer to a technology specialist and further on to a technology leader. The company provided me a global perspective to develop my skills. Honeywell has a great performance-oriented work culture that values diversity and inclusion and allows employees to pursue a career that best fits their skills.
What do you do?
Honeywell petrochemicals and refinery technologies convert crude petroleum into clean fuels that power automobiles and aircrafts, and produce building blocks for plastics and synthetic textiles. I lead a team of technical specialists who provide petrochemicals and refinery technology solutions on commissioning, optimization, troubleshooting, turnarounds and training for Honeywell global customers.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
In the post-pandemic world, change and disruption are the new normal for legacy businesses. A #futureshaper has courage to try new opportunities even at the risk of failure, has perseverance to adapt to evolving dynamics, and has agility to pivot to new priorities.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Whatever you want to do, be passionate about doing it. Do not be afraid to think out-of-the-box and be open to trying new opportunities.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I am a die-hard aviation enthusiast. I spend my leisure hours learning about aircrafts and their engines at aviation museums, spend time on aircraft simulators, and spend long hours at airports watching those magnificent flying machines take to the air in all their glory.
