Turkey's MNG Jet Selects Honeywell Mechanical And Avionics Protection Plans
Turkey's MNG Jet Selects Honeywell Mechanical And Avionics Protection Plans
May 23, 2017
GENEVA, May 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Istanbul-based fleet management company MNG Jet has selected Honeywell (NYSE: HON) to provide its Mechanical Protection Plan and Avionics Protection Plan for the company's Bombardier Global 5000 and Challenger 605 aircraft. The plan offers owners and operators greater predictability over repair and maintenance for environmental, cabin control systems and mechanical components. This ensures that the Honeywell equipment on board, including the Mark V Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System and 36 series Auxiliary Power Unit, is protected to help enhance performance of the aircraft with minimum downtime during repairs.
Honeywell's Mechanical Protection Plan (MPP) provides aircraft management companies and other Bombardier Challenger 601, 604, 605 aircraft operators with access to rapid service and support from Honeywell-trained product experts, as well as more than 600 authorized sales and service centers worldwide. In addition to the MPP, MNG has selected the Honeywell Avionics Protection Plan (HAPP) and will gain access to the company's Exchange and Rental Program to minimize downtime and ensure its aircraft are back in the sky quickly and efficiently.
"Building on our long-term relationship with Honeywell as a channel partner and authorized service center, we can trust the company to offer an unmatched global network of customer and aftermarket support that keeps our maintenance costs within budget," said Uƒüur Kalkan, chief executive officer, MNG Jet. "Introducing MPP and HAPP policies to our Global 5000 and Bombardier Challenger 605 aircraft ensures our fleet is flight-ready and minimizes potential downtime."
"We understand that our business aviation customers have invested heavily in their environmental and cabin pressure control systems, which can be costly to maintain and repair when the unexpected happens," said Raghed Talih, aftermarket sales director, Honeywell Aerospace. "The fixed-price Mechanical Protection and Honeywell Avionics Protection Plans are designed to give operators peace of mind with predictable maintenance costs and the ability to avoid or minimize aircraft downtime and expensive repair bills."
Key Benefits of Honeywell's Fixed-Price Protection Plans
Honeywell's Mechanical Protection Plan and the Honeywell Avionics Protection Plan take the surprise out of maintenance costs and put aircraft managers and operators in control of these costs with these additional advantages:
Full coverage on repair services through Honeywell or one of its authorized service centers or dealers
Full coverage on rental units (HAPP only)
Full coverage on exchange units
24/7 aircraft-on-ground (AOG) emergency services
Multiyear contracts available with fixed escalation fee
Fixed price with an annual contract
Shipping costs covered
