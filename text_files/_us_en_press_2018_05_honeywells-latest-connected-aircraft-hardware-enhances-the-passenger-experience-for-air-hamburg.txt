Honeywell's Latest Connected Aircraft Hardware Enhances The Passenger Experience For Air Hamburg
Honeywell's Latest Connected Aircraft Hardware Enhances The Passenger Experience For Air Hamburg
May 30, 2018
GENEVA, May 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell's (NYSE: HON) GoDirect™ Router and GoDirect Access service have been selected by Air Hamburg to bring advanced cabin and passenger connectivity features to its fleet of Embraer Legacy 650 jets. Combining the GoDirect Router with GoDirect Access allows the private jet operator to manage in-flight Wi-Fi connections more easily while monitoring network access to keep a close eye on data usage and associated costs.
"The next generation of business jet travelers will be young millennial workers who expect fast and reliable connectivity as standard," said Torben Mundt, deputy director, Flight Operations, Air Hamburg. "By working with Honeywell, we can meet these expectations and get access to all kinds of data bandwidth monitoring options and services that help us improve the inflight experience, all while saving time and money."
With the smaller, more power-efficient GoDirect router, Air Hamburg can create new cost structures that make connectivity more readily available and ensure passengers can remain productive in flight. GoDirect Access offers enhanced network control to operators with monitoring options to ensure consumption charges never exceed budgets. These features can help streamline billing and eliminate the chance of operators absorbing costs that can be better met by passengers who benefit from the availability of Wi-Fi services in the cabin.
"Operating in the price-sensitive charter market means you have to strike the right balance between managing costs and providing a great passenger experience," said Stephen Alcock, senior director, B&GA Aftermarket – Europe, Honeywell Aerospace. "Previously, Air Hamburg could commit to only occasional internet availability due to cost considerations. Now, access to in-flight Wi-Fi never has to be limited, and with easier monitoring, chasing related invoices can become a thing of the past."
Introduced in March, Honeywell's GoDirect Router provides all the speed, performance and reliability of today's best routers in a package that is half the size and weight, and one-third of the price of comparable products. These features make it ideal for business jets. By enabling reliable connectivity in an easy-to-install system, the new router offers the broadest and most secure set of features available.
To learn more about the full suite of GoDirect connectivity equipment visit Honeywell at EBACE 2018, Booth #Y139 in Hall 6, Palexpo, Geneva, May 29–31.
