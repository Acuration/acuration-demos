Honeywell And Aereon To Leverage Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) For Oil And Gas
Honeywell And Aereon To Leverage Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) For Oil And Gas
January 10, 2017
HOUSTON, Jan. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) and Aereon today announced they will collaborate on solutions to help industrial customers boost the safety, efficiency and reliability of their operations by leveraging Honeywell's Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) ecosystem.
"For years, manufacturers and producers have looked for ways to solve operational problems that were believed to be unsolvable &endash; such as unplanned downtime, underperforming assets and inefficient supply chains," said Andrew Hird, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Process Solutions' Digital Transformation business. "With the capabilities of the IIoT, we can find new ways to solve those problems. A key part is the creation of an industrial ecosystem that leverages the depth of knowledge and experience of a range of equipment and service providers such as Aereon."
The INspire' ecosystem is a key part of Honeywell's Connected Plant initiative that helps manufacturers leverage the IIoT to improve the safety, efficiency and reliability of operations across a single plant or several plants across an enterprise.
Aereon is widely recognized for its innovative air emissions solutions for the complete oil and gas sector, from the wellhead to the gas station. It offers products for flare systems, enclosed combustion systems, high efficiency thermal oxidizers and vapor/gas recovery units.
"Aereon's fundamental strength is its wide array of fit-for-purpose combustion and vapor recovery products supported by in-house expertise to design, manufacture and support its field-installed base," said Mark Zyskowski, senior global vice president, Aereon. "We are pleased to be able to bring our expertise to the IIoT ecosystem that Honeywell is developing to help customers around the globe maximize value from their operations by tapping into the power of the IIoT."
Honeywell and its ecosystem partners are building a simple-to-use infrastructure that gives customers secure methods to capture and aggregate data, and apply advanced analytics. This infrastructure leverages domain knowledge from a vast and unique ecosystem of leading equipment vendors and process licensors, and allows customers to use this information to determine methods to reduce or even eliminate manufacturing upsets and inefficiencies.
With a larger, consolidated data set, manufacturers and producers can apply higher analytics for more detailed insight, scale the data as needed to meet the varied needs of single-site or enterprise-wide operations, and leverage a wider pool of data experts for monitoring and analysis.
"Honeywell's capabilities in data consolidation, cyber security and software development, combined with the deep industry knowledge of its collaborators, including Aereon, will help customers solve previously unsolvable problems," said Hird. "These problems include eliminating unplanned shutdowns, maximizing output, maintaining regulatory compliance, increasing safety and optimizing supply chain strategies."
Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Aereon is a global leader in gas/vapor combustion and recovery technologies and services and a portfolio company of Turnbridge Capital, LLC. Aereon was formed in 2012 upon the combination of Flare Industries LLC and Jordan Technologies. Aereon offers a broad product line of engineered custom and standard flare and thermal oxidizer systems, USA-EPA certified enclosed combustion systems, ignition systems and gas/vapor recovery units.
