5 Black Leaders Give Their Best Leadership Advice
5 Black Leaders Give Their Best Leadership Advice
This Black History Month and always, we’re celebrating our employees and their perspectives.
What does it take to excel as a leader?
To get inspired, we asked leaders from our Honeywell Black Employee Network to share their insights.
Netta Washington, president of Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions' gas detection business
(Pictured above)
Best leadership advice:
Act with purpose. Earlier in my career, I was unintentional in determining my next career steps. Oftentimes, I would get “tapped” to solve a problem and because of where I was in my career, I didn’t think I had the right to say no, and I saw my career span across many different functions.
One of my former bosses pulled me to the side and asked me what I wanted to do next, and for so long, I had allowed the “tap” to guide me. At that point, I realized I really didn’t know. This is when he gave me some advice that changed my career. He said to be intentional about what you want to do next and control the moves that take you there. From that point on, I continued to be “tapped,” but I regularly passed on opportunities that I felt did not lead to my ultimate goal.
Tarsha Luke, chief litigation counsel for Honeywell Aerospace, and Honeywell Black Employee Network executive committee member
Best leadership advice:
Always remain true to yourself. You want to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and know you acted with integrity. Your compassion will only make you a better leader and employee.
Robert Robinson, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Healthcare Solutions, and Honeywell Black Employee Network executive committee member
Best leadership advice:
Believe in yourself. Believe that you are worthy and believe that you can do it. I tell my daughters this all the time. You have to believe you are great.
Work hard. There are people who want the opportunity you have. You won’t regret doing your best.
Finally, develop a toughness to overcome challenges. I don’t know anybody who has succeeded who hasn’t experienced difficult times. Time and situations will test you. If you overcome the first challenge, you get a little tougher. Having the ability to act and educate under tremendous pressure is something that comes with experience.
Monta Fowlkes, senior director of sales for Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) business, and Honeywell Black Employee Network executive committee member
Best leadership advice:
Real growth comes from change, so always be open to trying something new and unfamiliar. Many of my best experiences came after I took on something entirely new and outside of my comfort zone. The opportunities are everywhere. Take them.
Darryl DeBow, US East Region program director of Projects and Automation Solutions, and Honeywell Black Employee Network executive committee member
Best leadership advice:
You don’t have to know it all or do it all to be successful. Learn your and your teammates’ capabilities and figure out how you can complement each other to win. Look for good mentors and build the level of trust in your capabilities that will turn them into sponsors.
