NEW YORK, Oct. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Garrett Motion Inc. (NYSE: GTX), a cutting-edge technology provider that enables vehicles to become safer, more connected, efficient and environmentally friendly, today marks its first day as an independent company following its successful tax-free spinoff from Honeywell.
Garrett CEO and President Olivier Rabiller led Garrett's executive leadership team in marking a new era in the more than 60-year history of the company by ringing the opening bell above the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange.
"This is a memorable milestone for a company that already celebrates more than six decades as an automotive technology pioneer, inventor and innovator," Rabiller said. "We have a robust and talented organization of world-class people, and we have established a strong position for providing differentiated technologies that are in demand.
"In leveraging our rich heritage as Honeywell Transportation Systems, we have evolved Garrett into a new dynamic and forward-thinking company. The Garrett name has been synonymous with advancing motion by revolutionizing turbocharger technology that has become foundational to modern internal combustion engines.
