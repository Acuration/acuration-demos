Rebuilding Together and Honeywell Volunteers Enrich Lives of Grove Park Residents in Atlanta
Rebuilding Together and Honeywell Volunteers Enrich Lives of Grove Park Residents in Atlanta
October 18, 2017
ATLANTA, Oct. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) volunteers and Rebuilding Together, a leading national nonprofit that rebuilds homes and communities for people in need throughout the country, today partnered to help revitalize five houses in the Grove Park neighborhood of Atlanta.
During the day-long event, 50 Honeywell volunteers made critical home repairs and improvements, including painting and stabilizing iron railings, removing debris, weatherizing doors and windows, and other renovations in the homes.
The effort is part of a community service initiative with Rebuilding Together's Atlanta affiliate, which coordinated the project, and Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the company's corporate citizenship initiative, which provided $50,000 in funding.
"We need to ensure long-term residents of the Grove Park neighborhood are not displaced by investors," said Caroline Blakely, President and CEO of Rebuilding Together. "Through Honeywell's support, we can provide homeowners with the critical repairs they need to maintain their homes and help them age in place."
"We are excited to take on our first project with Rebuilding Together Atlanta, less than five miles from our new Midtown Atlanta offices," said Anne Folk, Vice President, Human Resources and Communications, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. "Helping these homeowners live safely in their homes is rewarding work."
