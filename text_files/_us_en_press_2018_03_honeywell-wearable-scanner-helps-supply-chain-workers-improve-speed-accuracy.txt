New Honeywell Wearable Scanner Helps Supply Chain Workers Improve Speed and Accuracy
March 22, 2018
FORT MILL, S.C., March 12, 2018 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced its new smart, wearable scanner, which helps supply chain workers complete their high-volume tasks more efficiently and ergonomically. The 8680i Smart Wearable is a compact, high-performance and hands-free cordless scanner that helps improve efficiency and productivity for scan-intensive tasks. By eliminating the need to pick up a handheld scanner, scan the item and then set the scanner down, the smart wearable helps improve workers' scanning times by approximately five seconds per typical transaction.“To keep up with increasing pressure for fast, accurate order fulfillment, distribution centers need to streamline high-volume workflows and provide their workers with ergonomic data-capture solutions,” said Stan Zywicki, general manager of scanning and printing for Honeywell's Productivity Products business. “The 8680i Smart Wearable is an always-on, connected solution that allows for hands-free operation in areas where workers need to be able to complete tasks without having to hold a device.” The lightweight, Bluetooth TM-enabled device is worn on one hand and provides workers with ergonomic scanning and a clear display of information such as battery status and scan results. The 8680i is available in an advanced model, which offers Wi-Fi connectivity, customizable workflow instructions on the user-facing display and a two-button interface. This advanced model enables streamlined workflows with a single device to eliminate the need for both a scanner and mobile computer combination. A standard model is also available for use as a simpler, ergonomic Bluetooth-enabled scanner, which pairs with another device for more complex workflows. The 8680i helps warehouses and distribution centers increase speed and accuracy by streamlining high-volume workflows such as picking, sorting, put-away and packing.“Ergonomics and comfort are extremely important to distribution center workers,” said Zywicki. “To keep workers safe and healthy, we designed this scanner to be up to 17 percent lighter than competing wearable solutions.” Designed for a rugged industrial work environment, the wearable scanner can withstand 2,000 half-meter tumbles. Customers can choose from two different wearable form factors: a two-finger ring or a cut-resistant glove.
