Remembering George Paz, Honeywell Board Member
Remembering George Paz, Honeywell Board Member
October 26, 2022
In December 2008, George Paz was elected to the Honeywell Board of Directors. Mr. Paz had a long and successful career spanning multiple leadership positions, including President, CEO and Chairman of the Board at Express Scripts Holding Company, a pharmacy benefit management company. We were greatly saddened to learn that Mr. Paz passed away at the age of 67.
Over his 14 years of service to the Honeywell board, Mr. Paz served as the chair of the audit committee and as a member of two committees: corporate governance and responsibility and management development and compensation. Mr. Paz brought to the Honeywell board invaluable insights and contributions. His broad management and finance experience included corporate finance, insurance and risk management, mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, government regulation, cyber security, and employee health benefits.
George understood the importance of diversity and inclusion in the world and in the workplace.  As a Hispanic business leader, he deeply understood the importance of giving back as a mentor and role model. George recently shared his journey and insights with our employees during Hispanic Heritage month.
George was a courageous leader, wise businessman, and considerate friend and will be missed by all of us who had the great fortune to know him. Our heartfelt and deepest condolences are with his family during this difficult time.
Scott Davis will serve as interim chair of the audit committee of the Honeywell board until his successor is named.
