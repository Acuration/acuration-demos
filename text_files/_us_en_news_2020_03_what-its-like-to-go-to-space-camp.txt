What it’s Like to Go to Space Camp
What it’s Like to Go to Space Camp
10 years, more than 3,000 kids – here’s the latest from annual blast off at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center
One perk for Honeywell employees is the opportunity for their kids to attend the U.S. Space & Rocket Center for a week of learning.
The 10th Honeywell Leadership Challenge Academy, held in Huntsville, Alabama, promoted student interest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields while building leadership skills.
The week’s activities are focused on aviation, space, and rocketry. Students built and launched model rockets with sensor payloads, guided teammates through a simulated space shuttle mission, and took a ride in a Multi-Axis Trainer like those used by Mercury program pilots in the 1950s and 1960s.
Students at this year’s camp shared their coolest moments.
