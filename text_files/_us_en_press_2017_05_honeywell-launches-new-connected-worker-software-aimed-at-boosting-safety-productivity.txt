Honeywell Launches New Connected Worker Software Aimed At Boosting Safety, Productivity
Honeywell Launches New Connected Worker Software Aimed At Boosting Safety, Productivity
May 19, 2017
FORT MILL, S.C., May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today Honeywell Sotera', a new, comprehensive safety software platform to support its growing portfolio of connected industrial worker solutions, which are designed to help customers keep their facilities and personnel safe, boost productivity, and lower compliance and administrative costs.
"Honeywell is building on its leading position in industrial safety products and solutions to develop and deploy connected worker technologies that allow customers to make workplaces safer and operations more efficient while helping companies avoid costly down-time and administrative burden," said Ken Schmidt, general manager of portable gas detection products for Honeywell Industrial Safety. "Leveraging the Honeywell Sotera platform, our connected solutions can help customers monitor the safety of their workers no matter where they are and help optimize their plant and field operations."
The Honeywell Sotera platform will support connected worker offerings such as two-way communications, geo-location and automatic safety alerts to provide employers with real-time awareness of safety incidents and the ability to respond quickly if an employee is injured in a remote location.
The first rollout of the software, Honeywell Sotera-Express, will replace legacy software applications for Honeywell's industry-leading wearable gas detector portfolio with a new, user-friendly software interface. The software will make it easier for customers using different Honeywell devices to test, maintain and generate reports.
Honeywell Sotera-Express will serve as the sole device management software for all Honeywell gas detection products, starting with its popular portable gas detector products: BW Clip, GasAlertMicroClip and Honeywell RAE Systems' ToxiRAE Pro, MultiRAE, Q RAE3 and MicroRAE gas monitors, as well as the BW IntelliDoX and RAE Systems' AutoRAE 2 docking systems used to charge, test and maintain the devices. Click here to learn more about Honeywell Sotera-Express.
The software simplifies device configuration, testing and maintenance across all Honeywell brands, and greatly streamlines compliance administration for safety managers by generating testing, certification, incident and other key reports faster. It also incorporates advanced cyber security features to protect data.
The Honeywell Sotera platform was introduced today at Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions' (SPS) Launch Event broadcast from Minneapolis, where SPS unveiled a range of connected solutions designed to increase productivity and workplace safety. These included:
Sensepoint XCL, a new state-of-the art connected gas detector for use in commercial and light-industrial applications
A new freight monitoring solution that gives logistics companies and shippers real-time information about the location and condition of shipments to avoid damage and loss
A new compliance solution for truck drivers to electronically record hours of service and vehicle inspections to meet U.S. Department of Transportation regulations
A series of rugged, portable thermal printers that field service and direct-store delivery workers use for mobile label and receipt printing
