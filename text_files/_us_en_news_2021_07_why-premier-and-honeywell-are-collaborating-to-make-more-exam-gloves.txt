Why Premier and Honeywell are Collaborating to Make More Exam Gloves
Why Premier and Honeywell are Collaborating to Make More Exam Gloves
Here’s a look at how the two companies are amping up production of the essential personal protective equipment (PPE)
Healthcare workers wear gloves constantly. With higher hospital rates and vaccinations in full swing, it’s no surprise that there’s a shortage of the blue nitrile exam gloves.
Here’s a look at how we’re solving that.
What: Premier Inc and Honeywell announced a new commercial relationship dedicated to expanding the domestic production of nitrile exam gloves. Both companies are based in Charlotte.
Why: There’s a significant shortage of exam gloves with demand exceeding production capacity by nearly 40%. This is due to global raw material scarcity, port closures and delays and increased glove usage due to increased hospitalization rates and vaccination efforts.
Where: Made in the USA.
The impact: At least 750 million domestically made nitrile exam gloves in the first year alone.
What exactly is nitrile? Nitrile is a type of synthetic rubber that is considered an alternative to latex. Gloves made from nitrile are more durable and avoid any latex allergies.
