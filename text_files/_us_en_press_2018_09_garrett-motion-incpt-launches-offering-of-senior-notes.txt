Garrett Motion Inc. Launches Offering Of Senior Notes
Garrett Motion Inc. Launches Offering Of Senior Notes
October 5, 2018
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Sept. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell International Inc. ("Honeywell") (NYSE: HON) announced that, in connection with the previously announced spin-off (the "Spin-Off") of Garrett Motion Inc. ("Garrett") from Honeywell, Garrett LX I S.√† r.l. (the "Issuer") and Garrett Borrowing LLC (the "Co-Issuer" and, together with the Issuer, the "Issuers"), wholly owned subsidiaries of Garrett, have commenced a private offering of ‚Ç¨450 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 (the "Notes"). The precise size, timing and terms of the Notes are subject to market conditions and other factors.
In connection with the Spin-Off, Garrett intends to use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under a new credit facility, to repay intercompany indebtedness to Honeywell or a subsidiary of Honeywell to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the new credit facility and the Notes offering. We anticipate that the repayment to Honeywell or a subsidiary of Honeywell will be approximately $1.628 billion.
The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by Garrett, each of Garrett's domestic subsidiaries and certain of Garrett's foreign subsidiaries. The Notes will be secured by security interests granted by the Issuer over the equity interests in a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer and an unsecured intercompany loan to an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer, which will rank as junior to the security interests granted by the Issuer in such collateral to secure the new credit facility and any other future indebtedness secured on a basis senior to the Notes.
The Notes and related guarantees will be offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and related guarantees will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes or any other security, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. Any offers of the Notes or related guarantees will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum.
