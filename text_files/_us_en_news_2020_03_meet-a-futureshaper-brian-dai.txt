Meet a #futureshaper: Brian Dai
Meet a #futureshaper: Brian Dai
He's making flying as easy as driving
March 7, 2020
Brian Dai always wanted to be an engineer just like his father, who could make and tailor everything at home.
Now as a director of engineering, he helps pilots, operators, maintenance workers and passengers stay connected at all times.
Based in Shanghai, China; here is his #futureshaper story.
What brought you to Honeywell?
Honeywell was at a campus recruitment event I attended. As fate would have it, Honeywell was my first and only employer.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
I work with a great, talented team. Plus, Honeywell gives us the opportunity to grow and be successful with the business we have in China.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
I would predict that flying a plane will be as easy as driving a car. Fixing a plane will be as quick as fixing a car. Being a passenger on a plane will be as seamless as sitting in a cab.
In your eyes, what qualities does a #futureshaper possess?
A #futureshaper is always positive, actively learning and growing, has an adaptable mindset, and the ability to embrace and celebrate changes.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Believe in yourself. Grow from all your experiences, it makes you who you are.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
I am a soccer fan, a diehard Madridista. I also really enjoy traveling a lot.
