Connected Aircraft: Embraer Jets To Fly With Honeywell's JetWave System For High-Speed Wi-Fi
Connected Aircraft: Embraer Jets To Fly With Honeywell's JetWave System For High-Speed Wi-Fi
May 22, 2017
GENEVA, May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has been selected by Embraer to upgrade its Lineage 1000E Executive Jets with the company's JetWaveTM satellite communications hardware to provide global, high-speed Wi-Fi via Inmarsat's Jet ConneX service. Whether accessing work networks, staying connected to friends and family on social media, or streaming movies, passengers will experience a new level of consistent high-speed wireless connectivity over land or sea virtually everywhere around the world at speeds similar to those found in their home.
Honeywell's JetWave system will receive initial aircraft installation certification at the beginning of 2018 that will boost Embraer's Lineage 1000E platform to provide passengers with reliable, high-speed in-flight Wi-Fi. Available as forward-fit and retrofit options, JetWave hardware enables a global Ka-band connection from Inmarsat's Jet ConneX service. With Inmarsat's global satellite coverage passengers can experience a seamless connected experience.
"Since entering the market, Embraer Executive Jets has been committed to rethinking convention in business aviation by introducing innovative technologies, higher performance standards, and premium comfort for a superior flight experience," said Luciano Castro, vice president Programs, Embraer Executive Jets. "This is just one more way that the Lineage 1000E delivers on its promise of enhancing every customer's experience."
"As passengers continue to demand consistent Wi-Fi performance in the cabin, operators and flight crews recognize the benefits of staying connected with those on the ground," said Michael Edmonds, president, Services and Connectivity, Honeywell Aerospace. "With a connected cabin and cockpit, pilots and operators can improve their workload productivity and aircraft safety, while reducing costs. For passengers and the crew, this means a smoother flight experience with fewer flight delays because the ground crews can maintain constant communication with pilots to stay connected to crew on the ground."
"Our Jet ConneX service can support multiple passengers streaming video, simultaneously, anywhere the Linage flies," said Kurt Weidemeyer, vice president, Business Aviation, Inmarsat. "It means everyone can watch what they like, when they like, where they like."
