FORT MILL, S.C., Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today it has signed an agreement to acquire a 25 percent ownership interest in FLUX Information Technology, a leading provider of warehouse management and related supply chain software in China.

The investment in FLUX is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter pending Chinese regulatory approvals.
FLUX develops and implements warehouse management systems and other software for customers in multiple industries, and is a leading player in China's booming e-commerce, apparel, pharmaceutical, retail, third-party logistics, cold chain and manufacturing sectors.

E-commerce sales currently total more than $1.3 trillion in the Asia Pacific region according to expert estimates, and sales are expected to more than double to $3 trillion by 2021.
