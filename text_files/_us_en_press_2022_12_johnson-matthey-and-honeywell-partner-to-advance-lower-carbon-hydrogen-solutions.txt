Johnson Matthey and Honeywell Partner to Advance Lower Carbon Hydrogen Solutions
Johnson Matthey and Honeywell Partner to Advance Lower Carbon Hydrogen Solutions
December 15, 2022
LONDON and DES PLAINES, Ill., Dec. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell and Johnson Matthey (JM), today announced they will work together to deploy low carbon1 hydrogen solutions. The companies will offer JM's innovative LCH™ technology, coupled with Honeywell's leading carbon capture technology to produce lower carbon intensity hydrogen (blue hydrogen) at scale. Ready to be deployed today, this offering will provide project developers a new option for producing clean hydrogen.
The demand for hydrogen solutions is on the rise with public policies and funding mechanisms being put in place to encourage investment. An example is the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which commits  billions in production tax incentives for clean hydrogen producers.
With the evolving legislative environment, an integrated solution was identified with low process carbon intensity as a key target. According to JM- Honeywell UOP calculations, the result is a solution which will enable direct process emissions to be less than 0.1 kgCO2/kgH2 by capturing carbon rates above 99%2. This provides eligibility for production tax credits within the IRA, meaning projects can access the support they need to be deployed rapidly.
This relationship also builds on the collaboration recently announced at the European Refining Technology Conference in Berlin, where JM is integrating differentiated Honeywell UOP technologies into its CLEANPACE™ offering for decarbonising existing synthesis (syngas) gas plants. Honeywell's advanced solvent carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and hydrogen solutions allow for CO2 to be captured, transported, and stored at a lower cost through greater efficiency, while allowing for smaller equipment and lower capital operational expenses needed to run the plant compared to existing technologies3.
Alberto Giovanzana, Chief Commerical Officer of Catalyst Technologies at Johnson Matthey said: "By joining complementary technology elements, we will provide customers with a cost-effective approach that will enable meaningful reductions in emissions compared to conventional technology. As we mentioned in our Strategy Review earlier in the year, Catalyst Technologies aim to expand our offering through new strategic partnerships, integrating them with adjacent technologies. This is an exciting first step and we look forward to working with Honeywell on expanding our offering to include other sustainable technologies in the fuel and chemical spaces."
"Industries need to quicken their pace to reduce their emissions in order to meet their carbon reduction targets," said Barry Glickman, vice president and general manager, Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions. "This is accelerating the demand for clean hydrogen, which is expected to grow up to sevenfold by 2050. Collaborations like the one between Honeywell and Johnson Matthey across the clean hydrogen value chain are essential to accelerating the energy transition and helping to meet global emissions goals."
Today, 15 million tons per year of CO2 is being captured and used in storage/utilization applications through Honeywell's CO2 solutions process expertise. Honeywell currently has the capacity to capture 40 million tons per year through its installed projects worldwide4.

On-steam availability percentage calculated by total hours in operation over total hours of reporting period. Calculation based on based on reliability data from the 2010 North American User Meeting feedback. 99.95% (1 shutdown/hr) achieved with a preventative maintenance project versus 99.8% (2-6 shutdowns/yr) without a preventive maintenance program.
Information based on pilot-scale test campaigns at UT-Austin pilot plant and National Carbon Capture Center using flue gas from both coal and natural gas combined cycle sources.
Includes capacity of deployed Honeywell technology (membranes and chemical & physical solvents) in installed projects enabling CO2 capture from gas streams, of which 15 million tons of the captured CO2 are being utilized for enhanced oil recovery annually.
