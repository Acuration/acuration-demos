Everyone wants you to learn and grow, so don’t be afraid to ask or share your ideas.
Be willing to learn from everyone. Being part of a team with different career and cultural backgrounds gives you a complete experience, lets you develop professionally and personally.
Aarushi Bharti, Arizona State University
University Relations (HR) Intern in Phoenix, Arizona
What is the coolest thing you worked on during your internship?
The coolest things I worked on was organizing the social activities and events for the interns. I led an intern board, who helped with planning events and programs for the other interns, and I really enjoyed working with them and implementing their unique ideas. We organized game nights, a fitness challenge, artwork event and more.
What advice do you have for future interns?
My advice for future interns would be to work with your manager to create goals during the first week of the internship. Having these goals were helpful for me to make sure I was completing the necessary tasks and I had a target to aim for.
Ian Carter, University of Florida
Finance Intern in Atlanta, Georgia
What is the coolest thing you worked on during your internship?
The coolest thing I worked on during my internship is related to assisting with the redesign of the product categorization system. This project exposed me to many departments and to many interesting people, including several CFOs. When completed, the project will improve efficiency, standardization, and financial analysis.
What advice do you have for future interns?
The biggest piece of advice I have for future interns is to not be afraid to ask questions. It can be intimidating, but asking questions is how you learn and grow. Not only will speaking up to ask your question get you the information you need, but also, it can lead to interesting and useful dialogue completely unrelated to the original question.
Alexa Entringer, University of Florida
Future Finance Leader Intern in Atlanta, Georgia
What is the coolest thing you worked on during your internship?
Currently, I am working on a forecasting model to estimate incentives for salespeople.
It results in saving time, greater productivity and improving controls, while keeping balance sheet values appropriate compared to risk which is pretty cool!
What advice do you have for future interns?
Don’t be afraid to reach out to your fellow coworkers! Everyone that I have met is more than willing to share their roles and experiences. The more Honeywell professionals you meet, the better grasp you will have on company culture and if it is a good fit.
Clare Donaher, University of Pittsburgh
Mechanical Engineering Co-op in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
What is the coolest thing you worked on during your internship?
When I get to help brainstorm designs for the next generation of products, using a 3D modeling software to build and print prototypes!
What advice do you have for future interns?
Don’t be afraid to ask questions and take initiative! Your coworkers want to help you succeed, so just trust that you’re capable and do the best you can.
Mann Goel, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur
Software Engineer Intern in Bangalore, India
What is the coolest thing you worked on during your internship?
Collecting past information from a site and then based on that, predicting how will the same parameters look like in the future based on their past trends and correlations.
What advice do you have for future interns?
Though the internship is only of two months duration, treat each day as your first day and try to learn at least one very new and innovative concept everyday that you have never even heard of at your school and try to implement it.
Harry Zorilla Soto, Utah State University
HR Pathways Intern in Des Plaines, Illinois
What is the coolest thing you worked on during your internship?
My biggest project is to build an online solution for demand estimation allowing to predict how many employees will be needed in the next 12 to 14 months. Additionally we have to find out what skills we need, what locations need them, etc.
What advice do you have for future interns?
Embrace ambiguity, change and extremely fast paced work. People here live what they preach, get familiar with Honeywell’s eight behaviors cause they are embedded in everything and everybody here.
Carolina Hernandez, Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)
Bachelors Mechanical Engineer Intern in South Bend, Indiana
What is the coolest thing you worked on during your internship?
I have been working on assembly drawings for RS-25 engine, which was used in the space shuttle in the 1970s and will be updated for a new program.
What advice do you have for future interns?
Don’t be afraid to constantly ask questions, if you are stuck or unsure of something you are working on ask the person who assigned it to you. They tend to know the answer to what you are asking or will refer you to someone who may know more about the issue.
Mariam Olupitan, North Carolina A&T State University
Launch IT Intern in Charlotte, North Carolina
What’s the coolest thing you’ve worked on during your internship?
I worked with a predictive intelligence tool that uses AI and machine learning (ML) models to automate and improve business processes. Ultimately, implementing these models will improve business processes such as auto routing incident tickets, automatically assigning assignment groups for incident tickets and discovering hidden trends and patterns in the data.
What advice do you have for future interns?
Make connections with your colleagues and utilize your resources. Honeywell employees have tons of resources at their fingertips. If you're interested in learning about a new technology, tool or even career, utilize your resources and be proactive about learning more.
