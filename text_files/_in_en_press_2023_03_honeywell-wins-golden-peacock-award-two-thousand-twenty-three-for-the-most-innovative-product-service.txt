Honeywell Wins Golden Peacock Award 2023 For The Most Innovative Product/Service
Honeywell’s innovative Ethanol to Jet fuel (ETJ) process paves the way for the country to switch to Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)
Honeywell’s ETJ processing technology uses high-performance catalysts and heat management capabilities to maximize production efficiency, resulting in a cost-effective, lower carbon intensity aviation fuel.
16 March 2023
Gurugram, March 16, 2023 – Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) today announced that Honeywell UOP India Private Limited has been awarded with the “Golden Peacock Innovative Product/Service Award” at the 30th Annual World Congress for its revolutionary Ethanol-to-jet  (ETJ) technology.  The award recognizes Honeywell’s maturity and significant achievements in promoting and innovating sustainable operations, renewable energy and cleaner fuels.
Honeywell pioneered SAF production and Honeywell ETJ process leverages more than a decade of Honeywell UOP’s Ecofining™ experience, low process carbon intensity and high yield of jet as proven by UOP’s track record in catalyst development and ability to economically scale from 30 thousand to a billion gallons per year. ETJ fuel process builds on that original innovation to support the global aviation sector’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions and meet SAF production targets with an abundant feedstock like ethanol. Depending on the type of ethanol feedstock used, jet fuel produced from Honeywell's ethanol-to-jet fuel process can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80% on a total lifecycle basis, compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. Click here to know more on the benefits
