Meet a #futureshaper: Anne Lillywhite
She's making tomorrow's aircraft
October 15, 2019
Anne Lillywhite predicts great things for the aerospace industry.
The new revolution of aerospace will be Urban Air Mobility (UAM), which will offer people revolutionary means for transport, like air taxis, she said.
Anne’s helping lead the way in the future of air travel by overseeing cockpit design.
Based in Prague, Czech Republic, here is her #futureshaper story.
What do you do?
I am leading a team of engineers who design and develop our cockpit products: Everything that you can see in an aircraft cockpit and that enables the pilot to fly the airplane.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day?
The people. My employees, my colleagues. Simply the people. I love being a manager. Engineers are passionate about aerospace, they have strong personalities and acute skills. It is an honor me to be their leader. And every day something makes me happy, whether it is solving an issue, passing a project gate, welcoming a new employee or scratching my head to understand what they have in mind.
What do you wish people knew about Honeywell?
We are leaders in technologies for aerospace, buildings, cities and plants. We are an inclusive company with strong values and that we welcome new talents.
Why is the future important?
As a company, and as individuals, whether you are engineer or a parent, we have a duty to the next generations to make the world better.
How does your job make tomorrow better and safer than today?
We design and build systems for aircrafts that make them fly safer: Connected to the ground to track their position, smart flight controls to ensure stability and weather radars to predict turbulence.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper should have?
A strong passion and a vision.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Let your passion and your dreams guide you. Shoot for the moon and work hard.
What do you for fun?
Fitness classes, snowboarding and shopping with my daughters.
