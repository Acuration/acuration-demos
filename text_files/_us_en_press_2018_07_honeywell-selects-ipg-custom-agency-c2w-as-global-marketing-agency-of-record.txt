Honeywell Selects IPG Custom Agency C2W As Global Marketing Agency Of Record
July 30, 2018
Honeywell takes another step toward connecting portfolio and leveraging connectivity for customers
Integrated team will position Honeywell's connected software and products across industries and markets
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., July 30, 2018 -- Honeywell (NYSE:HON) today announced it has selected a customized team of talent and resources from a range of Interpublic Group agencies as its global agency of record. The multi-year assignment will cover brand, advertising, public relations, digital marketing, demand generation, and corporate marketing across all four of Honeywell's strategic business groups. The dedicated IPG team won the account after a competitive pitch, which included multiple globally integrated marketing firms.
Called C2W, IPG's purpose-built agency is powered by digital and B2B marketing specialist MRM//McCann, experiential agency Jack Morton, public relations and communications firm Weber Shandwick, and a range of specialist agencies from across the holding company.
“Honeywell is laser focused on solving our customers' most complex, challenging problems by leveraging our unique domain experience, software and analytics expertise, and ability to work across both physical and digital environments,” said Que Dallara, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer for Honeywell. “As a company, we wanted a more integrated and innovative approach to marketing. IPG demonstrated that they understood our ambitions, the rapid evolution of digital marketing, and how to brand a global, Fortune 100 company.”
Michael Roth, Chairman and CEO of IPG, commented, “Honeywell is a company that actively cultivates both business and technology innovation. We are excited to help this iconic brand accelerate its strategy to create cutting-edge solutions that connect and drive intelligence across its entire portfolio. C2W has the skills, creativity and insights to help Honeywell continue along its journey to become the world's leading software industrial company. We will be providing end-to-end marketing services through a new IPG strategic business unit with core services that access our best talent from across the group. It's a great example of the open architecture model we've championed at IPG for over a decade, with collaboration at its core.”
The primary focus for C2W will be to amplify Honeywell's rapidly expanding, connected, and data-rich portfolio across including key growth sectors such as aviation, buildings, supply chain, chemicals, workforce safety and oil and gas.
“Partnering with IPG to help us shape the Honeywell brand and support demand generation is a key component of the marketing transformation effort that we began last year,” said Caroline Pan, Honeywell Vice President for Global Marketing. “Honeywell is not just a leading industrial company, we're a world-class technology powerhouse. From aircraft navigation to building management to cybersecurity, we've invented solutions that have made the world a smarter, safer, more sustainable place. We believe IPG is the ideal partner to enable us to better communicate our value to customers and leverage best-in-class marketing techniques and technologies to significantly accelerate revenue and growth.”
