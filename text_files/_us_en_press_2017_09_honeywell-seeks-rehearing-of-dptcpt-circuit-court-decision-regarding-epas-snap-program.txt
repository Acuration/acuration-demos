Honeywell Seeks Rehearing of D.C. Circuit Court Decision Regarding EPA's SNAP Program
Honeywell Seeks Rehearing of D.C. Circuit Court Decision Regarding EPA's SNAP Program
September 25, 2017
MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., Sept. 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell and Chemours today filed a petition for rehearing of the August D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling regarding the EPA's Significant New Alternative Policy (SNAP) program. The Court's decision ignored the original intent to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to replace ozone depleting substances with the safest alternatives for various uses. The decision undermines the innovation and private sector investment that American businesses have made to create and transition to safer alternative chemicals.
The SNAP program is instrumental in supporting American innovation, manufacturing and global competitiveness in commercializing next-generation technologies. Supported by this smart, pro-business program, American companies have invested well over $1B to invent, commercialize and build U.S. manufacturing facilities to produce hydrofluoro-olefin (HFO) solutions to replace outdated hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) products. This regulation is well supported by the law, and we are confident that when this decision is reviewed that the original intent of fostering innovation while protecting human health and the environment will be restored.
A growing coalition of industry, academia and states agrees that this regulation is in the best interest of the public, industry and the environment. In its initial decision, the Court agreed that next-generation technologies such as HFOs are better for human health and the environment. Phasing down the use of outdated HFCs is a critical step that the world is taking to radically reduce the environmental impact of refrigerants, aerosols, solvents, and blowing agents. The United States is at the forefront of developing and supplying next-generation technologies that help the global community phase down the use of HFCs. Honeywell remains committed to ensuring that the United States continues to lead in meeting global demand for these products.
