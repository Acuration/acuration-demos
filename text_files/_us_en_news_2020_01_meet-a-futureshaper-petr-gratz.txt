Meet a #futureshaper: Petr Gratz
Meet a #futureshaper: Petr Gratz
He makes sensors that help detect gas by listening for it.
Petr Gratz leads teams responsible for developing products that help make people safer and more comfortable.
As a director of engineering, he has an impact on his colleagues and the world. That includes developing navigation systems for aircraft and safety systems that save lives.
Based in Brno, Czech Republic; here is his #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I always wanted to be an engineer or researcher.
What brought you to Honeywell?
A friend of mine mentioned Honeywell was opening a new design center and asked if I would join him for their presentation. I ended up joining him and I am glad I did because this meeting led to a job offer. I ended up starting a few months later. I’ve now been here more than 16 years.
What gets you excited about going to work every day?
Seeing my team grow – I love developing the people and talent on my teams. Innovations – every day I get the opportunity to work on something cool and new.
Did you ever imagine you would end up in the job you are now?
Not really. I thought I would stay with research when I was doing my Ph.D. It wasn’t until later I realized that I really enjoyed working with people, developing them and making them successful.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
There will be more and more automation, autonomy and artificial intelligence.
What advice would you give someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Be courageous. Don’t be afraid to take intelligent risks. At Honeywell there is remarkable talent and they are willing to help and support you.
When you are not working, what do you do for fun?
Many different things – from homebrewing, roasting coffee, listening to high fidelity music, sports – and of course – enjoying time with my family and friends.
