What Kids Think Their Dads Do for Work
What Kids Think Their Dads Do for Work
For Father’s Day, we asked just what children have to say about  all those virtual meetings.
June 18, 2020
As parents continue to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, children are getting an up-close view of the real world.
From engineers to marketers, here’s what kids have to say about seeing their dads work:
Arun Veeramani, senior offering manager
(Pictured above)
Children: Surya, 7; Adhav, 5
What do your children say about your job now that they have seen you in action?
They know I am in cybersecurity and they think I protect good people and their business from “bad people” who try to attack them using the internet. They see me on calls all the time as I work from home due to the COVID-19 situation. They wear headphones and imitate me speaking to my boss or other team members.
Jonathan Wells, global customer marketing lead
Children: Jonah Raja Wells, 3; Siya Devi Wells, 1
What do your children say about your job now that they have seen you in action?
With both my wife and I working from home, it has been everything you can imagine with two little ones, but it’s been such a fun and memorable experience. What makes it so special, is the recognition from Jonah "Jo Jo” when he sees that I’m sitting on my laptop working. The first thing he says is: “Are you on a call dad?” I laugh every time, because as a #futureshaper we can all relate to being in a virtual meeting. But Jonah loves seeing it! He’s even grabbed the headset and joined in for a few laughs with colleagues. Siya “Cici” hasn’t said many words yet, but I can tell you she’s determined to work with me. She too recognizes when the laptop is open and is always eager to try and play with the keyboard.
Raúl Alarcón, senior engineering manager
Children: Dante, 2
What do your children say about your job now that they have seen you in action?
He doesn't speak much yet, but he plays with his laptop toy, simulating working, and says: “Papá, Papá, Papá...”
Srikanth Nagaraj, director of engineering
Chlidren: Vidya Srikanth, 15; Vishal Srikanth, 11
What do your children say about your job now that they have seen you in action?
They said: My dad is always very particular about his work. I kind of feel his first preference he has given in his life is Honeywell. Though he balances other aspects he is extra committed to what he does for the company. I cannot think of even a single day my dad has spent without touching his laptop or phone to check on something. My dad’s work is extraordinary and very inspiring for us to reach his level.  I’m very proud of my father for working in a company to that creates something for this world, and supporting the whole family, giving us everything we dream for.
Jonathan Harris, chief financial officer of lifecycle solutions and technologies
Children: Angel, 20; Zoe, 8; Layla, 7; Ashley, 2
What do your children say about your job now that they have seen you in action?
Angel: I always knew that he was an extremely hard worker. One thing that I absolute loved about him working from home is that he never let that stop him from tending to his kids when needed. There would be times where he had to juggle a conference call and still managed to come to our rescue when needed. If I learned nothing else from him, it was how to work in the midst of chaos. I was also able to see what it truly meant to balance work and family. ... Definitely a super dad in my eyes!
Louis Lattanzio, technical service coordinator
Children: Matthea Lattanzio, 7; Matthew Lattanzio, 5
What do your children say about your job now that they have seen you in action?
They know what I do is complex, but they love to sit in and listen to the meetings, although I try to keep them quiet. Matthea said:  I’m happy for you when you don’t have any work on Saturday and Sunday because you get to spend time with us. And I love playing Claws, Uno and Trouble with you. You’re the best daddy.
What is Claws?
I chase them around as if I am a big bear and then give them a big bear hug when I catch them, thus the name claws or bear claws.
