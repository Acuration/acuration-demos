Four New Honeywell Safety Products Win Prestigious iF Design Awards for Innovation, User Design
March 21, 2017
SMITHFIELD, R.I., March 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that four of its safety products have won 2017 iF Design Awards in recognition of their outstanding innovation and user-focused design.
An independent jury of 58 design experts selected Honeywell Industrial Safety's BW Clip4 portable gas detector, the Sensepoint XCL and XRL fixed gas detectors and the Honeywell Mad Air respirator for 2017 product design awards as part of the iF International Forum (iF) Design competition.
The Honeywell products, from among a field of more than 5,500 entries from 59 countries, won based on their innovation, usability, ergonomic design and design quality, as well as aesthetic and emotional appeal.
"Developing innovative new products has long been Honeywell's strength, but these prestigious awards show that our product design is also world-class," said John Montigny, president, Honeywell Industrial Safety, a global leader in safety technology and personal protective equipment. "These products help address real-world safety issues faced by customers, whether in a commercial, industrial or consumer setting."
The iF Design Award is among the most prestigious and largest design competitions in the world. Held annually since 1953, the competition attracts thousands of entries to select the world's best products for their exceptional design.
"The strength of these products is that they were all designed with a clear understanding of the challenges faced by the people who use them," said Rob Strong, head of design for Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS). "Our commitment to using Honeywell User Experience design principles &endash; which put customer problems at the center of the design process -- is helping us deliver new products that showcase innovation, design elegance and ease-of-use."
