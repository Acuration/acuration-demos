New Honeywell Wireless Handheld Gas Monitors Simplify Safety Reports and Field Surveys
New Honeywell Wireless Handheld Gas Monitors Simplify Safety Reports and Field Surveys
February 14, 2019
FORT MILL, S.C., Feb 13, 2018: Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has enhanced its industry-leading product line of handheld photoionization (PID) monitors by adding Bluetooth connectivity and a mobile APP to simplify the data collection process and reports creation.
The enhancements to the Honeywell RAE PID monitors allow remediation engineers and hygienists to use their smartphones to pull more information from environmental and site factors in the field and do so faster, reducing time spent at sites.“ Creating reports has always been a pain point with our customers, so we wanted to find a solution to make their life on the job easier, and Honeywell has done just that,” said Gautier Mallet, Global Product Marketing Manager at Honeywell Industrial Safety. “These professionals now can save precious hours each week not having to download data logging files from their devices and sift through personal notes to create time-consuming internal and external reports.”
Honeywell's Device Configurator Mobile APP makes the data collection intuitive, simplifying and automating the administrative process, reducing administrative burden and time spent on job sites. In addition, the data aggregated can include a greater fund of contextual information such as location, instrument traceability, comments on measurement sessions, multiple photo snapshots and more.
The enhancements will be compatible with the entire family of Honeywell RAE Systems PID monitors including MiniRAE Lite +, MiniRAE 3000 +, PpbRAE 3000 + and UltraRAE 3000 +.
