Meet a #futureshaper: Daniela Ortiz Monasterio
She's making mining smarter
October 1, 2019
Daniela Ortiz Monasterio is a firmware engineer.
That means she develops the software that makes hardware work. Hardware is the physical part of a computer or system: keyboards, screens, etc., she said. But software is a set of instructions and data that make it work.
“I code the necessary instructions for the hardware to operate as intended.”
Based in Mexico City, Mexico; here is her #futureshaper story.
When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?
Since I was a young girl, I’ve always been into sports. I practiced soccer and tennis the most. So, when I was a child, all I wanted to be when I grew up was to be a goalkeeper.
What do you do?
I’ve also worked in computer vision and machine learning projects. Computer vision is basically making a machine understand images and videos as our (human) visual perception does; machine learning is ‘teaching’ a computer how to learn and predict data.
What gets you excited about coming to work every day?
I have the opportunity to work in very different projects, so it never gets boring. Also, thanks to the different platforms that Honeywell has access to, I can take several online trainings to keep feeding my desire for new knowledge.
Why is the future important?
The future is important because it is what we will be living tomorrow and what we will be leaving to newer generations. Every day, we have the power to change the future in a positive way, we only need the right actions to do so.
How does your job make tomorrow better/safer than today?
On my firmware-related jobs, we are making buildings smarter, developing HVAC controllers with Internet Protocol.
On the computer vision-related work, we are making mining processes more efficient and green by using image processing and machine learning.
What qualities do you think a #futureshaper should have?
I think the most important quality to have is to know how to balance between your technical and soft skills and have an equilibrium between both.
If you were a fortune reader, what would you predict as the future of your industry?
I would predict it to be a smarter, more efficient and green future.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
If you really want to accomplish a goal, break it up into several small objectives; that way it will be easier for you to achieve anything you want. Sometimes the path is difficult, but be resilient and always remind yourself  that you are capable of doing anything you want, never let anyone tell you otherwise.
What do you for fun?
Play the guitar, bass and ukulele, exercise, travel, go out with my partner, friends and family.
