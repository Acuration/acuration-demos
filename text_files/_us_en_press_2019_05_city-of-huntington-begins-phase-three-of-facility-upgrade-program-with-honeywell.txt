City of Huntington Begins Phase Three of facility Upgrade Program with Honeywell; Estimated Energy and Operational Savings Totals Approximately $4.8 million
City of Huntington Begins Phase Three of facility Upgrade Program with Honeywell
May 15, 2019
Honeywell’s improvements under the project’s third phase are expected to generate approximately $112,000 in annual energy and operational savings
Under phase three, the City of Huntington aims to improve overall lighting efficiency in 14 buildings, including the Big Sandy Superstore Arena as well as HVAC efficiency at City Hall
Huntington, WV., May 16, 2019 -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) and the City of Huntington, West Virginia, today announced the third phase of a 15-year energy savings performance contract (ESPC), which in all three phases is expected to save approximately $4.8 million in total operating costs for the city.
This current phase includes a comprehensive LED lighting system upgrade aimed at improving overall energy efficiency and occupant comfort levels, all while helping to reduce maintenance frequency. The LED lighting technology will be complemented with occupancy sensors across portions of the facilities to automatically control the lighting. In addition, HVAC system improvements and a control system upgrade will be made at City Hall. The improvements under this phase are expected to generate approximately $112,000 in annual energy and operational savings.
"The upgrades and improvements we’re working on with Honeywell will improve lighting in most of our buildings and help reduce operational costs and energy consumption citywide," said Huntington Mayor Steve Williams. "We’re encouraged that work under the third phase of the project will again be supported by expected energy and operational savings. This limits taxpayer costs and the need for upfront capital investment."
The current project scope will cover 14 buildings, including: City Hall, Big Sandy Superstore Arena, Huntington Police Department, A.D. Lewis Community Center, Fairfield East Community Center, Safety Town, Centennial Fire Station No. 1, Guyandotte Fire Station No. 5, Westmoreland Fire Station No. 8, University Fire Station No. 2, John W. Gallagher Fire Station No. 10, St. Cloud Fire Station No. 4 and the Public Works Department’s Traffic Building. This phase of the contract is expected to be completed in September 2019.
The lighting system upgrade at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena in particular will create a more comfortable environment and a more welcoming facility for hosting events. It will help assist in addressing the facility’s need for more flexible lighting technology and the current challenges of accommodating different lighting scenes. The LED lighting and controls technology will enable quicker adjustments to the lighting conditions and operate more efficiently than the former system.
"We are focused on bringing energy savings and enhanced comfort levels to Huntington residents and employees through these city facility enhancements," said Wayne Kent, vice president and general manager Americas of Honeywell Building Solutions. "Project upgrades, specifically at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena, will help to attract a wider variety of events, while optimizing energy consumption and comfort levels in some of the city’s most critical facilities – including the police department and fire stations."
The first and second phases involved facility upgrades, including lighting retrofits, mechanical and controls improvements, domestic water conservation efforts, traffic signal retrofits as well as building envelope repairs.
Honeywell has successfully executed similar projects at a variety of sites, including West Virginia Housing Authority, City of Newark, Miami-Dade County and Rock Island Arsenal Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center (RIA-JMTC).
