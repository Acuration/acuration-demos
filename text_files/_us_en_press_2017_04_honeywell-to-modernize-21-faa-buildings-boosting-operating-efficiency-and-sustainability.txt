Honeywell To Modernize 21 FAA Buildings, Boosting Operating Efficiency And Sustainability
Honeywell To Modernize 21 FAA Buildings, Boosting Operating Efficiency And Sustainability
April 6, 2017
MINNEAPOLIS, April 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced a facility infrastructure modernization project at 21 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-operated facilities across the United States. The project will create 95 related jobs over the course of the program and is expected to help the FAA reduce the energy use in those facilities by nearly 10 percent.
The project will be funded through a combination of an Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies (AFFECT) Grant from the Department of Energy and a 23-year, $10.8 million energy savings performance contract (ESPC). The ESPC will enable the FAA to fund the upgrades using annual energy and operational savings guaranteed by Honeywell, eliminating the need for upfront capital investment.
Honeywell will lead work for the multi-phased, facility infrastructure upgrades to air traffic control towers (ATCT), terminal radar approach controls (TRACON) and air route traffic control centers (ARTCC) at 21 locations across the FAA's Central Service and Eastern Service areas. The project will enable the FAA to address deferred maintenance to critical building systems, reduce overall energy costs and implement renewable energy sources.
"Aging infrastructure can be crippling to an organization's annual budget and hinder its ability to meet organizational goals," said John Rajchert, president of Honeywell Building Solutions. "Our work with the FAA is a prime example of how energy savings performance contracts are a valuable tool to help customers address critical building needs without further hindering capital budgets. That's a winning solution."
The project will focus on upgrading infrastructure and industrial processes at FAA Air Traffic Control facilities to make the buildings more energy and operationally efficient. The work includes:
Installing solar panel arrays to help power FAA facilities;
Installing energy-efficient LED lighting;
Upgrading building automation systems for improved HVAC control
The project is slated to be completed by the summer of 2018 and is expected to help reduce the FAA's energy use by more than 6 million kilowatt hours per year.
Honeywell is a pioneer in the development of ESPCs and has completed approximately 6,000 guaranteed efficiency projects over the past 30 years in facilities around the world, work that is delivering more than $6 billion in energy and operational savings for customers. This includes upgrades at more than 150 government facilities.
