Honeywell Upgrades Avionics Repair Capability In Asia Pacific Region, Shortening Repair Turnaround Time By More Than 60 Percent
Honeywell Upgrades Avionics Repair Capability In Asia Pacific Region, Shortening Repair Turnaround Time By More Than 60 Percent
August 21, 2017
SHANGHAI, July 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Honeywell (NYSE: HON) Avionics (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. announced that it has recently upgraded its product repair capabilities to provide more rapid repair turnaround time, more convenient customer communication, and more effective technical support for a variety of Honeywell products, including the traffic alert and collision avoidance system and IntuVue® 3D weather radar. These services can help operators reduce maintenance time and save on cost. Honeywell's product repair upgrade further improves its aftermarket services in mainland China and improves the relationships between Honeywell and its Chinese customers.
With expansion of Honeywell Avionics Shanghai, Chinese customers do not need to transfer aircraft to Honeywell sites in America or Singapore for repair; timely technical support at home will be available immediately. On average, repair turnaround time will be reduced by more than 60 percent and the China service center will provide one-stop for services in-region. The center provides comprehensive, high-quality services to customers, allowing them to reduce the safety stocks of backup facilities and further lowering their costs.
"There are big opportunities in the region's maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) market. According to ICF International's MRO Forecast and Market Trend, the Asia Pacific MRO market is expected to nearly double to approximately $32.2 billion by 2025, at 6 percent per annum," said Brian Davis, vice president, Airlines, Asia Pacific, Honeywell Aerospace. "In the Asia Pacific region, Honeywell has seven aftermarket service sites. Honeywell is committed to improving our operating and repair capabilities to provide local customers with better support in the Asia Pacific aviation market."
Currently, Honeywell's traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) TPA100D and its RDR4000 IntuVue 3D weather radar are widely outfitted on many Boeing and Airbus fleets across the region. The TCAS system helps enhance the airborne situational awareness to ensure flight safety and efficiency, and thus reduce operational costs for airlines. The IntuVue 3D weather radar provides the most complete, accurate and intuitive view of airborne weather hazards, resulting in improved hazard avoidance and increased safety. Adverse weather costs the aerospace industry billions of dollars each year through weather-related delays, including cancellations, diversions, disasters, and turbulence. Honeywell's weather radar will help limit that. Air China, China Eastern Airlines, 9 Air and Chengdu Airlines are among the airlines that are equipped with Honeywell's IntuVue 3D weather radar.
Founded in 2005, Honeywell Avionics Shanghai is dedicated to providing leading avionics repair and support services in the domestic China market. As part of the Shanghai avionics company, the ATEC 6 Series Test Station has already been certified by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
