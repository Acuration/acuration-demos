panels you can generate your own energy you can use this power yourself directly but sometimes you generate more power than you use that surplus power goes back to the grid we call this feeding energy back at the moment you are still receiving compensation for feeding energy back but this is gradually being reduced how does this feedin work exactly how does energy feedin work when you have solar panels installed they must be connected to the grid you must inform your grid operator that you will be feeding back power if necessary the grid operator can visit you to install a suitable feedin meter in addition many grid operators will require you to register for an energy feedin via energieleverennl the exact procedure for registering varies from one grid operator to another so check with your own operator what is the energysaving scheme if you feed energy back then you will currently receive a financial compensation for this this is done via the socalled net metering scheme however from 2024 onwards the net metering arrangement will most likely disappear you will then receive an increasingly lower reimbursement for the energy that you feed back it is therefore financially more interesting to use your own generated energy as much as possible you pay nothing for the use of your own solar energy if your solar panels do not generate enough energy you pay for energy that you use from the grid so it pays to be smart with your energy moreover the electricity grid will be less burdened when more people produce and consume energy themselves how do i use my energy wisely when feeding back the energy is no longer financially advantageous it is best to use your own energy energy that you use immediately is not returned to you for example when you run your washing machine while generating solar energy you use this energy immediately to be efficient with your energy it is therefore smart to use electrical appliances as much as possible when the sun is shining by using our smart green energy products you can make the most of your own energy with the help of zappi you can charge your electric car with your own solar energy if you combine this ev charger with our
