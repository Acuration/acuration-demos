to getting involved this week is to simply observe the satellites from your garden if you can see stars where you live then you can probably see some satellites observing satellites is simple after sunset when the sky is dark go outside and turn off any outdoor lights let your eyes adjust to the darkness look at the stars you can easily tell a satellite from a star because the satellite is moving slowly sometimes it may appear to blink because it is rotating satellites will move across the sky from horizon to horizon you can see satellites in the early evening because although it is dark where you are standing there is still sunlight above you in lowearth orbit leo you can see leo satellites because they reflect light from the sun to your eyes on a typical evening with dark skies you can easily see several satellites once you see a satellite you may wonder which satellite am i seeing there are several apps and websites that show which satellites can be seen based on your
