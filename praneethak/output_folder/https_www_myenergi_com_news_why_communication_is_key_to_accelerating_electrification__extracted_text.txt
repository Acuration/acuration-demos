myenergi why communication is key to accelerating electrification home  blog  why communication is key to accelerating electrification according to the results of a new yougov survey commissioned by the national franchised dealers association nfda consumer acceptance of electric vehicles evs continues to grow 42 of respondents considered the running cost advantage of evs a significant benefit while 36 suggested that environmental credentials were a major selling point however while its clear that attitudes are changing the transition to electrification is still impacted by myths misconceptions and inaccurate information for example 62 of survey respondents still considered evs far too expensive while 54 had concerns over battery life and 57 faced reservations over charging infrastructure as a result 60 of those aged over 55 were not interested in buying an ev full stop while many other demographics would only consider purchasing if prices dropped considerably  a concerning picture indeed for the uks transition to electrification overcoming misconceptions its fair to say that these statistics dont show the whole story and the headline grabbing highlights should be taken with a fairly large pinch of salt after all according to the latest vehicle registration data from the society of motor manufacturers and traders smmt1 more than 23000 battery electric vehicles bevs and 8900 plugin hybrids phevs were sold across the uk in october 2023 alone  six times the number of diesel cars 5261 to date this year more than 260000 bevs alone have driven off dealer forecourts with the tesla model y now the fifth most popular new car in the uk the used ev market is booming too with second hand sales reaching record levels in q2 2023 and demand up 80 quarteronquarter2 so is the switch to evs faltering if anything the opposite is true however its still important to debunk some of the myths that come up time and time again in the new car purchase decision making process evs are far too expensive as europes 2035 ban on petrol and diesel new car sales looms ever closer vehicle manufacturers are quickly diverting rd spend away from their remaining icepowered models and into their nextgeneration ev lineups mercedesbenz chrysler fiat peugeot citroÃ«n jaguar volvo ford audi and volkswagen for example have already cut funding for ice models3 while almost every other oem aims to offer an exclusively electric lineup before 2030 while you may expect this investment to hit your finances hard in reality evs are far more affordable than the antielectrification crowd would have you believe after all according to the latest stats from the finance  leasing association fla more than 90 of all new cars are now bought on finance but why is this relevant well an mg zs electric hatchback would cost 26000 to purchase outright compared to 18000 for the equivalent petrol alternative while this may indeed seem remarkably high monthly leasing costs work out as 25199 and 24828 respectively per calendar month4 is the additional 371 worth it for lower running costs significant tax advantages and the added environmental benefits well we think so ev battery life is a cause for concern experts suggest that the average electric vehicle battery can last almost 20 years or 200000 miles  a significantly longer lifespan than the typical internal combustion engine and far longer than todays average length of vehicle ownership whats more while battery efficiency will eventually start to drop the average ev will lose just 2 of accessible range per year  an arguably minor decline it might sound obvious but the latest models have been designed to far outperform their petrol and diesel predecessors significant investment has been made by manufacturers into designing evermore capable vehicles to suit the needs of tomorrows drivers the uk has insufficient charging infrastructure as of october 2023 zapmaps national database reported 51516 operational ev charging points across 30360 charging locations since october 2022 more than 15800 charge points were added to the uk network at a growth of 45 yearonyear more than half of these points are registered as either fast rapid or ultrarapid with installation volumes of the latter increasing 96 annually5 in short this means that there are now far more charging locations than petrol stations 83656 but its also worth noting that an estimated 80 of all charging still takes place on the driveway7 sales of smart ev chargers such as the myenergi zappi continue to soar  with over 680000 ev charging devices now installed at homes and workplaces nationwide8 its true that charging infrastructure must continue to expand as the transition to electrification accelerates but is existing infrastructure insufficient the numbers at least suggest otherwise limited ev range makes daily driving a cause for concern with the average driver only commuting 108 miles per week and some evs now boasting ranges in excess of 300 miles range anxiety is fast becoming a term of the past granted the calculation is relatively simplistic and doesnt take into consideration factors such as the seasonal drop in battery efficiency experienced during the colder winter months but it does demonstrate that owning an ev is easier more practical and more affordable than ever before do evs have a limited range compared to their petrol and diesel counterparts its fair to say that theyre pretty much on par should range prevent you from buying an ev well only if your commute is more than 150 miles each way communication is key to debunking myths so while scaremongering is commonplace switching to electric really is the sensible option for motorists need a nippy runaround for your trips into town theres countless hatchbacks thatll suit you down to the ground need something a little bigger for motorway journeys you can now pick up an suv saloon or estate for a highly costeffective monthly price best of all zero tailpipe emissions and torque on demand  the perfect balance of performance practicality and environmentallyfriendly motoring communication therefore is more important than ever as we accelerate towards an allev car parc while we can bust myths all day long national perception is clearly different to ev reality we need to overcome this barrier and ensure drivers are given the facts  after all with so much misinformation in the market we cant expect motorists to make the transition lightly for more information about myenergi or to find out about its latest range
