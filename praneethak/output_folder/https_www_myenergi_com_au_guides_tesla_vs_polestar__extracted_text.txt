modern ev without being radically different additionally the polestar weighs around quarter of a tonne more than the tesla and is a few centimetres taller although its worth noting this isnt overly apparent on initial viewing and both models appear to be a very similarsized the clever suspension fitted to the polestar is also adjustable allowing you dial in a bit more comfort when you arent in a hurry substance over style theres one small issue though in most cars adjusting the suspension involves nothing more than pressing a button on the dashboard whereas in the polestar you need to jack the car up and physically twist a knob on the end of each of the four dampers internally both of these premium evs have opted for a minimalistic look and it really works tesla however has generated some split opinions on how minimalistic the interior has become while some praise the enormous 15in central touchscreen others find it to be a step too far functions this touchscreen really takes the tech inside the tesla to the next level with the ability to play games and even watch netflix for longdistance travelling with children this could be a big selling point the polestar however is better equipped right from the off with standard equipment including 360degree cameras blindspot indicators apple car play and android auto support handsfree trunk costs based on a typical finance quote for the polestar 2 vs tesla 3 the polestar is certainly much better value for money assuming 16000 km a year and a threeyear term the polestar would come in at just 127120 in comparison to the tesla that will set you back a hefty 166929month in a threeyear cost breakdown which factors in the depreciation insurance servicing road tax and electricity costs the pricing is much more aligned with the polestar totalling 5676482 and the tesla totalling 5608448 our verdict polestar 2 vs tesla 3 despite the longer range the tesla just isnt quite cutting it for us for day to day driving and family needs the polestar wins this battle hands down when assessing the features design and costs the polestar is much more fun to drive a smoother ride and complete with luxury features and unique design
