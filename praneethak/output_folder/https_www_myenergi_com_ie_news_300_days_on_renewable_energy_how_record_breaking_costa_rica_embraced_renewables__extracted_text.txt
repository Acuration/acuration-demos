long costa rica is a small country with a population of little over 5 million its size  in relation to the likes of the us and the uk  does make it slightly easier to ignite such impactful change over short time but this should take nothing away from costa ricas achievements in renewable energy the central american country was an early adopter of renewable energy making full use of wind turbines solar panels geothermal and hydroelectric plants the latter of which are extremely productive given costa ricas volcanic regions and rainfall statistics since 2016 costa rica has maintained that at
