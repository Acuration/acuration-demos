zappi the zappi can also alter its charging strength to be compatible with your ev and can adjust depending on grid changes to save you money can zappi be used by hybrid cars standard hybrid cars are similar to petrol or diesel engined vehicles the difference is in the engine as hybrids have a regular combustion engine and an electric motor  meaning theres no need to charge however some manufacturers are creating plugin hybrids or phevs that have more powerful batteries that can be recharged by plugging in the car the land rover phev or mitsubishi outlander phev for instance are plugin hybrids compatible with our zappi charger why does zappi have different charging modes zappi has three different types of charging mode fast eco and eco these modes give you the power to decide how quickly and economically to charge your ev fast charge on fast charge zappi prioritises time by using energy from your renewable generator and the grid eco mode on eco mode zappi becomes an intelligent device that adjusts the charge rate to minimise taking energy from the grid by only taking the energy it needs zappi is wired into your homes electrical switchboard so it can sense when excess electricity is sent to the grid eco mode when zappi is set to eco mode it detects electricity going out to the grid and turns itself on to start charging your car whilst also matching the charge rate with the amount of electricity currently being exported what evs are compatible with other myenergi products our zappi harvi and eddi are all engineered to work in harmony together  making
