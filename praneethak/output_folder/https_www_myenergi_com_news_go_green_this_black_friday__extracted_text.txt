green friday movement which has been gathering increasing momentum since its inception asking you to go green this black friday and think twice about the importance of your costcutting purchases and help to prevent unnecessary carbon emissions rather than offering tempting deals via our website we rampingup plans to unveil a seasonal campaign to celebrate local shopping in addition final preparation is underway to announce the winners of our random zaps of kindness competition which will see ev chargers donated to local heroes and hugely deserving community groups across the uk myenergis random zaps of kindness campaign jordan brompton cofounder and cmo at myenergi said every year millions of shoppers head online to grab a black friday bargain according to research firm statista consumers will spend nearly ten billion pounds in just a few days but while its an important promotional event for retailers consumers should consider the environmental impact of their purchases indeed with many shoppers simply looking to grab a bargain rather than purchasing what they really want or need black friday is quickly becoming the uks most environmentallydamaging online event instead of adding to the problem we want to go against the grain break the cycle stand up for the planet and inspire change as such were throwing our support behind the green friday movement and
