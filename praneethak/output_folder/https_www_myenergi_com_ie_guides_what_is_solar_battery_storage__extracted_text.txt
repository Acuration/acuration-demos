home  guides  what is solar battery storage solar energy is one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly ways to power your home if youre looking to reduce your energy bill and your carbon footprint then choosing solar panels for your home is the smart choice unfortunately despite the many benefits of solar energy one common worry seems to be about powering your home during cloudy days or even nighttime if were honest ireland has more cloudy days than sunny ones and you dont want to be sending your excess solar energy back to the grid only to have to use less sustainable energy when you need the lights on at night this is where solar battery storage can really save the day or night for you how does a solar energy system work with solar battery storage imagine this its a sunny day and your solar panels are gathering lots of energy for you to use to power your home in fact they are working so efficiently that theyre actually generating way more electricity than you need what happens to all that extra electricity without a solar battery storage system that extra electricity is sent back to the grid and used to power other homes even though it might sound nice to generate renewable energy that helps your neighbours to power their homes it does mean youre not getting the full benefit of your solar panels by connecting a solar battery storage system like libbi to your solar power system you can hold onto that excess energy production for your own use at night or when it rains this way you can be sure that your home continues to be powered by clean renewable energy all the time find out more the technical bit there are quite a lot of technical elements and confusing steps involved when it comes to taking energy from the sun converting it into electricity using solar panels and storing it for your personal use honestly it still blows our minds sometimes weve broken this down into 5 simpleish steps to help you understand a little more step 1 energy conversion you might have heard the term pv panels this stands for photovoltaic panels pv panels convert sunlight into direct current dc which is a term used to describe electricity which flows in one continuous direction which is great we dont want to try and send energy back to the sun after all this conversion happens when particles of light photons hit the solar panels and dislodge electrons from the atoms within the panels this then creates an electrical current step 2 inverter because the dc electricity produced by the solar panels is not suitable for most household appliances this needs to be converted into alternating current ac electricity to do this an inverter is used which causes the dc to reverse its direction up to 60 times a second at regular intervals which then creates ac just like that the energy from the sun is being converted into electricity to boil your kettle and make that perfect cup of tea its at this stage where you can choose to give away your excess electricity to the grid or to use a solar battery storage system to store the electricity to make another cup of tea when the sun isnt shining as brightly step 3 battery controller before the electricity can be stored in a battery a charge controller is used to ensure that the correct voltage and current are going from the solar panels to the battery by using a charge controller the lifespan of your battery can be maximised as it will always be charging at the correct rate this regulated electricity can then be used to charge the battery as a way of storing it for your future use during the charging process electrical energy is stored in the battery as chemical energy through a series of electrochemical reactions that might sound confusing but its very similar to the way in which all rechargeable batteries operate just on a bigger scale step 4 battery discharge sometimes the electricity generated by your solar panels might not be enough for what you need typically on very rainy days or overnight however if you charge your battery with your excess electricity then it can discharge the stored chemical energy which can be converted back into electricity so no matter how miserable it is outside you can still make a cup of tea thank goodness step 5 battery management system a battery management system bms is a crucial component of any solar battery storage system it monitors and controls the charging and discharging of the solar battery to ensure that it is always operating within safe limits the bms also works to protect the battery from any potential issues like overcharging overdischarging shortcircuiting and overheating all of which could be dangerous and will certainly impact the lifespan of your battery not only will the bms keep you and your solar battery safe it can also provide valuable information on the batterys state of charge capacity and overall health which gives you more information to make decisions about your energy usage how long will a 5kw battery last there are so many different factors that will have an impact on the amount of time your solar battery can power your home from your households daily energy consumption to the amount of solar energy generated by your panels and when you use your solar battery to how effective your bms is as a general rule an average household can be powered for between 6 and 10 hours from one battery although this can vary significantly depending on the factors listed above you can work out how long a 5kw solar battery will last you by dividing the capacity of the battery measured in kilowatthours or kwh by your average energy usage luckily also measured in kwh for example if your 5kw battery has a capacity of 20 kwh and you typically use an average of 2kwh per hour in your home your battery will last around 10 hours if you want more information you can contact us to discuss how battery storage can help you find out more rely less on the grid introducing libbi the libbi solar battery storage system is designed to help you make the most of your solar energy system with a modular design that allows you to customise your storage capacity libbi ensures that you can store as much solar power as you need libbi has been designed to integrate seamlessly with other myenergi products such as the zappi electric vehicle charger and the eddi energy diverter you can maximise the benefits of your solar energy system by storing excess power and then diverting it to charge your eclectric vehicle heat your water or other appliances when needed with an intelligent battery management system the libbi always operates at peak efficiency and has a prolonged lifespan the system provides realtime monitoring which allows you to track your energy usage battery charge and solar production all from the myenergi app giving you all the information you need to make informed decisions about your energy consumption as well as its superior performance the libbi solar battery storage system is designed with sustainability in mind the libbi utilises lithium iron phosphate batteries which are known for not only their long life cycles but also high energy density and excellent safety records thanks to its modular design the libbi system offers you the chance to upgrade your solar battery capacity as your energy needs evolve preventing waste and ensuring that you always have the exact right amount of storage for your needs find out more contact our team get in touch with us today if you have a question about any of our products 353 12 003003
