gradually in winter tip 3 is your charging cable frozen a charging cable can freeze it is therefore better to park your electric car inside during the winter is that not possible then keep the plug connection dry is your cable still frozen put a hot water bottle on the connector to defrost it make sure that the hot water bottle does not leak tip 4 carry an extra charge cable the range of an

have this problem if you leave the car on the charger overnight the battery will stay warm disadvantages of the electric car in winter in the benelux temperatures begin to drop from october and it can already get quite cold winter weather can even last into march as you may already know cars do not like the cold at all not even electric cars all cars experience greater drag in winter air becomes

your electric car will have some car models can cope with this better than others but in general every electric car suffers from this there are however a few measures you can take to increase the range below we would like to give you some tips how can i economise on the range tip 1 use as few electronics as possible when driving it is a good idea to use as few electronics as possible to reduce the load on your battery so listen to your favourite song on the radio and use the heating as little as possible tip 2 a nice and warm car have your car preheated before you leave through your charging station you can not only charge your battery but also run the heater without draining your battery power when you want to leave the battery will be full and you will have a wonderfully warm interior this will make it less necessary to turn on the heater while driving this is nice because heating requires a lot of power from your battery the range can therefore decrease when you have the heating on a lot tip 3 use seat heating seat heating is an ideal way to get comfortably warm in your electric car during the winter the advantage of heating just your seat is that it costs less energy than heating the whole car that way your battery uses less power use zappi to charge easily and safely at home share story related news see all articles more about myenergi myenergi receives a 30
