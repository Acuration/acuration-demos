myenergi meet the team jordan brompton home  blog  meet the team jordan brompton childrens author zumba instructor radio presenter mother awardwinner eco warrior jordan brompton has achieved many remarkable feats both before and since cofounding myenergi the most recent of which being collaborators of world ev day what cars 1st electric car awards a new eco office space and working with the incredible charley boorman were extremely proud of our hardworking passionate marketing director and for good reason jordan has followed and pursued her passion for renewable energy and sustainability throughout her life and continues to strive to achieve the myenergi mission to create a kinder more sustainable future for our planet jordan brompton in an ev 2016 jordan  myenergi where it all began lee sutton and jordan brompton joined forces in 2016 because they both realised they shared a mutual passion for innovation and sustainability together with their opposing strengths they had the foundation to create something special which was to be myenergi we started by buying second hand pieces of machinery because we were a start up with only 6 people to our team based in a small village in the lincolnshire wolds we then started renting a unit with very limited space and resources inventing the myenergi product family jordan and the team wanted to allow the customer to have full flexibility and control of their energy systems from anywhere in the world products in this sector were behind and dated with the evolving market this gap accelerated lee jordan and their teams vision to provide sustainable alternatives which could be easy to use easy to install and allow the customer to make large savings on utility bills in 2016 this was unheard of our products have taken the ev charger  domestic renewable energy space by storm jordan explains manufacturing in the uk and shipping over 70000 devices in only 4 years and signing up thousands of customers to their app and online forum we now employ over 90 staff and create jobs for over 900 installers in the uk alone jordan brompton lee sutton sir terry leahy bill currie and andy mckay 2017 passion for the industry this development really excited me as i knew there was a range of products with electric vehicles i had built some very strong connections in the renewable energy world and it was great to rekindle these relationships with heaps of passion and enthusiasm for the journey ahead jordan began reaching out to wholesalers distributors bloggers and early adopters and it was not long before myenergi gained momentum i have to wholeheartedly believe in what im selling and when i met lee and saw how amazing the products were i was in says jordan lee and the team are a group of people with phenomenal ideas i may have fallen into the industry but my passion and love for it told me its where i belong here we are a couple of years down the line and growing ridiculously fast i found my place and understood it very quickly it felt and still feels great to sell a product that is saving people money and is positioned within the renewable industry renewable energy jordan cares deeply about the environment and fights determinedly to create a safer more sustainable future for our planet this makes her the perfect fit to lead our green team to continue doing great things in the renewable energy industry a sector that jordan says is amazing to operate in ive made some great friends in the renewables industry everyone knows one another even globally its that tight a community she says its a sector that is doing so much good in the world which inturn attracts a certain type of person this industry wants people that are genuinely trying to make a difference innovation and dedication were in it for a long time and are always trying to innovate and foresee what the future holds in order to be ten steps ahead of the competition says our cofounder jordan the myenergi team have always worked hard to provide the very best service and products for fellow renewable energy enthusiasts and eco warriors jordan says we have a fantastic relationship with our customers and often speak with them to find out what theyre looking for were creating robust innovative and moneysaving products which means we need to know which way the market is heading before it does building the green team myenergi has gone from strength to strength in the last four years jordan describes building a team as the biggest challenge but also the most rewarding she says finding the right people and building your core team especially when growing so quickly is never easy weve been very lucky with our wonderful team the guys weve got are unbelievable lee and i look for people who are passionate hardworking loyal and up for a challenge because of the exciting nature of myenergi weve attracted the right people you can teach the skills and give people the experience but passion comes naturally thats where we as leaders have to keep the momentum when asked what surprised her the most jordan said the speed of the growth im quite an ambitious person and have always known how huge myenergi can be theres no denying that it can be one of the biggest most household names but i didnt expect it to move as quickly as it is thats been the biggest wow factor for me recently jordan and the myenergi team have built new relationships all over the globe with 2 myenergi offices in europe expanding departments and offices in the uk and external friendships forming it is enevitable that more and more people are hearing about the wonderful mission of the myenergi team one of them being the well known actor charley boorman recognised from his motoring experiences around the globe with good friend ewan mcgreggor and the long way tv series charley boorman  jordan brompton at the myenergi manufacturing warehouse the story behind the growth while jordan and our green teams seemingly limitless passion and dedication for the cause has been a huge factor in myenergis growth jordan also puts this achievement down to the increased focus on renewable energy its becoming common knowledge that we as a species have gone too far with the internet and social media theres no hiding anymore  the government cant pull the wool over our eyes when it comes to climate change people want the best for their kids futures and the change is being driven from the end customer theyve made their minds up and want change for me its a revolution an awakening of the people thats driving the businesses and policymakers creating a more sustainable future for our children 2019 has been a huge year for jordan who welcomed her beautiful baby daughter bonnie to the world in june bonnie rather fittingly timed her arrival very shortly after her fantastic mother published her first childrens book sparki and the journey to earth this book is the first in a series of stories from jordan marking the commencement of a real passion project of our cofounder its been so much fun writing it jordan said at the time of sparki and the journey to earths release ive had the idea since myenergi started the way that the stars have aligned for it just feels so right its a nice way of educating and inspiring children telling them that theyre the ones that have to make the changes moving forwards childrens book  sparki and the journi to earth the future plans have exceeded all targets we are now manufacturing in a 35000sqft facility producing over 1000 units per week and have a new bespoke factory and office being built and we are still growing rapidly we have recruited more staff from the local area trained and upskilled the workforce this is on a scale we never believed we could achieve so soon we have invested in new machinery new it systems and business structures as market leaders in the eco industry jordan is fully aware of the pressures on myenergi to stay ahead of competitors but this only drives our cofounder to continue motivating and growing our team its not easy but we try our hardest to stay true to ourselves and do what weve always done innovate and remain one step ahead of our competitors while ensuring were always honest loyal and in touch with our customers if youd like to learn more about jordan our green products and the myenergi story be sure to check out our
