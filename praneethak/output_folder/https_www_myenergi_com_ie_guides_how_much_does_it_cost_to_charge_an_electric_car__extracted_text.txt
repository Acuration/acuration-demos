it cost to charge an electric car home  guides  how much does it cost to charge an electric car ev charging at home the costs the practicalities the cost of charging any electric car at home in ireland is dependent on numerous factors some of which are continually fluctuating which makes answering this question more complex than simply answering with a dead certain number some of the key factors involved in determining the cost of electric vehicle charging are vehicle battery size vehicle weight and the type of charger used its also dependent on a households particular energy tariff and whether energy is used efficiently for example those drivers who are utilising flexible time of use tariffs such as agile octopus could be making vast savings in comparison with another driver of the same vehicle the difference in electric vehicle battery sizes based on our selection of 40 of the best selling electric vehicles available right now 54kwh is the closest representation of the current average battery size however it is worth noting another top 40 list of vehicles might generate a slightly different result the information available online generally focuses on a 60kwh battery so when typing how much does it cost to charge an electric car into google the results will be subjective to that particular size of the battery battery sizes actually range from the popular tesla model 3 which sits at the higher end of the battery scale boasting a 75kwh battery option right down to the smart eq fortwo city car which has a smaller 175kwh therefore the cost of charging your tesla compared to smart eq would be vastly different what factors affect the cost of charging an electric car at home vehicle battery size  measured in kilowatts kwh  there are 1000watts in a kilowatt  the higher the kilowatts the further the range  the larger the battery the longer it takes to fully charge  larger batteries require more energy to fully charge  smaller batteries need charging more frequently  smaller batteries are ideal for a shorter distance towncity driving  larger batteries are best for long distance commuting usage  daily miles driven  the further you drive the more kwhs you will use  the distance of your daily commute determines the frequency  stopstart journeys use more energy than constant speeds  properly maintained tires cause less friction  how you drive your vehicle affects kwhs used ie quick accelerating vehicle weight  design  lighter vehicles often use less kwhs  heavier vehicles often use more kwhs  smaller kwh batteries are usually lighter  larger kwh batteries are usually heavier  the size of the wheels and quality of the tires used  the quality of the battery and components used  the efficiency of the circuitry and heat loss  aerodynamics factors and shape the types of charger you use  ecosmart ev chargers such as the zappi can drastically lower costs  reliance on public dc chargers tends to be more expensive  you can better manage and monitor using home chargers  charging at slower rates at home is usually more costeffective  some companies offer free charging for using their services  some workplaces offer low cost or free charging  tariffs and charge rates higher or lower dependent on area fluctuating weather climate  environment  electricity tends to be more expensive in the winter than summer  wind causes more friction when driving using more kwhs  more likely to use your interior heater in cold weather  likely to use your vehicle more frequently in the winter  fluctuating temperatures can disperse extra energy quicker  hot weather might entice you to venture further  road friction from snowfall to ground temperature to surface quality energy usage  setup  the times you choose to charge eg peak timetea time  busy periods of electricity usage are usually more expensive  selfgeneration from solar or wind will lower charging costs  the type of energy tariff you are on  your energy supplier and the rates charged  flexible tariffs allow cheaper charging rates during offpeak times  devices such as eddi can help you charge using 100 green energy  the area of the country you live how much does it cost to run an electric car in ireland based on 54kwh the average cost to fully charge an electric car from empty to full is around 910 whilst the average monthly cost to keep an electric vehicle charged would be around 3600 this data is based on fully charging your ev once per week at home another advantage is that evs are also exempt from paying road tax and significantly cheaper to maintain can i save money with an ev evs are considered far cheaper than fossil fuel vehicles and electric car owners can expect to save an average of 57 per month on fuel savings alone which is a total average fuel saving of 804 per year its also handy to know electric vehicles dont require an oil  filter change during their service which costs on average another 116 a year thats a 920 saving by removing the fossilbased components and elements of the combustion engine vehicle are electric vehicles cheaper to maintain it is widely recognised that electric cars are cheaper to maintain because there are significantly less mechanical moving parts that are susceptible to wear and tear battery energy is not only clean by name but clean by nature with no more oil spills engine leakage injectors or filters clogging up the most expensive part of an ev to replace would be the battery however most manufacturers offer lengthy warranties of up to 10 years on their batteries evs on a whole are far less complex than their predecessor the combustion engine however the general mechanics such as wheels steering wheels and brakes still need servicing and maintaining equally safety features of an electric vehicle still need checking annually in the form of an mot test for which the vehicle is required to pass to be legally on the road how much does it cost to for electric vehicle charging at home electric vehicle charging at home is the easiest and most cost effective way to charge most electric vehicle owners make plugging in their vehicles as automatic as unlocking the doors when arriving home where the vehicle would always be plugged in if not in use therefore it is most common for vehicle drivers to charge at home in the evening or through the night as people arrive home from work dependent on the amount of battery used throughout the day in most cases the charge will simply top up to full capacity topping up a vehicle every night will cost on average between 140  250 per day to maintain full charge the cost to fully charge the battery from near empty which is the equivalent of running to a petrol station on an empty tank would be between 910 average  990  however these daily monthly costs could be much lower if you where utilising time of use tariff options and green energy solutions its been known whereby customers are actually paid to their charge vehicles when there is so much surplus energy on the grid what is the cost to use a public charger public charging infrastructure is currently still very much in its early though progressive stages with new companies initiatives and technology changing at a rapid pace this makes concluding even an average cost to charge using public charge points very difficult to pin point equally some of the factors that determine the cost of a charge including the vehicle battery size and the time you have to spare will influence how much you will pay at a public charge station ie you may only require to top up enough to get you home safely to be able use your own home charger however based on our own experience and research weve concluded that the average price to charge a vehicle from empty to near full at a public charging station is between 900  2300 giving us an average of 1600 this is the electric equivalent of spending 5800  7000 to fill up a tank of petrol for which you can see the drastic difference in price between the fuel types although in many cases you may wish only fill up the amount you feel is required for the journey or days ahead equally in some cases charge points often create a time limit meaning you wouldnt achieve a full charge anyway when these elements are factored in a charge in a relative sense may cost as little as 290 per session what is the cheapest way to charge an ev there are a number of ways in which you could make sure you are charging for the best prices firstly look at your current energy provider and check whether you are on the right tariff agreement for you many home owners accept the first and cheapest standard tariff quotation they receive however in order to really control and begin to utilise these tariffs wed recommend creating a myenergi account where users can use the advanced tools and features to physically set automation rules and parameters to ensure the vehicle is always charging at the cheapest prices thus making the cost to charge an electric car even cheaper standard tariffs are not always the most effective dependent on the needs of your household this is especially true for ev drivers who could be utilises new initiatives such as flexible tariffs  time of use tariffs they work by offering customers far lower prices during off peak periods such as throughout the night and early hours this also happens to be the most likely time you are charging your ev however to best utilise these tariffs and to enable you to make sure your charger only charges when the electricity prices are at there lowest wed recommend selecting an eco smart charger such as the zappi which enables you to utilise these tariffs properly one service wed highly recommend is agile octopus by octopus energy a tariff very popular amongst ev drivers another amazing feature of the zappi charger is its ability to utilise solar energy and wind energy when teamed up with existing pv systems and the eddi diverter you could indeed be charging your car with 100 free and green energy making the cost to charge an electric car even lower home charging will also lessen the need to use more expensive public chargers as for free public charge points such as supermarket chains they tend to be slower chargers and usually only go as far as compensating the journey to and from the charger itself whilst you do your weekly shopping keep a tabs on the varying prices between pay as you go public charge points as you may find some cheaper and more favourable than others wed certainly recommend a home charging for the bulk of your daily
