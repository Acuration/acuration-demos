own an ev home  guides  the best and worst uk regions to own an ev how feasible is electric car charging across the uk while the technology which powers these vehicles is everincreasing how about the accessibility of public charging stations while the majority of homeowners will purchase an athome ev charger for example the zappi that isnt an option for all houses with no allocated parking flat and apartment owners are all hindered in these situations while local authorities are starting to increase the accessibility of charging points in car parks what if youre caught short and need a topup or youre going to need to rely on public systems where are the charging stations we have taken a look at all of the uk wide charging stations available to the public to deem in order which are the best and worst uk regions to own on ev based on ability to easily charge your vehicle at public charging stations zapmap enables uk drivers to locate charging points across the uk which is extremely helpful if planning a long journey it also provides you with a route planner so you can plan accordingly using the data on zapmap we have listed the main geographical areas of the uk in order of their charging point accessibility where is the best place to own an ev the best place to own an ev in the uk is the isle of man isle of man with just 98 charging points across the island it doesnt sound like it should be the winner however due to its size and smaller population for every charging point there are just 863 people and you wont have to travel too far to find a charging point with them appearing roughly every 2 square miles london is in second place london hits us in second place which is not surprising due to its smaller area size there are over 16 charging points for every square mile it is just beaten by the isle of man however as each of these charging points will be shared by roughly 894 people closely followed by the south east south east is in third place with a total of 5220 charging points across the landmass these would be shared between an average of 1758 people however they are frequently available and even on a long journey across the southeast coast will be complete in a full charge but with charging points every nearly every square mile you will have plenty of choices to stop and top up and the south west south west it is a similar picture here to the south east with 1971 people for every charging point you will have to travel slightly further through the countryside to find a charging point but in wellpopulated areas they are not hard to find a first for northern regions of the uk scotland is 5th on the list scotland really should be higher on the list as in densely populated areas you are likely to be sharing charging points between just 1170 people which is far fewer then both the south east and southwest regions however you wouldnt want to get stranded between the loch alsh and strathpeffer as this 80 mile stretch of road has no charging points available it scores lower down our list due to its size and area you would need to travel to find a charging point outside the major cities the north east puts in a good show north east now we are starting to get into larger figures with an area size of 3317 miles² you will be sharing charging points with over 2000 people builtup areas such as newcastle and sunderland have charging points pretty much every square mile however further up in places like lindisfarne you will be hardpressed to find a charging point without a 10plus mile journey east midlands east midlands with a charging point available on average every 3 squared miles in the east midlands these will be shared between 2200 putting in firmly in 7th place yorkshire and the humber is firmly in 8th position yorkshire and the humber with an area size of nearly 6000 miles² these 2160 charging points are shared on average between 2546 people and are available on average every 3 squared miles its not looking as good for residents of the channel islands the channel islands landmass is over 76 miles² however with 7 uninhabited islands the majority of the charging points are centred around saint helier and saint peter port which are the most populated areas while searching for a charging point in these capitals will be very easy you will be sharing them with over 2100 other people if you live anywhere in jersey apart from saint helier the charging point accessibility is terrible which puts it lower down our list the small geographical area of west midlands is low down on the list west midlands is one of our smallest geographical areas but this has helped it in terms of charging point accessibility with densely populated areas such as birmingham there is a vast population sharing these 2308 charging points they are very easy to find though with birmingham housing 6 charging point within every square mile wales needs to up their game wales there are around 626000 people living rurally in wales roughly 20 of its total population these people are unlikely to have access to a charging point without a good 10plus mile journey however in cities ports and tourist areas they are more readily available still sharing one port between 2240 people puts wales further down our list largely rural east of england isnt very well equipped for ev charging the east of england covers a very large rural demographic this vast 7382 mile² space is home to some 6 million people which is twice as populated as wales for a similar landmass but it doesnt house double the amount of charging points and unfortunately in the east of england you would have to do a bit of travelling in rural parts to find a charging station which you will be sharing with over 2500 people the north west is in the penultimate worst position north west with a charging point available on average every 4 squared miles in the north west these will be shared between 2700 putting in firmly in second to the last place right at the bottom of our list is northern ireland northern ireland with just 523 charging points for 18 million people and a huge 5400 square mile space you dont want to be running low on charge out there while owning an electric car is unlikely to be feasible without a home charging point currently for pretty much any part of the uk it is still interesting to learn how well equipped your area is the stats are continuously improving too with an average of 130 new public charging points being installed across the uk every 30days your leading renewables company myenergi uk are a
