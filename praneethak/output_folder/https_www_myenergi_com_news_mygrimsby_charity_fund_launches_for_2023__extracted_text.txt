the community closer together  a cause that everyone could get behind reaching the quarter finals of the fa cup last season proved what grimsby really meant to our players and supporters in partnership with myenergi our main shirt sponsor for the second season running rolling out the mygrimsby fund will help to support the businesses that need it the most were looking forward to celebrating their successes expanding their activities and helping to create a platform for the future  a greater grimsby and a tighter community jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi added it was an absolute privilege to spearhead the mygrimsby fund in 2022 and were looking forward to accelerating its momentum this season too providing financial support to underfunded local initiatives has helped to really build a sense of teamwork collaboration and support in the local area bringing people together and helping to grow the community feel that we all know and love as proud grimbarians were committed to bringing the town closer together what makes grimsby great is the sense of pride that you get from each and every resident  we want to support this grow this and see grimsby thrive it might not be much but the mygrimsby fund is just one way that were looking to give back to the local community that we owe so much share story related news view all news about myenergi myenergi and
