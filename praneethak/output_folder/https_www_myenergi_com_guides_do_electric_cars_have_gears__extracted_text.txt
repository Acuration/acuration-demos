gears electric cars dont require a clutch unlike conventional petrol or diesel engine vehicles these combustion engine vehicles require a multi speed gearbox which dictates the level of power to the engine electric vehicles however only have the one gear you could class them as automatic vehicle as you technically do not need to change gear and therefore will only find two pedals in your footwell a conventional petrol or diesel engine vehicle requires gears as it can only rev to around 40006000 rpm before requiring a gear shift this ensures there is no undue pressure applied to the engine an electric motor however can revs of up to 20000 rpm and therefore does not require the change in gear what are gears used for a gearbox in a conventional petrol or diesel engine vehicle allows for the car to be driven with minimum strain on the engine the changes in gears means that the vehicle can benefit from greater fuel economy when travelling at high speeds or over long distances changing gears allows the driver to determine the amount of power which is available in the engine first gear for example has a lot of pulling power and will essentially get the vehicle going gears 2 and 3 also have quite a high level of pulling power which are useful when trying to gain speed whereas gears 4 5 and 6 have much less pulling power but are convenient for lowering your vehicle rpm and the making the vehicle fuel efficient whilst putting less strain on the engine will electric cars have gears in the future electric vehicles do not need gears to move while a standard petrol or diesel combustion engine requires multiple gears for the power output to ensure the vehicle produces a consistent amount of torque without putting too much pressure on the engine the mechanics behind running an electric vehicle are not quite so complex as they are fuelled by the battery power they do not need the gears to dictate how much power goes to the engine and therefore only the one gear is required it is therefore highly unlikely that future models of electric cars will come equipped with gear changes unless a car manufacturer decides to add them in for a drivers familiarity but they would have no benefits of a drive experience or the running of the vehicle do i need a manual licence to drive an ev as electric vehicles dont technically have any gears at all you do only require an automatic licence to be able to drive one that does mean if you pass your test in an ev you will be able to drive automatic cars in future so you would either have to continue driving an ev or switch to getting a manual licence to top up your automatic licence if you were wanting to drive a standard petrol or diesel combustion engine manual vehicle in the future as well there may come a time in the future where all drivers are using evs and therefore driving lessons will be in evs and your driving licence will also be for automatic vehicles only but as this will be the only car available in the future this wont be an issue are electric cars easy to drive electric cars and very easy to drive because you do not have to learn to negotiate gear changes if you are a beginner learning to drive and are only going to be driving evs in the future you may want to opt for just doing an automatic driving licence to make the whole driving experience easier for you in the footwell of an electric car you will only notice two pedals the left one being the brake and the right one being the throttle or accelerator this means there is no clutch which is found in a standard manual combustion engine vehicle this does make an electric vehicle easier to drive as you simply press your foot on the right throttle pedal to move and left brake pedal to slow down and stop of course there is a lot more to learning to drive than just the two pedals but if you are only looking to only drive evs then can you certainly have it that little bit easier than those who are having to learn to use gears on a manual vehicle too more about evs and faqs how far can an electric car go the average distance an ev can travel is 211 miles however this is dependent on numerous factors including the size of the battery in kwh the vehicles weight  design and everfluctuating factors such as the weather what happens when an electric car runs out of battery if you have never run out of petrol when driving it is unlikely you will run out of battery the concept of recharging is the same as refilling your vehicle wed recommend heading to the nearest charging station when your vehicle reaches between 1520 capacity recharge on a public dc charger will take between 1030 minutes dependent on your vehicles charging rates how many kwh does an ev use in the perfect conditions an electric vehicle ev will use on average around 025 kwh per mile though this figure will fluctuate slightly based on changes in rolling resistance temperature wind direction and daily weather conditions how low can my electric vehicle battery go before it needs charging to maintain the longevity of a vehicle battery it is recommended that you maintain a minimum charge of at least 1520 the average distance between charge points in the uk is 61 miles meaning the bare minimum charge required would be 4 though this is not recommended what is the longest range on an electric car 620 miles is the official range of the tesla roadster and currently in the top spot for the longest range on an electric car the average between the top 10 longest range vehicles is 342 miles what is the range of an ev 211 miles is the average range of an ev when comparing 40 of the best selling electric vehicles in 2020 range is determined by many factors including vehicle weight and the kwh size of the battery how much does electric car charging at home cost it would cost 777 on average to fully charge an electric vehicle at home and most users would fully charge once per week this is an average of 3108 per month 0333300
