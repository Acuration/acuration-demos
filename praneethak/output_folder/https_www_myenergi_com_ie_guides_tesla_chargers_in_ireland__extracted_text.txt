guides  tesla chargers in ireland can i use a normal outlet to charge yes you can charge your tesla using a normal outlet however while you may not have considered it yet the standard charging outlet which is provided with all teslas has no connectivity no smart phone app no charge range control and isnt solar aware for these reasons combined plus the time it will take to charge your tesla at home we would always recommend upgrading your home car charger simply plugging it into the mains and leaving it could take upwards of 100 hours to reach full charge you also wont have any control over the functions of eco or rapid charging depending on how long you have the zappi has three charging modes which are all perfect for charging your tesla eco eco and fast eco charging this mode is a mixture of both green energy and energy imported from the grid this is perfect for charging your tesla with solar panels but if you dont have them it will use energy from the grid when its at its cheapest ie over night eco plus charging charge power is continuously adjusted in response to changes in generation or power consumption elsewhere in the home your ev charger will pause if there is too muchimported power continuing only when there is surplus free power available fast charging in this mode the vehicle will be charged at maximum power this power can come from a renewable energy source or simply from the grid in this mode your tesla can be fully charged in no time at all tesla model x charger the tesla model x has an impressive 348mile range but whats the best charging method having
