charging station earlier we told you about various charging options if you have your own garage or driveway at your home you can have your own charging station or wall charger installed at home but choosing a charging station whats involved were happy to explain in this guide a home charging station is often much cheaper than charging at a commercial station plus with zappi you can easily use energy from your own solar panels to charge as economically as possible 1 choosing a charging station starts in your meter box when choosing a charging station it is important to consider what connection you currently have in your meter box many older homes still have a 1phase connection while newer homes have a 3phase connection how fast you can charge at home depends on this power connection with a 1phase connection you can charge less quickly than with a 3phase connection of course your car must then be suitable for 3phase connections not sure which connection you currently have does the electricity meter in your meter box indicate 220 v or 230 v then you have a 1phase connection does it say 3x 220230 v or 280400 v then you have a 3phase connection a 1phase connection can be upgraded by your network operator it will cost approximately between 250 and 300 please note that after the connections are upgraded you will also pay more periodic costs in some cases it is also wise to use a power distributor in your meter cupboard do you cook via an induction stove or use a heat pump these appliances like your electric car also consume electricity by the way it is not wise to charge your electric car through a normal wall socket the charging cable can get too hot and cause a fire 2 choose type of charging station you can choose from various types of charging stations would you like to charge via a pole or via a box on the wall the advantage of a wallmounted charger is that they are often cheaper because you dont pay for the stand and the pole in the video below we explain what to look out for when choosing a charging station 3 buy a charging station another important factor to consider when choosing your charging station is the capacity of your electric car if your car can charge quickly but you can only charge slowly the capacity is not fully utilized conversely if your car cannot handle fast charging but your charging station can it may take a long time to charge your car choosing a charging station you are not only doing it for now but also for later it is therefore wise to consider any future cars therefore prefer to choose a slightly higher charging capacity than your current car needs that way you can also charge any new car properly and quickly 4 how much does a charge point cost our smart ev charger zappi is available
