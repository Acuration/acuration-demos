 blog  green friday  black friday what is black friday us shopping trend black friday has well and truly cemented itself into uk festive traditions this now global shopping frenzy which takes place the day after thanksgiving has turned into a monthlong celebration of discounted technology and sales the once spontaneous and slightly unpredictable oneday event of price slashing has become a heavily organised calculated and extended event leaving shoppers questioning whether the endless bargains really are all that many larger companies are generating this hysteria and stirring up this sense of urgency for which customers feel the urge to go on wild shopping sprees often regretting the outcome we believe this focus would be better diverted to supporting smaller local businesses whom are often overlooked during these chaotic shopping periods were people are often distracted by the hype and miss out on the bliss serenity and feel good factor brought about by supporting local people
