myenergi selfgeneration nation  solar sales soar amid escalating energy costs home  blog  selfgeneration nation  solar sales soar amid escalating energy costs selfgeneration nation  solar sales soar amid escalating energy costs over the past decade the european energy marketplace has continued to experience increasing volatility even prior to the catastrophic impact caused by russias invasion of ukraine prices were creeping up and unprecedented demand was beginning to put pressure on available supply in 2021 alone wholesale costs soared by upwards of 250 key factors behind this hike included a cold summer meaning less gas was stored for winter use fewer pipelines were delivered than predicted and energy generation across europe was far lower than in previous years this resulted in significant demand placed on supply channels just as energy demand peaked all while global economies were still bouncing back from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic rather than shortterm pressure with the market quickly bouncing back challenging conditions are set to continue with price caps rising inflation soaring and the cost of living impacting almost every household escalating energy prices and the real risk of demand outstripping supply continues to hit the headlines to tackle the seemingly looming energy crisis more households than ever are turning towards renewable energy generation as a solution to safeguard against an unpredictable market according to solar energy uk more than 3000 photovoltaic pv installations were undertaken every week in july  an increase of almost 200 yearonyear in addition installers nationwide have been reporting enquiry surges of more than 1000 but while increasing renewable uptake should be commended from an environmental perspective will selfgeneration really protect you from escalating energy bills whats more with a hefty associated price tag is it possible to further maximise efficiencies and reduce the payback on your investment does the maths add up when it comes to selfgeneration with almost 11 million installations across the uk solar pv deployment provides a combined national energy capacity of approximately 136 gigawatts unlike most renewable generation an increasing percentage of this capacity is from smaller panels many of which are found on the roofs of residential homes but why solar well when it comes to selfgenerated energy generation pv is a reliable and efficient solution with a realistic payback time and minimal maintenance requirements as the technology has continued to evolve and improve it has become the most popular solution for homeowners looking to take energy into their own hands while popular solar is just one solution skyrocketing energy prices have been a huge motivator for households investing in selfgeneration with all renewable technologies thrust into the spotlight whether smallscale wind turbines solar thermal technology or ground source heat pumps consumers are quickly moving away from reliance on mains supply and the uncontrollable pressure of market volatility and yet despite continued investment the achilles heel of renewables remains while most household energy is used in the evenings most renewable energy is generated during the day unless you have a comprehensive battery setup its most likely that youll export sustainable power at periods of low consumption and buy it back at a more expensive rate when you need it selfconsumption technologies  beating the system in the past the challenge of unmanageable generation has proven a barrier too high for most homeowners to overcome the equation simply doesnt add up but fortunately theres another way at myenergi were renowned worldwide for developing pioneering ecosmart energy solutions that maximise the efficiency of selfgenerated supply we help users to harness the true benefits of selfgeneration through marketleading smart technologies reducing their carbon footprint and helping them to take complete control of their energy spend were best known for designing the markets first ecosmart electric vehicle charging device  zappi  a futureproofed solution that alongside operating as a mainsconnected charging device that automatically optimises around your energy tariff to enable charging at both cheaper and greener times from the grid seamlessly integrates with renewable tech to harness selfgenerated energy this gives zappi users the opportunity to charge for free  quick simple zero emissions motoring while charging your car through mains supply is still far cheaper and more environmentally friendly than running a petrol or diesel car doing it with renewable energy can take ev charging completely off grid alongside zappi we also manufacture a wide range of other devices  such as eddi the uks 1 solar power diverter which diverts surplus renewable energy to domestic heating systems and harvi an energy monitoring wireless sensor that allows the zappi and eddi to be installed without wiring a direct ct clamp each of our products help households to consume more of their selfgenerated energy and minimise reliance on the grid in result a smart home with minimal grid demand autonomously powering your electric car heating and hot water with completely free renewable energy an investment up front is obviously required but with energy bills escalating it gives you complete control over energy spend and avoids the risk of price cap hikes meaning youll be safe in the knowledge that youre reducing your carbon footprint and contributing towards a more circular economy the idea of smart automated systems that use renewable energy to power and warm your home while recharging your zeroemission vehicle is a real gamechanger however its not a vision for the future its available to us today so while the achilles heel remains our innovations are giving consumers smarter more innovative and environmentallyfriendly alternatives to offset their reliance on the grid with the cost of grid generation outside the control of homeowners now is the perfect time to become more independent with concerns about ongoing price hikes selfgeneration energy independence and smart ecosmart technologies can provide the solution share story related news view all news about myenergi myenergi and grace beverley put green tech on centre stage 29th
