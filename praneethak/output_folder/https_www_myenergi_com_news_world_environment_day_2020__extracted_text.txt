it would take 16 earths to produce all of the necessary resources to meet the current demands of the human race we are failing to protect our planet and neglecting our environmental responsibilities despite the fact that the human population has doubled in the last 50 years this is having a detrimental effect on biodiversity hence the uns decision to dedicate this years celebration to protecting it the people behind world environment day describe biodiversity as a concern that is both urgent and existential made evident by the recent bushfires in brazil and locust infestations in australia nature is sending us a message say world environment day campaigners what is biodiversity biodiversity encompasses the interdependent relationship between the 8 million species living on earth covering everything from ecosystems to genetic diversity biodiversity can be described as a complex interdependent web in which each member plays an important role drawing and contributing in ways that may not even be visible to the eye everything from our food to our medicines and the air we breathe relies on biodiversity it is what sustains the human race as well as many other species it is imperative that we protect the species with which we share our planet our failure to do so has been likened by scientists to burning the library of life why does biological diversity matter biological diversity is critical for the overall health of our planet biodiversity provides us with natural disease resistance climate change migration oxygen food and clean air anything that damages biodiversity also damages the systems that protect and support our way of life only by putting nature at the heart of our decision making can we reverse biodiversity loss and help sustain our planet once more hunting animals on a mass scale for food and goods as well as destroying forests and bleaching coral reefs has placed us on the verge of a mass extinction we have upset the balance of nature and world environment day is encouraging everyone to make the right steps to restore it coronavirus and biodiversity roughly 75 of all emerging pathogens in the last decade are zoonotic meaning they have transmitted from animals to humans as the coronavirus pandemic has shown upsetting the balance of nature by encroaching on wildlife can create the conditions for deadly viruses to spread from animals to humans in the words of the experts the more biodiverse an ecosystem is the more difficult it is for one pathogen to spread rapidly or dominate whereas biodiversity loss provides opportunity for pathogens to pass between animals and people it is now up to us to protect our environment become more sustainable and enter a new normal world environment day how you can celebrate this year this
