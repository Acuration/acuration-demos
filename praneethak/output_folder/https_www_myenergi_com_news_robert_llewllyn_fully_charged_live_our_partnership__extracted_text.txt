robert llewllyns partnership with myenergi home  blog  fully charged live  robert llewllyns partnership with myenergi some of you may recognise robert llewellyn from tv game show scrapheap challenge or scifi sitcom red dwarf but to myenergi the nowhost of the fully charged youtube channel is a close friend and partner what is fully charged produced and hosted by actor writer and comedian robert llewllyn fully charged is a youtube channel about electric automobiles and how we generate and even own the electricity to power these machines from reviewing electric cars and motor shows to analysing environmentally friendly batteries fully charged covers a variety of topics in the renewables and green energy sector this of course ties in perfectly with the myenergi mission to create a sustainable future through compassionate technology which brings us to the story of how jordan our sales director and cofounder met robert for the first time where it all began our collaboration with robert llewellyn and fully charged live began when jordan ventured up to orkney scotland to support the event of eco cars jonathan porterfield our firstever customer and fantastic myenergi advocate i became friends with jonathan through twitter he loved myenergi and was one of our earliest adopters having bought the zappi via crowdfunding says jordan i was very keen to head up to orkney to support jonathans event and he told me that there was a good chance robert llewllyn would be there while excited at the prospect of meeting robert a great advocate for renewable energy and evs jordans primary mission was to enjoy the event her friend had put so much work into organising travelling in true myenergi style jordan made the almost600 mile trip up to orkney in an early model of the electric nissan leaf this was the first time our cofounder had driven an ev it was 24 hours of solid driving pure exhaustion she says i ended up missing my ferry the first time which was a bad start however by chance i ended up on robert llewellyns ferry the following day meaning i had a good 90 minutes with him on the crossing i went up and introduced myself we got chatting and i asked to get a picture i then told him i had a product to show him later at first he was rather nonchalant because he must get that all the time but when we got to the event and i showed him the zappi his attitude changed oh my god ive heard about this i remember him saying rather excitedly as it turned out jonathan had been singing the praises of myenergi to robert prior to the event so much so that the former scrapheap challenge host could not wait to see how it worked appearing on fully chargeds youtube channel as soon as jordan got the zappi out of her car and in front of robert he fell in love with it he wanted to get it in front of his fully charged audience there and then before we had even started production at myenergi hq says jordan much to her delight and shock roberts words were dont tell me anything about it i want to film an episode this weekend and ill ask you everything on camera i was just hoping to meet him but it all snowballed from there says jordan the youtube video was an amazing opportunity as he has such a targeted audience in the hundreds of thousands across the uk norway australia new zealand the us you cant buy that sort of exposure while thrilled with the opportunity jordan is the first to admit that she was terrified in front of the camera but robert soon put her at ease with his professionalism friendliness and approachability oh my god that is amazing robert said the moment jordan began the demonstration and our zappi started working its magic it is a classic nobrainer fantastic after the initial interview between robert and jordan was filmed we sent robert his very own zappi to install at home so impressed by its usability and efficiency he recorded additional footage for the episode in which he said its a really brilliant thing check out the website theyre really clever electronic engineers and the product is beautifully made zappi chargers are brilliant the video was broadcast on youtube in october just a month before we launched and gained over 168000 views and hundreds of comments the interest was so high that it actually crashed our website you can watch it in full using the link below zappi smart ev charger  fully charged falling in love with zappi at myenergi we absolutely adore our superb customers and wonderful advocates robert is now both robert is the same as us says jordan hes got solar panels and electric cars and is very much an early adopter he just found the exact same problem as many others that his ev would charge when its sunny but if you turn anything else on or off or if its cloudy youre going to start pulling power from the grid zappi is such a simple idea but theyre always the best ones it solves a problem many people had but did not know how to solve if youd like to learn more about green energy check out our selfconsumption of energy guide working together with robert llewllyn since meeting for the first time in orkney filming the fully charged episode and providing robert with a zappi myenergi and the renewables enthusiast have remained close industry friends with fully charged and myenergi growing together simultaneously roberts company and myenergi were both in their infancy when we met but weve grown together at the same speed so have always remained close jordan says we didnt pay for any of the exposure that episode gave us  robert does not do paid advertising he only does what he believes in  so we insisted on gifting him with a zappi instead sharing the startup experience and an enthusiasm for renewables were what brought jordan and robert together but jordan attributes the strong partnership between both brands to one shared mission were all wanting the same thing for people to adopt renewable energy and electric vehicles theyre the perfect synergy of industries and its so important with this massive climate crisis that were experiencing what next for myenergi fully charged and robert llewllyn last year we were very proud sponsors of fully charged live 2018 the first event of its kind with over 6000 attendees at silverstone alongside demonstrations speakers and displays it truly was an excellent inspiring event we were always completely behind fully charged live we wanted to do anything we could to help roberts business jordan says i am extremely grateful for his enthusiasm towards myenergi while he too was humbled by the exposure the zappi interview got for his channel since last years event robert attended our launch event for the new zappi to show his continued support meanwhile weve been planning for fully charged live 2019
