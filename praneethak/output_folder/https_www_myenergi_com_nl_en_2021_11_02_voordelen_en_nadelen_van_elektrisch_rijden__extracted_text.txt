disadvantages of electric driving there are many different opinions about electric cars is it really an environmentally friendly way to drive are they really that quiet to shed some light on the subject here are the pros and cons of electric driving benefit it is an environmentally friendly way of driving a big advantage of electric driving is that it is much cleaner than driving a traditional car after all you dont emit any pollutants when you charge the electric car with green power from your supplier or selfgenerated power from solar panels it is even better for the environment disadvantage producing and recycling does have an impact when talking about advantages and disadvantages of electric driving one point that often comes up is the production of an electric car producing an electric car takes energy recycling is also not so easy and has an impact on the environment however when you look at the entire lifetime of an electric car and comparing that to a fuel car the electric car ends up being less environmentally damaging the production of electricity can additionally become less taxing by generating cleaner energy from windmills and solar panels at myenergi you can easily charge your electric car with clean energy from your own solar panels using zappi benefit driving on electricity is cheaper than driving on petrol especially with rising petrol prices electric driving offers a great advantage it is cheaper to drive on electricity than on fuel although energy prices are rising fast driving electrically is still cheaper than filling up with petrol diesel or lpg charging your car at home can save you up to half in costs if you charge your car at a public charging point it is often more expensive than charging it at home but even then it is cheaper than regular fuel disadvantage charging takes time when weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of electric driving the charging time is a dilemma for many it does take more time to charge an electric car than it does to fill up at a petrol station whereas a petrol tank can be fully filled within minutes the battery of an electric car needs more time the charging time depends on the size of your battery in kw and the speed of charging in kwh on average you can expect to spend nearly 8 hours with a home charger at a public charging station that is about 1 to 2 hours and at a fast charging station half an hour it does take some planning if you want to drive longer distances however it need not be a major drawback with zappi can you set when your car should be charged our smart energy monitors can also determine when the power is cheapest and charge your car at that time after that your car only needs to be charged again when the range is no longer sufficient at that moment you will have been able to drive electrically for several hours and you are probably ready for a break you can combine that with charging disadvantage the purchase of an electric car is higher if there is one thing that people see as a major disadvantage of electric driving it is the purchase price it is true that at the moment electric cars are still more expensive than fuel cars however more and more people are choosing to drive electric so the demand is greater and there will be more supply the share of secondhand cars will therefore also increase the purchase of an electric car will therefore become cheaper benefit less maintenance required the purchase price may be a bigger expense but maintenance is not this is a major advantage of electric driving an electric motor has fewer moving parts than an internal combustion engine as a result an electric car is less likely to suffer from wear and tear in addition electric driving is encouraged by the government with a subsidy it also has tax advantages for you the additional tax liability for electric lease cars is much lower than for gasoline and diesel cars at the moment you also do not have to pay road tax or purchase tax bpm in the netherlands that saves on costs disadvantage electric driving does not take me very far so there are advantages and disadvantages to driving electric whether an electric car is right for you depends on several factors one of the most important questions you should ask yourself is is the range enough for my daily activities the disadvantage of electric driving is that you cant drive as far with a full battery as with a full tank of petrol on average you can drive between 100 and 500 kilometres with a full battery with a petrol car you can cover a distance of 750 kilometres on a 50 litre tank here we assume an average consumption of 1 to 15 the technology is in full swing with the development of batteries that can offer a higher action radius the expectation is therefore that in the future you will be able to drive electrically ever further advantage and disadvantage electric cars are quiet to conclude our list of advantages and disadvantages of electric driving we would like to mention that electric cars are much quieter the electric motor makes much less noise than an internal combustion engine this is an advantage because it reduces noise pollution particularly if you live in an area close to a motorway it is a lot more pleasant if more people drive electric however it is also a disadvantage other traffic is less likely to hear you coming it is therefore possible that a cyclist or pedestrian will overlook you causing a collision is of course the last thing you want this is why some electric cars make more noise at lower speeds on purpose advantages and disadvantages of electric driving what does myenergi think about that the decision whether or not to buy an electric car after weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of electric driving is of course up to you at myenergi we would like to see more electric cars on the road developments are moving fast and electric cars can be driven more and more efficiently and safely by charging your car with your own solar panels its a clean and cheap way of driving we see it as a great step towards a more sustainable future share story related news see all articles more about
