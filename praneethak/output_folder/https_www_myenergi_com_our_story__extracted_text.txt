recognise our social responsibility to each other our communities and our environment our journey myenergi began in 2016 by good friends and our cofounders lee sutton and jordan brompton rather than a fairytale story dreamt up in a shiny glass citycentre skyscraper the idea behind myenergi came from a conversation over a bottle of wine in lees living room with a simple question why wasnt there a product on the market that allowed lee to charge his ev from the solar pv panels installed on his house was it possible was it practical were there hundreds of zeroemission motorists out there all feeling the same way a talented electrical engineer lee had previously run a number of successful renewable energy tech companies he had the skillset to create the product while jordan had the sustainability network and marketing experience to build the brand thus myenergi was born starting as a modest team of two in just a few short years myenergi has matured into a workforce of 400 we have an installer network of more than 3000 approved zappi installers and weve sold over 500000 products worldwide since 2020 myenergi has seen an average annual growth of more than 180 while subsidiaries have been opened in australia germany ireland and the netherlands along the way the team more recently relocated from a small countryside workshop to a purposebuilt eco facility in stallingborough where work is already well underway to add a 66000 sq ft production facility to the growing site once complete the development will see myenergis entire uk operations housed in a single central location providing the perfect platform to further increase production output and further invest in our marketleading product portfolio while were best known for our ecosmart zappi ev charger weve since unveiled a series of other innovative products including eddi a clever device that diverts surplus renewable energy to domestic heating systems harvi an energy monitoring wireless sensor that allows products to be installed without wiring a direct ct clamp libbi a smart home battery solution that helps householders to prevent the unnecessary export of energy and the myenergi

the societal transition away from fossil fuels and towards the zerocarbon world of tomorrow were proud to have brought a fresh approach to sustainable tech while we pride ourselves on being innovative in every sense of the word  disrupting a hugely competitive market and providing a fresh approach that drives rather than follows  the entrepreneurial spirit that took the first product to market is
