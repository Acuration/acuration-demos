protection the latest updates to smart charge point regulations home  guides  anti tamper protection  smart charge point regulations were fully supportive of the uk governments approach to these new regulations and we are glad to announce that zappi is fully compliant whats new with uk smart regs at the beginning of the year you may remember our focus was on phase 1 of the smart charge point regulations which came into force on june 30th 2022 the first part of the regulations focussed on smart enabled functionality the next stage of the regulations focusses on the standardisation of charge point security and comes into effect from 30th december 2022 myenergis zappi has always set the standards in safety and security and its now become a regulated requirement for all charge point manufacturers to follow suit to ultimately protect customers from poor quality exports and what we often refer to as dumb chargers introducing antitamper protection alongside a software update one of the key requirements of the regulations is a compulsory tamper protection boundary anti tamper device which requires newly installed chargers to detect and alert of any successful or unsuccessful tamper attempts these new regulations do not apply to charge points already installed and rest assured zappi has been leading the way and setting the standards in safety and security long before these new regulations came into affect this is helped by the fact our products are manufactured right here in the uk we also have a solution for installers and wholesalers alike that may still have stock of older models in the form of a free of charge retrofit antitamper protection kit order my kit please note you must have a myenergi trade account login to be able to order your free of charge kits
