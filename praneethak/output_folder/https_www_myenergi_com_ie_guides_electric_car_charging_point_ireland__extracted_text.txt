charging points ireland home  guides  electric car charging points ireland how many electric car charging points are there in ireland while there isnt an exact figure on the number of electric charging points in ireland yet we can piece together a pretty good understanding from the news reports made available in february 2022 the irish times reported that there are 1900 public chargers at 800 sites in ireland since there have been updates of additional installs across the country which will take us to just over the 2100 mark in april 2022 how many electric cars are there on the road in ireland the estimated number of electric cars on irish roads today is roughly 47000 which is up by 15000 in the last year while this might seem like quite a lot it is way behind the governments

around 150000 evs on the road in 2030 85 lower than anticipated why so few electric cars in ireland it is anticipated that the slow growth of the electric car market in ireland is due to the lack of public infrastructure while the uptake in buying personal home electric car chargers is growing year on year the publicly available charging stations are way behind the curve unless youre in a builtup
