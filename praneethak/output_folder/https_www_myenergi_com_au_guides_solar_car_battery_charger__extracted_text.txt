what is a solar car battery charger home  guides  what is a solar car battery charger what is solar energy solar energy can be produced anywhere that the sun reaches and is the earths most readily available source of energy solar power is the process of harnessing the energy from the sun and using solar panels to transform sunlight into electricity commonly referred to as pv which means for photovoltaic solar panel systems work when 3 types of light are converted using cells at an atomic level into electricity you can now find solar farms both on land and floating on water generating power for thousands of homes and becoming more popular around the globe including france netherlands america uk and many more what is a solar charger in 2017 the worlds first solar car charger the zappi was invented by robin richard and lee sutton for smart home energy management company myenergi this pioneering technology was a monumental breakthrough and influential product for other electric car chargers to follow the solar car battery charger works like any standard charger but includes settings that allow you to take electricity produced by solar panels and send it straight into charging an ev this innovative practice allows you to drive on sunshine shop zappi charge for free with solar batteries a solar car battery charger works by allowing you to use excess solar to power up your car generating solar energy requires solar panels or pv to be fitted to your home or place of work but the energy generated through the solar panels is totally free charge even when it isnt sunny there is a big misconception that solar panels only work on a sunny day but instead they can use both direct or indirect sunlight to produce power although solar panels are most effective in direct sunlight a rainy day can help clean any dirt or dust off your panels making them work more efficiently solar panels will still work even when the light is reflected or partially blocked by clouds how do solar panels charge my car battery light energy produced by the sun is called a photon  the most basic fundamental particle of all light it is these photons in natural daylight that are converted by solar panel cells to produce electricity this small bundle of electromagnetic energy is constantly in motion and your solar panel works by allowing photons or particles of light to bounce into electrons generating a flow of electricity different types of light that is converted by photovoltaic cells introducing eddi the solar power diverter solar diverters take excess energy produced from your renewable energy sources such as solar pv and diverts it into a designated appliance such as an immersion heater or underfloor heating the myenergi eddi utilises this leftover energy making the most of the 100 green energy rather than exporting it back to the grid your power generation investment becomes more efficient product diverting the power back to your heating systems will solar panels benefit me there are many things to consider when thinking about switching to solar and your return on investment roi will depend on your set up looking into your homes electricity need size of the solar pv system and financial incentive schemes will all help determine what kind of investment will see the quickest gain solar panels are worth it if you generate enough electricity and stay in the same house long enough solar panels absorb the suns energy to generate electricity for free which can help reduce your electricity bills significantly cost savings by purchasing solar panels for example an averagesized home with a 4kw solar panel system that can meet the energy needs of a family of 3 or 4 will spend approximately 11000 on a pv system if installed by an mcs certified supplier it will save you up to 1600 a year you can expect to save roughly 499 on electricity bills annually and together with the smart export guarantee seg you would reach the breakeven point within 1622
