slash solar payback periods for ev drivers home  blog  working from home can slash solar payback periods for ev drivers working from home can slash solar payback periods for ev drivers according to insight from the office for national statistics ons more than 38 of the uk workforce now enjoy either a parthybrid or totally remote role while sceptics have suggested that this trend will begin to fall inline with retreating covid19 cases a recent survey from tracking happiness found that workers are reportedly happier and more productive than ever thanks to their newfound flexibility as such if anything remote working rates are expected to rise further over the coming years while this scenario would have been considered almost unthinkable prior to the pandemic multiple lockdowns have demonstrated that a significant percentage of roles can be successfully delivered remotely resulting in a more engaged workforce and offering a number of commercial benefits too indeed alongside better performance greater engagement and increased staff retention organisations offering remote options are said to have a 21 higher profitability margin alongside professional flexibility there are additional financial benefits available for electric car drivers who work from home and choose to invest in solar panels thanks to the latest developments in ecosmart home energy management technology not only can householders slash their energy bills they can also significantly reduce the payback period of their investment into renewables savvy saving  investing in solar when it comes to

consumption of any household typically only 45 of selfgenerated renewable energy is consumed while most household energy is used in the mornings and evenings most renewable energy is generated during the middle of the day unless you have a comprehensive battery setup its most likely that youll export sustainable power at periods of low consumption and buy it back at a more expensive rate when you
