guides  what is an energy diverter what is a solar energy diverter solar diverters also known as solar energy diverters or solar power diverters are specifically designed devices used in solar power systems to optimise energy utilisation and maximise selfconsumption of generated solar energy they are typically employed in gridconnected photovoltaic pv systems where excess solar energy can be diverted to other loads within the premises rather than exporting it back to the grid what does an energy diverter do the primary function of an energy diverter is to prioritise the consumption of solar energy within the property thereby reducing dependency on grid electricity and maximising the financial benefits of solar power generation it achieves this by diverting surplus solar energy that is not immediately consumed by the connected loads such as household appliances or lighting to auxiliary devices or systems that can utilise the excess energy effectively typically any excess energy generated on a solar pv system is sent back to the grid at a lower price or is often wasted put simply an energy diverter stops this wastage so you can use the power in your home uses of an energy diverter one common application of solar diverters is water heating they can be integrated with electric water heaters or immersion heaters to divert surplus solar energy directly into the water heating system by doing so the diverter optimises the use of solar power to heat water reducing the reliance on conventional electric heating methods and saving on energy costs explore eddi how does an energy diverter work energy diverters typically consist of a control unit and a power relay the control unit continuously monitors the amount of solar energy being generated by the pv system and compares it with the instantaneous power consumption within the property when excess energy is detected the control unit signals the power relay to divert the surplus energy to the predetermined destination such as the water heater or other designated loads by employing a solar energy diverter homeowners or businesses can make the most of their solar power systems ensuring that a higher proportion of the generated energy is utilised onsite rather than being exported to the grid this increases selfconsumption reduces electricity bills and enhances the overall efficiency of the solar power installation its important to note that specific features and functionalities of solar diverters may vary among different manufacturers and models therefore its recommended to consult the product documentation or seek professional advice to understand the capabilities and compatibility of a particular solar diverter with your solar power system get the perfect home setup zappi learn
