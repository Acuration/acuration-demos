global chip shortage home  news  myenergi innovates product range again in response to global chip shortage the global chip shortage continues to have a negative impact on the tech industry with myenergi now redesigning its devices in response to the crisis various media are warning of a shortage of products and materials largely caused by the global chip shortage this shortage began last year due to a combination of events exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic manufacturers all over the world have been affected with apple samsung and tesla just some of the big names that have had to deal with the shortage now myenergi had to find a solution to the problem with the british manufacturer deciding to complete a major product redesign project to address the shortage lead times for some microprocessors are now over 52 weeks which was a major problem for myenergi as it continues to experience explosive growth to futureproof the company and ensure that longterm demand does not outstrip supply myenergis team of engineers tackled the looming supply problem and worked around the clock to completely redesign its product range the modified designs operate on a new more powerful microprocessor that is not affected by the silicon shortage in addition to the increased production of myenergis zappi eddi harvi and hub products the more powerful microprocessor will enable additional functions over time giving customers more control over their home energy consumption dr chris horne chief technology officer of myenergi says the global shortage of silicon has led to problems for many sectors worldwide with ever longer lead times for critical microchips halting car production a shortage of consumer goods and huge price increases in computer components to name but a few as an important part of our products we had built up stocks to make up for the shortfall and cover our plans to increase production but we knew this problem would persist for the foreseeable future in light of this we acted quickly to change our control platform and complete the project in just three months we are now in a strong position to meet the increasing demand for our range of efficient energy control products which continues to grow as the global drive for sustainability and zero emissions gains momentum jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi added we have
