energy equal to one kilowatt of power sustained for one hour or 3600 kilojoules 36 megajoules well that clears that up joking aside the explanation above is not exactly simple and if you are new to kwh or are trying to figure out your energy bill the standard definition doesnt really help a 2016 study by uswitch showed that 60 of customers did not understand their energy bills mostly due to the language and terminology used youve probably seen kwh on your energy bills as it is how your energy is measured to find out how much you need to pay but do you understand how the cost is really calculated were going to break it down and give you an explanation that wont leave your head spinning what is a kilowatt a kilowatt is 1000 watts  a bit like how a litre is 1000 millilitres or a mile is 1000 metres a watt unit of measurement that tells us how much power an appliance needs to operate and different appliances require different amounts of watts or wattage to work what is a kwh a kwh is a kilowatt hour  this is how much energy it takes to run a 1000 kilowatt appliance for one hour there are also megawatthours mwh gigawatthours gwh and terawatthours twh but these are mostly used by big industrial companies youre unlikely to see them on your home electric bill because of the name kilowatt hour kwh you could be mistaken for thinking that 1 kwh  1 hour of time but thats not how it works instead a kwh is the amount of energy used and it differs depending on what youre using confused lets break it down electrical items are often categorised by their wattage  a 100 watt bulb a 50 watt radio or a 2000 watt microwave these different wattages mean they take different amounts of energy and therefore have different measurements the lower the wattage the longer it takes to use up a kwh a 50 watt radio would take 20 hours to use up 1 kwh a 100 watt lightbulb would take 10 hours to use up 1 kwh a 2000 microwave would take just 30 minutes to use up 1 kwh some appliances are more energyefficient than others and so use less energy if you need a comparison think about calories burned during exercise you burn a certain amount per hour depending on what youre doing cycling burns more than walking for example energy is similar  appliances burn energy at different rates and that is what we measure in kwh how much does 1 kwh of electricity cost the cost of energy is not static just like petrol and gas the price of electricity depends on many outside factors such as market conditions so for the purposes of this article lets say that electricity costs 10p for 1 kwh in order to work out how much electricity something costs we need to know three things the wattage how many hours youre using how much 1 kwh costs you want to play a video game on your games console you know that the console is 1000 watts and the game you want to play will take 6 hours to complete we already know that 1 kwh is 10p so we can use the following formula kw wattage of the appliance x the hours youre using it x the electricity cost in pounds and pence which gives us 1kw x 6 hours x 010p electricity cost per kwh  060p a day once you know the formula you can adapt it to calculate the cost of any appliance for example if the console is 2000 watts instead and you want to play for 7 hours 2kw x 7 hours x 010p electricity cost per kwh  140p a day obviously the price of electricity changes and not every appliance will clearly state its wattage but if you can use the formula above you can work it out still confused contact our experts in kwh the helpful and experienced team at myenergi are
