football club launch new environmental initiative green town home  green partnerships  green town as the lead sponsor of grimsby town football club we are fully committed to supporting the club in any way we can in addition to providing club sponsorship we are thrilled to be partnering with the club to launch our green town campaign commencing on tuesday 25th april this collaboration celebrates grimsby as a central hub for green innovation and technology grimsby which was known as the food processing capital of europe during the 1980s and 1990s is now experiencing a green energy revolution which is helping to create a more sustainable future for the town debbie cook chief executive of grimsby town fc said there are some really exciting things happening in grimsby and for me green town represents a commitment to a greener future and the relationship between the club and myenergi as a club we are already working towards bcorp accreditation but this is just the start for us we are just scratching the surface in terms of green initiatives wed like to champion at the club over the years we have made changes with sustainability in mind we have led lights in our floodlights solar panels at our training ground recycling stations at blundell park and we have installed electric charging points and energy efficient boilers now we are working with myenergi to make more changes for the future jordan brompton cmo and cofounder of myenergi said we want to prove that were not just talking about it we are doing it as organisations  thats why our shirt sponsorship has been so key we want the supporters of gtfc to know who you have partnered with and to know that we are doing everything that we can to create a kinder and more sustainable future for the generations to come so i think green town portrays such an amazing future green town takes its inspiration from food town a movement synonymous with the club for many years with the towns reputation for food processing across europe debbie cook explains the green town message on the shirt uses the same font as our 1988 shirt which proudly carried the food town message  we hope that many fans will recognise and like this detail i think that green town represents something really exciting happening in our town and im proud that the club can be the platform to get across that message i also hope the campaign will be a reminder to us all that we can do more to be greener and contribute to a more sustainable future grimsby town fc will be wearing a unique green town version of their home shirt for tomorrow nights match against crewe alexandra at blundell park in honour of the towns exciting future this special edition shirt features details that will bring back fond memories of the late 80s and 90s for loyal supporters grimsby town fc and myenergi will collaborate over the coming months to spread the green town message if youd like to follow the green town campaign keep an eye on our websites and social
