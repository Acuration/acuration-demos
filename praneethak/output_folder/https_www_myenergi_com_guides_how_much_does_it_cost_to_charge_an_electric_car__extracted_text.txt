an electric car home  guides  how much does it cost to charge an electric car how much does it cost to charge an electric car the myths debunked the cost of charging any electric vehicle is dependent on numerous factors some of which are continuously fluctuating therefore answering this question is little more complex as such its hard to give an answer which will be completely accurate for everyone some of the key factors involved in determining the cost are vehicle battery size vehicle weight and the type of charger used ie home or public chargers its also dependent on a households particular energy tariff and whether energy is used efficiently for example those drivers who are utilising flexible time of use tariffs such as agile octopus could be making vast savings in comparison with another driver of the exact same vehicle the difference in electric vehicle battery sizes based on our selection of 40 of the best selling electric vehicles available right now 54kwh is the closest representation of the current average battery size however it is worth noting another top 40 list of vehicles might generate a slightly different result information available online generally focuses on a 60kwh battery so when typing how much does it cost to charge an electric car into google the results will be subjective to that particular size of battery battery sizes actually range from the popular tesla model 3 which sits at the higher end of the battery scale boasting a 75kwh battery option right down to the smart eq fortwo city car which has a smaller 175kwh therefore the cost of charging your tesla compared to smart eq would be vastly different what factors affect the cost of charging an electric car vehicle battery size  measured in kilowatts kw  there are 1000watts in a kilowatt  the higher the kilowatts the further the range  the larger the battery the longer it takes to fully charge  larger batteries require more energy to fully charge  smaller batteries need charging more frequently  smaller batteries are ideal for a shorter distance towncity driving  larger batteries are best for long distance commuting  measured in kilowatts kw  there are 1000watts in a kilowatt  the higher the kilowatts the further the range  the larger the battery the longer it takes to fully charge  larger batteries require more energy to fully charge  smaller batteries need charging more frequently  smaller batteries are ideal for a shorter distance towncity driving  larger batteries are best for long distance commuting usage  daily miles driven  the further you drive the more kwh you will use  the distance of your daily commute determines the frequency  stopstart journeys use more energy than constant speeds  properly maintained tires cause less friction  how you drive your vehicle affects kwh used ie quick accelerating vehicle weight  design  lighter vehicles often use less kwh  heavier vehicles often use more kwh  smaller kw batteries are usually lighter  larger kw batteries are usually heavier  the size of the wheels and quality of the tires used  the quality of the battery and components used  the efficiency of the circuitry and heat loss  aerodynamics factors and shape the types of charger you use  ecosmart ev chargers such as the zappi can drastically lower costs  reliance on public dc chargers tends to be more expensive  you can better manage and monitor using home chargers  charging at slower rates at home is usually more costeffective  some companies offer free charging for using their services  some workplaces offer low cost or free charging  tariffs and charge rates higher or lower dependent on area fluctuating weather climate  environment  electricity tends to be more expensive in the winter than summer  wind causes more friction when driving using more kwh  more likely to use your interior heater in cold weather  likely to use your vehicle more frequently in the winter  fluctuating temperatures can disperse extra energy quicker  hot weather might entice you to venture further  road friction from snowfall to ground temperature to surface quality energy usage  setup  the times you choose to charge eg peak timetea time  busy periods of electricity usage are usually more expensive  selfgeneration from solar or wind will lower charging costs  the type of energy tariff you are on  your energy supplier and the rates charged  flexible tariffs allow cheaper charging rates during offpeak times  devices such as eddi can help you charge using 100 green energy  the area of the country you live how much does it cost to charge an electric car at home charging your electric vehicle at home is the easiest and most cost effective way to charge most electric vehicle owners make plugging in their vehicles as automatic as unlocking the doors when arriving home where the vehicle would always be plugged in if not in use dependent on the amount of battery used throughout the day in most cases the charge will simply top up to full capacity topping up a vehicle every night will cost on average between 110  120 per day to maintain full charge the cost to fully charge the battery from near empty which is the equivalent of running to a petrol station on an empty tank would be between 780 average  850  however these daily costs could be much lower if you where utilising time of use tariff options and green energy solutions customers have been known to actually get paid to charge vehicles at times when there is surplus energy on the grid what is the cost to use a public charger public charging infrastructure is currently still very much in its early stages with new companies initiatives and technology changing at a rapid pace this makes working out an average cost to charge using public charge points very difficult to pin point equally some of the factors that determine the cost of a charge including the vehicle battery size and the time you have to spare will influence how much you will pay at a public charge station ie you may only need to top up enough to get you home safely before fully charging with your home charger however based on our own experience and research weve concluded that the average price to charge a vehicle from empty to near full at a public charging station is between 800  2000 giving us an average of 1400 this is the electric equivalent of spending 5000  6000 to fill up a tank of petrol for which you can see the drastic difference in price between the fuel types although in many cases you may wish only fill up the amount you feel is required for the journey or days ahead in some cases charge points often have a time limit meaning you wouldnt be able to get a full charge anyway when these elements are factored in a charge in a relative sense may cost as little as 250 per session what is the cheapest way to charge an ev there are a number of ways in which you could keep charging costs down firstly look at your current energy provider and check whether you are on the right tariff for you many home owners accept the first and cheapest standard tariff quotation they receive however in order to really control and begin to utilise these tariffs wed recommend creating a myenergi account users can use the advanced tools and features to physically set automation rules and parameters to ensure the vehicle is always charging at the cheapest prices making the cost to charge an electric car even cheaper standard tariffs are not always the most effective dependent on the needs of your household this is especially true for ev drivers who can utilises new initiatives such as flexible tariffs and time of use tariffs these tariffs offer customers far lower prices during off peak periods such as throughout the night and early hours this also happens to be the most likely time you are charging your ev however to best utilise these tariffs and to enable you to make sure your charger only charges when the electricity prices are at there lowest wed recommend selecting an eco smart charger such as the zappi which enables you to utilise these tariffs properly one service wed highly recommend is agile octopus by octopus energy a tariff very popular amongst ev drivers more electrifying answers how much does it cost to run an electric car based on a 54kwh battery the average cost to fully charge an electric car from empty to full is around 780 the average monthly cost to keep an ev charged would be around 3100 this data is based on fully charging your ev once per week at home another advantage is that evs are also exempt from paying road tax and they are also significantly cheaper to maintain can i save money with an ev evs are considered far cheaper than fossil fuel vehicles and ev owners can expect to save an average of 5748 per month on fuel savings alone which is a total average fuel saving of 68976 per year its also handy to know that electric vehicles dont require an oil  filter change during their service this will save on average another 100 a year thats a 78976 saving by removing the fossilbased components and elements of the combustion engine vehicle are electric cars cheaper to maintain it is widely recognised that electric cars are cheaper to maintain because there are significantly less mechanical moving parts battery energy is not only clean by name but clean by nature with no more oil spills leaking engines or injectors and filters clogging up the most expensive part of an ev to replace would be the battery however most manufacturers offer lengthy warranties of up to 10 years on their batteries evs on the whole are far less complex than their predecessor the combustion engine the general mechanics such as wheels steering wheels and brakes still need servicing and maintaining regularly to ensure optimum performance equally the safety features of an electric vehicle still need checking annually in the form of an mot test for which the vehicle is required to pass to be legally on the road 0333300 1303 salesmyenergicom myenergi pioneer business park faraday way stallingborough grimsby dn41 8ff opens in a new tab services services our story contact news
