sensationally delays 2030 ice ban home  news  pm rishi sunak sensationally delays 2030 ice ban on wednesday 20th september prime minister rishi sunak announced a flurry of uturns on a number of highly ambitious climate policies most notable of these was a fiveyear delay to the widely supported and eagerly anticipated 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car and van sales suggesting that the decision had been made to help working families avoid unnecessary costs the cynical clearout of climate policies has already seen intense criticism from environmental groups and the automotive supply chain alike while sunak suggested that he had every confidence in the fact that the uk was still on track to hit its 2050 net zero target its fair to say that this move puts into real question the governments commitment to embracing hardhitting green measures jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi commented postponing the uks 2030 date for phasing out new petrol and diesel car and van sales  which of course has always permitted some forms of hybrids to continue to be sold  is not good news for anyone it weakens confidence in uk investment vehicle manufacturers dont like it those of us who are working to decarbonise homes and transport dont like it and families that cannot afford a new car wont like it because they may have to wait even longer to buy a cleaner and cheapertorun electric car in the used market if were serious about net zero intent on decarbonisation and really committed to hitting our targets we need to make big bold brave decisions  and stick to them im
