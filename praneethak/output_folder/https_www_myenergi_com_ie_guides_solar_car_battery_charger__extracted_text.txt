solar car battery charger home  guides  what is a solar car battery charger what is solar energy solar energy can be produced anywhere that the sun reaches and is the earths most obtainable source of energy solar power is the process of harnessing the energy from the sun and using solar panels to transform sunlight into electricity solar panels commonly referred to as pv standing for photovoltaic work when 3 types of light are converted using cells at an atomic level into electricity you can now find solar farms both on land and floating on water generating power for thousands of homes and becoming more popular around the globe making appearances in france netherlands america uk and many more countries as a source of green energy how is solar energy used for transportation in 2017 the worlds first solar car charger the zappi was invented by robin richard and lee sutton for smart home energy management company myenergi this pioneering technology was a monumental breakthrough and influential product for other electric car chargers to follow the solar car battery charger can work like any standard charger if you dont own solar but has eco settings that allow you to take electricity produced by solar panels and send it straight into charging an electric car or motorbike this innovative practice allows you to be driving on sunshine railroads subways buses planes cars and even roads can all be powered by solar and solar transit is becoming a popular offering in the renewable energy sector what is a solar car battery charger charge for free from solar energy a solar car battery charger works by allowing you to use excess solar to power up your car generating solar energy requires solar panels or pv to be fitted to your home or place of work but the energy generated through the solar panels is totally free charge even when it isnt sunny there is a big misconception that solar panels only work on a sunny day photovoltaic panels pv solar panels can use both direct or indirect sunlight to produce power although solar panels are most effective in direct sunlight a rainy day can help clean any dirt or dust off your panels making them work more efficiently solar panels will still work even when the light is reflected or partially blocked by clouds another misconception is that solar works from heat produced by the sun but in fact when panels are exposed to temperatures above 77 degrees fahrenheit 25c they tend to work less efficiently how do solar panels charge my car battery light energy produced by the sun is called a photon it is the most basic fundamental particle of all light it is these photons in natural daylight that are converted by solar panel cells to produce electricity this small bundle of electromagnetic energy is constantly in motion simply put a solar panel works by allowing photons or particles of light to bounce into electrons setting them free from atoms generating a flow of electricity solar panels are comprised of many smaller parts called photovoltaic cells photovoltaic as described above simply means the conversion of sunlight into electricity solar panels use the spectrum of colours we are used to seeing visible but also ultraviolet and infrared which cannot be seen by the human eye different types of light that is converted by photovoltaic cells how is energy diverted to power my solar car battery charger introducing eddi the solar power diverter solar diverters take excess energy produced from your renewable energy sources such as solar pv and diverts it into a designated appliance such as an immersion heater or underfloor heating the myenergi eddi utilises this leftover energy making the most of the 100 green energy rather than exporting it back to the grid your power generation investment becomes more efficient product diverting the power back to your heating systems products featured in this guide zappi learn more eddi learn more will solar panels benefit me there are many things to consider when thinking about switching to solar and your return on investment roi will depend on your set up looking into your homes electricity need size of the solar pv system and financial incentive schemes will all help determine what kind of investment will see the quickest gain solar panels are worth it if you generate enough electricity and stay in the same house long enough solar panels absorb the suns energy to generate electricity for free which can help reduce your electricity bills significantly in addition variables like solar panel grants such as the smart export guarantee which is only for people in the uk who have a source of renewable energy can see a return on investment faster contact our team get in touch with us today if you have a
