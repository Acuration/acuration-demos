panels work with battery storage home  guides  how do solar panels work with battery storage whether you already have solar panels or youre thinking of making the change you might be a little worried about what happens if you run out of electricity after all the idea of being stuck in the dark after a rainy day or not being able to make a cup of tea in the winter is quite scary although one option is using electricity from the grid if youve chosen solar panels as a costsaving option or to be more environmentally conscious this can seem counterintuitive this is where a battery storage system like libbi will help not only elevate these concerns but also ensure youre making the most out of your solar panels why would i need battery storage although very sunny days might be few and far between in ireland that doesnt mean your solar panels arent still hard at work your solar panels can generate enough electricity to power your home even when its overcast but what happens to your excess energy when it is sunny and your panels generate more than you need without a battery storage system that excess energy just gets sent right back to the grid although it sounds nice to be giving energy back to the grid to help your neighbours benefit from renewable energy sources it doesnt help you on very rainy days or at night during times when youre not producing as much as you need you would rely on energy from the grid at a cost to yourself and potentially from nonrenewable sources this is where a battery storage system will have a greater impact on your home needs battery storage systems like libbi can store excess energy for you to tap into whenever you need it how does a battery storage system work although there are lots of technical elements involved it can essentially be broken down into 6 simple steps energy conversion your solar panels convert sunlight into direct current dc electricity this is all happening on an atomic scale and you wont really be able to tell anything is happening just by looking at your panels inverter because the dc electricity is not compatible with most household appliances it needs to be converted into alternating current ac electricity this is done using an inverter which basically forces the dc to alternate its direction repeatedly and very quickly in a very short space of time charge controller to make sure that the battery is charged at the correct rate and not over or undercharging a charge controller is used to regulate the voltage this maximises the battery lifespan battery charging the battery is then charged in the same way any rechargeable battery is charged like your electric vehicle or even your mobile phone battery discharging when your solar panels arent generating enough electricity you can then use the energy stored in your battery to power your home on a single full charge of a 5kwh unit libbi can provide up to 89 hours of television watching battery management system bms this is an
