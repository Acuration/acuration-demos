south the climate is milder nuuk is the most populated city in the south with temperatures varying between 11c and 10c rarely going below 18c or above 12c july is the only month when greenlands temperature reaches above freezing greenland is one of the best countries in the world for clean air and because the humidity is low visibility is excellent unique factors about greenland greenland is the worlds largest island the name greenland means land of people greenland is more than three times the size of us state of texas despite having a land size of 216 million sq km there are no roads or railway system that connects settlements to one another  there are roads within the towns but they end at the outskirts greenland is the worlds least densely populated country the capital nuuk is one of the worlds smallest capital cities by population and the worlds most northern country capital scientists have estimated that the greenland ice sheet is between 400000 and 800000 years old greenlands first ever world televised motor sport race will take place on 28th  29th august 2021 which will be the extreme e series find out more here wildlife facts greenland has the worlds largest national park which is one of the reasons for its widespread and abundant wildlife and as its so vast and relatively accessible the wildlife thrives and is undisturbed the countrys plant life is characterised as tundra vegetation as is consists of plants like sedge and cotton grass several species of land mammals live on the island including polar bears musk oxen reindeer arctic foxes snow hares ermines and lemmings seals whales cod salmon flounder and halibut are found in the surrounding waters and greenlands rivers contain salmon and arctic char certain species like blue whale are protected and cannot be fished and each administrative area has a certain quota of whales seals and fish assigned to it to ensure theres no over fishing existing renewable infrastructure greenland has ambitions to become a sustainable island with 90 renewable energy by 2030 hydropower is the main renewable source that provides 6070 of greenlands entire electricity needs this is generated by five hydropower plants which proved energy to the communities of qaqortoq narsaq nuuk sisimiut ilulissat and tasiilaq existing ev infrastructure the greenland government has recognised that the problem with owning electric cars in greenland is the lack of access to charging facilities for those living in apartment buildings this is more than 70 of housing stock in nuuk in 2016 the public energy supply company nukissiorrfiit and the government started a pilot project to test the charging stations for evs using surplus energy from the local hydropower plant in nuuk in the project charging stations were installed by three apartment buildings with one rapid charging station in a public area of the city length of daylight in the summer months in greenland every year the sun does not set from may 25 to july 25 and stays visible throughout the entire day and night on the arctic circle the midnight sun only lasts for about half an hour however the further north you get the longer it lasts june 21 is the longest day of the year and known as the summer solstice opportunity for mass solar fields in greenland solar cells can reduce the import of diesel in greenland mass solar fields would work well in greenland where the lighting conditions are good for a large part of the year the current grid in greenland is run by the multifunctional utility nukissiorfiit which has hired the danish energy association as a consultant to analyse which technical adaptations are needed in order to use solar energy without compromising electrical security or system stability nukissiorfiit selected the villages of ilimanaq and paamiut as case studies to analyse how specific solar projects affect the grid paamiut  relatively east to adapt a pv system to the grid but solar cells can force the diesel plant to run less efficiently which will affect the economy nukissiorfiit  has an advantage of having 46000 intelligent electricity heat and water meters already installed which means they have already take the first steps towards utilising the potential of flexible consumption manoeuvrable solar fields are a necessity in order to control new production when solar panels produce more energy than the residents and companies can use greenland will need to limit their production without flexible power consumption or energy storage there will be a loss of electricity from solar cells as well as an economic loss for the owners of solar cells there can also be limitations to batteries in the cold climate of greenland myenergis eddi solar diverter is being installed at a school in greenland along with a solar array battery storage and harvi unit to create a microgeneration system which will negate the need for noisy diesel generators which can be replicated across greenland to work towards their carbon neutral targets this is a joint venture between myenergi xite energy  extreme e known as the legacy programme read more about the programme here share story related news view
