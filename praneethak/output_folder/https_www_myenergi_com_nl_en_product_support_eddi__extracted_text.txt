exported from the grid energy generated by your pv plant or other system that is normally exported is surplus the eddi uses this surplus to charge up to 37kw or for waterhome heating preventing excess energy from disappearing into the grid how is converting energy to a resistance load beneficial for me as much as 80 of energy you generate as surplus can be delivered back to the grid the eddi can help you use 100 of your selfgenerated energy which is completely free how does eddi help me save money the eddi allows you to store energy as hot water or heating when you are not there later in the

should go eddi and zappi then work together to use as much free energy as possible what is varisin varisine technology ensures that the energy from eddi is of the same quality as electricity entering your home through the grid this technology is the reason eddi meets all ce product directives we always advise you to read up on whether your products meet the standards when you choose cheaper energy diverters for your hot water for example it does save money in the beginning but in the end it can also cost you extra money why not install a cheaper energy inverter like a phase inverter devices with phase angle measurements deal with large loads up to 3kw which creates unwanted harmonic currents in the power system this can cause electrical and radio interference overheat and cause damage to diverters and other electrical devices and equipment by using pwm varisine as a control method eddi is the only device on the market that complies with regulatory requirements regarding limits on harmonic current emissions and other important emc standards what if i dont have a hot water tank you can still use eddi if you have an electric microgen system and the following  electric storage
