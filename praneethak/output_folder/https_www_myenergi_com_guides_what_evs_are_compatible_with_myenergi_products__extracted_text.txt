products home  guides  what ev home chargers are compatible with myenergi products compatibility with ev home chargers were proud to make renewable energy products and ev home chargers that work in harmony with a fantastic range of electric vehicles evs following the success of teslas range of evs many automakers have invested resources in the electric market as the battery technology develops further electric cars are only going to become more efficient and sustainable with government incentives in place such as scrapping of the bik tax on electric company cars to make the uk carbon neutral by 2050 evs are rapidly becoming the future of the transport industry new innovative charging and green technologies are making owning an electric car the most sensible environmental and economical option for many motorists but how do evs interact with such tech you ask zappi  the worlds first solar home ev charger firstly lets introduce zappi  our ecosmart ev charger zappis versatility means it can use electricity both from the grid and from domestic renewable sources  like wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels capable of charging your car using 100 free renewable energy from your solar pv or wind generation zappi puts sustainability straight into the hands of the user even if you havent got a photovoltaic system or something similar zappi can import electricity from the grid if you do have a pv system zappi gives you the ability to charge your vehicle with surplus energy thats generated from your own solar panels and wind turbines what evs are compatible with zappi the list of zappi compatible evs includes but is not limited to jaguar  ipace volvo  xc40 recharge smart car  the smart eq fortwo and forfour tesla  the whole tesla range

electric land rover  the whole land rover phev range bmw  the full bmw i range of phevs citroen  the citroen electric and plugin hybrid range volkswagen  the volkswagen id range nissan  the nissan leaf kia  the niro range hyundai  kona hyundai  ionic zappi home ev charger explained can zappi be used by hybrid cars standard hybrid cars are similar to petrol or diesel engined vehicles the difference is in the engine as hybrids have a regular combustion engine and an electric motor  meaning theres no need to charge however some manufacturers are creating plugin hybrids or phevs that have more powerful batteries that can be recharged by plugging in the car the land rover phev or mitsubishi outlander phev for instance are plugin hybrids compatible with our zappi charger why does zappi have different charging modes zappi has three different types of charging mode fast eco and eco these modes give you the power to decide how quickly and economically to charge your ev fast charge on fast charge zappi prioritises time by using energy from your renewable generator and the grid eco mode on eco mode zappi becomes an intelligent device that adjusts the charge rate to minimise taking energy from the grid by only taking the energy it needs zappi is wired into your homes electrical switchboard so it can sense when excess electricity is sent to the grid eco mode when zappi is set to eco mode it detects electricity going out to the grid and turns itself on to start charging your car whilst also matching the charge rate with the amount of electricity currently being exported what evs are compatible with other myenergi products our zappi harvi and eddi are all engineered to work in harmony together  making easy selfconsuming renewable energy a reality for everyone

diverts excess energy from the microgeneration system to heat water or rooms rather than exporting it back to the grid harvi the harvi is used alongside zappi and eddi and is an energyharvesting wireless sensor that measures how much energy is generated and how much goes to the grid the renewable energy dream at myenergi our deam is for everyone to have access to renewable energy and have the
