myenergi bik on electric cars no more tax on ev company cars home  blog  bik on electric cars no more tax on ev company cars from 6th april 2020 company car drivers will no longer pay benefitinkind bik tax on electric cars this new initiative is part of the governments continued efforts to encourage the transition to low emission and electric vehicles the new tax reductions and exemptions mean that businesses who provide emissionsfree electric company cars will pay no bik tax rate in 202021 company car fleets contribute to almost six in 10 new car registrations in the uk however the updated measures will incentivise the uks one million company car drivers to shift to electric cleaner more environmentallyfriendly models that produce far less co2 emissions what are biks not to be confused with income tax benefits in kind biks are the perks people receive from their employment that arent included in their salary or wage packet examples of benefits in kind can include company cars and private medical insurance some of these are already taxfree such as the contributions paid by an employer into your approved occupational or personal pension scheme however benefits in kind for company cars are taxed your bik rate which usually covers the tax year depending on how you choose to pay it is based on the emissions the car produces and how much it costs company car drivers who go electric will pay absolutely zero bik tax from april 2020 thus presenting yet another huge advantage of joining the electric revolution no bik how will this work her majestys treasury has created two new bik tables for company car drivers one table is for those driving a company car registered after april 6 2020 and one is for those driving a company car registered before april 6 2020 the treasury says that for cars first registered from april 6 2020 most company car tax rates will be reduced by two percentage points that means for a pure electric vehicle with zero tailpipe emissions company car drivers will be taxed at 0 paying no bik tax at all the zero percentage rate also applies to company car drivers in electric vehicles registered before april 6 2020 who were already receiving a reduced rate of 2 for 202021 pure electric company cars registered before april 6 2020 will also increase to 1 and 2 in subsequent years from 202122 to 202223 does the 0 bik include hybrid cars its not only electric vehicles that will be exempt from bik in 2020  plugin hybrid cars are also included in the zero company car tax rate plugin hybrid models need to officially emit less than 50 grams per kilometre of co2 and be able to travel for at least 130 miles as a pure electric vehicle to be eligible hybrid company car drivers will also benefit from zero bik tax from april 6 2020 rising to one per cent and two per cent in subsequent years fortunately there are tax breaks for drivers of hybrid models with shorter electriconly ranges plugin hybrids with an official electric range of less than 30 miles will be subject to 12 per cent bik from april next year which is still less than a conventional combustion engine how will this affect us this is a milestone event for the ev industry and for businesses over the country as there are now real and measurable incentives to make the transition to electric or hybrid engines by providing the appropriate percentages the government claims that businesses will have the ability to make more informed decisions about how they make the transition to zero emission fleets this development is an exciting step in the right direction for our countrys efforts to tackle climate change which is at the heart of everything we do at myenergi by making electric vehicles the new normal were taking the climate crisis into our own hands whilst
