founder  jordan brompton spotlighted in the successful founder home  blog  inspiring female founder  jordan brompton spotlighted in the successful founder jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi was recently spotlighted in the successful founder and spoke with them about myenergi and how we came to be myenergi is one of the worlds fastestgrowing eco tech firms were best known for designing zappi  the first ever ev charger capable of using 100 renewable energy zero fossil fuels zero reliance on the grid zero emissions travel we founded the business in 2016 with nothing  apart from a few good ideas and a serious passion for change despite suffering countless setbacks demand has boomed indeed weve grown rapidly from a handful of staff manufacturing products by hand in a countryside workshop to a workforce of more than 400 operating from a stateoftheart facility in stallingborough with subsidiaries opened in ireland germany the netherlands and australia along the way as cmo im responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the sales and marketing divisions driving business growth and spearheading corporate collaborations how did the idea come to you for the company rather than a fairytale story dreamt up in a shiny glass citycentre skyscraper the idea behind myenergi came from a conversation over a bottle of wine we couldnt understand why there wasnt a way for ev drivers to charge their cars via solar panels so decided to create our own pioneering product was it possible was it practical were there hundreds of zeroemission motorists out there all feeling the same way rather than undertaking years of market research and spending millions of dollars on focus groups we went on google we couldnt find any competitor products past the end of page two so had the madcap idea of teaming up to solve the problem  based on nothing more than gut feel alone how did you achieve awareness when we founded myenergi i wanted to build a company that consumers really bought into rather than a faceless corporation with great products but no character i wanted the market to see that we were different  a passionate team committed to sustainability fuelled by innovation and intent on delighting our customers but with limited marketing budget we had to think outside the box we used social media to celebrate our successes we went to trade events and showcased our product developments we used our black book of contacts to get wholesalers on board and we physically knocked on doors to have our voices heard as the business grew so did our brand we were soon invited to join panel discussions about the future of energy we were asked to be guests on podcasts about startup businesses we got ourselves involved in webinars about the future of tech and we visited as many events as we could to shout about what made us different defying convention we communicated openly we told the market everything  our successes our challenges and our aspirations we told them about our breakthroughs and we told them when we fell short in essence we brought them on the journey with us while wearing your heart on your sleeve may sound pretty terrifying it really worked rather than customers we built advocates how have you been able to gain funding and grow having started the business with nothing except for our life savings finances have always been tight the first product prototype took almost a year to develop and by this point our money had all but run out to keep our dream alive we ran a crowdfunding round online we needed 40000 to keep afloat but raised just 10000 by this point the future seemed pretty bleak we were out of money and we were running out of time we believed in what we were trying to achieve but needed a miracle to take things to the next level the picture changed when we met tv personality robert llewellyn at a trade event in orkney he was filming an episode for his ev youtube channel and loved our product he featured us which you can watch here and  from that day on  the phone began to ring we were growing organically but progress was slow we needed a significant capital injection to take things to the next level and so set about building a network of possible investors thanks to growing interest and our entrepreneurial spirit we started to catch the attention of the finance community experienced financiers sir terry leahy and bill currie were blown away by our story and we were invited to their liverpool offices to pitch our case the rest as they say is history we gave the pitch of our lives and right there on the spot were offered a 18m investment  it felt like dragons den i realised almost immediately that what we were doing wasnt just a clever idea but a business opportunity that had the legs to go global what are the key successes it might sound clich√© but our story has been somewhat of a whirlwind since landing funding weve grown from a team of two to staff numbers in excess of 400 there are now more than 3000 approved zappi installers in the uk alone while more than 400000 myenergi products have been shipped worldwide over the past three years weve experienced an average annual growth of more than 180 and were already targeting both new market entry and new product development what wereare the challenges and how have you overcome these while every day of the myenergi journey has been an exciting adventure weve experienced so many ups and downs along the way being an entrepreneur and doing what you love is tough its competitive its challenging its cruel and sometimes it feels like everything wants you to fail weve been through the rollercoaster of brexit component shortages and the pandemic  all in the first five years of our journey  not to mention the premature birth of my daughter but weve taken risks overcome obstacles and learnt from our mistakes through it all however perseverance and a desire to be successful have seen us come out stronger than ever what are your plans nowfor the future its fair to say that we have big plans were all set to further increase our manufacturing capacity and well be completing our brand new 60000 sq ft factory at our site in stallingborough later this year were also investing heavily in developing new products  having recently launched our libbi smart battery our continued growth really excites me were targeting new markets were experiencing huge demand for our products and were quickly becoming a household name in the future id love to see more people using our products to decarbonise their homes becoming totally energy independent and giving back to the environment when it comes to electric vehicle charging were very quickly moving from early adoption to the mass marketmajority stages people love our products and get hooked on our software im so proud of what weve achieved and want to help more people live with less reliance on the grid what would you like to share with others to encourage them to start their own entrepreneurship journey while ill always fly the flag for entrepreneurship its important to be prepared and not to underestimate the monumental challenges of starting your own business if you go in with the right attitude  to be persistent to be committed to expect failure and to never give up  you wont be disappointed can you share your top tips for entrepreneurial success i see so many inexperienced entrepreneurs trying to manage every element of their business attempting to keep control and tripping over in result it takes selfreflection and maturity to understand your weaknesses but pays dividends to bring in the right people to support you even if you cant necessarily afford it start looking to recruit a team that can pick up the areas in which youre less strong and enable you to focus on your strengths otherwise your business is likely to remain stationary its also important not to let the process overwhelm you i cant remember who told me this but the phrase worry about it when it happens has got me through no end of challenging situations when i start worrying about things that i cant control it really does set me on the straight and narrow who are the 5 people who inspire you the most and why i admire so many different people for so many different reasons my business partner lee is obviously an inspiration  ive worked with him for years and watched his incredible journey firsthand when it comes to household names elon musk spring to mind he challenges convention he solves problems he takes risks and has invested almost his entire net worth into making the planet a better place elsewhere i really admire the female leaders operating at the forefront of electrification and the renewable energy space juliet davenport at good energy avril palmerbaunack at bca and fiona howarth at octopus electric vehicles are just a few examples of inspiring women changing the face of the sector for the better if youd like to see jordans spotlight on the successful founder click here share story related news view all news about myenergi myenergi and grace beverley put green tech on
