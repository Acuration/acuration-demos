myenergi 1000 bill for motorists who fail to choose solarcompatible ev chargers home  blog  1000 bill for motorists who fail to choose solarcompatible ev chargers  chargers that are not solarcompatible are very likely to need replacing in future  millions of homes set to have solar as domestic installation rates have tripled  many car manufacturers still recommending ev chargers that are not futureproof with the transition to electrification continuing at pace and solar pv installations soaring failing to fit solarcompatible ev chargers on homes that have or could have solar panels in the future is a false economy  and it could cost motorists around 1000 to replace with a compatible charger in the future in 2022 domestic solar installations tripled the rates recorded in 2021 as uk consumers continue to consider alternative energy sources particularly given the global crisis we are calling for householders to install a home charger like the zappi that integrates with solar generation to maximise the opportunity for free clean selfgenerated green energy tom callow head of corporate communications at myenergi commented as ev registrations continue to grow demand for domestic chargers is rocketing however with so many options out there which should you choose while there are a number of excellent products available to specify we believe that consumers should be thinking about the future charging your ev with mains electricity is typical today but with decentralised domestic energy generation becoming evermore commonplace across the uk drivers should specify a device compatible with renewables to prevent buying twice at myenergi we believe that any ev driver who either has solar panels  or has the opportunity to install them in the future  should invest in a solarcompatible charger with ongoing concerns around the rising cost of energy taking advantage of solar power to keep costs down has become a hugely desirable option any ev driver installing a noncompatible device may come to regret their choice as they will need to replace it if they choose to invest in renewables car manufacturers and leasing companies that are recommending nonsolar chargers should therefore be making it clear that these chargers will not necessarily be futureproof for many whats more this shortterm thinking will undoubtedly create unnecessary ewaste in the longer term as the worlds first solarcompatible ev charger the myenergi zappi can operate as a mainsconnected home charger that optimises with time of use tariffs to enable cheaper and greener charging from the grid while also seamlessly integrating with solar generation to direct any available renewable energy to your car it does this without taking any energy from the grid in its most ecosmart mode callow concluded rather than seeing renewable energy exported back to the grid zappi users can instead plug in their ev and effectively charge for free  quick simple zero emissions
