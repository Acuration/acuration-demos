ticket technical support create a ticket requires a myaccount login register your zappi register now frequently asked questions about zappi do i need solar panels to use zappi no not at all zappi also works without solar panels as a normal charging station from 7kw to 22kw infinitely adjustable big advantage is that you can always charge safely thanks to load balancing technology also with zappi you can charge more economically thanks to the automatic link to charge with a dynamic energy contract at times when the rate is lowest what is required to install the zappi we recommend having your zappi installed by a licensed installer at least one separate group is required in your fuse box with a type a earth leakage circuit breaker of at least 20a and up to 32a curve b how many cts are included with each zappi 1 ct for the 1phase version and 3 cts for the 3phase version isare included how does charging with dynamic rates work you can charge in the most economical way with zappi by using dynamic rates there are several energy suppliers that provide a special contract where you pay a different rate every hour depending on the purchase price this rate is determined 24 hours in advance depending on consumption sun and wind and other parameters through an automatic link with this purchase price zappi can decide for you to choose the most favorable rates and delay or start charging this way you have a full battery every day but pay significantly less what is the minimum charge level for the 3phase zappi in all cases the limiting factor is the vehicle the ev some evs cannot be charged with a 3phase and so can only be charged with a 1phase the power supply is also limited by the ev usually it is 16a 30a or 32a if your ev can be charged with 3phase zappi has the ability to charge at a low rate by using only the 1phase this is a big advantage over other brands so with our zappi charging with smaller solar panel installations can be as low as 14kw 1phase charging range  14 kw  07 kw 3phase charging range  41 kw  22 kw can i charge at different rates in the phases of 3phase charging no when charging with the 3phase the rate will be determined by phase with the lowest available power value the ev can only charge if all phases are the same can the new 3phase zappi be connected to a 1phase yes it then behaves like a standard 1phase zappi but only the 1 ct input will be available in most cases it is then necessary to use a harvi note for belgian users it is not possible to use a 3phase zappi on a power network with 3 x 230v without neutral as still present in some areas in belgium also if your home has a singlephase connection where the base of the power grid has no neutral neuter you can only use a singlephase version can i swap an existing charger with the zappi yes you can do that with zappi the operation is very similar but make sure you connect the ct sensors these are necessary to take full advantage of the zappis smart technology also an internet connection ethernet or wifi is recommended to use the app and myaccount page can the zappi be installed next to my existing charger without overloading my main fuse it depends on the installation you can install zappi by using a circuit breaker in your current main installation and setting a net limit to ensure that you dont blow your main fuse or you can install zappi from a second installation and connect a sensor that acts as a monitor limit to ensure that your second main fuse does not overload in addition to the net limit it is wise to consult your installer for these more complex situations can i switch between 3phase and 1phase charging a 3phase zappi connected to a 3phase system can be installed to charge in an eco mode using only 1phase it is very useful when you want to charge at a low rate to use your surplus in eco mode this allows you to charge from as little as 14kw of surplus and make maximum use of your own energy generation of course you always have the option to charge faster up to 22kw in fast mode or by using the boost function can i charge an ev that can only charge on 1phase with a 3phase zappi yes absolutely does zappi also support vehicle to grid v2g  vehicle to home v2h  no we are an innovative company and constantly working on new developments once v2g  v2h becomes available in the market we will definitely expand our products to follow this technology currently these technologies are only made available in test phases car manufacturers and charging station manufacturers are working closely to roll this out as soon as possible but there are still many challenges how do the eco and eco modes work when i charge with 3phase for eco and eco mode we recommend charging on 1phase and it is fully automatic the advantage is that you can then already charge from 14kw of surplus current the amount of surplus current is measured over 3 phases the total is then sent to the car via 1phase so that the balance of 3 phases on the counter remains 0 zero so here it does not matter whether a 1phase inverter or a 3phase inverter is used for the solar panels even combinations of multiple inverters do not affect the operation of the eco  eco charging modes what can i measure with the cts at the 3phase zappi cts can be connected to the main connection the solar panel inverter a house battery or a subdivision for a 3phase zappi the cts should be connected to the 3phase main connection power grid this can be wired into the zappi or wirelessly via a harvi you cannot connect different types of cts they must be installed on the same source this is different with the 1phase version of zappi which can measure 3 different 1 phase loads mains production andor a house battery for example which evs can charge with 3phase almost all electric cars can charge 3 phase 11kw any car that can charge 3phase can also charge 1phase any car that can only charge 1phase can be charged with a 3phase charge point zappi downloads user
