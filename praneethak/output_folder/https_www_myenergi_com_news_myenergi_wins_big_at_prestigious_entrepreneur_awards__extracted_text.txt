biggest and best yet celebrating britains ambitious driven and inspirational entrepreneurs for a decade has been an honour and weve learnt so much from hearing all of their unique stories and perspectives the extraordinary circumstances of the last few years have tested the resilience of our business communities and the challenges were enough to give many entrepreneurs an excuse to give up instead our award winners did the opposite and through ingenuity innovation and the ability to adapt they thrived these challenges certainly havent gone away and the next few years will present new obstacles to overcome  but one only needed to look around the room at our tenth anniversary to see some of the truly special founders and doers to gain confidence that this snapshot of the economy can go on and adapt again wed like to congratulate all of our 2022 winners for all of their hard work and achievements  we look forward to following your lead into 2023 and beyond for more information
