charged using charging stations in all manner of public car parks you can also install a home charger such as the zappi for more convenient charging and at a reduced cost if you have solar panels at home you may also want to utilise zappi with these for even cleaner driving how long does it take to charge the nissan ariya 87kwh 12 hours 15 minutes using a standard 7kwh charger such as zappi it would take just over 12 hours to fully charge your 87kwh battery the nissan ariya 87kwh also has the capability to be charged on the 22kwh zappi which would reduce this charging time down to 4 hours and 45 minutes what is the range of the nissan ariya 87kwh 280 miles the range of the nissan ariya with the 87wh battery differs between 200 miles and 410 miles depending on your driving conditions

port on the nissan ariya to charge your nissan ariya simply attach your electric charger to the charging port near the front passengerside door and connect it to any appropriate charging source unlike many car manufacturers nissan supplies a charging cable giving you slow charging from any of your regular home outlets it should be noted that this will take longer than plugging into a designated charging station as the output of power from your home sockets is considerably less how much is the nissan ariya starting from a reasonable 33645 for the 63kwh engage the nissan ariya comes in 9

point prices correct as of october 2023 how big is the nissan ariya the nissan ariya is a little larger than the qashqai and is a pretty standard overall size for its category despite the ample passenger room in the ariya more so than the kia evq nissan has chosen to prioritise storage for your gadgets rather than for your luggage the boot is a little smaller than many of its rivals with a maximum storage capacity of 466 litres one thing to bear in mind is that the fourwheel drive models drop to 408 litres giving you even less space that being said nissan has designed the ariya to not have a transmission tunnel unlike most other electric cars meaning there is a flat floor giving passengers greater leg room how high is the nissan ariya measuring 166m tall the nissan ariya will have no trouble fitting under bridges and tunnels although its not as large as some of its rivals such as the hyundai ioniq 5 its still a pretty substantial car if youre worried about parking this large car dont be there are plenty of cameras to help you park as well as excellent visibility which no doubt had a hand in acquiring the 5star ncap rating of the nissan ariya however the back view is partially obstructed by some hefty rear screen pillars which may cause you to alter the view you rely on when squeezing into those tight car parking spaces similar electric vehicles compatible with
