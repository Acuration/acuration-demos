explained home  guides  smart charge point regulations explained ev charging has changed on 30th june 2022 the electric vehicles smart charge point regulations 2021 came into force catchy title isnt it changing the way we charge electric vehicles on 30th december further developments to these regulations were introduced hang on dont you just plug in and charge well in theory yes charging your ev at home or work is really simple  although you can charge from a standard 13a socket  you ideally need to have a suitable charge point installed for topping up your battery previously charge points simply need to be internet connected  which often means some nice visual tools in a mobile app  with some charge points also allowing you to set schedules so that you charge overnight when the electricity prices from some energy suppliers are lower great for ev drivers but what happens if every ev starts charging at the same time there are lots of people who enjoy spreading doom and gloom about evs and the electricity supply according to the national grid who manage the electricity transmission network there is plenty of capacity to meet the future electricity demand  but not if everyone charges at the same time which is what the new smart charge point regulations are aiming to solve how does the electricity grid work although its now possible to buy batteries for your home and of course an ev is just a big battery on wheels its very difficult and expensive to store the vast amounts of energy supplied through the electricity network instead the grid works by continuously balancing the amount of electricity generated by power stations wind turbines and solar panels to match the total electricity demand at the same time if the demand goes up then more generation needs to be turned on national grid also have the option to ask customers to reduce their load  something called a demand response service smart charge point regulations the problem we could face with ev charging is that if everyone starts to charge at the same time ie at the start of a low price electricity tariff then the increase in demand will be too quick for the generators to respond in the extreme case that could lead to power cuts this becomes even trickier as our grid decarbonises  more renewable electricity generated means we cant easily switch on more generators and instead we need to be more intelligent with how we use power no wonder the government are paying attention how do the charge point regulations help along with some provisions around cyber security and the protection of customer data the smart charge point regulations introduce three new requirements default offpeak charging a random delay at the start and end of the charge steps to promote customers to sign up to demand response services a further two requirements were added as of 30th december further cyber security improvements inclusion of a tamper detection kit optimum charging charge points are now set up so that the ev charges at the best time for the electricity network the peak demand  or rushhour periods on the grid  happen in the morning and late afternoon so by default evs will only charge overnight or during the middle of the day myenergi zappis are set to charge in offpeak hours by default 00000800 thats good for the grid and better for the environment as generation tends to produce more co2 during the peak periods meaning we rely more on gas fired power stations at these times if youre used to your ev charging as soon as you plug it in or youre desperate for a charge then you can override these settings but the intention of the new smart charge point regulations is to encourage more ev charging at the off peak times random delay charging as of june 30th every new ev charger sold now includes a random delay of up to 10 minutes every time an ev starts to charge so even when youve scheduled your charger to start poweringup your ev your car wont start to charge straight away thats pretty unnerving for a lot of drivers who want the reassurance that their battery will be full when they next use their car if you have your own generation such as solar or wind you might be thinking this will mean there could be a delay using your surplus theres no need to worry though if you have your own generation you can still charge from your excess energy and randomised delay does not apply it also effects on anyone using a low price tariff lets say that the tariff runs from 0030 to 0430am instead of starting to charge at 0030 the ev might not start charging until 0040 which means the customer has lost out on a few minutes of low rate electricity similarly the charge may not stop until 0440  so thats 10 minutes of charging at the higher electricity tariff this is not a huge cost on a single daily charge and most ev drivers consider this a small price to pay to keep the lights on but its important that we explain these new changes to avoid confusion to give you extra peace of mind a message will display in the myenergi app when the random delay is active demand response services using domestic loads are quite rare myenergi were part of the fred trial which was one of the first to demonstrate how evs could be used on large scale to balance the grid smart green electricity grid the government have recognised that with millions of evs all plugged into the grid that we have a huge battery that can be used to help balance the grid however that wont work if theres a 10 minute delay every time national grid need to call on that reserve operators in the energy system including distribution networks and energy suppliers also have the option to ask customers to change the time or rate of their charge this is called demand side response services dsrs that is why any ev charger that is providing dsrs is excluded from the 10minute delay there is a lot to do to explain these services to ev drivers so they are happy to sign up and pass some of the control of their charging to a third party this is an important step towards the smart green electricity grid frequently asked questions randomised delay the basics why is there a random delay when my charge starts making a small change can have a big impact if everyone starts or stops charging at the same time the load on the grid will increase too quickly for the electricity generators to respond the randomised delay stops this happening by making sure that everyone does not start to charge at the same time for instance if lots of people have set a scheduled charge to match their electricity tariff following the new regulations zappi will randomly wait up to 10 minutes after the scheduled charge time to start charging and at the end when the charge is stopping can i turn off the delay permanently no as set out in government legislation the delay must happen when your car is charging from the grid to ensure that energy demand is kept stable at all times of the day how long does the random delay last for the delay will be no longer than 10 minutes and it will start when your charging session is due to commence for example if you come home from work at 5pm and plug your car in and you have a schedule set to start at 1am the delay will start at 1am this also applies at the end of your charging session unless your car is already full  in which case the car will stop charging more information can i override the random 10 minute delay if i need my car to start charging immediately yes this can be done by pressing the  button on the zappi device or using the ev screen in the mobile app does randomised delay mean there could be a 10minute delay before i can unplug my car no randomised delay only applies on a scheduled charge event you will still be able to unplug straightway by either unplugging the cable from your vehicle or stopping the charging session on zappi or in the myenergi app what is randomised delay at the end of my charging session managing the grid is a balancing act demand and supply must be carefully balanced imagine if everyone stopped charging at the same moment this could cause a huge drop in demand on the electricity grid which could cause grid instability to prevent this randomised delay will mean your car might stop charging up to 10 minutes after its scheduled stop time your energy i like to charge so that i match the offpeak hours on my electricity tariff what does randomised delay mean to me randomised delay means your charging session might take up to 10 minutes to start and could overrun by up to 10 minutes after your scheduled time keep in mind that the delay could be anywhere from a few seconds up to 10 minutes and is different each time sometimes you will not even notice it will there be a delay when using my surplus local generation to charge my car randomised delay does not apply when charging from your own surplus generation such as solar or wind when in eco or eco mode does randomised delay mean my car could be overcharged no your vehicle will stop the charging session as soon as your vehicle is full or reaches its target battery level regardless of any delay smart scheduling  default offpeak charging the basics can i override the schedules youve set yes you can simply update them on your zappi device screen by going to the charge settings menu or by using your myenergi app how do i reapply the default schedules you can reapply the default schedule by accessing the timed boosts section in your myenergi app where the default hours are preset for you the start time and days this applies to are already set simply select set why does my zappi have schedules already programmed one of the intentions of the smart charging regulations is to encourage ev drivers to charge their cars during times where demand on the energy grid is lower to meet this requirement we have set a default offpeak schedule between 0000  0800 to promote the benefits of charging during these times this time overlaps with many of the cheapest dual rate and ev specific tariffs dynamic time of use tarriffs im on a dynamic time of use energy tariff do these regulations still apply to me yes they do all energy tariffs are subject to the regulations so the random delay will also be applied at the start and end of each scheduled charge period you can schedule your ev charging around your tariff rather than sticking to the default times using the my schedules feature in the myenergi online account myaccount or by entering them in the myenergi app connected chargers faqs my zappi will not be connected to the internet will smart charging regulations apply to me yes zappi will automatically configure smart charging regulations on first setup please keep in mind like all electronic clocks zappis internal clock will drift without an internet connection you can manage your default schedule under the charge settings menu on the zappi display we recommend that you do connect your zappi to the internet to get the full use of the smart features the myenergi app and can update your zappi with new firmware when it becomes available charge logs faqs can i download my charging history yes by accessing your account at httpsmyaccountmyenergicom you can download your charging history in excel or csv format how far back can i view this information for from the 30th june 2022 we will make 13 months of historical charging data available for you to view and download where can i access my evs charging history you can access the charging history for your zappi by
