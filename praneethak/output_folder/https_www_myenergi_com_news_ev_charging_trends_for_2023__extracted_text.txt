2023 and the future of electrification home  blog  ev charging trends for 2023 and the future of electrification jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi gives her thoughts on the ev charging trends were likely to see in 2023 and discusses why the next 12 months will be a pivotal period for the uks transition to electrification most trends come and go but its safe to say that the future of transport is electric indeed despite global production challenges microchip shortages supply chain disruptions and the lasting impact of the covid19 pandemic 2022 was yet another recordbreaking year for ev registrations according to data from the society of motor manufacturers and traders smmt more than 300000 battery electric and plugin hybrid vehicles were collectively registered throughout the year  almost four times the number of diesel cars sold insight from statista suggests that this growth will only increase with a cagr of 1389 projected between now and 2027 leading to sales of more than 637000 new evs per annum as a result alongside the burgeoning growth of the used ev marketplace demand for charging solutions continues to increase at pace according to the international energy agency iea this will continue to see both public and private infrastructure grow rapidly  with significant investment expected in support so as we kickstart 2023 what themes are we likely to see emerge from the ev charging sector new products new legislation new tech developments new brands coming onstream or developing their footprint in the uk while it may just be speculation ive put together five key ev charging trends that i expect to see impact the marketplace as well as consumer charging behaviours over the coming months 1 the public charging network will continue to expand according to insight from mckinsey  company the growth of the uks public charging network continues at pace zap map suggests that there are now more than 36000 charging devices and 600000 connectors spread across almost 22000 locations nationwide this represents an increase of 33 since november 2021 with significant investment already planned from the markets leading brands were likely to see the network develop further in 2023 from new locations popping up on an almost daily basis to more superfast chargers being fitted than at any other time itll be easier than ever to charge your car onthego charging as a service caas is therefore expected to grow in 2023 put simply its the idea that offering a service for motorists to charge their vehicles isnt enough to generate significant revenue unless delivered on a mass scale instead if drivers are sat waiting for their ev to charge caas sees this free time used as a tool to encourage purchase behaviour  think free charging at supermarkets or the development of charging destinations featuring shopping centres retail facilities and restaurants companies like gridserve are dominating the marketplace and with more and more consumers starting to consider ev charging as part of their daily routine i only see this corner of the market continuing to expand 2 technology will improve customer experience although its positive to see more evs than ever plugged in to public charging points across the uk keeping charging stations free has become somewhat of a challenge in the past the bugbear for any ev driver was petrol or diesel vehicles blocking working charging points however now we have a new enemy  ev users that dont move their cars once charging has finished for consumers this leads to frustration and unnecessary delays for providers a clear loss of revenue in 2023 were likely to see new and innovative solutions unveiled to tackle the challenge from charging point sensors and a wealth of new apps to chargesfines for malpractice 3 domestic charging will become king while the headlines often surround public charging its important to remember that more than 85 of charging takes place at home as such im confident that the domestic charging market will see the fastest growth in 2023  resulting in an increase in unit sales and installations alongside a wealth of new products and technologies making it to market for those who dont have a driveway im certain that well see progress made towards developing safe secure hazardfree onstreet charging solutions for those who previously had to trail charging wires across the pavement weve already seen a number of developments here that will start to pick up pace as the year progresses with legislation introduced last year mandating the installation of smart chargers as standard to all new property developments the accessibility of domestic charging is quickly pushing range anxiety and public charge point availability issues into the history books 4 ecosmart charging will become commonplace continuing on the theme of domestic charging its worth mentioning the importance of futureproof tech and the ability to harness selfgenerated energy to charge your ev after all data from the microgeneration certification scheme suggests that more householders than ever are adopting renewables to offset their reliance on mains supply and reduce their carbon footprint this ev charging trend is expected to continue in 2023  especially when it comes to solar and domesticscale wind generation after all the energy price crisis rumbles on with no sign of abating any time soon meaning consumers are being forced to take matters into their own hands my advice is therefore to consider installing a renewablecompatible ev charger even if you dont yet have solar panels installed i predict that selfgeneration will boom over the coming years with more households than ever opting for decentralised green supply especially as return on investment periods are dropping fast think ahead and make sure you dont have to buy twice  its a false economy 5 v2g technology will develop further in the same sentence as smart charging youll often hear the terms v2h vehicle to home v2x vehicle to everything v2l vehicle to load and v2g vehicle to grid after all evs are basically just mobile batteries the idea behind v2g is the opportunity to store energy in the ev battery and return it to the grid in times of peak demand this would not only earn you money but also help to flatten electricity usage curves its a smart idea and one that could deliver significant value from a decentralised energy perspective at myenergi were working on numerous demand side response trials to see how the load balancing capability of evs could work in practice  its set to be a major talking point in 2023 the transition to electrification cofounder and cmo of myenergi jordan brompton while i may have referred to the above themes as trends for the new year in all honesty theyre far more the transition to electrification is growing in momentum and the industry is progressing quickly to support its future from caas and technology improvements to the incremental growth of domestic charging and its ability to balance the grid these trends are actually some of the key areas supporting growth  rather than gimmicks that will soon be forgotten at myenergi were excited to be driving the industry forward in 2023 and supporting the global transition to electrification we have a number of exciting announcements planned for the next 12 months and look forward to seeing the sector continue to grow to keep an eye on our latest news for updates and insights share story related news view all news about myenergi myenergi and grace beverley put
