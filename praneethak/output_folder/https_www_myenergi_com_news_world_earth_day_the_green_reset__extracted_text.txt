to landfill each year it also reduces the need for production using new or raw materials which means a reduction in air pollution water pollution greenhouse gas emissions and often a conservation of global resources some project ideas you could try below wash out old tin cans decorate with paints collage or by making holes in them to create pencil pots plant pots or a little money tin for a rainy

fridge revamp a photo frame or string together to make a cool piece of art for your garden scout out some furniture in the house or on a marketplace that needs some tlc give it a sand down change the handles try painting it a different colour or maybe even multi coloured upcycle and recycle projects ideas to try during thegreenreset 3 reduce food miles  minimise waste there are a number of reasons why buying local produce is great for you and the planet as well as supporting the local economy theres normally a lot less packaging involved and the produce is often fresher whats more theres a notable reduction in food miles so youre getting higher quality food while reducing the use of fossil fuels whats not to like its estimated that uk households waste 45million tonnes of food every year which creates greenhouse gases 21 times more damaging to the environment than co2 when left to rot in landfill so to prevent food waste from being damaging to your pocket and to the environment follow

than co2 when left to rot in landfill 4 invest in sustainable products as more of us become aware of harmful industry practices we are striving and searching for more sustainable alternatives as many of you may have found our society isnt built to support these green habits such as going plastic free eating a vegan diet or trying to lower your carbon emissions by making little changes like bringing our own bag to the super markets choosing a bar of soap over a bottle of shower gel refusing a plastic straw or investing in our own reusable coffee cups it sets a standard that will help push companies to follow below are some ideas tips and swaps for eco living dont throw away all your plastic items in your home in the pursuit to go plastic free this is just contributing to the problem instead try to use what you have for as long as possible until it needs replacing bags for life for life lets be honest we have all seen someone use a bag for life as a bin bag head in hands moment these types of carriers are more durable if they get into the natural environment taking up to 1000 years to break down into micro plastics which continue to absorb toxins and pollute the environment so to tackle this problem make your own tote bags out of old clothing curtains or buy from a company who supports something bigger such as surfers against sewage check our their tote bags here swap defuser sticks which can trigger respiratory problems or be poisonous for your animals for natural candles such as ebb and flos wellness candle which you can find here take a reusable coffee cup to your favourite local coffee shop we recommend chillys  take a look here use bars of soap without plastic packaging instead of shower gels next time your toothbrush has served its time try swapping to a bamboo toothbrush ones with charcoal claim to help make your teeth whiter too remove single use plastic products from your cleaning routine and swap to to a cleaner way of cleaning with ocean saver products when we collectively support responsibly manufactured products fairtrade standards and be more mindful with our investments we are pushing those that are still implementing environmentallyharmful and dishonest practices to make the necessary changes in their company culture simple changes amongst the masses encourages big changes across big industries plastic toothbrushes take over 400 years to decompose even then they break down into micro plastics and can fill the stomachs of marine life 5 grow your own with summer on the horizon think of how much fun you could have with the kids grandkids or even a little healthy competition between friends growing your own fresh fruits and vegetables there is something magical about planting seeds in some dirt and waiting to see the little babies start to sprout up into a wild array of stems leaves and shoots besides being extremely proud of your handywork there will be no plastic packaging you wont have to travel to the supermarket and they will always be field fresh you could even gift your family and friends with any quirky extra produce if you dont fancy yourself as a green fingers or havent got a garden space why not treat yourself to some low maintenance easy keepers like succulents or air filtering plants every home looks great with a burst of green here and there and air filtering plans

education when making new purchases is having a negative ripple effect on people and the planet from the early farming processes right through to manufacturing and packaging the fashion industry is now known as the second most polluting industry in the world buy less choose well and make it last for the green reset starting 22nd april 2021 challenge yourself to try to shop secondhand or mend clothing that needs a little tlc upcycling existing resources means that we dont have to use any new raw materials in the production process 80 billion garments are produced each year and on average we only wear each item 7 times before it ends up in the bin cotton covers just 24 of the worlds cultivated land but uses more of the worlds pesticides and insecticides than any other single major crop did you know that it takes 2700 liters to produce the cotton needed to make a single tshirt and the pesticides used are some of the most harmful to our health and environment go organic bag up clothes that you dont wear anymore and pass it around family and friends before taking it to a charity shop invest in better quality items that will last longer and you will love wearing check for industry standards labels such as fair trade or organic cotton research ways in which you can mend or repair the clothes you have here are some ideas to get started 80 billion garments are produced each year

depths which covers 71 percent of the earths surface recently media and organisations are shining a spotlight on some of the most poignant problems the globe is facing and a lot of it starts with our oceans surfers against sewage are making sure the government recognise the importance of a thriving ocean for the planet and people and to utilise its capacity as a solution to the climate crisis 1 ocean rewilding and blue carbon habitat restoration we want to see an increased investment and associated targets in ocean rewilding to allow blue carbon habitats to thrive and actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in order to achieve negative carbon emissions 2 implementation of highly protected marine areas hpmas we want to see the implementation of hpmas to fully protect marine species from human disruption and to allow ecosystems to recover we need marine areas where deep sea mining is banned commercial fishing is prevented oil and gas exploration is ceased and pollution inputs are tightly regulated 3 recognition of the importance of marine ecosystems for human wellbeing we want governments at cop26 to acknowledge the pivotal role the ocean plays in sustaining economies and societal wellbeing and to ensure protection of coastal communities against the climatic changes we can no longer prevent such as sea level rise and flooding other hot topic in the media is the new netflix documentary seaspiracy experts claim that fishing takes 27 trillion fish from ocean every year marine biologist dr sylvia alice earle shares that the ocean will be empty  and soon if fishing continues at the rate it is currently at the estimate is by middle of 21st century if we keep taking wild fish at the level we are today there wont be enough fish to catch predicting virtually empty oceans by by as soon as 2048 she shares as well as over fishing ship slavery and bottom trawling this sheer amount of innocent marine life and coral that is destroyed cannot continue as many as 50 million sharks are caught every year and are categorised as bycatch which is a term used to described fish and mammals that are unintentionally caught in the process of mass fishing at
