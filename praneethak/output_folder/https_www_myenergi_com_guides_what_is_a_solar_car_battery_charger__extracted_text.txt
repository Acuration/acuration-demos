charger home  guides  what is a solar car battery charger what is solar energy solar energy can be produced anywhere that the sun reaches and is the earths most obtainable source of energy solar power is the process of harnessing the energy from the sun and using solar panels to transform sunlight into electricity solar panels commonly referred to as pv standing for photovoltaic work when 3 types of light are converted using cells at an atomic level into electricity you can now find solar farms both on land and floating on water generating power for thousands of homes and becoming more popular around the globe making appearances in france netherlands america uk and many more countries as a source of green energy how is solar energy used for transportation in 2017 the worlds first solar car charger the zappi was invented by robin richard and lee sutton for smart home energy management company myenergi this pioneering technology was a monumental breakthrough and influential product for other electric car chargers to follow the solar car battery charger can work like any standard charger if you dont own solar but has eco settings that allow you to take electricity produced by solar panels and send it straight into charging an electric car or motorbike this innovative practice allows you to be driving on sunshine railroads subways buses planes cars and even roads can all be powered by solar and solar transit is becoming a popular offering in the renewable energy sector what is a solar charger zappi is the worlds first solar charger invented by robin richard and lee sutton introduced pioneering technology greatly influencing many similar products that followed zappi works with our without solar panels pv but for those with them installed it can harness the power of the sun you will be able to utilise the various eco settings which will allow you to use selfgenerated energy to charge your electric vehicle solar is transforming the prospects of the transportation industry for which railroads subways buses planes cars and even roads can utilise this amazing technology to both save money and better the planet its a win win solution shop zappi what is a solar car battery charger charge for free from solar energy a solar car battery charger works by allowing you to use excess solar to power up your car generating solar energy requires solar panels or pv to be fitted to your home or place of work but the energy generated through the solar panels is totally free charge even when it isnt sunny the amount of electricity solar panels produce is constantly fluctuating depending on the quality brightness and length of daylight available there is a misconception that solar panels require direct sunlight and although they would naturally work better when the sun is gleaming and the sky is blue solar panels are more reliant on the photons present in natural daylight which means even on an overcast day at the height of spring and summer youd expect an ample level of generation in fact we tend to spend more time outside in the summer and use far less electricity for which there tends to be a large amount of surplus energy generated in most cases that surplus energy is pumped back into the grid and somebody else would utilise that extra power youve generated however if you have a diverter such as the eddi and an ecosmart car charger such as the zappi you are able to utilise this surplus energy by instead diverting it into charging your electric vehicle how do solar panels charge my car battery light energy produced by the sun is called a photon it is the most basic fundamental particle of all light it is these photons in natural daylight that are converted by solar panel cells to produce electricity this small bundle of electromagnetic energy is constantly in motion simply put a solar panel works by allowing photons or particles of light to bounce into electrons setting them free from atoms generating a flow of electricity solar panels are comprised of many smaller parts called photovoltaic cells photovoltaic as described above simply means the conversion of sunlight into electricity solar panels use the spectrum of colours we are used to seeing visible but also ultraviolet and infrared which cannot be seen by the human eye the zappi is clever enough to communicate with your pv system via a little device called harvi which acts as a messenger by sensing and communicating import and export data to other myenergi devices those devices can then shout hang on dont fire my excess energy back out to the grid ill use it instead zappi happens to use this surplus energy to charge your vehicle whereas eddi would use it to instead heat your water how the energy is used by the zappi is determined by your requirements and preference via the mode you select different types of light that is converted by photovoltaic cells how is energy diverted to power my solar car battery charger introducing eddi the solar power diverter solar diverters take excess energy produced from your renewable energy sources such as solar pv and diverts it into a designated appliance such as an immersion heater or underfloor heating the myenergi eddi utilises this leftover energy making the most of the 100 green energy rather than exporting it back to the grid your power generation investment becomes more efficient product diverting the power back to your heating systems 0333300 1303 salesmyenergicom myenergi pioneer business park faraday way stallingborough grimsby dn41 8ff opens in a new tab services
