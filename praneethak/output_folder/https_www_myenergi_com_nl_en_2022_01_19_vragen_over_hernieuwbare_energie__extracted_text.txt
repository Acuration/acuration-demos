electricity is needed for our daily lives and the only way to provide it without harmful effects on the climate is by using clean renewable energy sources such as wind solar and water 2 why is renewable energy expensive according to some renewable energy is quite pricey thats because the investment in wind turbines and solar panels can be quite substantial however that investment will pay for itself by also saving you a lot of money your energy bill will be lower if you generate your own energy cant generate your own energy then you can still decide to participate in a cooperative that collectively generates green energy or to switch to a green energy supplier 3 why is it sustainable the term renewable energy actually says it all it is sustainable because it can be used over and

renewable energy we are less dependent on fossil fuels that pollute our atmosphere cleaner alternatives contribute to a better climate 7 how does it combat climate change renewable energy reduces carbon pollution and has a much lower impact on our environment says world wildlife magazine for years we have relied on petroleum and gas in our homes and diesel and gasoline in our engines when these fuels are burned they emit huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the air these greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere which in turn leads to extreme weather conditions rising sea levels and melting ice caps energy sources such as wind and solar do not release harmful gases making them a much cleaner alternative to our atmosphere 8 how was renewable energy discovered actually it has been used for centuries as early as 200 bc water wheels were used in a similar way to how we now use water power in 1500 a technique similar to windmills was already being used in 1860 french investor
