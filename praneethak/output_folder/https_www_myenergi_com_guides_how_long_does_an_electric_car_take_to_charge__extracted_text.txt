take to charge home  guides  how long does an electric car take to charge how long does an electric car take to charge firstly you need to know the size of the vehicle battery in kwh and the rate of the charge in kw based on an average 54kwh battery a 50kw public charger would take around 64 minutes to achieve a full 100 charge whereas a typical 7kw home charger would take around 7hrs 42 minutes however it also depends on the amount of charge you require for the journey ahead for example if you know you only require 10 battery to get home you may opt to only charge up to 25 capacity using a public charger and this would take roughly a quarter of the time 16 minutes how to work out how long it takes to charge an ev step 1 firstly you need to know the size of the vehicle battery measured in kws kilowatts there are many different sizes from vehicle to vehicle eg the newer tesla model 3 has a 75kw battery installed the mini electric has a 326kwh battery to keep things simple well demonstrate using a 70kwh battery step 2 secondly you need to know the rate at which your ev charger charges measured in kwh we are going to concentrate on home domestic chargers some manufacturers offer 3kwh home chargers the zappi comes in both 7kwh and 22kwh versions most uk houses have a single phase supply which means the maximum charge rate will be 7kwh therefore most homeowners will have 7kwh chargers installed the result we now know our vehicle needs 70kwh to achieve a full charge and our charger is charging at the rate of 7kw now its just some simple maths 7 kw x 10 hours  70kwh it really is that simple now you know it takes around 10 hours to charge a 70kwh battery you know it will take over 10 hours to charge any battery higher than 70kwh and less than 10hours to charge any battery lower than 70kwh want the excruciating details and minutes 70kwh is easy to work out lets assume your battery is 54kwh which is a figure weve concluded as a rough average across 40 of the best selling evs the maths is the same find the nearest whole number 7 kw x 7 hours  49kwh of charge at this point we know this particular vehicle would take over 7hrs though less than 8hrs to achieve a full 100 charge not accurate enough if you would like to know the extended minutes take the remaining 5kwh required to hit 54kwh divide by 7kw and times by 60 minutes 5  7 x 60 which equals 42 minutes voila the average time to charge an ev is around 7 hours 42 minutes are all electric car chargers the same not all electric vehicle chargers are the same though almost all modern evs come with type 2 sockets which are compatible across all the variations of charger this is with the exception of a handful of very early models which use a type 1 charger home chargers require an ac single phase supply which most uk homes have and charge at a rate of 7kw public chargers known as rapid chargers are usually dc and charge at much faster rates between 50kw  150kw though usually for a higher cost there are also 22kw chargers available known as fast chargers for your home or workplace though the premises would require a 3 phase supply to charge at these faster rates these types of charger are often used on commercial premises equally not all vehicles can charge at these higher rates of ac so its worth checking if your vehicle can handle 22kw charges that said you wouldnt do any damage plugging into a 22kw charger instead your vehicle would simply revert to charging at the slower 7kw rates if you do have a 3 phase supply wed recommend opting for a zappi 22kw charger to utilise faster charging rates and we recommend a zappi 7kw charger your top ev questions  answered where can i charge my ev the easiest and most efficient place to charge your vehicle is at home using your own charging station such as the zappi 7kw eco charger especially overnight however if you are running low whilst out on the road there are over 15000 public charge points located throughout the uk with more being listed every day charging forecourts such as the above gridserve electric forecourt in essex are becoming more common charging infrastructure is growing rapidly especially since the announcement to ban the sale of fossil fuel cars from 2030 many workplaces are now adopting free charging points in staff parking areas enabling you to charge your vehicle whilst you work should i charge my ev every night one of the many benefits of owning a domestic charge point is your ability to do just that many ev owners treat their vehicles in the same way they do their mobile phones and tend to keep them charging throughout the night ready for the morning this will save you time and make you less reliant on public charge points for most average drivers it is not absolutely necessary to charge your electric vehicle every night in the same way it is not necessary to travel to the petrol station everyday what is rapid charging rapid chargers are the large bulky sized chargers you are most likely to find at dedicated public charging stations these are the types of chargers you would most likely stop at on a long journey when you need to achieve a full charge in between 20  60 minutes whilst youre eating your lunch the main difference between fast commercial chargers and rapid chargers is that fast chargers use alternating current ac whereas rapid chargers use direct current dc the power transmitted across our national grid and received in our homes is alternating current ac because it is more economical and better at travelling longer distances however batteries always require power as dc which is why there is often a large transformer block between the 13amp wall socket and the device such as a laptop or console electric vehicles are no different and have components inside to convert ac to dc which enables the power to be stored in the vehicle battery ultimately electric vehicles are like big laptops on wheels rapid chargers are slightly different to regular chargers because this ac to dc conversion process happens inside the charger itself the components involved in this conversion process are usually heavy expensive and require far more power from the grid 125a to perform this conversion quickly this makes rapid charging more expensive than ac charging however it is the best option available for mid journey pitstops when you need to recharge quickly wed recommend that you limit the use of rapid chargers to emergency charging and long journeys only to save money and preserve the longevity of the vehicle battery home chargers are certainly the best option for regular day to day charging such as the zappi 7kw home ev charger what is a granny charger a granny charger is ultimately a cars emergency spare charger most electric vehicles are able to plug into a standard 13a household 3pin socket the same thing your kettle is plugged into this type of charger is most commonly known as a type 1 charger as suggestive of its name it is the slowest option to charge an electric car pulling just 23kw which equates to around 2 12 hours per 10 of charge as opposed to 46 minutes when using a 7kw type 2 charger if you are currently resorting to plugging into a 3pin socket and your vehicle accepts type 2 charging wed recommend having a 7kw charge point installed such as the zappi for triple the charging speeds at home which is the best electric car charger for my home the zappi is a popular choice for those entering into the world of ev and is one of the best selling home and workplace chargers across europe zappi is the worlds first eco smart ev charger and made  designed in britain zappi is a smart ev charger which means it can be controlled monitored and updated using your smart phone tablet or computer via an internet connection this makes zappi one of the most futureproof chargers on the market the unit comes in a 7kw or 22kw version with or without a type 2 cable attached and a choice of two colours black or white zappis extra eco features allow you to charge your vehicle using solar or wind generated energy via your panels andor turbine equally zappi works as a simple plug and go stand alone charger another great feature of the zappi is your ability to utilise time of use tariffs these tariffs allow ev drivers to charge their vehicles for the cheapest daily prices available whereby drivers can set their zappi to only charge when electricity prices are at their lowest 0333300 1303 salesmyenergicom myenergi pioneer business park faraday way stallingborough grimsby dn41 8ff opens
