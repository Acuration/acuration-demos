a lot of renewable energy from nature such as solar energy but also wind energy the advantage of these energy sources is that they never run out in this article we would like to tell you more about how wind energy is generated and what advantages it has wind energy is energy that is generated from the power of the wind thanks to a windmill it is a clean form of energy after all it uses an energy source that is already there wind how does a wind turbine work windmills also called wind turbines consist of three rotating blades wind causes these blades to rotate where the three blades intersect is called the rotor the rotor is connected to the housing at the top of the mast called the nacelle a special motor ensures that the nacelle is always turned so that the blades face the wind on top of the windmill a wind vane continuously measures the wind direction in this way the wind turbine can be positioned to take full advantage of the power of the wind inside the nacelle is a generator this generator uses magnets to convert the rotary motion of the rotor into electricity a transformer then converts the electricity generated in low voltage into high voltage the electricity can then be supplied to the grid what different wind turbines are there there are windmills with horizontal blades and with vertical blades horizontal sails are the most common a windmill with vertical blades comes in various varieties in general they produce less wind energy than their horizontal counterparts because their components are easier to access wind turbines with vertical blades are easier to maintain can i generate wind energy at home you certainly can you should just keep in mind that the smaller wind turbines you place in your yard at home will generate less wind energy if you compare wind energy to solar energy then your own solar panels generate more profit than your own wind turbine therefore placing a wind turbine in your yard is more fun as a supplement but not to power your entire home to use your generated wind energy completely by yourself eddi is a godsend the system allows your energy to be used primarily for your own use and less frequently fed back into the grid if you additionally use an electric car zappi can ensure that the excess wind energy is used by your ev charger how much energy does a windmill generate how much a wind turbine yields depends on several factors consider the size of the blades the height of the mill and the location of the turbine the standard rule is the larger the blades the higher the yield a high wind turbine can also generate more energy than a low one because there is often more wind to catch at higher altitudes in addition there is often more wind by the sea than on land it is therefore not surprising that many wind farms are located on the coast and at sea advantages of wind energy by using wind energy we can reduce co2 emissions which in turn has a positive impact on the climate in addition it is a clean renewable source of energy with solar panels we can already generate a lot of renewable electricity but it is not enough to power all homes one windmill already generates as much energy as dozens of solar panels of course this only applies to the large wind turbines you see along the road or by the sea for a small wind turbines from your garden this does not apply share story related news see all
