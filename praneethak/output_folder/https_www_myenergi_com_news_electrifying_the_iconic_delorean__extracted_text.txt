electrifying the iconic delorean  back to the future home  blog  myenergi is electrifying the iconic delorean  back to the future what is the delorean we hear you ask well quite literally take you back to the future and explain its the car of the future made in the past made famous by the iconic 80s movie back to the future this vehicle literally gave us a glimpse into how those who grew up in the 80s depicted the future might look by now referencing the date 2015 for which mcfly travels forward in time looking at the vehicle now you can certainly see where elons musks inspirations might have come from for the tesla model x literally making science fiction science fact okay we havent quite sussed time travel aspect of the movie and the film predicted we might have moved forward far sooner but we are finally starting to see glimpses of this technological future through todays pioneering technology companies such as usas tesla and the uks myenergi who in different ways are helping to make this a reality through the electrification of vehicles the great shift away from polluting fossil fuels in favour of far cleaner battery technology if companies such as tesla are creating the cool vehicles myenergi are creating the products to power them in the cleanest possible way however myenergi thought itd be a shame to leave such an iconic vehicle in the past with its outdated exhaust pipe therefore we decided to do something about that turning the delorean electric so how did it come about our good friends in australia electric car cafe who specialise in the art of turning classic ice vehicles into evs approached us with the idea of bringing this beautiful car into the current future we quite obviously said hell yeah a project which has myenergi written all over it therefore we partnered with ecc for the project at hand also providing them with the first solar compatible electric vehicle charger in the world the zappi to help power this beauty this delorean is going to be one of the few in the world powered by a tesla powertrain and tesla battery packs want to see the car and know more about the conversion process follow like and subscribe to electric car cafes youtube channel below and watch the 6 part series on all the excruciating technical details and see it come to life which other legendary film cars should be converted to evs imagine owning an ev version of one of these iconic movie vehicles weve shown you it is possible weve picked a handful of vehicles to start the ball rolling in our version of the classic game top trumps scoring each vehicle on speed coolness sex appeal gadgets and its secret weapon which car will come on top how do they compare against the delorean dmc delorean lets see how the delorean stacks up against our selection of iconic movie cars total score  18 aston martin db5 made famous by the super suave james bond as played by a young sean connery in the classic film goldfinger it quite clearly beats doc browns delorean on sex appeal and though the delorean holds the ultimate gadget to travel back in time this is quite simply a james bond car all bond cars come with a whole host of gadgets installed as standard as designed by q in his secret lab revolving number plates gps dashboard arm rest controls tire slashers smoke screen oil slick rear bulletproof screen front wing machine guns ejector seat total score  27 dodge charger before the delorean hit our silver screens one of the most iconic cars of the early 80s was general lees dodge charger from the dukes of hazzard this vehicle slightly pips the delorean on sex appeal though only because it is likely to beat the delorean in a drag race although lacks on special gadgets however it did potentially spend more time in the air than the delorean and seemed totally indestructible total score  12 pontiac trans am two words the hoff of course this steams the delorean on sex appeal a car that talked to its passengers way before the posh dudes on your gps sat nav its pretty fast as well we are very surprised that tesla hasnt yet given its cars a voice to talk back but we are sure it wont be long with the increased capabilities of ai technology were sure youll be having deep conversations with your car in the very near future total score  25 amc pacer mirthmobile okay doesnt seem there is a lot going for this particular vehicle scoring just 1 point but its the taking part that counts and we had to pick an equally cool wooden spoon however wed pay to see somebody turn this vehicle into an ev total score  1 the batmobile i mean its the batmobile possibly the coolest car of anyones childhood tesla have adopted voice control but does need to catch up on the below list of gadgets especially the sounddistinguishing battector very apt for these times see the full list here taken from the batman fandom closed circuit television handset with direct hotline to police headquarters direction finder equipment spare

score  26 the ectomobile  miller meteor cadillac hearse another very iconic vehicle from the 80s movie ghostbusters we decided to give this vehicle a 7 for gadgets because they are so technical not even we understand how they work however even if the hoff drove this vehicle it might score a 2 at best for sex appeal and might even loose a point for coolness total score  9 6000 sux  robocop car we couldnt find anything particularly special about this car other than it feels like a poor mans delorean however it does shout i am an 80s classic movie car and wed happily see this turned into a fully working ev total score  9 dodge charger the second dodge vehicle in our lineup famous for being the car that dom toretto owns in the fast  furious series heres where we have hit a grey area wed have to rip the iconic exposed muscle car engine air intake from the bonnet though if we turned this into an ev perhaps wed somehow leave this element intact simply as an ornament total score  18 have we missed any other iconic vehicles which deserve to be in our list disagree with our scores let us know your thoughts on our social media channels if you enjoyed this article you may also like our blog
