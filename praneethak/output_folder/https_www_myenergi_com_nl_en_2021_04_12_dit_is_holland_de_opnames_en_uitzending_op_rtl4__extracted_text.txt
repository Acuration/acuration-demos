filming and broadcast on rtl4 since the beginning of 2018 myenergi has been represented in the benelux by an enthusiastic team of employees and in particular the zappi has been put on the map as the smartest charging solution in the market that this has not gone unnoticed is shown by the fact that various media contacted us frequently to create publicity for our products numerous media and production companies in the netherlands and belgium approach us almost weekly to entice us to advertise with them the commercial tv stations have also received many offers to present our company in a kind of information commercial and one of those companies was zworks a content production company for the program this is holland this program is broadcasted on the most watched commercial television station in the netherlands rtl4 the first broadcast is on sunday afternoon a rerun on the following saturday production day  friday 12 march 2020 our team was well prepared with clean company clothes and full of expectations for what was to come zworks came to us with a cameraman and an editor in the afternoon and as expected in our little country the weather didnt want to cooperate that day so we first recorded the interview in our office as general manager marc zeguers was quite used to it as a radio presenter in his younger days he had stood in front of a microphone before and our youtube explanation and installation videos are all recorded by him yet it had to be done a few times again because you want to give as much information as possible in the shortest time possible after that some broll shots were made in the warehouse and we ourselves had taken a good look at our solar panels with a drone that morning a beautiful home from a satisfied zappi customer in order to film an example of the charging process on location at a beautiful villa we crossed the border one of our enthusiastic customers wanted to cooperate and we were allowed to film the installed zappi on his driveway as said the weather gods did not want to cooperate and in the pouring rain we made the necessary footage in one hour and then wait for the broadcast the assembly followed two weeks later and the result was immediately fantastic some minor adjustments were also made without any problems so we can only speak highly of zworks the broadcast was on sunday 11 in the afternoon and less than 5 minutes later we had an order in it could also have been just a coincidence  but it still gave a nice feeling if you missed the broadcast you can watch it again below share story related news see all
