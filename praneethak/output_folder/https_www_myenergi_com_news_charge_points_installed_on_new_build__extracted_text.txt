be fitted with electric vehicle ev charging points from 2022 home  car charging  newbuild properties to be fitted with electric vehicle ev charging points from 2022 earlier this month the uks transport minister unveiled plans for electric vehicle ev charging points to be installed on all newbuild properties in england from 2022 a precursor to the governments 2030 ban on the sale of all new petrol and diesel cars the planned introduction of legislation guiding the mandatory installation of charging points on all newbuild properties will prove somewhat of a landmark moment the move will not only see the uk lead the way in the global race to electrification but also further boost the uks growing charging network  which continues to expand at a record rate with the bill dictating that all devices will need to be smart ie capable of communicating with the car about when is best to plug into the grid it will prevent the energy network from being overloaded with too many drivers charging at once whats more it will help to boost confidence in electric vehicles for those who are still concerned about range implications and personal access to charging points indeed rather than just another headache when buying your next car installing a wallbox and charging your electric vehicle at home will quickly become as easy and routine as turning on your central heating or setting your house alarm installation of a myenergi zappi ev charger jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi believes this news could prove a defining moment in our transition to electrification this is hugely positive news  a defining moment in our transition to electrification however as with any legislation it comes with its own set of challenges while promising to prove transformational considered implementation is key let me explain the home charge market has exploded in recent years with numerous brands entering the industry and introducing their innovative new technologies some are truly pioneering home charge solutions  others not so the resulting challenge for property developers is to be aware of the differences and be able to easily identify the futureproof solutions that will add significant value after all the last thing homeowners need is the pressure to swap out a dated and incompatible charging device less than a few years after purchasing their newbuild as such id like to see the government further support the market by providing this impartial guidance surrounding the most suitable products for installation this would help to ensure the smooth implementation and lasting success of the new bill as an example zappi  our next generation ecosmart ev charger has been installed at tens of thousands of properties across the globe alongside standard smart charging modes the zappi is the first device on the market capable of harnessing power from renewable energy microgeneration technologies such as pv panels and smallscale wind turbines in result this means that zappi users have the opportunity to charge for free whats more by using their own selfgenerated renewable energy the risk of overloading the grid is effectively eliminated and our customers can boast an impressively low carbon footprint so while the planned introduction of legislation regarding mandated electric vehicle charging point installation is positive news education and guidance is critical to longterm success to ensure that the right devices are installed however property developers need a quick and simple way to check that the home charge solutions that they specify are fitforpurpose and can be used by homeowners for years to come for more information about the proposed changes and how they may effect property developers or those looking to
