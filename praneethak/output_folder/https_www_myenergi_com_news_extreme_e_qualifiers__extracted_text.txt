long after when claudia hurtgens car appeared to dig into the sand on a rutted section before dramatically rolling over several times team abt cupra were initially concerned when they didnt hear a radio response from claudia though a massive relief from all watching when she came out of the overturned car standing described by her team mates as the best pictures of the day sebastien loeb and cristina gutierrez of lewis hamiltons x44 team gained the pace early being the first team to run and really set the benchmark high leaving the remaining teams chasing hard over the course of the qualifiers however despite a solid start from hamiltons x44 it was nico rosbergs team which pipped them to the post with a tremendous run from johan kristoffersson  molly taylor snatching the top spot by 450 seconds giving rosberg x racing an early head start in qualifier 1 the battle for 5th  6th spot was heightened between oliver bennett  christine giampaoli zonca of hispano suiza xite energy  jenson button  mikaela ahlinkottulinsky of jbxe where both teams incurred penalty points for speeding in the switch zone however jensons team incurred extended penalties which left an easy slow and steady run out for the oli  christine on the second leg simply needing to get the car in myenergi colours back in one piece 6th place is a particularly sought after spot amongst the bottom 4 being the last position in which to qualify for the semi final rounds the penalty points didnt end there with rosberg x racing incurring a major 60second time penalty for speeding in the driver switch lane which saw taylor  kristoffersson fall down the order from first to third and finally finishing in 5th place overall following excellent runs from andretti united including british driver catie munnings and acciona sainz xe team to the relief of jenson buttons jbxe chip gannassi racing unfortunately did not start the second qualifiers due to damage to the car which caused issues with the
