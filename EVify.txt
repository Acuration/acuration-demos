	What makes electric vehicles special?
		Top Five Reasons to Choose an Electric Car
		Electric vehicles save you money Electric vehicles can also save you on maintenance costs. Battery EVs have no gasoline engine, they do not need oil changes, spark plugs, or timing belts, and unlike gasoline motors, electric motors required no routine maintenance.
		The Union of Concerned Scientists provides information on various topics related to climate change, transportation, energy, food, and democracy. They urge people to take action and demand that fossil fuel CEOs stop fueling forest fires. The energy choices we make today could make or break our ability to fight climate change. The transportation system is outdated and broken, and it needs to change. With concerted action, the US can meet its climate goals and see huge benefits to the economy and public health. The food system should provide healthy, sustainable food for everyone, and Congress must safeguard and support food and farmworkers. The nuclear weapons are the most dangerous invention the world has ever seen, and we need to prevent them from being used again. Urge Congress to reform US nuclear weapons policy.

	The Value Proposition for Lightweighting in Electric Vehicles
	The value proposition on lightweight materials needs to adjust to the new EV business model.
	The value proposition for lightweighting in electric vehicles needs to adjust to the new EV business model. EVs are heavy due to their power source, which is gasoline. EV battery technology requires huge investments to develop and implement in vehicles. To increase the inherent value of EVs, the natural response from those not directly involved in the industry is to talk about cutting the vehicle weight. However, new start-ups tend to make different lightweighting decisions than established OEMs.

	What is the introduction of EV?
		EVs 101 — Introduction to Electric Vehicles | DVRPC
		EVs operate pretty much like traditional gasoline vehicles except that they use electric motors, rather than a gasoline powered ICE to move the vehicle. Rather than carrying energy in the form of gasoline in a tank, an electric vehicle carries energy as electricity in a battery.
		The article provides an overview of light-duty electric vehicles and their terminology. It draws from the Electric Vehicles pages at the US Department of Energy and other sources. Electric vehicles (EVs) have several attributes that make them desirable for personal transportation. EVs do not produce tailpipe emissions, which can help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. EVs are expected to be less expensive to maintain than traditional ICE vehicles.

The preferred charging location for EV drivers is at home, with 51% of charging taking place at home. Workplace charging (16%) has emerged as the second most common method of recharging for EV owners. Providing EV charging stations at shopping destinations and gas stations is beneficial for business owners, with 81% of respondents saying the presence of an EV charger at a business made them more loyal to that business. However, the cost of installing a public Level 2 charging station could be between $2,500 and $4,900, and a Fast Charger can cost between $20,000 and $150,000.

Ford is struggling to achieve a healthy profit due to supply chain issues and a cost structure that isn't competitive. The profits equation is a bigger question for Ford than other automakers, particularly after admitting to leaving $2 billion in profits on the table due to lack of execution. Ford has been achieving EV sales growth at twice the rate of the EV segment, but this will change as General Motors begins its EV push. The article discusses where the profit margins are for electric vehicles and how to sell a $40,000 electric crossover with a 20% gross margin. During Ford's quarterly investment call last week, an analyst put to Ford this elephant in the room, and Ford owned up on the call.

	The article discusses the impact of electric vehicle (EV) sales on the three core auto industries: making, dealing, and fueling. The US government spent $80 billion to bail out gas automakers in 2008, but they have failed to become more efficient. The global auto industry is shrinking as people hold on to cars longer and opt out of cars entirely. Gas vehicles have a 20% profit margin, but EVs are forecasted to be closer to 5% at scale. With only 2% of car sales as EVs, there is a chicken-and-egg problem: why invest in making them at scale if they aren't already selling at scale? Manufacturers have pledged to grow EV sales, but it is expensive and too far out for CEOs to care. Daimler and GM intend to produce 1 million EVs a year by 2026. Many cities and countries are banning the sale of new combustion engines.

	How much profit does BYD make per car?
		China's EV giant BYD is slowly closing its profit gap with Tesla - Quartz
		Dividing BYD's net profit for the same period by its sales indicates that the company made about 10,300 yuan ($1,730) per vehicle sold. That's a notable increase from the third quarter of 2022, when BYD averaged under $1,470 of profit per car sold.
		Chinese EV maker BYD is closing the profit gap with Tesla in terms of pure-electric vehicle sales and profit per car sold. BYD sold over 2.08 million new energy vehicles in the third quarter of this year, making about 10,300 yuan ($1,730) per vehicle sold. Tesla, on the other hand, sold over 431,000 full-electric cars, just several thousand behind BYD's 435,000. While BYD has fattened its profit margin on each vehicle it delivers to customers, Tesla is slipping. However, BYD still logged a record quarterly profit of 10.41 billion yuan, a 82.2% increase from a year earlier. Tesla's fat margins have proved to be a nifty weapon in the EV price war, giving the company a buffer to slash prices amid cut-throat competition.

		Winning strategies for EV marketing

		The article discusses winning digital marketing strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) in various industries such as pharmaceutical, insurance, FMCG, manufacturing, and healthcare. The EV industry is evolving rapidly, and EV business owners need to market their products in the best way possible to increase sales. Social media is a great way to reach potential customers and engage existing ones, especially those who are sceptical about buying an EV. Organic content like photos, videos, and blog posts can attract attention from people interested in EVs. Email marketing can keep your brand top-of-mind with existing customers and introduce it to potential customers who haven't heard of you yet. Highlighting customer reviews from existing customers can help build credibility and trust in the mind of potential customers. Positive reviews give potential customers the required confidence and assurance about making a purchase. It's imperative to include customer reviews in your marketing strategy to increase brand awareness and sales. To increase sales, EV businesses need to target influencers who are passionate about electric vehicles and understand the pain points of their brand.

It includes hardware, people, and companies involved in EV charging, and software that connects them all. The ecosystem includes a diverse range of participants, including EV manufacturers, charging station companies, and electricity producers and utility companies. EV charging companies are the most visible part of the ecosystem as they build and maintain charging networks and bring EV charging to the public. Understanding how the ecosystem functions is crucial to providing charging services for all types of EV vehicles. The EV charging ecosystem constantly evolves and adapts to new situations, and it requires a capable power grid that supplies electricity to EV charging networks.
