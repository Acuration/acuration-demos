the devastating effects of litter on wildlife
 


 








 










there is an estimated 
150 million tonnes of plastic
 in our oceans by 2050 experts predict that there will be more rubbish than fish in our waters


it is our mission to create a better future for our wonderful planet and while the myenergi hq focus is on renewable energy our green team are extremely passionate about all aspects of creating a more sustainable environment


lets take a look at the impact littering has on our planet particularly nature and wildlife


stats about littering that will shock you




the 
rspca
 receives 5000 calls a year regarding litter thats an average of roughly 14 calls every day


the world wide fund for nature report that 15 million tonnes of plastic waste derives from water bottles


33 
of litter comes from fast food


the uk has the worst statistics for litter with a jawdropping 
62 of englands residents
 admitting to littering


one billion
 seabirds are killed by litter every year while 260 marine animal species have become trapped by litter in the ocean




 




effects of littering on wildlife


trash that is mindlessly thrown on the floor is having a seriously detrimental effect on plants and animals not only is it a direct threat to many creatures health but it can also destroy their habitats and environment


here are just some of the most common problems caused by litter




animals getting trapped and entangled in plastic packaging


wildlife suffocating in plastic bags and similar litter


creatures cutting themselves on sharp objects thrown away by humans


wildlife getting stuck in discarded gum


litter damaging the homes and nests animals spend so long creating for themselves




these are just a few of the many issues plaguing our wonderful wildlife youll notice a trend in each of the above examples every one of them is entirely avoidable


how can we prevent this


the simple answer is stop littering failing to properly dispose of your rubbish is careless and incredibly damaging to our planet


aim to use recyclable materials whenever possible and be sure to recycle them in the correct manner


singleuse plastics such as straws and plastic cutlery is among the most avoidable and damaging type of litter in the world


even if you do dispose of your plastics properly there are some extra precautions you can do to protect our wildlife which include




cutting elastic bands and ringed packaging to ensure animals dont squeeze into them and get trapped


rinse and crush cans when youre throwing them away


pick up other peoples litter if you come across it


put lids back on containers that you throw out


choose paper bags whenever possible or take your own reusable bags when shopping




what else can we do to save the environment


cutting down litter is a massive thing the human race can do to help the many species left struggling on our planet but it is not the only step you can make far from it
