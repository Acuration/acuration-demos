how do electric vehicles work
 


 












there can be no denying that electric vehicles are the future these cars are becoming an increasingly more common sight on our roads helping drivers to reduce the impact that they have on the environment


how do these electric vehicles work though we thought we would take a closer look
























what are the parts of electric vehicles


electric vehicles have up to 90 fewer moving parts than a standard internal combustion alternative and the essential parts include




motor

the motor is what powers the vehicle these engines can be either direct current or alternating current although ac is the most common


inverter

this helps to turn direct current into alternating current


drivetrain

electric vehicles only need a singlespeed transmission sending the power directly from the motor to the wheels


batteries

these are an essential part of electric vehicles storing the electricity required to power the motor the higher the kw of the battery the further the vehicle will be able to travel


charger

this is how drivers charge the batteries and will connect to either your mains outlet or a dedicated charging point


















how does the engine work


unlike traditional combustion engines electric vehicles do not require any fuel instead the car is powered by batteries which store electricity in turn these rechargeable batteries then power the motor which turns the wheels and drives the vehicle


electric vehicles are able to accelerate at a much faster rate than traditional cars which makes them a fantastic choice for use around town and on long journeys

how do you charge electric vehicles


electric vehicles can be charged either through a traditional socket in your home or via a dedicated car charging unit the three types of chargers include




plug socket

this type of charger plugs directly into your homes wall socket however this is often the slowest way to charge your electric vehicles


socketed

this is a charge point that will allow drivers to plug in either a type 1 or a type 2 cable


tethered

this is very similar to a socketed charger but it comes with a tethered cable attached that has either a type 1 or a type 2 connection




there are also three different speeds of charging slow which is usually up to 3 kw and is designed for overnight charging fast is between 7 kw and 22 kw and is typically found in public places such as supermarkets or car parks rapid charging is the quickest type but it is only compatible with electric vehicles that have a compatible charger
















what about hybrid vehicles


hybrid electric vehicles are a mix of both traditional internal combustion engines and electric motors rather than being charged via a socket the batteries are recharged when the standard engine is being used or through regenerative braking


thanks to the extra power provided by the electric motor hybrid vehicles can often have a smaller capacity engine while they also have a greater fuel economy without sacrificing performance
