eddi product information


eddi is a solar power diverter that helps you to make the most of your self generated power rather than exporting it back to the grid


bring an 
eddi
 into your home and you can make the most of the 100 green energy generated from your solar pv or wind generation system


rather than exporting excess generation back to the grid as per a standard pv system with our intelligent power diverter that extra power generation is instead diverted back to your heating systems thus heating water on 100 self generated green energy
