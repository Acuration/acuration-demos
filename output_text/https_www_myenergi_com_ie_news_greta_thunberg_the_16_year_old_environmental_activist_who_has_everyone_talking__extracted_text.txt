greta thunberg the 16yearold environmental activist who has everyone talking

greta thunberg the 16yearold environmental activist who has everyone talking
 


 








 










you have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words


16yearold environmental activist greta thunberg is making headlines all around the world particularly after her passionate speech at the un general assembly


a next generation leader in the words of 
time magazine
 youve seen her name across the papers heard her ardent speeches on the television and seen many major decisionmakers and celebrities speaking her name both positively and negatively


but who actually is this swedish 16yearold who has found herself at the forefront of the global climate crisis


who is greta thunberg


born in stockholm on 3rd january 2003 greta is the daughter of swedish opera singer malena ernman and swedish authoractor svante thunberg


first hearing of climate change when she was 8 years old greta was astounded that more was not being done to stop this vicious beast eating our planet in the three years that followed greta grew depressed and soon stopped eating and talking


i was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome ocd and selective mutism she said during her 
tedxtalk 
in 2018 that basically means i only speak when i think its necessary now is one of those moments 


everyone keeps saying that climate change is an existential threat and the most important issue of all and yet they just carry on like before


greta convinced her parents to 
reduce their carbon footprint
 even persuading her mother to sacrifice her international operasinging career by giving up flying in order to help save the planet 


the increasingly keen environmentalists influence soon spread to her classmates and it was not long before she got international recognition for her efforts


greta thunberg school strikes  climate change campaign


in the widespread discussions regarding 
global warming
 and 
climate change
 most will agree that children are the future the ones who will have the biggest influence on the state of our planet 


but first we need to ensure our children and childrens children have a planet that is capable of being saved that can only truly be achieved through the actions and decisions of the policymakers the big businesses and politicians capable of making such widespread change


greta thunberg is someone who is fighting for those people to make the necessary changes before it is too late she is an individual who despite being just 16yearsold is ensuring the voices of the future are being heard among the voices of those to blame for our environments tragic demise


gretas most controversial and therefore effective in many peoples eyes campaign was the 
international school strikes
 which began on 20th august 2018 this echoed the success of a similar movement in november 2015 when over 50000 people skipped school on the day of the un climate change conference


just 15yearsold at the time greta took the day off school to protest outside swedish parliament in an attempt to force leaders to do more to help the environment every friday that followed she would miss school to protest encouraging others all around the world to do the same


now known as 
fridays for future
 millions of students across the world follow in gretas footsteps every week to campaign for climate justice


criticism of greta thunberg


greta thunberg has successfully garnered the attention of some of the worlds biggest names but not all of them have been positive in their feedback


french president emmanuel macron for instance claims such radical positions as held by thunberg antagonize our societies while 
piers morgan
 never one to shy away from controversy recently called greta unstable


following her recent speech donald trump tweeted somewhat sarcasticallyshe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future so nice to see this led greta to respond by brilliantly mocking the us president via 
her twitter bio



welldeserved praise for greta thunberg


greta thunberg has rightly earned a lot of praise and accolades for her hard work and determination to save the planet prior to her most notable campaign she actually won the svenska dagbladet writing competition for an article she produced on the climate when she was first campaigning 


this kickstarted a huge cabinet of trophies and awards which includes being nominated for the 2019 nobel peace prize and swedens most important woman of the year 2019


the likes of 
leonardo dicaprio
 and various other 
climatecampaigning celebrities
 all shared her latest speech online demonstrating their support for the 16yearold


greta thunberg quotes


this is all wrong thunberg said in her latest and arguably most powerful 
speech
 yet i shouldnt be up here i should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope how dare you you have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words


here are some of our favourite greta thunberg quotes over the last few years




right here right now is where we draw the line the world is waking up and change is coming whether you like it or not


we are striking because we have done our homework and they have not


i want you to act as if the house is on fire because it is


you must unite behind the science you must take action you must do the impossible because giving up can never be an option


change is coming whether you like it or not


many people say that sweden is just a small country and it doesnt matter what we do but i have learned you are never too small to make a difference


we cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis and if solutions within the system are so impossible to find then maybe we should change the system itself
