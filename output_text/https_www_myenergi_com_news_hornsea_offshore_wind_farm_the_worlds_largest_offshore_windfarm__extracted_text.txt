hornsea offshore wind farm the worlds largest offshore wind farm
 


 








 










did you know that the uk will soon be home to the worlds largest offshore wind farm thats right when construction is completed in early 2020 the highly anticipated hornsea offshore wind farm will provide clean electricity to 1 million uk homes


spanning over 400 square kilometres hornsea one is positioned just off the hull and grimsby coast not too far away from myenergi hq


what you need to know about hornsea one offshore wind farm




hornsea one will feature 174 wind turbines


each wind turbine will stand at 190m tall making it over twice the size of grimsby dock tower and 35m taller than the humber bridges towers


the blades of the turbines have a circumference of 75 metres


hornsea one will provide power to over one million uk homes


the structure includes the longest ever powerline 900km cable route


it has a power capacity of 12 gw




when was hornsea one announced


work has been ongoing on the hornsea one construction for the last few years with initial plans from orsted stemming back to 2010


orsted are the danish renewable energy company in charge of the project their mission much like ours is to create a world that runs entirely on green energy


when will the hornsea offshore wind farm be completed


hornsea one is set for completion in q1 of 2020


orsted
 do know a thing or two about this sort of project having invested 12 billion in the sector creating 25 offshore wind farms across the globe


why is more money being invested in offshore wind farms


in march 2019 the uk government pledged to provide a third of 
all uk electricity via offshore wind farms by 2030
 this promise was part of the governments ambition to make the uk a global leader in renewables with more investment potential than any other country in the world


countries all over the world are looking to cut down their emissions and focus on 
renewable energy
 through producing cleaner more sustainable power decisionmakers are hoping the damaging effects of 
climate change
 and 
global warming
 will be reduced


wind power
 alongside 
solar panels
 
geothermal energy
 
hydroelectricity
 and biomass are all viable and increasingly popular alternatives to fossil fuels that have caused so much damage to our environment


how do offshore wind farms work


renewable sustainable and clean offshore wind farms tick all of the boxes they generate power by using the high forces of the wind on the seas 


the wind is much more powerful on the ocean due to the lack of barriers and this power is transported via a generator which converts the kinetic energy of the turbines into electricity this electricity is then transmitted through cables into a distribution network before finding its way into our homes


just how powerful is hornsea one


a single rotation of just one of hornsea ones turbines can power the average home for 24 hours when its complete and fully functioning all 174 turbines of hornsea one will be able to power over 1 million homes in the uk
