libbi is


a modular home battery storage system that adapts to your needs


we created libbi to store your electricity to use it when you need it most it allows you to capture as much surplus solar electricity as possible whilst integrating with your existing myenergi devices


libbi is modular by design each module can store up to 5kwh of electricity so combining 4 of them together would provide up to 20kwh of storage

libbi gives you


ultimate control of how you use your stored energy


libbi isnt just a home battery storage system its eco smart this means it makes intelligent decisions about when it provides and stores electricity based on how much energy you use how much you generate with your solar and the electricity tariff you use










control

your surplus self generated electricity decreasing your dependency on the electricity grid

an intelligent home battery storage system that adapts to your needs












modular storage


the libbi system is modular by design and is adaptable to suit your needs each module is 5kwh so by combining 4 together would provide 20kwh of storage










home ecosystem




libbi is designed to work in harmony with your other myenergi devices

prioritise where stored electricity is diverted to use in your home to top up your ev or heat your hot water










green or grid you choose


whether you want to charge libbi from solar the electricity grid or a mixture of both the choice is yours

where charging from the electricity grid well optimise around your time of use tariff










remote access


the myenergi app allows you to access and control your libbi from anywhere in the world live displays and graphs allow you to monitor your imported and exported electricity all in one place




















an energy storage system to suit your needs 


libbi works as both an ac and dc coupled battery system with solar pv connect pv without the need for a separate inverter or retrofit to any existing ac system

your home battery storage questions answered


faqs












i dont have solar is this product right for me












if you have a time of use tariff from your electricity provider libbi will optimise charging around cheaper periods and will store it for you to use during more expensive peak times


if youd like to add solar in the future you can do so at any time without needing to purchase a separate solar inverter as the libbi system includes one














will libbi work with my zappi and eddi












absolutely libbi has been developed to work in harmony with our existing products connecting your home battery storage to our energy ecosystem

using the intuitive preferences in our mobile app you can control when libbi will drain to your zappi eddi and home enabling you to make decisions on how you want to use your stored electricity














what is a time of use tariff












time of use tariffs tou are available from some electricity suppliers on these types of tariff you can benefit from cheaper prices at certain times of the day these times are usually offpeak when there is less demand on the electricity grid














will libbi work with an agile electricity tariff












yes customers who are on an agile tariff for example intelligent octopus can optimise their libbi charging around cheaper price periods


libbi offers customers the option to charge solely from solar pv or from solar and the electricity grid combined meaning you can make the most of selfgenerated electricity whilst also charging using cheaper offpeak tariff prices














how long does it take to install libbi on average












the average battery install is typically less than 1 day  if youre having home battery storage installed with a solar array this can take longer typically up to 2 days depending on the complexity of the work required  for example this timescale doesnt include erecting scaffolding for a new solar array














where can i have libbi installed












the libbi home battery storage and inverter can be installed both indoors and outdoors however the libbi controller must be installed indoors


when installing indoors there needs to be sufficient space around the system to allow for air flow and it cant usually be installed in loft spaces due to the weight or blocking an entry or exit route


our certified installation partners will walk you through the best location for your libbi during their initial survey














what is the largest system size i can purchase












the libbi system is modular by design with this you can create a home battery storage system between 5kwh 1 battery up to 20kwh 4 batteries














how do i work out what system size i need to optimise my solar












the size of the libbi system best suited for your home will be worked out by one of our certified installation partners


this calculation is based on the size and electricity requirements of your home plus your existing solar panel system size a typical uk household uses between 8kwh and 10kwh of electricity per day on average


using these factors our installers can ensure you have enough capacity in your libbi to store excess solar electricity you have generated or your cheaper electricity grid energy














i have a wind power generation source will libbi still be compatible












yes libbi surplus electricity generation from independent wind turbines installed in the home when detecting surplus electricity libbi will ensure that this is either stored for future use or used to power your other devices such as zappi and eddi based on your charging preferences


 














im on a 3 phase supply can i still have a libbi












yes libbi can be installed on 1 phase of your 3 phase supply with the potential to install up to 3 1 on each phase alternatively we will be launching a 3 phase version in due course so watch this space














will i still be eligible for my existing feed in tariff fit tariff if i install a libbi












those who are receiving feedintariff payments for the electricity they generate with solar pv will need to inform their fit licensee in most cases the licensee is the electricity supplier who has been contracted to supply electricity to your home a qualified myenergi installer will provide guidance on how to do this


 


 














does libbi provide backup power in the event of a power cut












the libbi system can be installed with optional blackout backup


this means that in the event of a power outage libbi will provide the electricity its stored to a dedicated circuit or socket thats connected to the libbi backup output
