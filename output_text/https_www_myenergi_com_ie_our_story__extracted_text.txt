our passion for creating a better future for both people and our planet has lead us to cross paths with tv adventurer and motorbike enthusiast charley boorman charley best known for cohosting the adventurepacked long way tv shows with fellow actor and friend ewan mcgregor has recently had installed our multiaward winning product the zappi charley traveled north at the end of september 2020 to meet with the myenergi family each department was excited to give him a sneak peek at where all the magic happens
















 






timeline and milestones


myenergi was founded in 2016 by cofounders lee sutton and jordan brompton whose passion for renewable energy drove their vision to optimise renewable energy use at home they anticipated the direction of travel of electrification renewable energy harnessing and behavioural change and sought to design and manufacture a range of innovative products which would facilitate this shift their range of products  all designed and manufactured in the uk  are together the first eco smart home energy solution developed for consumers in this space






























 






myenergi has grown significantly since its inception from a team of just six in 2016 to a workforce of more than 350 today 2017 marked the release of our first three products  eddi zappi and harvi  and the establishment of our loyal tribe of customers in 2018 a fourth product  hub  was added followed by the myenergi app and zappi v2 in 2019


in 2020 growth really started to take off we opened our first international subsidiaries in germany and benelux followed by ireland in 2021 in the uk we quickly outgrew our existing premises and have recently opened our new brand new hq offices in stallingborough lincolnshire with plans of a second 45000 sq ft manufacturing facility already underway
