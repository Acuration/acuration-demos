how to charge the nissan leaf at home
 


 












among the pioneers in the ev market the nissan leaf stands tall as an icon of ecofriendly driving  the nissan leaf is a zero emission vehicle that utilises an electric motor its perfect for citygoers and short distance commuters or anyone who wants to reduce their carbon footprintas electric cars become increasingly popular potential buyers and ev enthusiasts often find themselves wondering about the charging process and the time it takes to power up these impressive vehicles
















 






how to charge the nissan leaf at home


first find the charging port the charging port for the nissan leaf is located on the drivers side of the car behind a panel that looks like a storage compartment and can be opened with your key fob or by turning it manually its also above a cable well this means that youll need to push down on some sort of plastic flap in order to access it the battery pack is located under this area as well


youll need to buy a level 2 charger for your home such as the zappi 
ev charger
 plug the cord into the charging port thats above the cable well the charger should have a male plug on one end and a female receptacle on the other plus an indicator light showing that its connected to power and working properly
























how long does the nissan leaf take to charge


charging time for the nissan leaf varies depending on the battery level and the type of charger used with a fully drained battery taking about 21 hours on a standard 3pin charger however when charged with a zappi even in eco mode this can vastly reduce and can fast charge within 60 minutes


you can check your battery levels in your cars infotainment display on leaf svsl models the status of each of the four lithiumion batteries will be displayed as one of these icons full four bars half full three bars low two bars and very low one bar


 


 




















what charger does the nissan leaf use


the nissan leaf will come equipped with a type 1 120volt charger best known as a typical 3pin charger this works well for occasional or emergency use but isnt ideal to be charging your vehicle on the regular using this type of charger can be both costly and could take up to 21 hours to fully charge


typically owners opt for purchasing a type 2 charger the nissan leaf is equipped with a type 2 connector for charging which can be used at home work or public charging points across the uk


 










how much does it cost to charge the nissan leaf




depending on the type of charger used will mean the costs and time for charging your leaf ev will vary for example a rapid or fast charger at 50kw will charge your leaf within 30 minutes a slow 3kw charge however can take up to 21 hours the cost to fully charge your ev depends on these different types of charging and will therefore range between 420 and 750 for a full charge subject to the charger and charger location


















more about evs and faqs












how far can an electric car go












the average distance an ev can travel is 211 miles however this is dependent on numerous factors including the size of the battery in kwh the vehicles weight  design and everfluctuating factors such as the weather














what happens when an electric car runs out of battery












if you have never run out of petrol when driving it is unlikely you will run out of battery the concept of recharging is the same as refilling your vehicle wed recommend heading to the nearest charging station when your vehicle reaches between 1520 capacity recharge on a public dc charger will take between 1030 minutes dependent on your vehicles charging rates














how many kwh does an ev use












in the perfect conditions an electric vehicle ev will use on average around 025 kwh per mile though this figure will fluctuate slightly based on changes in rolling resistance temperature wind direction and daily weather conditions














how low can my electric vehicle battery go before it needs charging












to maintain the longevity of a vehicle battery it is recommended that you 
maintain a minimum charge of at least 1520
 the average distance between charge points in the uk is 61 miles meaning the bare minimum charge required would be 4 though this is not recommended














what is the longest range on an electric car












620 miles is the official range of the tesla roadster and currently in the top spot for the longest range on an electric car the average between the top 10 longest range vehicles is 342 miles














what is the range of an ev












211 miles is the average range of an ev when comparing 40 of the best selling electric vehicles in 2020 range is determined by many factors including vehicle weight and the kwh size of the battery














how much does electric car charging at home cost












it would cost 777 on average to fully 
charge an electric vehicle at home
 and most users would fully charge once per week this is an average of 3108 per month
