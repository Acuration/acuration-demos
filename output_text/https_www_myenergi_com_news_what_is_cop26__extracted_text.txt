what is cop26
 


 








 










cop26 is the word on everyones lips but what is it and why has it got the whole world talking


for more than a quarter of a century the 
united nations un
 have been bringing together most of the earths countries for global climate summits also known as conference of the parties cops the annual event brings together almost twohundred world leaders to discuss the worlds commitment to climate change this year marks the twentysixth year and therefore giving it the name 
cop26


when and where is it


historically members of cop have offered to host the event and this year the uk are hosting the event alongside our partner italy right here in glasgow


the summit will take place at the scottish event campus sec from sunday 31 october to friday 12 november 2021


scottish event campus sec


why is this years conference so important


since the very first cop summit took place in 1995 the subject of climate change has become a growing concern from being an issue of fairly low importance to a global emergency


a crucial moment for this change happened at cop21 in 2015 when the paris agreement was formed the paris agreement was the first ever legally binding commitment to mitigate global warming


the agreement meant that every single country irrespective of their size agreed to reducing carbon emissions to drop the global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees celsius  with an aim to try and reduce this even further to less than 15 degrees celsius the agreement also presented a financial commitment to ensure that funds were made available to help deliver the aims set out


also as part of the agreement every fiveyears each country is required to update their plans setting out how they intend to reduce their emissions and how much by these are known as nationally determined contributions ndcs


the ndcs that were set out in paris unfortunately did not meet the 2 degrees set out in the agreement and the window for achieving the target is closing therefore this cop is crucial as countries must provide stronger plans to be in with a chance of achieving the target


what is myenergi doing to support cop26 and the uk in their contribution to climate change


at myenergi we recognise that the targets set at cop are important but what is crucial is the action taken to achieve those targets and that is why we are a headline partner of the 
fully charged stopburningstuff manifesto
 in 2021s cop26


the manifesto specifically focuses on the solutions to climate change the biggest threat humanity has ever faced and our products are a key part of the solution


our products allow users to utilise their surplus green energy ultimately reducing reliance on the grid and providing users with energy independence


myenergi zappi 
ev charger


as we move towards the electrification of vehicles providing zero emission transport also brings about the challenge of reducing extra strain on the grid our ecosmart ev charger 
zappi
 has the ability to charge through 100 selfgenerated green energy and off grid with many intelligent features the zappi gives users complete control of their electric car charging experience such as the ability to utilise time of use and economy tariffs allowing users to schedule chargers at times when energy tariffs are at their lowest thus encouraging energy consciousness


but the electrification is just one step towards decarbonisation the notion towards implementing ecosmart technology in new homes as standard will provide another way in which we can remove the need for burning coal and thus reduce strain on the grid that is why we have created 
eddi
 eddi is a microgeneration energy diverter which provides a brain to any solar pv and renewable home set up rather than filtering surplus energy back to the grid eddi allows users to maximise the use of their surplus green energy by diverting it elsewhere within the home


with all this new technology integrating them into your current home property set up can seem daunting and costly we have created integrated wireless technologies such as 
harvi
 and 
hub
 making it very easy for installers by reducing difficult cable routing making for quicker and easier installations


this seamless control and monitoring ecosystem between all myenergi smart home products combined with the potential return on investment benefits is totally unique in the marketplace


glasgow science centre


how can you get involved


 
whilst cop26 itself is a closed event there is plenty that you can do to get involved the event has two zones known as the blue zone and the green zone


the blue zone is a unmanaged zone closed to the public at the scottish event campus sec this is where the negotiations will take place


the green zone is a public zone held at the glasgow science centre which will be hosting events exhibitions cultural performances workshops and talks from people all over the world  over the course of cop there will be amazing opportunities to listen learn and start the discission on climate action


you view the full itinerary list and book tickets to visit the green zone

follow us at cop


ahead of cop this friday 29 october we will be joined by the 
electric vehicle association eva
 as they make a pit stop at our uk hq in north east lincolnshire on their drive to glasgow for cop read more about the event 
here


the green team will be heading up to glasgow to spark climate action conversations make sure to keep an eye out on our social media accounts to keep up with the latest
