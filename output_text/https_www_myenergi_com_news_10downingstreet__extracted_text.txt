myenergi attends the great british entrepreneurs reception at 10 downing street
 


 








 










earlier this week 24 april our cofounder jordan brompton visited 10 downing street for the great british entrepreneurs reception the exclusive event which was also attended by the prime minister rishi sunak and chancellor of the exchequer jeremy hunt celebrated the achievements of some of the uks most successful entrepreneurs


the great british entrepreneur awards is a prestigious ceremony that recognises business leaders from across the uk who have shown exceptional vision innovation and commercial prowess jordan took home the award in 2022 which also saw myenergi crowned scaleup entrepreneur of the year


the reception at downing street was an exciting opportunity for jordan to network with other successful entrepreneurs and showcase the achievements of myenergi it marked a proud moment for the company to be recognised among the best and brightest in the uk


i had to pinch myself to make sure it was all real  what weve achieved at myenergi is nothing short of amazing commented jordan


since founding the business in 2016 weve experienced whirlwind growth  expanding from a handful of staff manufacturing products by hand in a countryside workshop to a global team operating from our stateoftheart headquarters in stallingborough as well as subsidiaries in ireland germany the netherlands and australia


i was representing every single member of the myenergi team who are collectively disrupting the industry and really pushing the company forward i just wish everyone could have come along


as a business weve quickly become a leader in the manufacture of sustainable energy solutions including ev charging solutions and energy management tech our flagship product zappi allows users to charge their car using excess solar energy generated by solar panels rather than relying on grid electricity


over the past three years alone weve experienced an average annual growth of more than 180 with the clear targets of both new market entry and new product development as the world shifts towards renewables were committed to staying at the forefront of the industry providing innovative solutions that help consumers reduce their carbon footprint and save on energy costs
