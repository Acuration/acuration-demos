lincolnshires myenergi secure 12 million investment from high profile uk businessmen bill currie and sir terry leahy
 


 




















the exciting and vibrant lincolnshire based ecoproduct manufacturer myenergi keep going from strength to strength


after the product launch in september 2016 of their now famous zappi electric vehicle charger and smart power diverter eddi founders lee sutton and jordan brompton have just secured significant investment from high profile businessmen sir terry leahy and bill currie


myenergi have had a successful first year releasing 3 products to market and featuring an episode on the popular fullycharged youtube series starring and presented by red dwarfs robert llewelyn placing them as a major player in the ever expanding ev and renewables market

myenergi are delighted to welcome sir terry former ceo of tesco and start up investor and bill founder of the william currie group with open arms and are excited to see where they can take myenergi with their proven expertise and support


the investment will allow the myenergi team to increase production capacity in response to the high demand the small team of 7 has already almost doubled in size within the last month and are looking to recruit more staff


myenergi manufacture the ecosmart zappi the smartest 
ev charger
 on the market a product that is olev approved meaning new electric vehicle owners in the uk can receive a 500 grant back from the government


the product has a long list of features one of the most popular being loadbalancing this feature reduces power to the car when a large load is turned on in the house ie an electric shower washing machine or kettle zappi can also charge from economy rate tariffs zappi boasts features for homeowners with microgeneration ie solar panels or a wind turbine dynamically shifting surplusspare energy from the solar panels to an electric vehicle essentially giving the ev owner the possibility of a free charge from their solar or wind generation

myenergi not only offer smart charging solutions they also manufacture ecosmart products that give the homeowner control of their generation and energy within the home their eddi product diverts surplus power from the homes solar panels to an immersion heater storage heater underfloor heating etc


the team have a long road map of products to release and show no signs of slowing down with their minds set on going global


our ethos at myenergi is to develop affordable easy install solutions to help maximise the benefit of solar panels and wind turbines as an owner of solar panels myself and a lengthy career in electronic engineering i thought why not develop solutions that will improve my return on investment and make the absolute most of my system our products do just that eddi and zappi reduce the payback period making having solar panels installed on your home even more attractive this is a big passion of the myenergi team as a collective lee sutton

here at myenergi we see a pattern emerging across europe as the demand for electricity goes up unfortunately so do prices however the price of selfgeneration systems such as solar panels are coming down and technology is improving at a rapid rate one way to lower your bills is to generate your own electricity and use it within the household selfconsumption this is something myenergi are extremely passionate about giving the power back to the people lowering utility bills and reducing the pressure on our national grid which means less reasons to use coal gas and nuclear power says jordan brompton


the british manufacturer has worked hard with limited funds to release their innovative products winning over the hearts and minds of an everexpanding customer base interested in and passionate about a sustainable future electric vehicles and renewable energy domestic solar installs in the uk are approaching the 1 million mark and are backed up by the impressive ev uptake currently the uk has 135000 electric cars and 5000 electric vans recent announcements by major car manufacturers reinforce the demand for electric vehicles and have committed to be fully electric some as early as 2019

the investment has arrived at a perfect time to ramp production up to satisfy demand


exciting times ahead for this small british startup
