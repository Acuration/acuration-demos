subsidy for the electric car
 


 








 










as an individual in the netherlands when you purchase an allelectric passenger car or a private lease car you may be eligible for the subsidy for electric cars for individuals sepp what does this electric car subsidy entail and what conditions must i meet we would like to answer those questions in this article

the electric car subsidy is valid for new and used electric passenger cars from the smaller or compact middle class this scheme is in effect in the netherlands and can be applied for once provided you meet the conditions in belgium until 2020 there was a zeroemission premium that encouraged the purchase of electric cars this premium has since been abolished


conditions for the subsidy of the electric car


the website of rijksdienst voor ondernemend nederland rvo lists the 
conditions
 you must meet to qualify for the electric car subsidy for example the passenger car you purchase must be 100 electric with a range of at least 120 kilometers the list price must not be less than 12000 and not more than 45000 in addition it may not be a converted car and the car must have been produced as an electric car

are you unsure if the electric car you have your eye on qualifies for the subsidy then check out the 
list of importers and dealers
 whose vehicles are definitely eligible


apply for subsidy


electric driving
 is becoming increasingly popular not surprisingly many people are applying for the electric car subsidy as a result the available budget is quickly running out for 2021 there is already no budget left from january 2022 you can apply for subsidies again

the good is news is that 
in 2022 there will be three times as much budget
 available providing opportunities to apply for electric car subsidies due to the declining purchase prices of electric cars the subsidy is lower though 3350 instead of the planned 3700 the subsidy for used cars does remain  2000

please note that the purchase or lease agreement of the car must be concluded in the same calendar year in which you apply for the subsidy if this is not the case you will not be eligible for the sepp thus to apply for the electric car subsidy in 2022 you must have entered into a purchase or lease agreement on or after jan 1 2022 the date you enter into the purchase or lease agreement is leading the electric passenger car must also not be in your name before january 1 2022
