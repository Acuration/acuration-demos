620 miles on one charge


teslas electric car range is capable of travelling up to 620 miles on a single charge thanks to its incredible battery power life and capabilities


having founded tesla motors in 2003 elon musk and his team of developers have worked extremely hard to ensure electric cars become the future of driving therefore cutting down on global emissions and increasing sustainability and renewability


people think of tesla as an eclectic car company but the whole purpose of tesla was to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy musk once said


with our cofounder and elon musks biggest fan jordan recently acquiring her very own tesla  and musk now promising a millionmile battery  we thought now would be the perfect time to answer all of your questions about the extraordinary qualities of the tesla battery
















 






tesla battery life


different types of tesla batteries and lifespan


the upcoming tesla roadster will be the quickest car in the world capable of travelling 060mph in just 19 seconds with a top speed of over 250mph it will also have the most impressive range of an ev driving for up to 620 miles on a single charge


to put this into perspective the longest vehicle range currently sits at 620 miles from the tesla roadster boasts a 200 kwh 720 mj battery


the main pain point people had with electric cars was always the limited range now thanks to the amazing work of tesla that is no longer an issue musks company has found the most energydense cell available and developed their batteries to suit its needs


in terms of lifespan tesla batteries are covered in your cars warranty the details of which can be found below

how does a tesla battery work


a tesla battery is not all too dissimilar to that of a phone or laptop tesla batteries use thousands of lithium ion cells to power the vehicle


equipped with a heating system capable of warming the battery in cool temperatures tesla motors are as durable as they are capable unlike hybrid motors teslas batteries have to be charged from outlets this is because they run solely on battery power meaning the electric motor cannot be charged automatically while driving


the energy generated and stored in the battery is then used to generate a small motor that powers the vehicle


a tesla battery can be fully charged in less than 90 minutes thanks to the supercharger the worlds fastest charging network
















 






most efficient environmentallyfriendly way to charge a tesla


the most sustainable way to charge your electric vehicle is to use renewable energy that you yourself have already consumed at home how do you achieve this with the help of zappi our innovative 
ev charger



easily installed in your own home zappi is an intelligent device that uses your selfgenerated energy from solar or wind power to charge your ev reducing your carbon footprint and reliance on the grid
