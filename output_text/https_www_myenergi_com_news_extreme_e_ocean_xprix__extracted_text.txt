myenergi set to bring a spark to senegal for ocean x prix


with just 10 days to go until the 
extreme e ocean x prix
 myenergi pioneer of the worlds first 
ecosmart ev charging device

 is set to electrify the grid and bring a spark to proceedings in senegal the 
hispano suiza xite team
 powered by myenergi is currently sitting in fifth position just 15 points from the top of the leaderboard


led by team manager juli mundet caballero and piloted by drivers 
oli bennett
 and 
christine giampaoli zonca
 the uk outfit is looking to build upon its strong start in the first event sensationally beating jenson button and taking second place in the crazy race the team have shown their potential and are hungry for more


 


oliver bennett
 is a 28yearold british driver with experience in rallycross competitions in 2016 he made his debut in the british rallycross championship and the following season he fought for the title
christine giampaoli zonca
 better known as christine gz is a 27yearold italiancanary driver in 2014 in her fulltime debut in competition she achieved her first victory in a gravel rally and that same year she was proclaimed regional champion of the canary islands in frontwheel drive vehicles as well as in group b4


 


 


ocean x prix which takes place in 
dakar senegal

 will see the teams race along the banks of 
lac rose
 drivers will face short drops sharp elevations twists turns dips and breaks  a world away from the soft sand and long sweeping full throttle sections of 
desert x prix in saudi arabia


 


jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi commented


pushing the boundaries of technology and capability extreme e is revolutionising global motorsport combining entertainment with environmental activism the championship is raising global awareness of the widespread impacts of global warming and the climate emergency


we were delighted with our performance in the championships first round 
 desert x prix
 it was incredible to see the vision come to life and take myenergi to the masses we cant wait to bring our passion enthusiasm and sustainable spark to the next event  were here to make waves and topple the giants


next event race 002
lac rose dakar senegal
29th30th may 2021


the ocean x prix starts on the beach running alongside the atlantic ocean which hugs the west african coastline drivers will be tempted to look left at the stunning waves breaking on the beach alongside them but this fast section will demand their attention before they turn inland and onto a more technical part of the course in amongst the backyard of the dunes


obstacles will include a myriad of short sharp elevation and directional changes as the drivers navigate their way through the tight and twisty inland sector a world apart from the long sweeping full throttle sections of the alula desert we will see less elevation changes experienced in saudi more like 4 to 5 metres here across a series of dunes but with more short drops and sharp rises




 


oli bennett racing driver for the hispano suiza xite energy team added already weve proven that the hispano suiza xite team powered by myenergi is a force to be reckoned with desert x prix was a great start for us and gave the world a taste of whats to come


 


having myenergi on board as principal sponsor has been a real breath of fresh air the company is renowned worldwide for its sustainable views and revolutionary products the brand a perfect fit and were looking forward to working closely together as the series progresses


 


extreme e the allelectric allterrain championship sees suvs race through some of the most demanding environments on earth including the arctic circle and amazon rainforest the series aims to highlight the impact of climate change on some of the most remote and notablyaffected locations
