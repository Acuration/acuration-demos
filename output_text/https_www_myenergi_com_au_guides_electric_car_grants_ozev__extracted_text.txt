what electric car grants are available
 


 




















what is an electric car grant


electric cars grants are available to support drive and encourage the transition from petrol and diesel vehicles over to plugin electric vehicles


electric vehicles dont release carbon and dangerous gasses into the atmosphere and therefore are much better for the environment


governments worldwide are driving the notion towards a netzero carbon target in an attempt to slow the pace of global warming amongst many other major benefits


these include increasing australias ev manufacturing and design sectors which in turn creates new skills and jobs and cleaner air in our towns and cities
















funding available for electric cars


in australia there is limited funding available for electric cars however if you are looking to purchase an electric car in victoria or new south wales there is certainly more support for you


we are expecting the electric car grants available to become more widely available as they are within other parts of the world but there is currently no set timescale on this


alongside developments in new technology such as myenergis 
libbi
 and 
zappi
 choosing green technology is becoming more accessible and more affordable


















 




electric car charging in victoria


buying an electric car has become easier for victorians with the state government implementing a 3000 subsidy the subsidy applies to 
zero emissions vehicles zev
 and is available for up to 20000 vehicles










 




electric car charging in nsw


the nsw government is offering 3000 rebates for the first 25000 new battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles with a dutiable value of less than 68750


this incentive along with the abolition of stamp duty will save eligible ev purchasers up to 5540 and help drive the uptake of evs to more than 50 of all car sales by 203031
