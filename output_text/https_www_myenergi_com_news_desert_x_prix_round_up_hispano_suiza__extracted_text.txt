desert x prix roundup  hispano suiza xite energy powered by myenergi


high five for myenergi in saudi arabia extreme e event


myenergi pioneer of the worlds first ecosmart ev charging device is celebrating a strong fifth place finish with its team in the first event for the new global extreme e motorsport series held in saudi arabia


competing against eight other teams  three of them run by formula 1 world champions lewis hamilton nico rosberg and jenson button  myenergi is sponsoring the hispano suiza xite team in the series that highlights sustainability and climate change challenges by racing in threatened habitats around the world


drivers oliver bennett and christine giampaoli zonca gz sensationally beat button to be runnersup in the crazy race  a last attempt to make it to the grand final of extreme es maiden desert xprix event in saudi arabias alula desert


their result puts them fifth in the extreme e standings heading into the next event at lac rose dakar senegal on 2930 may three further events will follow later in the year at locations in greenland brazil and argentina


jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi commented on paper extreme e sounded like the perfect arena for our brand we have been blown away watching it come to life with the first event in saudi arabia with widespread coverage in the uk on bbc itv sky and bt sport let alone the many other broadcasts elsewhere in the world and on top of that all the feedback across social media


our vision is to become the global leader in eco tech and smart ev charging so what better platform to showcase our brand to let people know we are here


we are super proud of the hispano suiza xite team and of course our two drivers oli and christine  their performance all weekend have been outstanding


oli bennett added to be in at the start of something like this is a very big deal to make the top five is great the crazy race was really intense  having jenson on the outside of me on the grid was incredible we got a slightly better line than him through the first corner and were able to make it stick

the dust was horrendous i was following timmy hansen into the first corner and it was impossible to see anything it was like shutting your eyes at 100mph you just had to back out of the throttle and try to find a different line


we have good points on the board and beating a formula 1 world champion is a pretty good way to start
