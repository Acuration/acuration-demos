green energy in winter
 


 








 










winter always brings a dilemma on the one hand you want to turn on the heating to get nice and warm in your home but on the other hand it is less good for the environment and your wallet green energy in the winter can offer you a solution to this especially if you generate your own energy

green energy is becoming increasingly popular which is good news for climate only in winter it is a challenge to produce enough energy yourself find out below how our smart devices like 
eddi
 
harvi
 and 
zappi
 can help you make the best use of green energy in winter


comfortable home


our innovative eddi helps you to produce green energy at home it helps you to become independent from the grid it also helps you to use green energy in the winter to heat your home instead of feeding it back to the grid in this way the energy you generate with your own solar panels is not wasted


positive impact of green energy in winter


thanks to climate changes influence on the weather winters will only get worse and more dangerous for the planet and ourselves fossil fuels only reinforce the negative influence this is why it is so important to use green energy in the winter from october to march are often the times when we rely heavily on our home heating and turn on our lights more often because it gets darker outside


saving energy in winter


investing in wind energy and solar panels costs money but it will also earn you money in the end your energy bill will be lower especially when you take full advantage of your selfgenerated energy you can save a lot do you generate too little electricity in cold months then look for a green energy supplier that way you can still use green energy in the winter and reduce your ecological footprint just make sure that the power you get is 
really green
