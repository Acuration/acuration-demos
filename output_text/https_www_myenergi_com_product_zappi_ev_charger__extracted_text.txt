power




choose an option
7kw 1ph
22kw 3ph
which is right for me
7kw 1ph
a singlephase 1ph charger can charge your ev at a maximum of 74kw this is most commonly found in homes and other domestic properties


22kw 3ph
a threephase charger can charge your ev at a maximum of 22kw vehicle permitting they are more common on workplace and commercial buildings though modern homes with 3 phase supplies can benefit from faster charge rates

connection type




choose an option
type 2 tethered
untethered
which is right for me
type 2 tethered
tethered chargers come with a cable attached to the unit which cannot be detached the cable has a type 2 plug attached which has become the worldwide industry standard and is suitable for all modern evs excluding a handful of early type 1 models hence if you have type 1 you should choose the untethered unit


untethered
untethered chargers do not come with a cable attached to the unit meaning you will need to use a separate cable to charge
