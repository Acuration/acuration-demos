ev charging load management
 


 












 






what is load management


load management  simply put  is when you use software to control your ev charging


standard home ev chargers use the power supply from the house to charge their vehicles nice and straightforward


but what do you do when you own a building where several evs that all need charging at the same time that could make for one very big queue


for commercial buildings workplaces apartments and things like that thats where load management makes a big difference


load management is the process of balancing the supply and demand of electricity on the grid by controlling the power drawn by devices such as ev chargers it prevents blackouts and brownouts and can also save money by reducing the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades


























commercial load management


charging multiple evs at the same time can put a lot of strain on your electrical systems and it could lead to an overload not good load management allows you to specify the amount of power used and it can adapt to different circumstances as they arise if the power required exceeds whats available from the grid then load management evaluates and modifies the flow of power for safety and performance


for example if you own an apartment building with multiple car points outside it will balance out the electricity being used and the risk of damage or overload to the charging infrastructure is minimised for four vehicles who all need of charging at the same time and the current used for a 32a 36kw charger is 40a then each car would be charged at 10a


































load management can save your bacon


if installing and maintaining charging points at your business is an big part of your future business plans then making the system is reliable and efficient is top priority


you cant risk an overload or blackout when you have commercial vehicles to charge a loss of power could mean a loss of business revenue and unexpected downtime


with load management you can rest assured that your electrical system can handle the demand of ev charging without overloading even at your busiest times

save money with load management


when handling multiple properties each with multiple ev chargers you need to know your set up is both efficient and reliable


myenergis zappi monitors the electricity demand and supply in realtime and can detect when the electricity demand is high and when it is low


each zappi communicates wirelessly with its buddies within the set up to dynamically and constantly adjust the charge rate according to how much power is available within the building this is known as load shedding by reducing the charging rate the smart ev charger ensures that the total electricity demand is within the available supply


simply setup the first 
zappi
 as master point then pair additional chargers as the demand for charging in your building increases

different options available












static load management












even distributes the power available via a preset system across all evs being charged at the time with each vehicle receiving the same amount of power














scheduled load management












depending on the time of day evs will receive different charging power  allowing for 
time of use pricing
 and when more power is generally available














active load management












the power available for charging is determined by the power usage of the connected building and can be set by the owner of the premises at times when the building requires more power less will be allocated to the ev chargers and vice versa
