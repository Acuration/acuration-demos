libbi is


a modular battery system that adapts to your needs


we created libbi to store your electricity to use it when you need it most 


libbi is modular each module can store up to 5 kwh of electricity so if you combine 4 of them it provides up to 20 kwh of storage

libbi gives you


ultimate control over your stored energy


libbi is not an ordinary battery system it is ecosmart this means that it makes intelligent decisions about when to supply and store electricity based on how much energy you use how much you generate with your solar power and the electricity rate you use










control

your excess selfgenerated electricity making you less dependent on the grid

your questions answered


faqs


ask your question here










i do not have solar power is this product suitable for me












if you have a usage rate with dynamic pricing from your electricity supplier libbi optimizes charging around cheaper periods and stores it so you can use it during more expensive peak hours


if you want to add solar power in the future you can do so at any time without having to purchase a separate solar inverter since the libbi system includes one












does libbi work with my zappi and eddi












absolutely libbi is designed to work in harmony with our existing products and connect your home battery storage to our energy ecosystem

using the intuitive preferences in our mobile app you can control if and when libbi is discharged to your zappi 
eddi
 and home this allows you to make your own decisions about how to use your stored electricity












what are dynamic rates












dynamic tariffs are available from some electricity suppliers these tariffs allow you to take advantage of cheaper energy prices at certain times of the day these times are usually offpeak hours when there is less demand on the electricity grid prices can also be more favorable during the day when there is a lot of sun and wind for example












does libbi work with a flexible electricity tariff












yes customers with a flexible or dynamic tariff for example in the netherlands nieuwe stroom anwb energyzero tibber frank can recharge and optimize their libbi around cheaper price periods


libbi offers customers the option of charging exclusively through their solar panels or combined through solar and the grid this means you can get the most out of selfgenerated electricity while also charging at cheaper offpeak rates












on average how long does it take to install libbi












the average battery installation usually takes less than 1 day if you are having a battery installed in conjunction with solar panels it may take longer typically up to 2 days depending on the complexity of the work required for example this time frame does not include setting up scaffolding for a new solar panel












where can i get libbi installed












the libbi battery and inverter can be installed either indoors or outdoors however the libbi controller must be installed indoors


when installed indoors there must be sufficient space around the system to allow airflow and it usually cannot be installed in attics due to weight or because an entry or exit route will be blocked


our certified installation partners will guide you through their initial research for the best location for your libbi












what is the largest system size i can buy












the libbi system is modular it allows you to create a battery storage system from 5 kwh 1 battery to 20 kwh 4 batteries












how do i determine what system size i need to optimize my solar power












the size of libbi system best suited for your home will be determined by one of our certified installation partners


this calculation is based on the size and electricity needs of your home plus the size of your existing solar panel system on average a typical household consumes between 8kwh and 10kwh of electricity per day


using these factors our installers can ensure you have enough capacity in your libbi to store excess solar energy you have generated or your cheaper grid energy












i have a source for wind power generation is libbi still compatible












yes libbi can store excess electricity generated by independent wind turbines installed in the home upon detecting excess electricity libbi ensures that it is stored for future use or used to power your other devices such as zappi and eddi based on your charging preferences












i have a threephase house connection can i use a libbi












yes libbi can be installed on 1 phase of your 3 phase home connection with the possibility of installing up to 3 libbi systems 1 on each phase alternatively we will launch a version with a 3 phase inverter in due course so keep an eye on our website












does libbi provide backup power during power outages












the libbi system can be installed with optional blackout backup


this means that in the event of a power failure libbi will supply the stored electricity to a special circuit or outlet connected to the libbi backup output
