solar smart saving with a novated lease
 


 








 










pulling into the myenergi apac car park everything looks the same as usual the
 zappis
 are still perfectly mounted on the walls and the orange roller door is pulled down with its symbolic myenergi bolt on full display 


but all is not the same because just in front of the door breaking up the sea of orange paint is a giant white car and an even bigger smile across the face of its new owner myenergi technical support specialist alex levett 




 


alex has just purchased his new byd atto 3 with a novated lease novated leases are car agreements that involve three parties your employer you the employee and a financing company employers often offer novated leases as employment benefits like staff discounts on health insurance or gift cards 


having worked for us since early this year myenergi was happy to support alex on his investment for his continued hard work and clearly hes pretty impressed


the car features astound him and he quickly begins rushing to show off his favourites namely the sunroof 128 display and lush leather white interior lets see how long that lasts


alex takes the car for a spin around the local area explaining to me that working for a company known for being ecofriendly and having the worlds best solarsmart charger i figured that eventually i would have to make the move to electric and im really glad i did


by granting alex a novated lease myenergi has helped him
 build his dreams
 the lease will reduce the overall cost of owning a car by taking advantage of various tax deductions whilst still working as a traditional lease 


 


how does a novated lease work


firstly you enter into a finance lease and novation agreement which means that your employer takes on the obligations of the lease payments and operating costs these costs include fuel service maintenance insurance and registration paid for through a salary sacrifice arrangement your employer then deducts these expenses from your pretax salary which lowers your taxable income reducing your income tax and increasing your takehome pay sweet right


the economic benefits played a big part in helping alex decide to go electric 


with the novated lease the benefits were incredible everything is included from rego and insurance and even down to new tyres and servicing plus the free charging onsite helps he jests


as we turn out of the industrial estate the indicator rhythmically ticking away alex and i begin discussing how has the electric car discount bill made novated leases like his a whole lot cheaper


i think generally the electric car discount bill is a massive incentive to go electric regardless of whether you choose a novated lease or not but it certainly helps alex tells me as we delve deeper into what the bill meant for him he explains to me that he received 3000 back in his pocket from a rebate when buying the atto 3 


 


so what is the electric car discount bill and how can it save you money 


the electric car discount bill exempts eligible electric cars from fringe benefits tax fbt fbt is one of the biggest expenses in a novated lease paid by employers on certain benefits provided to their employees but now an fbt exemption is available for electric cars first used on or after july 1st 2022 and only applies to salary sacrifice electric cars that fall below the luxury car tax threshold for fuelefficient vehicles 


a salary sacrifice can be a big financial concern when youre just starting in a profession i was a bit worried i initially thought why would anyone do that alex tells me but after working out the numbers and that he would save a whopping 30000 in tax throughout the lease alexs concerns faded away to be able to save money by getting a brand new 2023 car it was a nobrainer really he says 


 


what is it like charging an ev with 
zappi



 


as we turn back into the myenergi apac headquarters alex is keen to get set up with the zappi so that he can make the most of driving on sunshine by charging the car using power for the buildings pv system hes happily beavering away now pulling his charging cable from the car to the zappi and adjusting the buttons with ease hes got technical support specialist written all over him


i ask alex what it is like charging with the zappi 
so easy he beams the relief from the idea of never having to go to the petrol station spreading across his face i rock up to work plug the zappi in and wait for the sun to shine 


he tells me his charging stats showing me the zappi on the myenergi app and beaming at the ability to adjust his charger without having to leave the office he explains to me that a full charge from 0100 would take around 7 hours with the zappi but since hes keeping it toppedup from day to day hes usually fully charged by the time i go grab a bahnmi at lunchtime 


so easy i rock up to work plug the zappi in and wait for the sun to shine


as we head inside ready to get back to work alex tells me of his plans for this weekend his manager johnny picks up his brand new white polestar 2 on saturday were going to shoot off for an electric road trip somewhere this weekend he says with a smile


if youre curious about novated leases at your workplace speak to your employer to see if theres a novated lease or salary package arrangement in place your employer has the freedom to establish a novated lease program if they choose to do so but ultimately its at their discretion
