used evs  over the hill or an absolute steal


according to 
recent data
 from the 
society of manufacturers and traders
 smmt more than 12000 battery electric vehicles bevs were registered nationwide in july to date this year 127492 uk drivers have embraced electrification  an increase of 499 compared to the same period in 2021


while data points to continued sector growth wider market pressures are seemingly slowing the transition a worldwide deficit of lithium a global shortage of semiconductors and the ongoing conflict in ukraine are all heavily impacting production efficiencies with some oem lead times reportedly reaching upwards of twelve months


and thats not all while the purchase price of evs has continued to tumble comparable finance rates are still far higher than their internal combustion engine ice counterparts with government incentives also beginning to wane affordability remains a major concern for many motorists


so with supply slim and prices high is going electric necessarily the right choice for every motorist whats more even if you want to make the switch how can you do it without simply being added to an evergrowing order list the answer to both is pretty simple  look to the used market


what used market


a quick search on 
auto trader
 brings up more than 8500 results for used bevs and nearly 7000 results for used plugin hybrids spanning 33 manufacturers and hundreds of models  from hatchbacks and hybrids to coupes and convertibles the choice is truly vast and availability is immediate


while you cant miss the mix of topend nearly new models pushing upwards of 100k theres also a huge choice of cars for far less than 17409 the average uk spend on a secondhand vehicle you might have to compromise a little when it comes to colour features or mileage but the listings are packed with brilliant buys


there is such an expansive selection of listings from both approved dealers and private sellers that its difficult to know what the best buy for the average uk motorist is what you get for your money and what sort of realworld range you should expect


to give you a helping hand here are five choices of used models for sub 17k they are reliable reputable and most importantly environmentally friendly




bmw i3 33 kwh
  one of the first and one of the best the bmw i3 has a realworld range of around 125 miles its compact size makes it perfect for city driving while its futuristic styling help you stand out from the crowd


nissan leaf 40 kwh
  for a bargain price you can pick up one of the most iconic evs with a realworld range of 140 miles itll eat up the daily commute


renault zoe ze40 i 40 kwh
  cheap to run cheap to buy the renault zoe is the perfect allrounder you can easily grab a batteryowned model with a realworld range of around 155 miles for a bargain price


smart eq fortwo 17 kwh
  iconic styling and 60 miles electric range can be yours for as little as 13500 whats more no parking space will ever be too small


volkswagen egolf 24kwh
  impressive build quality and a realworld range of over 80 miles is more than enough for the average uk motorists daily needs




pushing your budget a little further you can easily stray into the realms of a kia niro mazda mx30 mg zs hyundai kona or ds 3 crossback all in all a great selection of low mileage used models for a fraction of the price


mythbusting  are used evs a ticking time bomb


many motorists are still put off the used market by misinformation even though the choice is there from battery systems failing and range figures plummeting to planned obsolescence after your threeyear finance deal is up weve all heard the rumours


there are many questions around how long you can keep an ev when you will need a new battery whether the range drops quickly after purchase and if the risks outweigh the benefits now the energy crisis is seeing electricity prices rocket


experts suggest that the average ev battery pack can last almost 20 years or 200000 miles  a significantly longer lifespan than the typical internal combustion engine and far longer than todays average length of vehicle ownership whats more while battery efficiency will eventually start to drop the average ev will lose just 2 of accessible range per year  an arguably minor decline


it might sound obvious but the latest models have been designed to far outperform their petrol and diesel predecessors significant investment has been made by manufacturers into designing evermore capable vehicles to suit the needs of tomorrows drivers and it really shows the evs of today which include those on our list have excellent ranges impressive durability and are cheap to maintain thanks to fewer moving parts


edmund king president of the aa said evs are cheaper to run have no car tax offer cheaper servicing and are exempt from congestion charges and some parking charges whats more as the range of evs and number of chargers have increased the aa has seen the number of breakdowns for out of charge half currently less than 4 of ev breakdowns are linked to running out of charge


so while scaremongering about evs is commonplace switching to electric really is the sensible option for motorists  regardless of budget need a nippy runaround for your trips into town theres countless hatchbacks thatll suit you down to the ground need something a little bigger for motorway journeys you can pick up an suv saloon or estate thatll keep on going for another decade


what about the elephant in the room


rising electricity bills


will your used ev quickly become a drain on your finances will the price cap rise far above petrol prices and massively impact my finances all important questions but again motorists shouldnt be concerned charging an ev will not put your energy bills off the charts


while the environmental benefits of evs are widely publicised the financial benefits are equally as impressive at current prices a small hatchback like the renault zoe would cost less than 650 per annum for the average driver to run if they charge at home even though these prices will increase in october when the energy price cap jumps evs are still the most costefficient option  especially with fuel prices now pushing 190 per litre for diesel and an average tank 55 litres costing upwards of 100




the real cheat is if you have a solar array and an ecosmart ev charger like the myenergi 
zappi
 in this instance you can effectively charge at home for free by selfconsuming your selfgenerated renewable energy  zero fossil fuels zero reliance on the grid zero emissions travel of course it requires an upfront investment but the ability to take total control of your home energy use is an attractive one


so whats the right car to buy right now well with so many to choose from its completely up to you make sure its electric though itll pay you back in spades
