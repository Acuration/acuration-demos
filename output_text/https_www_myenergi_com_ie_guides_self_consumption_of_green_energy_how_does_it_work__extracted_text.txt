selfconsumption of green energy how does it work
 


 












there is no denying that our world depends on electricity but how can we make sure that our reliance on it doesnt come at the cost of our planet by embracing selfconsumption and energy efficiency




















what is selfconsumption
















more often than not solar panels or solar photovoltaic technology and wind turbines will produce more than enough energy to keep your home fully powered this surplus energy gets sent back to the national grid  even if it exceeds your 
export tariff



to counter this selfconsumption lets you keep all of the energy you produce therefore reducing your reliance on the grid and the amount of wasted power you send back to it with a selfconsumption system such as our innovative eddi device electricity will be diverted back into your house before it goes out to the national grid


 








the benefits of selfconsumption


the main benefit of using a selfconsumption system is that you will be almost entirely selfsufficient you wont need to send your electricity to the grid nor will you have to rely on it when power is no longer being produced due to nighttime or poor weather


an additional benefit is that this means your bills will drop too without taking power from the grid you are no longer being charged for the electricity you already had but were unable to store


 








selfconsumption is just the beginning


while selfconsumption means you dont waste any of the green energy you are producing it is just as important to make sure that you are using your power efficiently


energy efficiency is a natural step to helping improve our carbon footprint


by utilising all of our generated power and saving it where possible we are creating less waste and lowering the demand for extra energy production from the grid  which could be coming from damaging sources such as fossil fuels




















what if i need to power an electric car


our intelligent 
zappi electric car charger
 is perfect for this if you have an electric car our innovative 
zappi
 device can charge it from the surplus of your solar and wind generation with three different settings the charging current automatically responds to your households power consumption


with a combination of selfconsumption and energy efficiency  and the help of myenergi products  you can become a huge part of building a sustainable future 
and
 save money on your energy bills
