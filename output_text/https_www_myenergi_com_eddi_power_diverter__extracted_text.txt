the ultimate
 solar diverter


eddi


a smart solar diverter  designed to help you maximise the consumption of your selfgenerated solar  wind power

so why you need a solar diverter


did you know that hot showers bath time and cleaning the dishes accounts for around 18 of a typical households energy use


thats a lot of electricity  and a lot of money


book your installation

put the brain into your solar pv with the ultimate solar diverter


a solar photovoltaic pv system without an eddi is a like a car without a steering wheel or driver without an eddi you have no control over where you want your selfgenerated energy to go or how you want to use it


solar pv owners without an eddi waste large amounts of their selfgenerated energy by giving any unused electricity freely or cheaply back to the grid


a solar diverter ensures that you are maximising the consumption of all your own selfgenerated solar  wind energy by diverting it to be used within your own property such as to power heating systems heat water or maximise the efficiency of a heat pump the possibilities are endless


























dont waste another watt of your selfgenerated energy


eddi uses stateoftheart technology to monitor pv performance and your energy consumption this means that surplus power can always be used in the best way  heating your water with solar ready for when you need it most

eddi is intelligent


watch your energy go further with eddi


eddi easily connects into any existing microgeneration system when added eddi continually makes intelligent decisions every 1 second about how and where your energy generation is used around the home eddi offers 6 key functions  

 













solar power diversion  












eddi diverts any excess solar or wind generation back into the property to help maximise the consumption of your selfgenerated energy opposed to exporting out to the grid in turn you can heat water with solar  for free














low generation trickle charging 












eddi can heat your water using lower amounts of solar generation 1kw whereas heat pumps  ev chargers usually require around 14kw before they kick in meaning eddi can trickle charge your hot water when the heat pump isnt active















heat appliance switching  












eddi will switch between heat appliances dependent on the amount of generation and the heat of the water at any given time and will select the most efficient way to keep the water heated














enhanced hot water functionality 












eddi supports destratification which keeps hot water circulating around the tank
 where traditionally hot water rises to the top of the tank the secondary circulation function will help to circulate hot water around your property at peak times to ensure the hot water is more instant














advanced app control












use the 
myenergi app
 to adjust and optimise the settings of your ecosmart tech devices to achieve maximum efficiency of your heat appliances and other smart devices set timers for your boiler through the myenergi app














smartgrid ready












eddi is a futureproof eco smart technology and connects to the internet through wifi or ethernet allowing it to fully integrate and work in harmony with other future smartgridready products around the home such as heat pumps 
battery storage systems
 such as libbi and 
ev chargers
 such as zappi




















 






run your heat pump with the intelligence of eddi


if there is not enough solar generation to powerup the heat pump eddi takes over the task of heating water using any available solar we call this low generation trickle charging


eddi can fully heat your water using much lower amounts of solar generation such as during winter mornings late summer evenings or when its overcast ultimately improving the life and efficiency of the heat pump and prevents reliance on top ups from the grid


eddi becomes the automatic heat appliance switch dependent on the level of generation switching between the heat pump during hours of optimum generation or eddi trickle charges with the immersion heater during periods of lower generation dependent on your chosen settings and preferences

smart tariff tracking


our eco smart technology makes intelligent decisions based on your self generated power and the energy tariff you are signed up to this allows your myenergi devices to optimise for drawing energy from the grid at the lowest possible rate per kwh










 




exceeding safety standards


safety is of paramount importance every myenergi product is engineered to the highest standards possible in terms of energy efficiency but we place equal importance on safety while we adhere to all industry safety standards we are always looking to provide the safest experience possible for our installers and users thats why we were the first to introduce pen fault testing ahead of every other manufacturer




























eddi comes with a 3year warranty


heat water with solar
 or wind with the added protection of technical support as well as having our excellent technical support team on hand to answer any of your questions and queries eddi also comes with a 3year warranty once your myenergi eddi has been installed please register your individual products to take full advance of the 3year warranty support
