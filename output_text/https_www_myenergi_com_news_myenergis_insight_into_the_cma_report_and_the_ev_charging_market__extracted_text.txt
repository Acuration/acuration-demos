myenergis insight into the cma report and the ev charging market
 


 








 










myenergi gives insight into the cma report and the ev charging market which outlines a number of areas that need addressing to facilitate the shift to electric vehicles and ultimately net zero carbon the uk has made great strides to increase ev use in recent years but a variety of challenges remain over the medium term as we try to reach the ambitious targets committed by the uk government and other countries worldwide


 


while the recommendations of the report address some of these challenges we feel it misses some essential elements necessary for the widescale ev adoption that we are encouraging and expecting over the coming years




accessibility and affordability 


the main focus of the report is on the 
rapid rollout of public charge points
 which while of great importance will not be as fundamental as 
home charging
 for ongoing ev adoption


 


currently 62 of ev owners charge their vehicles at home this is  and will remain  the most affordable convenient and commonly used charging method charging at home is even more affordable if a homeowner has solar panels a smart energy tariff and a genuinely 
intelligent 
ev charger

 allowing them to harness energy when it is at its cheapest and greenest


electric car charging infrastructure


providing support to those needing home ev charging will be fundamental in increasing adoption particular focus is needed for onstreet charging for those who live in rental properties or share parking spaces these ev owners currently rely on public chargers which could be fully occupied at the time of need or located a meaningful distance away from home this is a particular challenge in more rural locations access to charging evs at home should be guaranteed to ensure owners can easily charge their vehicles while benefitting from meaningful cost savings


 


we welcome the increased focus on these areas but believe the sector needs a much more coordinated approach to genuinely accelerate the transition to mass adoption of evs


 


market centralisation 


oems and dealerships currently have a lot of control over the market exclusively recommending and partnering with selected ev charger manufactures according to the cmas report these manufacturers hold upwards of 65 of the market already


 


as evs become more mainstream it is critical that more scrutiny is placed on this channel as an industry we need to ensure consumers are fully educated and aware of the range of solutions available to them some of which might have features they prefer or be priced at a level more suited to them without increased scrutiny there could be further market centralisation potentially leading to consumers homes not being properly future proofed as needed to deliver a truly smart and flexible energy grid


 


smart charging 


the governments requirements for home charge points to be smart is very welcome but the definition of a smart charger is contentious


 


a truly smart charger is one which allows for smart charging helps to balance the grid and can connect to the whole home energy system allowing users to have greater control of their energy use and charge their vehicle using the energy they have harvested themselves


smart charger installation


 


currently a charger need only connect to the internet to be branded as smart with manufacturers needing to selfcertify their products this could lead to significant variations in quality to reap the full benefits there needs to be more stringent quality controls to limit widespread adoption of dumb chargers in disguise limiting the benefits a truly smart charger provides our charger zappi was the first ecosmart charger on the market with functionality such as load balancing and full user control over how and when an ev uses electricity it can therefore be utilised very effectively with variable ecofriendly tariffs its technology can also be used to reduce stress on the grid maximise selfconsumption and cater for a host of other ecosmart products in the home


 


we hope our fellow manufacturers join us in building products which are designed with the future health of the energy system inmind and deliver functionality which is truly intelligent and designed to make charging the cheapest and greenest it can possibly be


 


what is the cma report


cma
 stands for 
competition and markets authority 
in the uk the main focus of this nonministerial government department is to ensure that markets and competition work in the best interests of consumers the cmas goals include consumer protection and reducing the amount of competative business behaviour and ensuring all uk business is carried out fairly and adheres to all legal compliances to the highest standards


what is a zappi


zappi is the worlds first solar compatible electric vehicle charger invented in 2017 by british manufacturer myenergi zappi operates as a standard grid to vehicle charger and is future proof when paired with a hub enabling firmware downloads in just minuets
