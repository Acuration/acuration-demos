myenergi champions independent installers with allnew online platform






myenergi the awardwinning manufacturer of renewable energy products for ecosmart home management has launched an online platform to seamlessly connect customers of its zappi ev charge point with certified installers across the uk


developed in partnership with 
installhub
 the stepbystep solution takes the customer through the
 
ozev grants application
 process and connects them to their closest myenergiapproved independent while 
saving time
 and 
money
 for the consumer installers benefit from sales leads direct to their inbox


 


louise mccormack solutions director at myenergi commented


working with the talented team at installhub weve developed a userfriendly platform that simplifies the purchase and installation process rather than leaving the customer to find an installer themselves weve essentially automated the process


 


in time 
myenergi
 will add a whole host of addedvalue features to the platform including onsite 
video support
 functionality and a 
generous rewards scheme
 for certified installers


louise continued were committed to championing the independent and building a tightknit family of approved installers to support the uks transition to electrification as such we try to make the partnership process as easy as we can  providing the best tools training and services possible to make installing a zappi quick easy and costeffective


our new platform further streamlines the purchase process and provides busy installers with hasslefree sales leads whats more as it takes customers through the ozev grants process theres fewer questions to answer and significantly less paperwork


 




 


stephen smith ceo at installhub added 


using the latest smart technology to create userfriendly mobile and desktop applications we partnered with myenergi to pioneer a unique system to directly enhance all business operations including automating initial lead generation organisation of work streams surveys installations and grant applications


the new platform keeps simplicity at the very forefront with many unique features to help users make the very most of this truly exciting sector
