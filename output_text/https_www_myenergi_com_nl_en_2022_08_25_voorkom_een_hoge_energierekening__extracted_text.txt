avoid a high energy bill
 


 








 










with rising energy prices charging your electric car is also becoming more expensive how can you avoid running up a high energy bill at the end of the month we will be happy to help you save


loading at home


charging your electric car at home
 remains the most economical option at a public charging station or fast charger the costs are often higher and rising energy prices are also passed on there however if your energy supplier has raised prices charging at home can also become more expensive it is therefore a good idea to take a look at your energy contract and determine whether you can save money by switching


prevent high energy bills with zappi


with our 
smart ev charger zappi
 you can easily charge your car when the lowest flexible energy rates apply by charging at the lowest possible prices you will soon have a lower energy bill

do you have solar panels on your roof zappi can use this energy to charge your car that way you make smart use of your free power using a small device called 
harvi
 zappi communicates with your solar panels thanks to harvi your surplus energy does not go straight back to the grid but is first checked to see if it can be used by your own devices thus zappi allows you to 
charge
 your 
electric car with your own solar energy



what else can you do to save


your electric car obviously requires quite a bit of power but you can avoid high energy bills in other areas as well are you already applying the savings tips below




when buying a new electrical appliance pay attention to the energy label and choose an energyefficient one


replace incandescent and halogen bulbs for led lights


will you be absent from a particular room for a period of time then turn off the lights and heating


do you often forget to turn off the light smart bulbs that you can set with a timer or motion sensor help save money


turn down your heating by at least one degree this will already save you at least 6 percent energy


in summer keep the heat out by blinds and keep windows and doors closed during the hottest hours


in winter dont forget to ventilate heating moist air is much more difficult than heating dry air so youll unknowingly use more energy so make sure you have fresh air on a regular basis


are you still cooking on a gas stove consider switching to an induction cooktop


turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth


take a shower rather than a bath and shower for shorter periods and less often a quick refresher at the sink is often sufficient as well


use the washing machine less often and wash at lower temperatures more often


when you can dry your laundry outside instead of putting it in the dryer
