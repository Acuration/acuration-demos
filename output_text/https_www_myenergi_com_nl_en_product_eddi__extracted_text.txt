eddi product information


eddi is a solar inverter that helps you make the most of your selfgenerated power instead of feeding it back to the grid


bring a 
eddi
 into your home and you can take full advantage of the 100 green energy generated by your pv or wind generation system


instead of feeding excess energy back into the grid as with a standard pv system our intelligent eddi power diverter feeds that extra generated energy back into your heating systems allowing you to heat water with 100 selfgenerated green energy
