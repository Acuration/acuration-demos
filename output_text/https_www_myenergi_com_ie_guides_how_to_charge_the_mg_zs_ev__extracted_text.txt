how to charge the mg zs ev
 


 












 






in recent years the use of electric and hybrid vehicles has skyrocketed and this is only going to become more popular in the coming years this guide takes a closer look at how to charge the mg zs ev the first electric vehicle in the chineseowned manufacturers range


the compact suv with its zippy performance attractive price tag and stylish design has made it incredibly popular among commuters
















how to charge the mg zs ev



wondering how to charge the mg zs ev the vehicle is very simple to recharge and features the common css charging standard this consists of both combined ac and dc inlet ports with the top portion of the charger designed for type 2 connectors which are used for typical home wall sockets and public ac ports the bottom section of the inlet port is designed for dc charging which requires much high power but far less charging time


when it comes to how to charge the mg zx ev the vehicle is suitable for use across slow fast and rapid 
electric car chargers
 this ensures that owners are able to simply plug it into their mains socket at home and utilise a fast charging unit or any public chargers


















 




how to charge the mg zs ev how long does it take


when it comes to how to charge the mg zs ev one of the most common questions that owners want to know is just how long it takes to charge as with all electric and hybrid vehicles this can differ depending on a huge array of factors the below figures will give you an idea but it is important to remember that it is very rare an electric vehicle will ever need to be fully charged from 0


using a rapid 50kw charger for up to 80 charge it will take around 40 minutes for a fast 22kw it will take up to five hours for 100 while for a fast 7kw it will be 65 hours and for a slow 3kw charger it will take 15 hours










 




how much does it cost to charge the mg zs ev


another important question that every electric vehicle owner wants to know is just how much it will cost to fully charge their car this is a hard question to answer completely as it depends on a huge array of factors


the first is the type of charger that you are using and the time of day using an ecofriendly charger during offpeak hours will cost less than fast charging during peak periods however the condition of your battery can also play a major role


on average though a full charge from 0 would cost owners of the mg zs ev around 25 and 30


























what is the range of the mg zs ev


now you know how to charge the mg zs ev the final question most drivers ask is what the available range is there are two versions of the vehicle the standard which features a range of 140 miles with average use or the long range version which is around 225 miles
