jargon buster the renewable energy definition you need to know
 


 












when something evolves as quickly as renewable energy it can be tricky to keep up with the latest definitions and jargon with new technologies released and entering our homes on a regular basis its easy to get bogged down in the terminology


however at myenergi we feel that an opportunity has arisen for us to go back to basics on the principles that define us














renewable energy definition




what is the renewable energy definition


renewable energy is often described as clean energy or green energy these terms all mean the same thing the renewable energy definition as indicated by the 
oxford dictionary
 is energy from a source that is not depleted when used such as wind or solar power


it is essentially energy that can be harness and used which comes from natural sources or processes that are constantly replenished and in theory will never die out


part of our company mission is to inspire and educate as many people as possible about the role each of us can play in helping to save the planet a huge part of that is educating everyone on the fundamentals of what we do how we do it and most importantly why we do it


so without further delay  here is our myenergi glossary of all the renewable energy definitions and myenergi terms that you may come across and what they really mean




















climate change definitions
















any significant change in temperature precipitation wind and weather  different from the norm  is known as climate change it is one of the biggest crises humanity is facing and covers more than global warming as it refers to all types of changes happening to our planet


here are some of the keywords and phrases associated with this phenomenon
























carbon footprint


a term used to describe the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the actions of an individual organisation or community










global warming


commonly associated with 
climate change
 global warming describes the increase in the overall temperature of the earths atmosphere


global warming is thought to be caused by the greenhouse effect  which in turn is caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide cfcs and other pollutants in the atmosphere










chlorofluorocarbons cfcs


chlorofluorocarbons are a group of chemicals that are made up of chlorine fluorine carbon and hydrogen it was discovered in the 1970s that they were causing a chemical reaction that was destroying the ozone layer and contributing heavily to global warming they were found in fridges and spray cans and were commonly used until the early 2000s until they were banned completely










the ozone layer


the ozone layer is part of the earths atmosphere that forms a barrier over the planet it helps keep out harmful radiation from the sun that contributes towards global warming






















greenhouse effect


the greenhouse effect refers to the trapping of the suns heat in our atmosphere it happens when the suns rays reach the earths atmosphere and are unable to be reflected back out again this happens because the rays are absorbed and reemitted by greenhouse gases










greenhouse gases


greenhouse gases are any gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect by absorbing the suns radiation carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs are the two most common greenhouse gases










fossil fuels


fossil fuels were formed from the remains of dead organisms over millions of years they are nonrenewable finite resources like crude oil coal and gas  so when they are used up they cant be replaced




























renewable energy definitions
















renewable energy is any sustainable energy that comes from natural resources like geothermal heat sun wind and water renewable energy also includes biomass hydroelectricity solar electricity and heat geothermal energy wave wind and tidal power
























biomass


biomass can be defined as any organic matter that is available on a renewable basis this includes organic waste from industrial sources plants or animals biomass is burned to release energy by either providing heat or steam that spins turbines










geothermal energy


geothermal energy is defined as heat derived from within the subsurface of the earth which carries geothermal energy to the surface by water or steam a geothermal power plant works by using the heat from steam or hot water reservoirs underground to drive an electrical generator










hydropower


hydropower refers to energy that is converted to electricity through flowing water its usually generated through the motion of flowing water turning turbines that spin a generator to generate electricity










solar power


solar power is energy that derives from the sun it can be harnessed in several ways including through photovoltaic pv and concentrated solar power systems csp these systems work by absorbing the energy from the sun that shines on the panels which creates electricity






















tidal power


tidal power is energy that is produced from the tides of the sea by making use of the difference between lower and higher tides tidal power captures the energy from moving water by using a turbine to generate electricity










wave power


wave power is created by harnessing the kinetic energy made from the waves of the sea similarly to how tidal power works the individual waves from the sea turn a turbine attached to a generator that generates electricity










wind power


wind power harnesses the power of the wind by using the kinetic energy made by the wind moving wind turbines to generate electricity


wind turbines are used to harness winds kinetic energy and turn it into mechanical power and can vary in size depending on whether they are onshore or offshore






















renewable energy technology jargon




















smart meter  a smart meter records the consumption of electricity at short intervals and provides realtime data about how much electricity your home is using and how much it costs it can also control electricity usage remotely






low carbon energy  the term low carbon energy refers to any technology that minimises the amount of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere low carbon energy tech can be any renewable energy source and can also include nuclear power






solar power diverter  a solar power diverter is a way of storing solar electricity these devices are growing in popularity as they can save you a lot of money how by preventing electricity produced by solar panels being automatically exported back to the national grid and storing it instead






watt w  a watt is how we measure how much power or energy is used by a circuit and it is calculated by multiplying the voltage times the current a television can use anywhere between 80 to 400 watts an hour and a lightbulb uses around 60






kilowatt hour kwh  commonly seen on electricity bills a kilowatt hour is the term used to measure electricity usage it is equivalent to a power usage of one thousand watts for one hour














electric vehicle ev  an electric car is a vehicle that runs solely on electricity and uses one or more electric motors for movement electric vehicles emit less greenhouse gases and air pollutants than a petrol or diesel car and dont use finite fossil fuels






photovoltaic pv  photovoltaic refers to the technology used to directly convert light from the sun into electricity






hybrid vehicle  a hybrid vehicle is a combination of an electric and a petrol  diesel car engine in the same vehicle they are used as a more renewable alternative to petrol and diesel cars as they reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using less fuel and emitting less polluting chemicals and waste






battery electric vehicles bev  a battery electric vehicle commonly known as a bev is an electric vehicle that is only powered by a battery they dont have a petrol or diesel engine and are 100 electric






plugin hybrid electric vehicle phev  a plugin hybrid electric vehicle is a vehicle that has a combination of an electric battery and a petrol or diesel engine the difference between a phev and a hybrid vehicle is that a phev can be recharged by plugging the car in to charge the batteries phevs tend to have a greater electric range than conventional hybrids  which means that they can travel further on electric power alone before the petrol  diesel engine starts up to help
