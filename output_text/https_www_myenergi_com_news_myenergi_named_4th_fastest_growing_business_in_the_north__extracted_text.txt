myenergi named 4th fastestgrowing business in the north
 


 








 










myenergi pioneer of the worlds first ecosmart electric vehicle charging device has placed 4 in the fast growth 50  an index of the fastestgrowing privatelyowned companies in the north of england


 


sponsored by ubs the initiative celebrates the growth and impact of successful businesses acting as inspiration for other fastgrowth firms to follow in their footsteps thousands of leading companies have been profiled since the very first list was published in 1999 with the initiative expanding in 2023 to include sectoral and regional awards


 


myenergi came in at 4 and was also crowned the regions fastestgrowing manufacturing and engineering firm having reported average annual sales growth over two years of 205 founded in 2016 the business is renowned for its firsttomarket range of ecosmart home energy technologies including zappi  the worlds first solarcompatible ev charger


 


in the seven years since myenergi has achieved rapid globalisation opening subsidiaries in australia germany the netherlands and ireland in october the business shipped its 600000
th
 device and announced a 30m investment from energy impact partners to further accelerate new product development


 


jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi commented when we founded myenergi the dream was simple  create a positive impact push the boundaries of possibility and change the world through pioneering green technologies we started with nothing apart from a few good ideas and a serious passion for change  today were widely considered one of the sectors fastestgrowing companies


 


being named as one of the norths fastestgrowing businesses demonstrates the mountains weve climbed the progress weve made and the obstacles weve overcome none of this would have been possible without the dynamism passion and enthusiasm of our people this award celebrates recognises and thanks each and every myenergi team member


 


its amazing to think that  just a few years ago  we were building firstgeneration zappi and posting them to customers via our local post office today our stateoftheart production facilities produce thousands of products every week with myenergi devices operational all over the world
