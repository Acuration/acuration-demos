what is a smart ev charger
 


 












a truly smart ev charger considers the integration with future technologies and relieves pressure from our electricity grid


smart 
ev chargers
 in their simplest form are chargers which can be connected to the internet the main purpose of this connection is to ensure that the device can be updated with firmware especially as new software and technologies are released into the market which may need to connect to the device


ultimately being smart is futureproofing the device so that it doesnt become defunct years down the line


 






















intelligent ev chargers


however being smart as far as electric vehicle charging is concerned is far more than just the ability to connect to the internet


the new smart charge point regulations which came into play in june 2022 consulted on by myenergi defines exactly what it means to be a smart 
ev charger



smart ev chargers ultimately have features that release pressure from the grid system including default offpeak charging random delay at the start of a charge

what kw car charger do i need at home


most uk homes have a single phase ac supply and the maximum rate you can charge at on a single phase is 7kw therefore 7kw chargers are most commonly used for domestic home charging


some modern developments are now feeding an ac three phase supply if your premises does have a three phase supply you can benefit from faster charger speeds and therefore could opt for a 22kw charger


therefore 22kw chargers are most commonly used on smaller commercial premises workplace or modern developments




















what is a smart ev charger


a truly intelligent smart ev charger will also have the ability to integrate with other renewable energy sources such as solar panels domestic wind turbines battery storage and work harmoniously with elements such as air source heat pumps and wider renewable energy technologies around the building


other factors such as how it can save customers money through integration with time of use tariffs and economy tariffs should also be considered when selecting a smart charger


zappi is a popular choice for those looking for a truly intelligent smart charger as it ticks all the boxes of what is considered a smart charger










zappi
 has been carefully designed to include several features and functions to give users complete control of their electric car charging experience such as the ability to utilise time of use and economy tariffs allowing users to schedule chargers at times when energy tariffs are at their lowest thus encouraging energy consciousness


not only does myenergi design their products for the complete userfriendly experience but equally with the installation process in mind reducing face fix cabling and the need to reduce disruption to existing buildings was an important factor in the product design process


accessories such as the harvi product is an energy monitor which transmits import  export data to the other myenergi devices every 1 second completely wirelessly and negates the need to run wired ct clamps between devices


















which ev charger is right for me












untethered chargers


untethered chargers come without a cable attached and instead youd use your own cable which is often supplied with the ev


the main advantages with untethered chargers are  


 those with type 1 vehicles would require a special type 1 to type 2 cable so would tend to opt for an untethered unit


 if you required a custom length cable eg needed a 12m cable between the charger and the vehicle tethered units come with a 65m cable attached


 they are aesthetically neater subject to opinion










tethered chargers


tethered chargers come with a cable attached to the unit which cannot be detached the cable has a type 2 plug attached which has become the worldwide industry standard and is suitable for all modern evs excluding a handful of early type 1 models hence if you have type 1 you should choose the untethered unit


the main advantages with untethered chargers are  


 convenience is the biggest benefit for choosing a tethered unit negating the need to keep unpacking and packing away your detachable lead each time










7kw chargers


7kw chargers are the most common charger for a home charging station and would be the most suitable recommendation for existing residential properties and most new builds with a single phase supply










22kw chargers


22kw chargers are the most common charger for smaller commercial and workplace charging properties with a three phase supply however some modern homes especially new developments can opt for a 22kw charger if there is a three phase supply to the property




















what is fast car charging


fast car chargers are ultimately ev chargers which charge at rates between 7kw  22kw ac the process simply involves putting more electricity into your cars battery at a faster rate where a typical 3 pin 13amp plug socket in the home would charge at the rate of 23kw fast chargers charge at more than three times the speed 22kw in comparison charge at more than nine times the speed


 23kw 3 pin plug socket known as granny charging  
would take around 
24 hours
 on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle  note most hybrids have very small batteries when compared to full evs


 35kw chargers know as slow chargers  
would take around 
16 hours
 on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle  note most hybrids have very small batteries when compared to full evs


 7kw chargers known as fast chargers  
would take around 
8 hours
 on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle


 22kw chargers known as fast chargers  
would take around 
34 hours
 on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle


fast chargers are not to be confused with rapid chargers or super chargers which are the types of charger youd use on longer journeys when you require a full charge in less than an hour
