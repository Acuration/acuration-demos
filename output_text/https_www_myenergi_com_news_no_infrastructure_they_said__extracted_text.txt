were buzzing to be involved in the governments domestic demand side response demonstrator feasibility study


no infrastructure seems to be the fearmongering words used by some media outlets with regards to electric cars


these 5 intelligent organisations will demonstrate how our smart devices zappi  eddi along with a smart energy provider and sophisticated platform can be used as part of the smart grid allowing customers to share the benefits from the flexibility of their loads reducing pressure on the grid and helping drive forward the future of evs and a more sustainable way of living


evergreen smart power and its partners myenergi snowdrop energy swansea university and the energy systems catapult will be using a virtual power plant to demonstrate how flexible ev charging and heating loads can controlled to provide substantial load flexibility in the future


the government is committing up to 775 million from 2018 to 2021 to support innovative domestic applications of demand side response dsr technologies and business models this grant competition will support up to 30 feasibility studies phase 1 and 10 demonstration projects phase 2 in domestic settings we are looking for innovative scalable and replicable solutions which could provide reliable domestic demand side response using a range of approaches which could involve storage heaters decarbonisation of heat and business models with novel usage of flexible demand
