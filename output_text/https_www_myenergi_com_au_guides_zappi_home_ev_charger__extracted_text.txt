why is there a need for the zappi ev charger


without a robust selfutilisation system such as our outstanding zappi those with solar panels or wind turbines often witness their selfgenerated power feeding straight into the grid

clearly homeowners whove taken the step to install solar panels and wind turbines are ardently championing the green energy movement its only logical that their next focus would be on electric vehicles recognising this trend we were inspired to develop zappi


as avid electric car enthusiasts were all fans of the widelyused app electric route which many like us swear by playing around with words related to this and the broader electric theme we felt a spark with the name voltmate


our creations stem from our genuine love enthusiasm and inventive spirit we believe in giving them distinct names and identities rather than nondescript numerical labels
