electric family car is it possible

electric family car is it possible
 


 








 










an electric family car does it even exist and is it really a convenient solution for a family or would you be better off continuing to drive a gasoline or diesel car

most electric cars are available in standard models with 4 or 5 seats do you have a larger family then the search becomes a little more difficult but not impossible there are also cars available for 7 people keep in mind that electric family cars generally start at prices from 33000 the 
anwb
 has compiled a list per price range of which electric cars are available and how many seats the model has


advantages of an electric family car


driving electrically is a clean way of getting from a to b unlike a traditional fuelpowered car an electric car does not emit any pollutants unlike a traditional fueldriven car an electric car does not emit any pollutants if you also use green energy to recharge your car you are already doing something 
sustainable
 another advantage of an electric family car is that it is cheaper to charge your battery than to fill a tank with fuel the disadvantage is that the purchase price of such a car is much higher than that of a fuelpowered car however cheaper models are appearing on the market and the number of secondhand cars is increasing


is an electric family car even possible


as a parent a family with young children will often still have to take you everywhere by car think of the soccer matches outside their home town days out to an amusement park or a family vacation to a campsite in france

in a family a car is often indispensable because of the many trips you make as a parent many wonder if an electric family car is so convenient after all you can 
t drive as far
 with a full battery as you can with a tank of gasoline it also takes much longer to charge than a tank of gas especially with small children who are not keen on standing still for three quarters of an hour at a charging station this is a challenge still even as a family with the necessary preparations you can get on the road well with a family electric car


what does an electric family car have to meet


ideally a family electric car should have a large range and enough legroom to provide a nice seat for everyone in addition a good trunk is also handy to store all the sports gear and suitcases

before you head out with your family you probably already have your hands full at home to get everyone ready on time therefore it is not pleasant if you also have to 
charge
 your car first afterwards having your own ev charger that you can use at home is therefore ideal with 
zappi
 you can easily ensure that your car is ready for you the morning before your departure with a full battery do you have solar panels then you can take full advantage of those to charge your car as well


before you go


before you hit the road with your family electric car its a good idea to determine your route in advance see what is the quickest way to your destination and where 
charging stations
 can be found  should the battery run down unexpectedly it is always helpful to know where you can charge are you going to an amusement park or zoo check the website to see if the park has special parking spaces for family electric cars then while youre visiting the park with your family you can charge your car right away for the return trip

extra tip bring plenty of entertainment for the road especially for young children waiting until an electric car is fully charged takes a very long time therefore bring a puzzle book or reading book or let them watch their favorite movie on a tablet dont forget their favorite cuddly toy it can keep them company while waiting
