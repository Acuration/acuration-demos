renault zoe ze50 r135 charging guide


despite being one of the more affordable electric vehicles on the market the renault zoe doesnt compromise on driving range despite being on the market for just over a decade renault has continued to make improvements to the zoe to keep up with industry advancements


as well as improving the mileage from a single charge renault has also been working hard to ensure the infotainment console has evolved with each new release to keep it in line with its competitors
















 






can you charge renault zoe at home


as with most electric vehicles choosing to charge your car at home is not only one of the easiest methods of keeping your car charged but also the most cost effective by choosing to use a 
home ev charger
 with the renault zoe you can take advantage of cheaper charging rates when compared to using public charging points






















how long does it take to charge the renault zoe ze50 r135


7 hours and 25 minutes


 






using a standard 
7kwh charger
 such as zappi it would take 7 hours and 25 minutes to fully charge your 52kwh battery the renault zoe ze50 r135 also has the capability to be charged on the 22kwh zappi which would reduce this charging time down to 3 hours














what is the range of the renault zoe ze50 r135


190 miles






the range of the renault zoe ze50 r135 with the 52kwh battery differs between 135 miles and 290 miles depending on your driving conditions and the type of road typically the average range from a full charge will be around 190 miles














how much does it cost to charge the renault zoe ze50 r135


390






it could cost just 390 to charge the renault zoe ze50 r135 with the 52kwh battery when fully utilising offpeak charging on an octopus intelligent tariff at 0075pkwh in contrast peak charging on a standard rate of 034pkwh can cost 1768 to charge up




















 






how much is the battery lease on renault zoe


there are two options when it comes to acquiring a battery for your renault zoe you can either hire the battery from 25 per month or you can buy the battery outright there is now also the option to full purchase the renault zoe whivh means you can choose to fully own the vehicle and the battery


price correct as of december 2023
















 






how long does a renault zoe last


as with any car purchase there is no guarantee on exactly how long the vehicle will last as this is dependent on many factors including driving styles and vehicle upkeep that being said renault does offer an 8year warranty on its batteries as standard as well as a 3year warranty and 3 years of roadside assistance as standard
