porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo charging guide


porsche has long been a brand which has been associated with fast cars and luxury as with many car manufacturers and largely due to global pressure for a more sustainable future porsche has released a few hybrid offerings over the years but the taycan is the first allelectric vehicle in its fleet


what the porsche taycan does better than other electric cars is prove that style and substance go hand in hand this fully electric vehicle handles like a dream whilst showing porsches talent for turning any shape into a sports car
















 






can porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo use a tesla charger


yes the porsche taycan is compatible with the tesla supercharger if you need some ultrafast charging whilst youre out finding a supercharger can offer exactly that


although the supercharger is an effective charging method away from home choosing to install a 
home ev charger
 will ensure you can charge at home in the most economical way possible with the ability to charge the porsche taycan using surplus energy created from your home solar panels a dedicated charger allows you to be in full control of your home charging






















how long does it take to charge the porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo


11 hours 57 minutes


 






using a standard 
7kwh charger
 such as zappi it would take 11 hours and 57 minutes to fully charge your 837kwh battery the porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo also has the capability to be charged on the 22kwh zappi which would reduce this charging time down to 9 hours














what is the range of the porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo


265 miles






the range of the porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo with the 873kwh battery differs between 195 miles and 380 miles depending on your driving conditions and the type of road typically the average range from a full charge will be around 265 miles














how much does it cost to charge the porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo


628






it could cost just 628 to charge the porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo with the 71kwh battery when fully utilising offpeak charging on an octopus intelligent tariff at 0075pkwh in contrast peak charging on a standard rate of 034pkwh can cost 2846 to charge up




















 






how much is a porsche taycan 4s plus sport turismo


starting at 95996 and ranging beyond 130000 its safe to say that the porsche taycan is one of the more expensive electric vehicles available


as with all the cars in porsches fleet there seems to be an endless list of customisations from the exterior colour to the stitching on the interior of course this all comes at an additional cost


prices correct as of october 2023
















 






is the porsche taycan fully electric


yes the porsche taycan is the first fully electric offering by porsche with a threeyear warranty as standard as well as an additional 8year warranty covering the battery you can be sure your investment is protected


the porsche taycan doesnt just guarantee the battery wont fail for those first 8 years it actually guarantees that the battery wont drop below 70 of its original capacity an addition which is not standard with all evs
