technological advancements and the increased focus on green alternatives mean that we are now seeing some of the best electric vehicles ever produced in terms of capability and range


the level of innovation automakers are currently achieving and working towards means that 
electric vehicle registrations have grown by 2400
 in the last six years this is of course music to the ears of our myenergi team with electric vehicles producing zero emissions and being altogether much more beneficial to the environment


thinking of joining the huge number of motorists  as well as most of the myenergi team  in making the switch to an electric vehicle explore our list to discover the electric vehicles with the longest range currently available on the market


1 tesla model s long range  370 miles


it comes as no surprise that 
elon musks tesla
 the brand that has arguably singlehandedly revived the electric car revolution sits at the top of our list 




the 
model s
 is the perfect embodiment of teslas commitment to innovation and technology boasting allwheeldrive a 17 touchscreen and an engine capable of 060mph in as little as 24 seconds




auto express
 described the model s as an executive car for industry pioneers that want to make a statement giving it an impressive 45 stars out of 5


2 tesla model 3  329 miles


tesla are well and truly smashing the ev market at the moment producing three of the models with the best range next up is the 
model 3
 with a range of 329 miles 


the model 3 possesses some of elon musks most impressive safety features including a metal structure capable of resisting four times the vehicles own mass which is the equivalent of two fullgrown african elephants




with preorders available for delivery from june 2019 excitement is high for the model 3 especially due to its slightly lower price of roughly 38900


3 tesla model x  315 miles


 


last but certainly not least in our tesla entries is the  
model x
 the quickest most capable sport utility vehicle in history according to tesla




seating up to seven adults and with stacks of storage space this is arguably teslas most practical model not to mention the fact it can travel from 060mph in an exhilarating 27 seconds




while the model xs 325mile range is one of the best it did score lower than the model s when reviewed by 
auto express
 achieving 3 out of 5 stars
