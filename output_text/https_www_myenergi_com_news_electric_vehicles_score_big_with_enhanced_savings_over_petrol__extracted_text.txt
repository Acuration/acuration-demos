electric vehicles score big with enhanced savings over petrol
 


 








 










in yet another step forward for green mobility ev owners using their 
ev charger
 at home are set to enjoy further savings thanks to the uks falling energy price cap and its not just a minor saving were talking about  its a significant margin that puts traditional petrol vehicles in the rearview mirror once and for all


earlier today 25 august ofgem announced the 
new consumer cap
 for october 2023 1923 with a drop in kwh price down to 274p to put this into context the typical ev now costs just 12 to charge up to 80 or just 674p per mile in direct comparison filling up the tank of a petrol vehicle to the same level would set you back by an astonishing 4640  thats 1385p per mile


this impressive drop in charging costs reinforces the multitude of reasons to embrace electric over more traditional petrol and diesel vehicles after all its clear that evs are not just the sustainable choice but offer an unparalleled financial advantage when it comes to running costs too commented jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi


jordan continued more than 80 of ev owners charge up at home making the falling energy price cap so important the savings are evident and the appeal of electric vehicles has never been greater this is a pivotal move towards getting more evs on the road and accelerating towards a greener future


its worth noting that while the energy price cap has dipped some public charging networks have opted to increase their rates leading to a call for regulatory scrutiny akin to the oversight petrol pump prices currently face even so juicing up your ev using an ultrarapid charger during offpeak hours is still cheaper than filling up your car at the pumps  and will continue to be unless petrol and diesel prices drop below 1 per litre


so gear up as we cruise into a brighter greener and more economical future where evs lead the charge
