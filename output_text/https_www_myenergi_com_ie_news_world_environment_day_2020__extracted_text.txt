world environment day 2020  when is it  whats the theme
 


 








 










on the 5th of june 2020 we will be celebrating world environment day  a yearly event that brings us together to reflect on the effect we have on our planet and campaign for vital environmental action


world environment day alongside the recently celebrated 
earth day
 not only encourage and educate everyone to protect our planet but they also help to unite us and create muchneeded solidarity in a time of crisis


its on days like these that we are reminded of 
why we do what we do



history of world environment day


driving positive environmental change for over five decades 
world environment day
 is an incredible display of solidarity unity and respect for our planet and all of its inhabitants


it was created in 1972 by the un general assembly to engage governments businesses celebrities and citizens to focus their efforts on a pressing environmental issue its first official celebration came two years later launching alongside the slogan only one earth


world environment days many highlights include last years 
beatairpollution
 campaign and the creation of the 
un environmental programme



discover how it has been at the forefront of climate change and wildlife conservation for so many years in this 
world environment day timeline





this years theme biodiversity


world environment day is hosted every year by a different country this years host is colombia in partnership with germany the theme for world environment day 2020 is biodiversity


the 
wwf
 report that it would take 16 earths to produce all of the necessary resources to meet the current demands of the human race we are failing to protect our planet and neglecting our environmental responsibilities despite the fact that the
 human population has doubled in the last 50 years



this is having a detrimental effect on biodiversity hence the uns decision to dedicate this years celebration to protecting it


the people behind 
world environment day
 describe biodiversity as a concern that is both urgent and existential made evident by the recent 
bushfires in brazil
 and 
locust infestations in australia




nature is sending us a message
 say world environment day campaigners




what is biodiversity


biodiversity
 encompasses the interdependent relationship between the 8 million species living on earth


covering everything from ecosystems to genetic diversity 
biodiversity
 can be described as a complex interdependent web in which each member plays an important role drawing and contributing in ways that may not even be visible to the eye


everything from our food to our medicines and the air we breathe relies on biodiversity it is what sustains the human race as well as many other species


it is imperative that we protect the species with which we share our planet our failure to do so has been likened by scientists to 
burning the library of life





why does biological diversity matter


biological diversity is critical for the overall health of our planet 
biodiversity
 provides us with natural disease resistance climate change migration oxygen food and clean air


anything that damages biodiversity also damages the systems that protect and support our way of life only by putting nature at the heart of our decision making can we reverse biodiversity loss and help 
sustain
 our planet once more


hunting animals on a mass scale for food and goods as well as destroying forests and bleaching coral reefs has placed us on the verge of a mass extinction we have upset the balance of nature and world environment day is encouraging everyone to make the right steps to restore it




coronavirus and biodiversity


roughly 
75 of all emerging pathogens in the last decade are zoonotic
 meaning they have transmitted from animals to humans


as the 
coronavirus pandemic
 has shown upsetting the balance of nature by encroaching on 
wildlife
 can create the conditions for deadly viruses to spread from animals to humans


in the words of the experts the more biodiverse an ecosystem is the more difficult it is for one pathogen to spread rapidly or dominate whereas biodiversity loss provides opportunity for pathogens to pass between animals and people


it is now up to us to protect our environment become more sustainable and enter a 
new normal





world environment day how you can celebrate this year


this year we will have to campaign and celebrate world environment day from the safety of our homes to learn how you can get involved check out the 
world environment day 2020 practical guide
