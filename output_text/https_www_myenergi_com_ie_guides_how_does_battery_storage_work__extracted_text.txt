how does battery storage work


by now its likely that youve already begun to weigh up the numerous benefits of investing in a 
battery storage system
 you might still wonder how they work despite all the benefits of owning a battery storage system


dont worry youre not alone in this guide we will look at some of the more technical aspects of a battery storage system specifically 
libbi
 and break down some of the complicated jargon for you

what is a battery storage system


put simply a battery storage system works in the same way that a rechargeable battery of any kind does just often on a larger scale like that of an electric car for example


unlike charging your phone or car and the battery running low when youre scrolling through social media or driving to work you can use the stored electricity to power the kettle watch tv or keep the lights on in your home


a battery storage system can allow you continued access to electricity in the event of a blackout it can also help by storing excess energy which is generated by solar panels to ensure you dont need to rely on the grid


however even without solar panels a battery storage system like 
libbi
 can save you money by storing electricity produced in offpeak times when your tariff might be cheaper you can then use this stored cheaper electricity during peak times to help you keep on top of your energy costs

how does a battery storage system store electricity


this is where it can get a little more complicated and the idea of having a giant battery in your home can also seem quite alarming however libbis battery uses lithium iron phosphate technology which is completely safe and stable making it the ideal home battery storage system


libbi utilises intelligent battery software to coordinate energy production smart control systems ensure that the battery is not overcharging or discharging ineffectively energy is released from the battery storage system during peak times which keeps costs down and electricity flowing

why should i have a battery storage system


there are a multitude of d
ifferent reasons
 why you should have a battery storage system one of which is the savings you could see on your energy bills you can also be sure that youre utilising any of the spare renewable energy that your home is generating either through wind or solar panels


however did you know that choosing to use a battery storage system plays a vital role in assisting the 
whole grid
 when energy demand is high your household can avoid relying on the grid altogether especially with libbis smart controls which communicate with grid controllers


so not only will you be seeing financial and environmental benefits for your own home but you could be a pivotal part of keeping the grid running smoothly and mitigating future blackouts

which battery system is right for me


this is a tricky question ultimately every home will have slightly different requirements and there are a few things you should take into consideration such as




what is my current energy usage


what are my homes power needs


what do i think my energy consumption will be in 5 years




when it comes to futureproofing your battery storage system 
libbis
 modular design means that you can scale up or down based on your changing needs each 5kwh module produces enough energy to keep an average 3bedroom homes lights running for 144 hours


as well as utilising the smart controls libbi can also be connected to your myenergi app so that you can remain in control of your battery storage this also means that you can manage libbi from anywhere in the world right from your mobile phone 


if youre still unsure about how much battery storage you need give us a call today we would be more than happy to discuss all of your battery storage needs and further questions
