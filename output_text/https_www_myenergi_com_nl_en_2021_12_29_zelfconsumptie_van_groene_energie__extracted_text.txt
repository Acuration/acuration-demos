selfconsumption of green energy how does it work
 


 








 










the world depends on electricity but how can we make sure it is not at the expense of our planet by encouraging selfconsumption of green energy and using energy efficiently and what better time to start than green january


what is selfconsumption of green energy


solar panels and 
wind turbines
 usually produce more than enough energy to fully power your home often you will even have energy left over this surplus goes back into the national grid this is sometimes unfortunate since you can use this energy yourself at other times at times when you need energy but do not produce your own green energy you are dependent on the grid 
solar panels
 do not generate anything in the dark while that is exactly when you want to switch on a light that is done with power from the grid

selfconsumption of green energy means that you use your own generated energy as much as possible it makes you less dependent on the grid and less energy will be delivered back to the grid smart solutions like 
eddi
 allow you to benefit from your generated energy first before it goes back to the grid


benefits of selfconsumption


selfconsumption of green energy has a number of advantages




your house is fully supplied with a sustainable form of energy


you are almost completely selfsufficient and not or less dependent on the grid


your energy bill will be lower




selfconsumption of green energy is only the beginning


by selfconsuming green energy you ensure that no green energy is lost however it is still important to use energy efficiently by consciously looking at your energy use you can reduce your 
carbon footprint
 by using all energy generated and storing it where it can we can pollute the earth less
