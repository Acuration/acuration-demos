zappi


first wed like to tell you more about 
zappi
 our smart ev charger an ev charger is of course capable of charging your car at home with your own charging station but our zappi can do even more than that it works flawlessly with your own green energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines thanks to our unique technology you can easily switch between your selfgenerated energy and energy from the grid so you can always charge your electric car in the most economical way

even if you do not have your own energy sources you can combine your electric car with myenergi products zappi then uses electricity from the grid to charge your car charging at home is often much cheaper than charging your car on the road

how does it work


our zappi is for sale with two different connectors type 1 and type 2 that means almost any electric car can be combined with myenergi products and charged using zappi

zappi is additionally able to adapt its charging power to your electric car it can also adapt to changes in the grid to save your money for example it can charge only when offpeak rates are in effect

can zappi be used for hybrid cars

standard hybrid cars are very similar to gasoline and diesel cars the difference is in the engine hybrid cars have both a regular engine and an electric motor which means there is no need to charge them however there are plugin hybrid cars on the market phevs that have a more powerful battery that battery can be charged by plugging in the car these plugin hybrid cars can be combined with our zappi charger


why does zappi have different charging modes


with zappi you can charge your car in three different ways




fast in this mode zappi prioritises charging time when using energy from your renewable energy source and the grid


eco in this mode zappi minimises the use of electricity from the grid and only consumes energy that is needed


eco in this mode zappi detects when a surplus of your selfgenerated energy is delivered back to the grid and turns itself on to charge your electric car with that surplus




combining an electric car with myenergi products


our green energy products zappi harvi and eddi are all designed to work together flawlessly making 
selfconsumption
 of your green energy easy by combining your electric car with myenergi products you can make optimal use of your selfgenerated energy




eddi
 is a smart energy diverter that you can use with your solar panels or wind turbines it uses a surplus of energy to heat water or rooms this way you prevent your surplus from going straight back into the grid


harvi
 can be used alongside zappi and eddi it is a selfpowered wireless sensor that measures how much energy is generated and how much goes back to the grid


the 
myenergi hub
 works with all our products and you can use it to remotely manage and monitor your myenergi products




Â 


our future dream


at myenergi we dream of everyone being able to generate their own energy and use it at home in doing so we can save the planet and protect the future for generations to come combining an electric car with myenergi products is just the beginning of our journey and we cant wait to share future developments with you
