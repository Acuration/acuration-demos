25 green energy terms with meaning
 


 








 










when something develops as quickly as green energy it is difficult to keep up with the latest jargon its easy to get lost in all the terminology reason for us to help you out by listing 25 green energy terms and their meanings


green energy terms


our mission is to inspire and educate as many people as possible about the possibilities in saving our planet a big part of that is explaining the basics and why we do it you will come across the following green energy terms on a regular basis wed love to explain what they mean


climate change terms


climate change
 means a significant change in temperature and weather conditions that deviates from the norm it is one of the greatest crises facing humanity it includes more than just global warming it also refers to all the changes that are happening on our planet terms you may come across are


co2 footprint


this term describes the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the behaviour of individuals organisations or communities


global warming


this english term indicates that the overall temperature of the earths atmosphere is rising it is thought to be caused by the greenhouse effect which in turn is caused by increasing amounts of carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbons and other pollutants in the atmosphere


chlorofluorocarbons cfcs


chlorofluorocarbons are a group of chemicals consisting of chlorine fluorine carbon and hydrogen  in 1970 it was discovered that these substances caused a chemical reaction that is destroying the ozone layer and strongly contributing to global warming they were found in refrigerators and spray bottles and were widely used until the early 2000s since then these substances have been 
banned



ozone layer


the ozone layer is part of the earths atmosphere and forms a barrier over the planet it helps to block harmful radiation from the sun


greenhouse effect


the greenhouse effect refers to the heat of the sun that is trapped in the atmosphere this occurs when the suns rays reach the atmosphere but cannot be reflected back the rays are absorbed by the greenhouse gases


greenhouse gases


greenhouse gases are all gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect by absorbing the suns rays the best known greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons


fossil fuels


fossil fuels are formed from the remains of dead organisms over millions of years they are nonrenewable and finite this means that they cannot be replaced when they run out


renewable energy terms


renewable energy
 includes all renewable energy that comes from natural sources such as wind sun water and geothermal heat it includes biomass hydroelectricity solar energy and heat geothermal energy and wind energy


biomass


biomass
 is a broad umbrella term for all organic substances such as agricultural crops organic waste manure and wood or woodchips


geothermal energy


geothermal energy also known as geothermal heat is energy gained by using the heat from steam or hot water reservoirs to drive an electric generator


hydropower


hydropower refers to the electricity generated by flowing water


solar energy


solar energy is energy that is generated by the rays of the sun solar panels are often used for this purpose


tidal energy


tidal power makes use of the differences between low and high tide the energy of the moving water is used in a turbine to generate electricity


wave energy


wave energy makes use of the rapidly changing water heights at sea the waves it is therefore very similar to tidal energy


wind energy


wind energy makes use of the power of the wind the wind currents set the blades of a 
wind turbine
 in motion and thus create electricity


smart meter


a smart meter keeps track of electricity consumption in your home and shows how much electricity you are using at the moment and how much it costs it also allows you to check your energy consumption remotely


low co2 emissions


low carbon means that you emit less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere with a particular technology


solar energy storage


a solar storage system ensures that the electricity you generate with your solar panels but do not use is not automatically fed back into the grid but is instead stored


watt w


watts is a unit of power and indicates how much energy is consumed for example your television may consume 80 to 400 watts per hour and a light bulb around 60 watts


kilowatt hour kwh


kilowatt hour means one thousand watts per hour it shows how much electricity is being consumed


electric car or electric vehicle ev


an electric car runs purely on electricity and uses an electric motor to propel itself these cars emit fewer greenhouse gases than petrol or diesel cars and do not use finite energy sources


photovoltaic pv


photovoltaic refers to the way sunlight is converted into energy


hybrid car


a hybrid car is a combination of an electric car and a petroldiesel car in one it is a more environmentally friendly alternative to petrol and diesel cars as they emit less greenhouse gas


battery electric car or battery electric vehicles bev


a battery electric car is a car that runs only on a battery they use no fuel or diesel and are 100 per cent electric


plugin hybrid or plugin hybrid electric vehicle phev


a plugin hybrid car is a car that uses the combination of an electric battery and a petrol or diesel engine the difference between a plugin hybrid car and a hybrid car is that the battery of a plugin hybrid car can be charged a hybrid car cannot be charged via an external charger and only charges while driving a plugin hybrid car often has a longer range than conventional hybrid cars


myenergi energy terms


our mission at myenergi is to create and innovate green energy products that help reduce your co2 emissions and energy bills


zappi


our smart ev charger zappi uses energy that you generate with solar panels or your own wind turbine to charge your electric car it can also be used with energy from the grid at the most favourable rates


eddi


eddi
 is an ecosmart energy converter that uses the surplus of your selfgenerated energy to heat your home and water


harvi


harvi is a selfpowered wireless sensor that can be used alongside zappi and eddi the smart device can measure how much energy you consume and suggest cheaper cleaner ways to power your car and home
