an installers review  written by api electrical
 


 




















 


this is a free noncommissioned guest blog post provided by 
api electrical
  a leading uk independent ev chargepoint installation specialist based in the north west


to give perspective on this blog  we are not aligned to any one particular chargepoint brand  we are proudly independent service providers and partnered to more chargepoint manufacturers than any other installer in the uk


our independence gives us a unique insight and perspective to review what is available to plugin car owners with regard to their options and choice of charge points and how the zappi compares


innovation

when we became aware of the zappi  it immediately stood out from the crowd it ticked so many boxes  and even boxes that were not there normally to be ticked we just had to become 
zappi charger installers


a nobrainer  guaranteed

we now always ask our customers whether they have or may get solar in the future and tell them that if they have then the zappi is a nobrainer compared to any other charger on the market


kinder to the environment and on the pocket

the simple fact is that the zappi is the first chargepoint on the market designed to attract people with microgeneration enabling zappi owners to take advantage of their surplus selfgenerated energy such as solar and wind and put it to better and cleaner use by charging their cars rather than than feeding it back into the grid and lets face it who wouldnt like free fuel for their cars


the feeling of driving around with your own generated energy gives zappi users a unique sense of ownersatisfaction and the more it is used  the more you save  and this return on investment is one of the zappis major attractions



design and installation

our electricians tell us that the zappi is very easy to install and it comes with some integral features that no other domestic chargers have such as loadbalancing to prevent tripping of the available supply which is something normally only associated with far more expensive commercial chargers


lcd display

the zappi also has an integral lcd display to monitor energy consumption and enables you to quickly and easily calculate the savings you make as you go other chargers require a meter at extra cost to be installed to provide this information


the zappis info display relays far more info than just kwh used it displays which mode you choose to use it it can charge entirely on free surplus energy pausing if more surplus is required or it can be set to automatically switch to grid when surplus has been used  or it can simply charge at a full 7kw providing approximately 30 miles of range per hour depending on the cars charging capacity


choice of cable length

another unique selling point for the zappi is the optional extra of an 8m cable rather than the standard 5m this is something that we think can be invaluable for customers with larger plugin cars that are compromised on where they can park their car in their drive sometimes 5 meters just isnt enough


conclusion

it is a pleasure to be able to offer this product to our customers and we consider it a clear winner on value for money because of its low cost and superior design features and if combined with solar or wind microgeneration it is a total nobrainer  myenergi sum it up perfectly with their simple but catchy strapline  charge your ev with your pv
