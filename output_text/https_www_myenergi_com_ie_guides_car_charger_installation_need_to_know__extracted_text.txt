electric car charger home installation ireland what you need to know
 


 












as the sales of electric cars and electric bikes continue to increase electric car charger home installation is becoming more popular than ever before


at the end of july 2020 there was an incredible 136600 
electric vehicles
 on uk and irish roads and the electric car market is expanding all the time more people throughout 
lockdown
 took an interest in the environment and what they can do to combat climate change


according to a 
survey
 by the society of motor manufacturers and traders theres been a 262 increase in the registration of evs since july 2019 there has also been an increase of 322 in the registration of phevs plugin electric vehicles


we believe everyone should have access to the necessary means to live sustainably  and nothing should stand in the way of 
owning an ev














choosing an ev charger


there are a few fundamental steps to take before you can choose the right home ev charging station the first thing to consider is what type of ev you have or what type of ev you are considering buying














 






type of electric vehicle


the type of vehicle you have will determine how much power your ev charger will need to provide for example plugin hybrid electric vehicles have smaller batteries than traditional evs as they dont run on electricity alone


electric vehicles have a range of battery sizes and their capacity is measured in kilowatthours kwh the difference in 
battery capacity
 can range from 176 kwh in the smart eq fortwo to a huge 100 kwh in the tesla model x and s to work out what you need we recommend researching the charging capacity of various chargers
















 






the energy source used to charge your electric vehicle


youll also have to consider what energy source youll be using to charge your ev if you have a microgeneration system such as 
solar pv panels
 or a wind turbine youll need an ev charger that is compatible with that power source


if youll be charging your ev from the grid youll want to look into energy tariffs that 
accommodate ev charging
  to prevent a significant increase in your utility bills many electricity providers have begun to incentivise ev charging by tailoring tariffs specifically to overnight charging
















what electric car charger home installation options are there


there are two main types of home ev charging station fast charging for homes and rapid charging for public chargers most home electric car chargers use ac charging however when rapid charging is required  for instance at motorway service stations  dc charging is typically used as it is quicker




we are seeing a rapid increase in the number of charging stations at uk  irish workplaces  particularly from companies that have electric fleets charging at work is becoming an increasingly popular facility  and many businesses are utilising the governments 
workplace charging scheme
 wcs which is a voucherbased option that provides financial incentives for installing ev chargers
















 










electric car charger home installation irleand


theres a variety of home 
ev charging solutions
 to explore most ev chargers work with all vehicles  the only difference between them is their specifications for example some ev chargers have smart tariff integration and solar charging capabilities while others do not




















 










am i eligible for electric car charger home installation


probably

the good news is that really anyone can get a home charging point for their car installed you dont need to be subject to any specific criteria it is more from a physical standpoint where there might be limitations for example no dedicated parking


but if you fit the following criteria then youre good to go




dedicated offstreet parking either on your drive or your own parking bay


wifi connection at your property


permission from your landlord if you rent your property






















what do i need to install a home car charger


















level 1 chargers


depending on the level of your home charging system what you need to install will depend on how many volts the charger needs


lower voltage level 1 chargers dont require any special installation but they charge at a significantly lower speed level 1 chargers typically provide around 4 miles of range per hour  compared to the standard 24mile range of standard level 2 chargers










level 2 chargers


level 2 chargers require 240 volts of electricity to operate and need a special installation process similar to that of installing an oven or other highvoltage appliance level 2 chargers require a certified installer although some ev chargers such as the 
zappi
 boast safety features that remove the need to install an earth rod










earth rods


earth rods provide protection from potentially fatal shocks in the event of an electrical fault by diverting current that could escape from a device to a metal conductor official wiring regulations state that in nearly all circumstances ev charger installers will have to install 3ft earth rods to prevent this from happening


providing earth rods  and making sure they are safely deep enough in the ground  is timeconsuming and can be difficult in stony surfaces it also pushes up the cost of installation

is there any funding available for electric car charger home installation


there are different ways of getting a charger installed at home having an ozev approved charger is the most important criteria if you wish to claim the 350 olev grant this grant is given by the government office for low emissions vehicles to cover installation costs and to ensure motorists get a reliable olez approved charge point installer


before you have your charger fitted you need to submit an application to the dno district network operator the company responsible for providing electricity to your property this request will state what type of charge youre installing and how powerful it is


the dno application is something your installer can do for you but if you want to install your ev charger yourself you need to follow these steps and information


we advise that you check the electrical infrastructure of your home before installing an ev charger the typical home works at a specification of roughly 60 amps  and you run the risk of blowing fuses and causing electrical problems if you reach the maximum amount of energy your street or board can manage


zappis builtin safety features monitor whats going on in your home to prevent this from happening and due to its load balancing and load curtailment features it doesnt require a dno


 




























 






how much does electric car charger home installation cost


the most popular smart ev chargers in the ireland vary in price  ranging anywhere from 600  3500 including installation this mainly depends on the technology and specifications of the individual charger


zappi is at the lower end of the price spectrum  yet its capabilities are in keeping with the higher end of the price range it not only has the smart capabilities of three charging modes   its also engineered to be as sustainable as possible






















how do i maintain my electric car charger




home ev charging points typically dont require much maintenance and any reputable ev charger will come with a 
3year warranty
 there are however ways you can take care of your ev charger to make sure it lasts as long as possible


how do i make the most out of my electric car charger


many ev chargers come with a huge range of capabilities  going beyond simply charging the ev to make the most out of your ev charger you should find a mode and rate of charge that best suits your needs










for example the zappi has three different types of charging mode




fast mode this is exactly as it sounds in this mode zappi will charge your vehicle at the maximum power as quickly as possible this mode will utilise any surplus energy available and top up to maximum power from the grid until the vehicle is fully charged


eco on eco mode zappi becomes an intelligent device that adjusts its charge rate to minimise using electricity from the national grid with over 14kwh surplus zappi will charge just like in eco mode however if the surplus drops below the minimum charge rate of 14kw zappi will pull from the grid to achieve the 14kw and remain charging instead of pausing the charge


eco the most economical charging mode this is the complete opposite to fast mode in eco zappi will charge on 100 green energy from your surplus pv with absolutely zero grid power




specifically designed to work alongside solar pv panels and wind turbines zappi can automatically start charging your ev with any surplus power generated this means no energy is wasted or exported to the grid


at myenergi were proud to engineer a smart ev charger thats designed to give our customers complete control over how much of their selfgenerated renewable energy is used to charge their ev zappi isnt simply a solar pv or wind turbine charger  it has the power to use both the grid and a microgeneration system
















 






complimenting your ev charger


you can enhance the performance of your electric car charger home installation by using extra devices these devices can monitor usage and increase the efficiency of your ev charger such as the 
harvi
 and eddi


eddi is a 
power diverter
 that can be used alongside solar pv panels and wind turbines eddi makes sure all the renewable energy you generate stays where it should in your home and not exported to the grid it does this by directing excess energy to heat water or rooms making sure none is wasted


the harvi is another intelligent device that saves time and money when installing an ev charger it allows the entire myenergi product family to be installed without the need for a wired current transformer ct the ct is typically needed to measure the grid or generation power  which instead is connected to harvi


harvi is a wireless device that harvests the energy from the ct and transmits it to the eddi and  or zappi  eliminating the need for wiring
