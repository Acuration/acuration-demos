world space week
 


 








 










the week of the 4th  10th of october we will be celebrating the annual 
world space week
 it is the largest space event on earth celebrating science and technology and their contribution to the betterment of the human condition with over 8000 events held last year in 96 different countries




this years theme satellites improve life


this year the space week theme is satellites improve life and with this theme the world space week will show the importance of satellites in daily life and how our lives are affected by satellites such as in communication the environment transport weather forecasts telemedicine science and much much more satellites are more important and accessible than ever the reduction and lower launch costs have even made satellites available to schools companies are developing constellations of small satellites to make the internet available to everyone in the world


satellites are everywhere in our lives which means we often take them for granted but not anymore lets big up the satellite this world space week i mean imagine the world without gps navigation


 




world space week



whats happening


observe satellites during world space week


when
 410th october


what
 the first step to getting involved this week is to simply observe the satellites from your garden if you can see stars where you live then you can probably see some satellites

observing satellites is simple after sunset when the sky is dark go outside and turn off any outdoor lights let your eyes adjust to the darkness look at the stars you can easily tell a satellite from a star because the satellite is moving slowly sometimes it may appear to blink because it is rotating satellites will move across the sky from horizon to horizon


you can see satellites in the early evening because although it is dark where you are standing there is still sunlight above you in lowearth orbit leo you can see leo satellites because they reflect light from the sun to your eyes on a typical evening with dark skies you can easily see several satellites


once you see a satellite you may wonder which satellite am i seeing there are several apps and websites that show which satellites can be seen based on your position and time
