is an electric car sustainable
 


 








 










the sustainability aspect of electric cars has often been discussed in the media is the electric car sustainable or does it damage the environment after all in this article we explain what makes electric cars sustainable and how they affect the environment


1 much less co2 emissions


a major reason why the electric car is sustainable is its limited co2 emissions over their entire life cycle electric cars emit on average 
40 percent less co2
 out than gasoline cars 
milieu centraal
 calculated that a middleclass electric car emits about 32300 kilograms of co2 while a comparable fuel car emits about 53100 kilograms of co2 during this calculation they assumed the production of the car the battery Ã¡nd when it is driven 220000 kilometers in addition they took into account graygreen electricity coming from the power outlet the latter point implies that a positive change is yet to come producing gray power in power plants also emits co2 but green power does not during production do you charge your electric car with your own 
green power
 then your co2 emissions are even smaller

with our smart ev charger 
zappi
 you can easily use your own green power at home to power your
 charge an electric car economically and environmentally friendly





2 positive for air quality


an electric car is better for air quality especially in cities this is because while driving no particulate matter and nitrogen oxides come out of the exhaust particulate matter and nitrogen oxides are not only bad for our health but also for nature especially in cities where air quality is often poor this is a positive side effect of electric driving

there is one small caveat however like a fuel car an electric car does cause wear on the road surface and a spreading of dust on the road however despite the heavier weight of an electric car the wear and tear is no more than for a fuel car contrary to what some people think


3 electric car sustainable despite battery


a common argument is that an electric car would not be sustainable because of the production of the battery it is true that producing the battery requires a lot of energy however when converted the emissions of an electric car including the production of the battery are still less than the emissions of a fuel car per mile you drive an electric car uses less energy than a fuel car electric driving is 
much more efficient
 which makes the electric car sustainable

but what about the raw materials needed for the battery taking that into account can an electric car be called sustainable even then to produce a 
battery
 one uses lithium graphite and cobalt among others lithium and graphite come from countries that are reasonably developed cobalt however is not that is often still extracted from illegal mines in the congo it is dangerous work and also prohibited by law yet it continues to happen why because according to peoples organizations such as 
amnesty international
 there are more disadvantages to closing the mines however organizations do call for improving working conditions and using as little cobalt as possible in future batteries batteries made today already contain 3 times less cobalt than 5 years ago

is extracting the raw materials for an electric cars battery sustainable no often not and besides it is dangerous work so can we say that an electric car has a negative impact on the environment no neither why because it is because the components of a battery 
can be recycled
 unlike fossil fuels for a gasoline car for example

is a battery no longer sufficient for an electric car then it can get a second life as 
solar
 or 
wind energy
 storage does that no longer work then they are recycled and raw materials such as aluminum copper cobalt and also increasingly lithium are reused in this way the environmental impact of an electric cars battery is also reduced
