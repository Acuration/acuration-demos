what is a smart car charger
 


 












as electric vehicles evs become more common so do the technologies that support their usage one key piece of technology is the electric vehicle charger but did you know that not all ev chargers are created equal enter the world of smart 
ev chargers
 devices designed to optimize your electric vehicle experience


so what sets a smart ev charger apart from a conventional one how does it work and more importantly how can it enhance your ev ownership experience


in this guide we will explore the ins and outs of smart ev chargers their benefits and how they integrate into our increasingly connected world well discuss the technology behind these intelligent devices how they can adjust to your usage patterns save you money and even support the electrical grid


whether youre an electric vehicle owner planning to buy one or just techcurious this blog post will equip you with insights into this transformative technology lets plug in and get started














 






car charging a brief history


while we believe that electric cars are a modernday invention they actually date back to the early 1830s while at this time they were not massproduced the technology still existed they were mostly workshop vehicles built for personal use and were very limited to range and speed the lower cost of the combustion engine soon took charge and took the spotlight away from any potential of running cars from electricity for a long time


it is only really since 2006 that electric vehicle sales have soared this is due to the increase in reliability range and advances in technology most leading car manufacturers now produce at least one electricfirst vehicle and with every advancement the price of electric cars is also coming down electric cars are forecast to reach price parity with petrol cars by 2025


































not all electric vehicle chargers are the same though almost all modern electric cars come with type 2 sockets which are compatible across all the variations of charger this is with the exception of a handful of very early models which use a type 1 charger


home chargers require an ac single phase supply which most irish homes have and charge at a rate of 7kwh public chargers known as rapid chargers are usually dc and charge at much faster rates between 50kwh  150kwh though usually for a higher cost public rapid chargers found at charging stations are also tens of thousands of pounds in comparison to commercial fast chargers or home chargers which are fraction of the price










there are also 22kwh chargers available known as fast chargers for your home or workplace though the premises would require a 3 phase supply to charge at these faster rates these types of charger are often used on commercial premises equally not all vehicles can charge at these higher rates of ac so its worth checking if your vehicle can handle 22kwh charges that said you wouldnt do any damage plugging into a 22kwh charger instead your vehicle would simply revert to charging at the slower 7kwh rates


if you do have a 3 phase supply wed recommend opting for a zappi 22kwh 
car charger
 to utilise faster charging rates though for most residential homes wed recommend opting for a zappi 7kwh charger


















 






what is a smart car charger


a smart car charger works seamlessly and individually with your own electric car it allows you to manage how much energy to give to any pluggedin car this amount of power it gives to your car can depend on a number of factors




the time of the day


the demands on the grid


the type of charging required




utilising the power of smart car chargers saves time and money and most importantly economises energy to help us to better protect the planets precious resources our mission is to provide clean and green energy for all devices to free our users from the bonds of fossil fuel pollution we can build a better future together a smart car charger allows you to ultimately ensure youre powering your vehicle in the most ecofriendly way
















what is fast car charging


fast car chargers are also known as 22kwh chargers the process simply involves putting more electricity into your cars battery at a faster rate in a nutshell it will charge your car faster rapid or fast chargers are often available at commercial premises or service stations where electric car owners need a quickly charge to keep moving


they are also available as home chargers for example the zappi but they will not utilise the same moneysaving resources as eco an eco charging mode would the cost of car charging also vastly depends of the output of power the charging power of 3 kw and take around 612 hours to fully charge an ev fast charging stations can charge with a maximum power of between 722 kw and take between 16 hours to fully charge an ev whereas rapid or fast car chargers can charge with a maximum power of between 50150 kw taking around 2040 minutes to charge an ev to 100
