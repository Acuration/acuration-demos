zappi is a smart ev charger with a difference not only does it work like a traditional ev charger it can also charge your ev with 100 free energy generated by your solar panels or wind turbine and so here is the smart part zappi can charge free with your solar panels during the day and can charge at the most economical times at night if you can use your energy providers offpeak hours all controllable by the myenergi app no solar panels no problem if you dont have a pv system zappi can still work as a regular ev charging station that imports from the grid you can always add your solarwind system later
