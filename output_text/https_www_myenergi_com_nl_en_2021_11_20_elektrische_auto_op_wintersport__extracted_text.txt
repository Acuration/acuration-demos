winter sports in an electric car
 


 








 










with more and more people driving electric even during the vacation months the roads are full of electric cars not only do they hit the road in the summer but also in the winter they take their electric car for winter sports with the right preparations this is also quite possible

earlier we gave you some 
tips 
on how to safely hit the road in winter with your electric car among other things make sure you have winter tires and take an extra charging cable with you just to be sure also watch out for slippery roads and keep in mind that your range will be lower in winter


advantages and disadvantages of an electric car on winter sports


driving an electric car when going on a winter sports vacation has its advantages but also disadvantages

the advantages are




electric charging is cheaper than fuel


it is better for the environment




the disadvantages are




the range is limited are you taking your electric car on a winter holiday to austria then you will have to charge in between


loading takes time fortunately you can often combine it with a welldeserved break and a nice meal


are you going on a winter holiday during a busy period then your travel time may increase unexpectedly due to loading and traffic jams




on black saturdays youre bound to end up in a traffic jam but with an electric car theres an extra one the queue for the charging station in february 2020 there were 
queues of tesla cars
 in front of the charging stations so always be prepared


how do you prepare


if you are taking an electric car on a winter holiday it is important to prepare well in addition to the preparations for the holiday itself the journey there also requires the necessary measures




put 
winter tyres
 on your car


find out where there are 
charging points on your route
 plan your route in advance with for example 
abetterrouteplannercom
 this route planner shows a real range based on your car type and shows you the best route


if possible leave at
 night to avoid the traffic jams and queues at the charging stations in the afternoon


check whether your hotel has a recharging facility
 this saves you having to find a station for the return journey


set off
with a full battery
 with 
zappi
 you can easily make sure your car is ready to go


bring warm clothes
 in the car and extra blankets for waiting while charging to reduce the load on your battery it is a good idea to turn on the heating as little as possible in an electric car in winter


make sure you have the essentials like your passport driving licence and debit card with you but 
dont forget your charge card
 
here is a handy checklist
 of what to take with you when you go on a winter trip with your electric car


bring entertainment for when you are loading




with good preparation you can take your electric car on a winter holiday with peace of mind and all you have to do at your destination is enjoy it and charge it for the journey home
