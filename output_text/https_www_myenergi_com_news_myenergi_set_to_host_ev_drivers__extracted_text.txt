myenergi set to host ev drivers en route to cop26
 


 








 










later this week 29 october myenergi is set to host ev drivers en route to cop26 un climate change conference at its eco headquarters in north east lincolnshire


part of the 
electric road to cop26
 an initiative organised by 
eva england
 
eva scotland
 
geva
 and 
local ev groups nexus
 the group is visiting companies operating at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution to raise awareness of the need for faster transport decarbonisation


when they arrive at myenergi drivers will have the opportunity to meet the green team and take a private tour of the companys stateoftheart facility they will also be introduced to myenergis latest range of renewable energy technologies including the 
ecosmart zappi ev charge
r

jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi commented were looking forward to hosting drivers taking part in the
electric road to cop26
 as well as putting on lunch well be offering guided tours of our pioneering eco headquarters which was officially opened earlier this year


initiatives to raise awareness of transport decarbonisation are hugely important indeed transportation accounts for 24 of direct co2 emissions from fuel combustion globally of which road vehicles are responsible for nearly 75 a rapid shift to electrification is essential to combat these statistics but legislation is critical to accelerating the transition


alongside hosting the 
electric road to cop26 
visit members of the myenergi team will also be attending cop26 kate tyrrell events  relationship manager will be speaking at the cop26 ferry event hosted by national grid and promoting ecosmart technologies in the green zone throughout the twoweek event
