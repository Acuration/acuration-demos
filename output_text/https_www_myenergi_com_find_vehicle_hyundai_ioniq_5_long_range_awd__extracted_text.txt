hyundai ioniq 5 awd long range


the hyundai ioniq 5 isnt just a car its a bold statement in the evolving world of electric vehicles evs this model part of hyundais ambitious ioniq brand dedicated exclusively to electric mobility marks a new era for the industry with its cuttingedge design impressive technology and commitment to sustainability the ioniq 5 doesnt just meet expectations  it seeks to surpass them


with an absolutely incredible 5star review from almost everyone who has spent any time with the hyundai ioniq 5 its no wonder that this is one of the most highly soughtafter electric vehicles on the market with such an incredible reputation we take a look at the answers to some of the questions you might have before purchasing
















 






where to charge hyundai ioniq 5


the hyundai ioniq 5 can be charged at home with a 
home ev charger
 many electric vehicle owners will plug their car into the zappi to charge overnight in the same way you would leave your mobile phone to charge that doesnt mean you have to charge your car every night in the same way you dont have to visit the petrol station every day with a petrol car


hyundai ioniq 5 can also be charged at work if your work has charging points or by using any public charging station






















how long does it take to charge the ioniq 5 awd long range


10 hours and 34 minutes


 






using a standard 7kwh charger such as zappi it would take 10 hours and 34 minutes to fully charge your 74kwh battery the ioniq also has the capability to be charged on the 22kwh zappi which would reduce this charging time down to 8 hours














what is the range of the hyundai ioniq 5 awd long range


235 miles






the range of the hyundai ioniq 5 awd long range with the 74kwh battery differs between 170 miles and 345 miles depending on your driving conditions and the type of road typically the average range from a full charge will be around 235 miles














how much does it cost to charge the ioniq 5 awd long range


555






it could cost just 555 to charge the hyundai ioniq 5 standard range model when fully utilising offpeak charging on an octopus intelligent tariff at 0075pkwh in contrast peak charging on a standard rate of 034pkwh can cost 2516 to charge up




















 






how much is the ioniq 5


the long range ioniq 5 awd has a starting price of 50445 with the 
twowheel drive
 coming in slightly lower at 46945 however the entrylevel model 
standard range
 has a starting price of 43445


unlike many other car manufacturers who charge for the majority of extras each hyundai ioniq 5 comes with many extras included as standard meaning there is much less discrepancy between the price of the base model and the more advanced model


if you are looking for a car that will fit the whole family and be comfortable on the road then this is likely the car for you that being said the mileage range of the battery varies greatly depending on the model meaning it might not always be the best car for long journeys officially the battery range is anywhere from 170 miles to around 345 miles


prices correct as of october 2023
















 






does hyundai ioniq have autopilot


the hyundai ioniq 5 is the first car in the hyundai fleet to feature level 2 autonomous safety technology


what this means for you is that your car will be able to control speed and the distance between other vehicles as well as help you when youre changing lanes its not quite the come to me selfdriving feature that tesla has long been trailing but it does help improve the safety of your car


with an ncap safety score of 5 stars the highest award possible and an incredibly highreliability ranking given by whatcarcom the hyundai ioniq 5 is a car you can trust
