10 easy ways to make your business more ecofriendly
 


 








 










saving our planet from the doom of global warming is all about becoming more sustainable efficient and ecofriendly the enormity of this mission extends itself to all areas of life from your home to your business


whether it be through their own values and morals or a response to increased social political or consumer pressure surrounding climate change more and more 
businesses
 are looking at how they can reduce their carbon footprint


the urgency to increase sustainability and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels has never been stronger and every step taken towards creating a greener more ecofriendly environment makes a difference


if you own or manage a business or want to help ensure the workplace in which you work is as sustainable and environmentally friendly as it could be follow these 10 simple steps


1 recycle and use reusable supplies


in the us alone 16 billion plastic pens are thrown away each year lowcost singleuse plastic supplies such as this have a huge impact on the environment due to littering and waste


aim to use recyclable and reusable materials such as employee water bottles instead of plastic bottles whenever possible also make sure your recycling bins are clearly labelled and that your team is completely aware of what can and cant be recycled


2 use a renewable energy provider


if you are not yet using your own renewable energy be sure to check what sort of power you are paying for on your tariff to reduce your carbon footprint it is very important you are using renewable energy as much as possible


find out 
who supplies green energy in the uk



3 dont throw away old furniture and electronics


sometimes offices need a refurb a refreshed look an update we get that 
however 
theres no reason why your older furniture and computers should be thrown in the skip to make way for the new items


no instead you should look to sell your chairs and desks try trading them in at charity shops or selling them on the likes of facebook marketplace or gumtree


4 invest in your own renewable energy


reducing your reliance on the grid and creating your own 
renewable energy
 is the most efficient and sustainable change you can make in reducing your businesss carbon footprint


by generating your own recyclable power using natural resources you dramatically reduce the emissions your business produces


check out our renewable energy guides for further info on this




what are the different types of renewable energy


learn all about wind power


learn all about solar power


learn all about hydroelectric power




everything you need to know about geothermal power


 


5 introduce a carpool system


car emissions are one of the biggest contributing factors to global warming as they massively increase the amount of greenhouse gases trapped in our atmosphere


some of your staff more than likely arrive to work from the same direction via similar routes why not encourage them to share lifts into work therefore making full use of a cars seats while reducing the amount of fuel emissions stemming from your employees commutes


6 offer biketowork perks and features


cycling to work is one of the most efficient ways of commuting so why not incentivise your employees to do so


enable your team to cut down on the emissions they generate through driving and public transport by offering 
biketowork
 perks these can be as little as safe storage for bicycles in your building right on through to offering savings and vouchers on bicycles and bike accessories


7 use electric cars


if your company offers company vehicles as a staff benefit or uses vehicles to transport goods why not consider an electric car or hybrid


we appreciate that transportation is a musthave for a lot of businesses but there is often no need to have a huge gasguzzling vehicle in place of a more efficient ecofriendly electric or hybrid option


by getting on board with the electric revolution your business will appear modern and ahead of the curve as well as conscientious of the environment win win


8 use digital comms more than print


try to avoid print communication when digital or overthephone is an equally viable option this will cut down on print and mailing costs on the environment and your bank balance


9 cut down on energy wastage


little things like turning off equipment and lights when they are not in use can make a huge difference to your businesss environmental impact


through saving energy you are reducing the number of fumes released from power plants its also worth investing in energysaving light bulbs to cut down energy wastage


10 measure your carbon footprint


make sure you keep track of your progress and the positive changes you are making the best way to improve and ensure everyone is on board with the fantastic things your business is doing is to continually 
measure your carbon footprint
 against set goals


you have a key role in implementing positive change


few things have as big a say on the future of our planet than that of businesses all over the world its time to start implementing and influencing the positive pivotal changes our planet needs in order to survive
