plastic roads the solution to waste pollution
 


 








 










the harmful environmental impact of plastic waste has been a massive issue for years however 
macrebur
 has a solution plastic roads their mission 
helping to solve two world problems with one solution
  reducing plastic waste and improving poor road quality heres everything you need to know about plastic roads


what are plastic roads


currently our roads are made of a product called 
bitumen
 which uses crude oil rocks limestone and sand to create the surface macrebur however will use their own innovative methods to replace the crude oil element with plastic waste


instead of dumping our plastic in a landfill  and causing even more horrendous pollution  it will be put to better use creating smooth roads throughout the country and potentially the rest of the world


why are plastic roads needed


plastic pollution has been at the forefront of our minds for years but its severity was brought into the limelight in 2018 with a series of shocking images for example there was video footage showing 
waves of plastic waste washing up on the shore of the dominican republic
 and the popular attenborough documentary 
blue planet showed albatrosses feeding plastic
 to their young


how much plastic is used in the road


one kilometre of road made with macreburs plastic solution is said to use around 684000 plastic bottles or 18 million plastic bags although it is thought that 22 billion plastic bottles and 500 billion plastic bags end up in landfill every year plastic roads are a great start towards reducing plastic waste


considering the estimated 
total road length in the uk in 2017 was estimated to be 397025km
 you can imagine just how much plastic would be put to good use with macreburs new innovation


if you want to know what you can do to help reduce your carbon footprint check out our blogs linked below

how environmentally friendly are plastic roads


while it is fantastic we are taking plastic away from being dumped in landfills and oceans there are some issues associated with the creation of plastic roads in order to use plastic in the production of bitumen the 
material has to be burned and broken down
 this releases harmful molecules into the atmosphere which can linger in our oceans and ice caps


on the other hand it is important to remember that this is a recent innovation and like all new things it takes time for issues to be ironed out and resolved were excited for future developments in this area


when will we start using plastic roads


roads and car parks
 made of plastic have already been used across the country 
cumbria county council
 were the first highways authority to trial the roads and they are now using it in larger projects worth 200000 the uk department for transport has set aside 16 million for it too


what next


not only will this help solve the plastic problem but it also means communities can use local plastic to create and fix local roads macrebur also claims they can even recycle the roads at the end of their lifespan creating a circular economy and improving sustainability
