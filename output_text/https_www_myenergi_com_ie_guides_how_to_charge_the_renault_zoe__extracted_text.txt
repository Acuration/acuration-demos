how to charge the renault zoe
 


 












electric vehicles are becoming an increasingly more common part of the road network and there is now a huge array of cars to choose from many of the worlds leading manufacturers are now producing electric cars and the 
renault zoe
 is a fantastic solution for the urban environment


if this is your first electric vehicle and you are wondering how to charge the renault zoe we have taken a closer look at the process






















best ev charger for renault zoe

keeping the renault zoe charged is incredibly simple and the vehicle comes equipped with a type 2 
ev charger
 as standard while the higher specification versions of the zoe do come with a css rapid charging port whichever option you have the port is found in the centre of the front grille ensuring it is easily accessible


when it comes to answering how to charge the renault zoe it is important to point out that the car can also be charged on either slow fast or rapid public points at home the car can be charged directly from your mains power output but this can take a long time to do requiring up to 24 hours for a full charge from flat that is why it is recommended to use a dedicated zappi which can supply much higher power


buy zappi for your zoe
























how long does it take to charge the renault zoe

when looking at how to charge the renault zoe one of the most important questions drivers want to know is how long it will take to charge the overall charging time will depend on a range of factors including the current charge levels of the battery however using a 7 kw wallbox will take seven hours to charge the vehicle from 0 to 100


for those drivers looking for quicker charging then opting for a fast 22 kw will reduce that charge time to 23 hours a rapid 50 kw charger allows drivers to charge their renault zoe from 0 to 80 in just 45 minutes


Â 
















how much does it cost to charge the renault zoe

alongside wondering how to charge the renault zoe another very important question that drivers have is how much it will cost as with the charge time this will depend on a range of different factors including what charger is being used the settings being used the condition of the battery and the time of day that you are charging your car


a typical charge will cost around 30 to go from 0 to 100 but it is possible to reduce this by using an ecocharger and opting to charge the vehicle during offpeak hours


buy zappi direct














 






what is the range of the renault zoe

finally when it comes to answering how to charge the renault zoe you will want to know how far you will be able to travel on a charge the vehicle currently offers drivers up to 245 miles when fully charged which makes it a fantastic option for driving around town and beyond
