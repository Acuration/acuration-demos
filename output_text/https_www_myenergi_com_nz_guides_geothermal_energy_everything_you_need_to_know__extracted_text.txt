geothermal energy everything you need to know
 


 












 






earth is a powerful beautiful planet but it is also one in desperate need of saving fossil fuels and pollution have contributed to a slow degradation of our home but a continual adoption of renewable energy can be the saviour


power actually generated from the earth also known as geothermal energy is certainly part of that solution learn all about it in our goto guide
























what is geothermal energy


humans have enjoyed geothermal energy for thousands of years if youve ever been on holiday to the likes of iceland switzerland or hungary you may have too how via hot springs of course


thats right the thermal baths around the world use geothermal energy to heat the water so what is geothermal energy exactly well the word originates from ancient greece with geo meaning earth and thermos meaning heat
















how does geothermal power work


carbonfree sustainable and renewable geothermal energy seems to tick all the boxes of being a viable clean alternative to fossil fuels such as coal oil and gas but how does it work


geothermal power as touched upon earlier is energy sourced from the heat generated by the earths core scientists tell us that 999 of our planet is hotter than 100 degrees celsius making it a tremendous source of energy


as you may remember from your school science classes heat  energy why because it creates the motion of atoms and molecules


found underground geothermal energy is utilised via streams and hot water sources within the earths crust if you dig even deeper it can be found in magma and molten hot rocks devices known as geothermal heat pumps transfer this heat into energy to warm and cool our homes and water supplies


















what is a geothermal heat pump


sometimes referred to as geoexchange geothermal heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular among renewable energy enthusiasts essentially a geothermal heat pump is a device that absorbs heat from the ground using stored water and circulates it through pipes into your home


this is when the pump is triggered and it concentrates the thermal power transferring it into a system to heat your home it can also reverse this process to cool your building










different types of geothermal energy heat pumps


there are two different types of geothermal power being used today with many variations within each category


closedloop geothermal heat pumps  consisting of horizontal vertical and pondlake configurations closedloop pumps send an antifreeze solution around a buried or submerged loop transferring heat between the cooling system and the heat pipe


openloop geothermal heat pumps  openloop systems differ from closedloop pumps in that they circulate via wells or surface water openloop geothermal heat pumps are only used when it can be guaranteed that the source water is clean and plentiful


















other types of renewable energy


our planet has been heavily polluted via fossil fuels so much so that global warming and climate change is a serious threat to current and future generations the good news is that there are plenty of alternatives available including geothermal energy
