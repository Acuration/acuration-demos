experience by johan


the whole process was pleasant


we had no idea where to start when looking for an installer the overwhelming selection on the internet didnt make it any easier in the end we decided to choose an installation partner from myenergi fortunately the configurator turned out to be a handy tool because we could immediately see the prices and compare them calmly


after we approved the quote we chose a suitable date with the installer from then on everything went smoothly the technician installed the zappi neatly and left everything tidy the whole process went more smoothly than expected


now we have a wellfunctioning zappi and can charge our electric car without any hassle we are glad we chose myenergi and would definitely recommend them to others looking for a reliable and professional charging station installation
