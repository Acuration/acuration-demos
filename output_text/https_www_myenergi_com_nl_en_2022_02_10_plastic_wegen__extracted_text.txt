plastic roads the solution to waste
 


 








 










the harmful effects of plastic have been known about and a problem for years but now 
macrebur
 has found a solution plastic roads their mission to tackle two problems at once reducing plastic waste and improving road quality 


what are plastic roads


currently our roads are made of 
bitumen
which uses oil bricks clinker and sand to create the surface 
macrebur wants to replace the oil with plastic waste instead of dumping our waste in a heap it is better to use it to make roads


why are plastic roads necessary


for years we have been aware of plastic pollution but the real breakthrough of how harmful it is only came in 2018 through shocking images from among others 
waves of plastic that washed ashore near the dominican republic
 and the popular documentary by david attenborough 
blue planet which showed an albatross feeding on plastic
 to her boy


how much plastic is used in a road


making one kilometer of road with macreburs solution requires about 684000 plastic bottles or 18 million plastic bags thats almost long not as many as we throw away annually but its a start it is estimated that we throw away 22 trillion plastic bottles and 500 trillion plastic bags each year


want to know what you can do yourself to reduce your plastic use then read these blogs




reduce your plastic consumption


selfconsumption of green energy


reduce your co2 footprint





how environmentally friendly are plastic roads


although it is obviously great that plastic waste can be reduced processing plastic into roads also has a downside during production the plastic must be
broken down and burned
 in the process harmful molecules are released into the atmosphere

on the other hand it is still a new project and is still being further developed to solve problems


and what else


plastic roads can not only tackle plastic waste but also contribute to the local economy local waste can be locally processed into a plastic road macrebur also states that they can recycle their plastic roads when they are no longer usable
