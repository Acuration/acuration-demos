whats the difference between green renewable and clean energy
 


 












 






3 pillars of sustainability


renewable energy green energy clean energy with such an increased focus on sustainability and saving our planet it can be quite confusing to keep up to date with the terminology


with this in mind weve created a simple goto guide to the many similarities and few differences between the following three pillars of ensuring a safer more sustainable future
















 






what is renewable energy


renewable energy is essentially power generated from a source that is constantly being replenished


in theory this type of energy should never run out making it a much more efficient option than nonrenewable sources such as fossil fuels and gas which are damaging to the atmosphere


renewable energy sources are natural and include the likes of wind power and solar panels




















what is green energy


green energy is defined as power generated from natural sources such as wind water and sunlight this is where some confusion may occur most green energy sources are also renewable but not all renewable energy sources are wholly green


some people for instance argue that while hydropower is renewable the process of generating vast amounts of it is not in fact green why because of the industrialisation and deforestation involved in the process of building the huge hydro dam projects dotted around the world


the most renewable and green power source is of course our planet therefore wind solar and water are the most efficient mostused sources of renewable and green energy these energy sources successfully blur the line between green and renewable energy thus forming the perfect sustainable partnership










what is clean energy


dictionarycoms definition of clean energy is energy as electricity of nuclear power that does not pollute the atmosphere when used as opposed to coal and oil that do


again there is some obvious crossover between clean energy green energy and renewable energy clean and green energy are pretty much direct synonyms if you need help remembering the various definitions use the below as a guide


clean energy  clean air


green energy  natural sources


renewable energy  recyclable sources
