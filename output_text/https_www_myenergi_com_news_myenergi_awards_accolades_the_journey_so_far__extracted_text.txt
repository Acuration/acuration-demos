myenergi awards  accolades the journey so far
 


 








 










the renewables industry is one of the most rewarding and fulfilling sectors in which to operate striving together to create a more sustainable future alongside fellow ecowarriors gives us great joy and satisfaction


to us creating a brighter future for the planet we call home is more than just a job it is a collective mission that we all share inside and outside of work


what started in 2017 as a small green tech company in binbrook lincolnshire has grown to a fantastic team of 65 people shipping over 40000 products


we have filed patents 
written books
 and released plenty of new and innovative green products


the 
myenergi mission
 has always been  and always will be  to change the world through green technology and we are extremely proud of what we have achieved so far


throughout this amazing journey our team has been rewarded and nominated for accolades and awards that span across the sector and the local area


while we are fully aware that our adventure has only just begun and that there is plenty more work to be done to save our environment we know how important it is to celebrate our successes and look back on what we have achieved so far
