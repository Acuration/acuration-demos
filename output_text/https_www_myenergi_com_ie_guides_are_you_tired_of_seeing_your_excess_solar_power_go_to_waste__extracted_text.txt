are you tired of seeing your excess solar power go to waste
 


 












the 
solar panel
 market is going crazy in ireland at the moment and is expected to increase by over 50 in 20232024 while solar panels are incredible at taking energy from the sun and transforming it into power for your home around 25 of the average solar panels power is wasted


on most systems excess solar power that is generated goes back to the grid but thanks to myenergis leading power diverter this energy is now no longer lost






















what is a power diverter


rather than exporting excess energy back to the grid a power diverter will direct it back to your heating systems which means you can 
heat your water
 for example on 100 selfgenerated green energy put simply a 
power diverter
 is a device that allows you to make the most of the energy generated at home therefore maximising your solar return on investment and reducing your energy bills even further
















introducing eddi


eddi is the first 
solar power diverter
 of its kind and has been revolutionising the renewables market for the last few years as solar panels become more accessible the technology and capabilities of eddi have grown


eddi is a compact device that sits in your airing cupboard utility room or cloakroom and intelligently monitors your energy usage to ensure you are taking limited power from the grid eddi learns your energy consumption habits and will always ensure that you have the right power when you need it most for example having hot water heated at the right times for the lowest cost possible


by using the energy you generate in your own home you can reduce your reliance on the grid and cut your energy bills

Â 






















how does eddi work


when your micro generation system creates excess solar power eddi detects this and automatically diverts the power to your boiler air source heat pump or other heating system this means you can heat your water or home without having to draw energy from the grid free hot water for life


the advanced technology inside eddi means that you can monitor your energy usage and see how much youre generating and consuming in realtime this gives you greater control over your energy consumption allowing you to make smarter choices about how and when you use energy


eddi also has the added benefit of being able to be retrofitted to any existing solar pv system making it a great option for those who have already invested in renewable energy sources however you dont need solar or wind power to benefit from eddi this clever device also has a userfriendly interface that allows you to manage and monitor your energy consumption and savings
























make the most of your air source heat pump


air source heat pumps ashps are a popular way of heating homes particularly in areas where gas is not available an ashp works by absorbing heat from the outside air and releasing it inside the home this process requires electricity to power the pump fan and controls this type of heating and cooling system is growing in popularity in ireland and its easy to understand why


however as with most heating systems there are always more efficient ways to maximise the energy output eddi can work in conjunction with an air source heat pump to increase its energy efficiency and reduce energy bills


by diverting surplus energy from a solar pv or wind generation system to an ashp you can reduce the amount of electricity required from the grid this will significantly reduce the running costs of your ashp and reduce your carbon footprint


using an eddi with an ashp is particularly effective during the summer months when the ashp requires less energy to operate this means that surplus energy generated by a solar pv or wind generation system can be diverted to the ashp instead of being exported back to the grid




















how much money can an eddi save me on my bills


the amount of money an eddi can save you on your bills will depend on a variety of factors including the size of your solar pv or wind generation system your energy usage habits and the efficiency of your homes heating system


however studies have shown that households with solar panels can save around 30 on their electricity bills by using a solar power diverter like eddi


additionally by managing how much energy you draw from the grid eddi can help reduce your reliance on expensive grid electricity during peak hours and save you money on your overall energy bills


overall the savings you can achieve with eddi will depend on your individual circumstances but many users have reported significant reductions in their energy bills after installing the device










does eddi only work with solar panels


eddi has the unique advantage of working with any form of renewable energy generation including solar wind turbines and hydro power systems but it can also work with grid only electricity systems and 
battery storage
 systems for those looking to harvest power from the grid for their homes to control aspects of their heating and hot water systems for the lowest kwh possible eddi is your guy


if you have an ashp for example but no solar panels eddi can heat up your tank overnight when the electricity rates are at their lowest and by understanding your consumption habits always have hot water when you need it


















environmental impacts


eddi isnt just about saving money on energy bills its also about reducing your carbon footprint and contributing to a cleaner more sustainable future by using eddi to divert excess solar power or wind energy back to your home you can reduce your reliance on the grid which is under increasing pressure


using eddi to maximise your selfgenerated energy could save you on average 20 on your energy bills and significantly reduce your carbon footprint its a winwin situation you save money on your energy bills while doing your part for the environment
