how much does it cost to charge an electric car
 


 












 






how much does it cost to charge an electric car the myths debunked


the cost of charging any electric vehicle is dependent on numerous factors some of which are continually fluctuating which makes answering this question more complex than simply answering with a dead certain number some of the key factors involved in determining the cost of charging an electric car are vehicle battery size vehicle weight and the type of charger used ie home or public chargers


its also dependent on a households particular energy tariff and whether energy is used efficiently


 
















the difference in electric vehicle battery sizes


based on our selection of 40 of the best selling electric vehicles available right now 54kwh is the closest representation of the current average battery size however it is worth noting another top 40 list of vehicles might generate a slightly different result


information available online generally focuses on a 60kwh battery so when typing how much does it cost to charge an electric car into google the results will be subjective to that particular size of battery


battery sizes actually range from the popular tesla model 3 which sits at the higher end of the battery scale boasting a 75kwh battery option right down to the smart eq fortwo city car which has a smaller 175kwh


therefore the cost of charging your tesla compared to smart eq would be vastly different


 














what factors affect the cost of charging an electric car












vehicle battery size


 measured in kilowatts kw

 there are 1000watts in a kilowatt

 the higher the kilowatts the further the range

 the larger the battery the longer it takes to fully charge

 larger batteries require more energy to fully charge

 smaller batteries need charging more frequently

 smaller batteries are ideal for a shorter distance towncity driving

 larger batteries are best for long distance commuting










usage  daily km driven


 the further you drive the more kwh you will use

 the distance of your daily commute determines the frequency

 stopstart journeys use more energy than constant speeds

 properly maintained tires cause less friction

 how you drive your vehicle affects kwh used ie quick accelerating


 










vehicle weight  design


 lighter vehicles often use less kwh

 heavier vehicles often use more kwh

 smaller kw batteries are usually lighter

 larger kw batteries are usually heavier

 the size of the wheels and quality of the tires used

 the quality of the battery and components used

 the efficiency of the circuitry and heat loss

 aerodynamics factors and shape


 










the types of charger you use


 ecosmart 
ev chargers
 such as the zappi can drastically lower costs

 reliance on public dc chargers tends to be more expensive

 you can better manage and monitor using home chargers

 charging at slower rates at home is usually more costeffective

 some companies offer free charging for using their services

 some workplaces offer low cost or free charging

 tariffs and charge rates higher or lower dependent on area


 










fluctuating weather climate  environment


 electricity tends to be more expensive in the winter than summer

 wind causes more friction when driving using more kwh

 more likely to use your interior heater in cold weather

 likely to use your vehicle more frequently in the winter

 fluctuating temperatures can disperse extra energy quicker

 hot weather might entice you to venture further

 road friction from snowfall to ground temperature to surface quality


 










energy usage  setup


 the times you choose to charge eg peak timetea time

 busy periods of electricity usage are usually more expensive

 selfgeneration from solar or wind will lower charging costs

 the type of energy tariff you are on

 your energy supplier and the rates charged

 flexible tariffs allow cheaper charging rates during offpeak times

 devices such as 
eddi
 can help you charge using 100 green energy

how much does it cost to run an electric car


based on 54kwh the average cost to fully charge an electric car from empty to full is around 1444 whilst the average monthly cost to keep an ev charged would be around 5739 this data is based on fully charging your ev once per week at home another advantage is that evs are also exempt from paying road tax and significantly cheaper to maintain


 










 




are electric cars cheaper to maintain


it is widely recognised that electric cars are cheaper to maintain because there are significantly less mechanical moving parts that are susceptible to wear and tear battery energy is not only clean by name but clean by nature with no more oil spills engine leakage injectors or filters clogging up the most expensive part of an ev to replace would be the battery however most manufacturers offer lengthy warranties of up to 10 years on their batteries evs on a whole are far less complex than their predecessor the combustion engine however the general mechanics such as wheels steering wheels and brakes still need servicing and maintaining equally safety features of an electric vehicle still need checking annually in the form of an mot test for which the vehicle is required to pass to be legally on the road


 


 










 




can i save money with an ev


evs are considered far cheaper than fossil fuel vehicles and ev owners can expect to save an average of 10641 per month on fuel savings alone which is a total average fuel saving of 1277 per year


its also handy to know electric vehicles dont require an oil  filter change during their service which costs on average another 18514 a year thats a 146218 saving by removing the fossilbased components and elements of the combustion engine vehicle


 


























 how much does it cost to charge an electric car at home


charging your electric vehicle at home is the easiest and most cost effective way to charge most electric vehicle owners make plugging in their vehicles as automatic as unlocking the doors when arriving home where the vehicle would always be plugged in if not in use therefore it is most common for vehicle drivers to charge at home in the evening or through the night as people arrive home from work dependent on the amount of battery used throughout the day in most cases the charge will simply top up to full capacity the cost to fully charge the battery from near empty which is the equivalent of running to a petrol station on an empty tank would be between 1444 average  1574  however these daily monthly costs could be much lower if you where utilising time of use tariff options and green energy solutions its been known whereby customers are actually paid to their charge vehicles when there is so much surplus energy on the grid


 


 
















what is the cheapest way to charge an ev


there are a number of ways in which you could make sure you are charging for the best prices firstly look at your current energy provider and check whether you are on the right tariff agreement for you many home owners accept the first and cheapest standard tariff quotation they receive however standard tariffs are not always the most effective dependent on the needs of your household this is especially true for ev drivers who could be utilises new initiatives such as flexible tariffs  time of use tariffs they work by offering customers far lower prices during off peak periods such as throughout the night and early hours this also happens to be the most likely time you are charging your ev however to best utilise these tariffs and to enable you to make sure your charger only charges when the electricity prices are at there lowest wed recommend selecting an eco smart charger such as the zappi and a hub which enables you to utilise these tariffs properly


in order to really control and begin to utilise these tariffs wed recommend creating a myenergi account where users can use the advanced tools and features to physically set automation rules and parameters to ensure the vehicle is always charging at the cheapest prices thus making the cost to charge an electric car even cheaper
