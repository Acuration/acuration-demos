minimize your carbon emissions and costs maximize your convenience


both the zappi 
ev charger
 and the eddi energy diverter are ecosmart products this means that not only are they connected to the internet and to each other but they can also make intelligent decisions about when and where your power should be rerouted this allows you to control how much power goes from the grid and how much power from your selfgenerated electricity goes to your home


to manage your energy our ecosmart technology considers a number of factors such as co₂ emissions cost convenience and the energy rate you use while reducing your energy costs and carbon emissions are paramount we understand that preserving your current lifestyle should come first a sustainable future with a positive impact on the environment and minimal impact on your daily life is the ideal
























our devices are not only smart


they are intelligent


although smart devices sound impressive the term is often used to mean that the device can be connected and controlled via the internet while that is convenient we need technology that makes intelligent decisions on our behalf about when and where power is taken thats exactly how our ecosmart technology works  it takes on the burden of making decisions so you can get on with your day


smart  connected


the device can be controlled by a user via the internet


ecosmart  adaptive


the device makes intelligent decisions without intervention


























gives you more control


ocpp makes managing your energy even easier


zappi is now ocpp compliant by default this means you can connect to any ocppcompliant platform allowing you to monitor and manage your charging experience when it comes to managing your energy you now have more insight and control


control who has access to your zappi


whether its friends family members or even neighbors  you can now control who has access to your zappi using 5digit pins


manage how your zappi is used


since each user has a pin you can also set the default charging mode available when they plug in fast eco eco


monitor usage


understanding more about how your zappi is being used allows you to make better decisions when managing your energy


 


























ecosmart technology  tariff control


our ecosmart technology makes intelligent decisions based on the energy rate you subscribe to allowing it to take energy from the grid at the lowest possible rate per kwh
