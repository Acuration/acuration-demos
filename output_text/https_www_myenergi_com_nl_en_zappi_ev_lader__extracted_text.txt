gives you more control


more choice more control meet ocpp


zappi now complies with ocpp regulations by default


this means you can connect to any ocppcompatible platform allowing you to control and manage your charging experience


what is ocpp


ocpp is a standardized form of communication for ev charging infrastructure regardless of manufacturer it is designed to enable compatibility between ev chargers and management software to provide greater convenience and choice for consumers
















what are the benefits


ocpp offers 4 main benefits for zappi users which are slightly different depending on whether you have a single zappi at home or use multiple zappis in a business environment


















 




check


set a pin to control who has access to your zappi










 




select


select the default charging mode fast eco eco when a charging session is started

the following steps


should i pay or upgrade


ocpp is a free opensource protocol you only need to update your zappis firmware to use it


dont know how to upgrade


if you have never updated your zappi before and dont know how to do so you can find manuals on the product support pages under the downloads heading these can help you install the latest version of the firmware step by step

1 solar charger


with or without solar panels zappi charges your car 


ready for the future with the zappi home charger
















three charging options


zappi offers charging tailored to your lifestyle and needs whether you need a quick charging session or prefer to charge using 100 renewable energy or a combination of both zappi gives you the flexibility to charge your way










eco charging












the ecocharging mode combines green energy with energy taken from the grid this mode minimizes the use of grid power typically taking advantage of lower rates during the night but it also allows charging with 100 green energy this allows you to charge your car for free charging power is constantly adjusted to changes in electricity generation or power consumption elsewhere in the home


if the excess power generated falls below 14 kw power from the grid is used to replenish it












eco drawers












eco charging is very similar to eco charging in that it can use power from the grid or your own energy source however charging power is constantly adjusted based on changes in power generation or power consumption elsewhere in the home charging your electric car is interrupted if too much power is input and only continues when there is a surplus of available free power












quick loading












in fast mode your vehicle is charged with maximum power this power can come from a renewable energy source or simply from the grid the cost of charging an electric car also depends on several factors including the mode and type of car


if you dont have solar panels or wind power generation zappi charges in the same way as a standard mode 3 charge point
































setting timers


at certain hours flexible energy rates are significantly lower with zappi you can use the boost timer option to start charging during the periods with the lowest rates its a costeffective charging timer for your electric vehicle
















flexible charging


there are several energy suppliers who offer special contracts where you pay a different rate each hour depending on the purchase price with an automatic link zappi can decide for you to choose the most favorable rates by delaying or starting charging
















solar charging


zappi works in harmony with your solar panels or wind turbine this means you can charge your car with green energy at no cost if you dont have a renewable energy source at home zappi works in fast mode just like any other charger
















remote access


with the myenergi app you can access and control your devices from anywhere in the world visual graphs allow you to check your import and export information in one place
















pin protected


a 5digit pin code is a security feature integrated into this smart ev charging station in case you want to choose to use it this prevents people from changing your settings using or tampering with your solar ev charging charger without permission






















































ev charger with 3year warranty


in addition to our excellent technical support to answer all your questions zappi also comes with a 3year warranty once your myenergi zappi is installed register your individual products to take full advantage of the 3year warranty support

get a grip on your own power


zappi uses your selfgenerated power to charge evs


zappi uses selfgenerated power to charge evs

a solarpowered ev charger allows you to harness excess solar energy to provide power to your car to generate solar energy you need to install solar photovoltaic pv panels on your home or workplace however the energy produced by the solar panels is completely free effectively giving you free mileage


the suns light energy is called photon this is the most fundamental particle of all light it is these photons in natural daylight that are converted into electricity by solar panels this small beam of electromagnetic energy is constantly moving simply put a solar panel works by colliding photons or particles of light with electrons which detach them from atoms generating a stream of electricity


our ecosmart technology makes intelligent decisions based on your selfgenerated power and the energy tariff you subscribe to this allows your myenergi devices to be optimized to use energy from the grid at the lowest possible rate per kwh










 




charging your vehicle safely


all safety standards exceeded


safety is a top priority every myenergi product is designed to the highest possible energy efficiency standards but we place equal importance on safety


of course we adhere to all safety standards in the industry but we like to go a step further to always provide our installers and users with the safest possible experience thats why we were the first to introduce the pen fault test even before other manufacturers did




























manage  monitor your energy consumption


every myenergi device is designed to be connected this means you can monitor everything from the myenergi app in one place and adjust settings timers and boost functions as you wish control your myenergi devices 247 from anywhere with the myenergi app

can i charge without solar power












yes you can use your zappi ev charger to charge your car without solar power then it simply uses power from the grid and charges your car as with a conventional electric car charger with the added benefit of being ready for solar charging if you purchase solar panels in the future












does conservation save you money












after an initial investment in green technology you will save on your bills in the long run by becoming more sustainable












how long does it take to charge an electric car












the time it takes to charge your ev is not so black and white and depends on several factors such as the vehicle battery size and charger type however the average charging time for an ev is about 7 hours and 42 minutes when using a standard nonrapid charger












how long does it take to charge an electric car with solar panels












the time it takes to charge your ev using solar panels depends on several factors including the number of solar panels on average a single panel will generate about 2 kwh per day so if you have multiple panels the power generated will increase












how much does it cost to charge an electric car












the cost of charging your ev depends on several factors if you use solar panels you can charge your ev for free on the other hand if you pay to charge your ev at a gas station for example they will set their own rate based on the changing cost of energy at the time at home you can usually charge more cheaply by plugging in your electric car at night instead of during the day in addition you can select different charging levels which makes the cost variable
