wind turbine energy


the government recently announced its aim to produce onethird of the uks electricity via wind power by 2030 parliaments recently signed multimillion pound deal with the offshore wind sector has all but confirmed this goal


lining sections of the horizon spinning in the distance on the side of roads in fields and by the coast wind turbines are quickly becoming the key to reducing the countrys carbon emissions
























what are the different types of wind turbine




horizontalaxis turbine


these are the most common type of wind turbines the tall white towers with rotor blades spinning in the breeze the most powerful wind turbine on record is currently the vestas v164 which can produce 95 megawatts that means one turbine alone could power 9000 homes


with 85metre blades and a swept area thats double the size of the london eye you can spot these magnificent feats of engineering in the irish sea at the burbo bank offshore wind farm


verticalaxis turbine


there are many variations of verticalaxis turbines but generally they produce less power than horizontalaxis turbines however they are better to maintain due to the fact their components are easier to access


one style of verticalaxis turbine is the darrieus wind turbine which can create its own internal force of wind so therefore doesnt rely solely on the speed of the wind in order to rotate quickly that does mean it requires a separate motor to get started though


cycloturbines improve upon the darrieus generating more power as well as being able to start without assistance meanwhile the verticalaxis turbine is being continuously developed and improved for everyday use
















how do wind turbines work


turbines are made up of three rotor blades that spin in the wind these angled blades are developed to be straight and incredibly aerodynamic  which means they reduce drag from air moving past  with a slight curve on one side to create lift it is this lift that causes the blades to move and rotate creating kinetic energy


how does wind energy become electricity


the kinetic energy created from the movement of the blades is transferred into a generator where it converts to electricity all of this happens in the hub of the wind turbine the small section that the blades are connected to


once the power has entered the generator it is moved down the tower and into a transformer before being sent to the national grid


can i install a wind turbine at home


after solar panels wind power is becoming an increasingly popular choice for residential selfconsumption of green energy both energy sources work in a similar way producing power to be used in the home or sent back to the grid if there is excess


of course with myenergis eddi device you can utilise every watt you produce with our innovative selfconsumption system that means the power that is created through your solar panel or wind turbine is kept within your property and not wasted by being sent back to the grid


if you have an electric vehicle our innovative zappi device can also direct any excess power to your 
ev charger
 reducing your reliance on the grid and making the most of your renewable wind energy














other advantages of wind energy




not only is wind energy great for the environment and reducing your carbon footprint the development of wind farms have brought incredibly positive changes for many cities


great yarmouth for example has now become a central point for the boom of renewable energy with great investments being made across the coastal town


in fact many seaside towns are sure to see a similar change as they become the base for many offshore wind farms for many residents this is seen as a tremendously positive progression for their towns


closer to home hull has seen huge investments from siemens as they develop their turbine blades making the humber a frontrunner for the renewables sector
