how to charge the volkswagen id 4
 


 












where is the charging port on the vw id 4



the location of the wv id 4 is important unlike pulling up at a fuel station where you can select the pump based on the fuel cap location if youre looking to install a home ev charger then you will need to be sure this will easily reach the location of your charging port on your electric car the vw id 4 charging point is located on the back of the passenger side of the car


explore ev chargers






















can i charge the vw id 4 at home


the vw id 4 uses a type 2 charger which is a typical 
home ev charger



the zappi is compatible with the wv id 4 providing three levels of charging based on your unique requirements and schedule you can opt from eco eco and fast charging to ensure your vw id 4 is charged to the right level as and when you need it fast charging will charge your car directly from your own solar panels or from the grid as quickly as possible


whereas ecocharging is best used overnight when the costs of electricity are typically lower and offpeak this type of charging will take longer but will ensure your car is ready to go come the morning as cheap as possible
























what charger does the vw id 4 use


all vw electric cars come equipped with a type 1 120volt charger 


this works well for occasional or emergency use but isnt ideal to be charging your vehicle on the regular using this type of charger can be both costly and could take up to 50 hours to fully charge


typically owners opt for purchasing a type 2 charger the wv id 4 is equipped with a type 2 connector for charging which can be used at home work or public charging points across the uk




















how much does it cost to charge the vw id 4


the cost of charging any ev always depends on a number of factors from the type of charger used location and setting used for example rapid charging will typically cost more than eco charging done offpeak however if youre looking to calculate the average cost of charging your vw id 4 at home this is around 2022 from empty to full










what is the range on the vw id 4


the range on the vw id 4 is one of the better ones of the ev range topping 310 miles
