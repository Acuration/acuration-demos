most common faqs about eddi












what does the eddi do












the eddi monitors power imported from and exported to the grid power generated by your pv or other microgen system that is normally exported is surplus power


the eddi diverts this surplus power to the waterstorage heater or other load upto 37kw thus preventing it from being exported














how does diverting this energy to a resistive load benefit me the customer












surplus energy that is exported back to the grid can be as high as 80 of the total that is generated in the first place the eddi can help you use up to 100 of your microgenerated energy which is completely free














do the eddi and zappi work together












absolutely its always best to have myenergi products installed together you can prioritise where the energy goes eddi and zappi will work together to try and consume as much free energy as possible














what is varisine












varisine technology ensures that the power from the eddi is the same quality as that of the electricity that enters your property from the grid this technology is the reason the eddi meets all ce product approval guidelines


careful consideration must be given when choosing a water heater a cheaper control method such as phase angle could save money on the the initial cost of the unit however may end up costing you in the future we recommend reading into the compliance of products














why should i not install a phaseangle cheaper energy diverter












phase angle devices dealing with large loads up to 3kw causes unwanted harmonic currents to be injected into the power system these can cause electrical and radio interference overheating and damage to inverters and other electrical devices and equipment


utilising pwm varisine as its control method ensures the eddi is one of the only devices on the market that meets the legal requirements to comply with the limits for harmonic current emissions and other important emc standards














what if i dont have a hot water tank












you can still use an eddi if you have an electric microgen system and the following


 electric storage heaters the eddi is compatible with economy 7  10

 electric underfloor heating

 space saving electric heaters

 any other electrical resistive load up to 37kw with a mechanical thermostat
