what are the 5 types of renewable energy
 


 








 










for the last four years more renewable energy sources have been 
installed across the world
 than new fossil fuel and nuclear capacity combined meanwhile in the uk the 
government
 recently committed to cut greenhouse gases to nearly zero by 2050


we as a global society are collectively realising just how crucial renewable energy is in rescuing our planet from the dark depths of 
climate change
 and 
global warming
 


in fact renewable energy now provides almost a third of the uks power and that number is only set to increase with those in powers continued focus on the environment


in the past humans have relied on fossil fuels to power our homes and propel our vehicles this has had a monstrous effect on our planet resulting in greenhouse gases polluting the air we breathe and the environment we and so many other wonderful creatures call home


but no more


wondering how you can join the myenergi mission to create a more sustainable greener healthier and kinder future for our planet first things first before you discover each of our wonderful 
green products
 you may need a greater understanding and appreciation of renewable 
green energy
 sources


1 wind power


wind energy
 is power generated by wind turbines its importance was underlined earlier this year when the government announced plans to produce 
onethird of the uks electricity
 via wind by as soon as 2030


wind turbines create kinetic energy that is then transferred into electricity via a generator not only is wind power clean sustainable and renewable it has also created a tremendous amount of jobs particularly in coastal towns as a result of offshore wind potential


2 solar power


did you know that theres enough energy from the sun hitting the earth every hour to meet the whole of humanitys needs for an entire year this makes 
solar power
 the 
most abundant energy source
 on the planet


the government is investing more resources into solar power and subsidies and with good reason given that the 
majority of the public would install solar panels
 if they had greater assistance from officials


discover 
how solar panels work
 and the 
advantages of solar panels
 in our goto guide 


3 geothermal power


geothermal energy has been used for thousands of years in the likes of hot springs across the world it is essentially energy sourced from the searing heat of the earths core 


such high temperatures create the motion of atoms and molecules which is then transferred via heat pumps to warm and cool our water supplies and homes


4 hydro power


hydroelectric power
 currently accounts for 
71 of the worlds renewable energy
 it generates energy through the power of flowing water which is used to spin a turbine connected to an electric generator


modern turbines can convert up to 
90 of the available energy
 into electricity making hydroelectric power an extremely useful and sustainable resource


5 biomass power


biomass is renewable power generated from organic sources examples include manure forest debris and scrap lumber


this carbon neutral energy is identified as renewable and sustainable as it utilises materials that would otherwise be wasted in landfills or by being openly burned and therefore turned into harmful emissions


these materials are burned in a controlled environment that then turns the generated heat and steam to power turbines thus turning it into electricity

sustainability mission
