technical faqs


 












do i need a harvi 












only if you cant hardwire any or all of your cts back to zappi or eddi units harvi will transmit ct data wirelessly subject to distance and certain obstructions














what does a red zappi eddi or harvi light on the hub indicate












this indicates a loss of communication between the hub and whatever device is displaying the red led check that the hub has an ethernet cable connected to your router














what distance can the wireless comms on the harvi or hub reach












we usually recommend no more than around 2025m although in a lot of cases this can be much further each site needs to be assessed on an individual basis for anything that could obstruct or disturb radio communications














can the ct cable be extended is there a max length












yes you can extend them up to a maximum of 100m but you must use a twisted pair cable cat5 for it to work and maintain correct polarity throughout














do i have to have a ct fitted to the solar pv feed or not












providing the grid ct is fitted then zappieddi will work perfectly the solar pv ct isnt compulsory but it does give you your solar pv information on the zappieddi screen and also on the app giving you one place to view everything














does the zappi require any rcd protection












no the zappi 2 has an atype rcd with 6ma dc leakage protection built in meaning no requirement to fit an rcd elsewhere














there are no histories showing in the app though real time data is fine












please check the timedate settings are correct on every myenergi device

on the timedate menu check




the timezone is correct


auto dst is turned on


update from cloud is turned on if paired with a hub
















what does a red server led on the hub indicate












a red server light means that the hub is not receiving any data from the server check that the hub has an ethernet cable to your router and that this cable is working ok by plugging in another device such as a computer

you should also try rebooting your router and the hub














which zappi do i need if my ev uses a type 1 connection












if your ev uses the type 1 connection then you will need to purchase an untethered zappi which can be used with all type 1  2 compatible vehicles using your own charge lead














why wont my car chargeeddi heat despite having plenty of surplus energy












check that your grid ct is fitted and configured in your zappieddi please see ct golden rules
