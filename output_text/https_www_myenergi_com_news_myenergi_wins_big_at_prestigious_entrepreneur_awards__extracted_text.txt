myenergi wins big at prestigious entrepreneur awards
 


 








 










myenergi pioneer of the worlds first ecosmart ev charger took home the double at last nights great british entrepreneur awards 21 november alongside scooping the scaleup entrepreneur of the year accolade cofounder jordan brompton was also crowned the events highly coveted great british entrepreneur of the year






celebrating the uks most inspirational entrepreneurial success stories the event shone a spotlight on exceptional talent and profiled the fastgrowth firms of the future recognising ambition innovative thinking and commitment to making a positive impact the prestigious ceremony took place at the grosvenor house hotel in london attracting an audience of more than 1400


myenergi is no stranger to fast growth having started with just two employees in 2016 and quickly scaling to more than 400 team members recently shipping its 400000th unit the company has opened subsidiaries in ireland australia and the netherlands along the way to support its continued internationalisation


over the past three years myenergi has seen an average annual growth of more than 180 while continued investment has helped the business to expand into stateoftheart new premises earlier this year myenergi launched libbi  a gamechanging battery solution that allows homeowners to store renewable energy  and was recently named as the uks ninth fastestgrowing company


jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi commented


taking home not one but two accolades at last nights great british entrepreneur awards still hasnt quite sunk in the scaleup entrepreneur of the year category alone received more than 5000 entries so even being named as a finalist was a real dream come true




taking home gold as great british entrepreneur of the year is a true celebration of our extraordinary journey and testament to every single member of the myenergi team who have each played an invaluable role in building the business we have today


when we founded myenergi the vision was simple  create a positive impact push the boundaries of possibility and change the world through pioneering green technology from our early days of making products by hand and posting them to customers at the local post office to a business thats now considered one of the worlds leading renewable energy tech firms im so proud of what weve collectively achieved


great british entrepreneur awards founder francesca james said that the awards tenth anniversary was the biggest and best yet


celebrating britains ambitious driven and inspirational entrepreneurs for a decade has been an honour and weve learnt so much from hearing all of their unique stories and perspectives


the extraordinary circumstances of the last few years have tested the resilience of our business communities and the challenges were enough to give many entrepreneurs an excuse to give up instead our award winners did the opposite and through ingenuity innovation and the ability to adapt they thrived


these challenges certainly havent gone away and the next few years will present new obstacles to overcome  but one only needed to look around the room at our tenth anniversary to see some of the truly special founders and doers to gain confidence that this snapshot of the economy can go on and adapt again


wed like to congratulate all of our 2022 winners for all of their hard work and achievements  we look forward to following your lead into 2023 and beyond
