environmentallyfriendly google searches quadruple during covid lockdown
 


 




















since the start of the coronavirus lockdown google searches related to the greenhouse effect carbon footprints and climate change have in some cases more than quadrupled in the uk


on 23rd march 2020 boris johnson announced a uk lockdown against covid19 and a prolonged stay indoors has caused many brits to question their prelockdown habits


during the
 covid19 crisis
 we have seen news of a reduction in greenhouse gases and cases of 
wildlife flourishing
 in our absence outdoors 


the drastic change in our daytoday lives has caused many people to reflect on their behaviour and attitudes towards climate change with the consequences of global warming becoming increasingly apparent




carbon footprint searches quadruple since lockdown


with the majority of people working from home or furloughed  and commuting and travel significantly reduced  
carbon emissions have fallen
 dramatically in 2020


people are spending more time at home than ever before causing them to question how they can reduce their energy bills and consumption google trends stats show between the start of lockdown and july 
people searched what is a carbon footprint four times 300 more often
 than the period before lockdown




meanwhile 
searches for uk pollution levels quadrupled
 with 300 more people typing this query into google between 23rd march and 1st july searches for carbon footprint meaning and how to reduce your carbon footprint also more than doubled in that time


a carbon footprint is the measure of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere as a result of ones activity if everyone were to 
reduce their carbon footprint
 the effects of global warming would slow




climate change  more people tackling the problem


climate change has been a consistent talking point around the world for much of the last decade with global warming presenting itself as an everincreasing threat to our planet


people are now paying more attention to the greenhouse effect and global warming than ever before which is reflected in the latest google search trends


between 23rd march and july 2020 
searches for the greenhouse effect the definition of climate change and causes of climate change more than doubled





the search stats








searches for what is the greenhouse effect increased by 550






what is global warming searches grew by 120






people googled define renewable energy 180 more often during lockdown






people asked google for the causes global warming twice as often compared with the previous period






what is a renewable energy source was googled 120 more often






searches for human causes of climate change saw an 80 uplift during lockdown








one of the key challenges of preventing climate change is educating the next generation to protect our planet better than those who came before them therefore it is encouraging to know that searches for what is climate change for kids 
what is environmental sustainability
 and similar queries are 
increasing in popularity by roughly 120
 in recent months




there are many 
renewable energy resources for kids
 available online and our cofounder jordan brompton has made it her mission to educate the next generation about renewable energy and the electrification of transport 


last year jordan released her first childrens novel 
sparki and the journey to earth
 a passion project she describes as the perfect little gift for your ecowarrior children the future saviours of our gorgeous planet


the solution  renewable energy


the coronavirus lockdown has caused the 
demand for electricity
 to decrease resulting in renewable energy overtaking fossil fuels in powering britain 


the lockdown could well have sparked more peoples interest in clean green power with uk citizens doubling down on searches for what is renewable energy




the search stats








what is renewable energy searches have increased by 100










searches for renewable energy sources grew by 150








180 more people asked google how does solar energy work while 160 more searches for advantage of solar energy were conducted










wind turbine for home searches increased by 150






what does sustainable mean searches increased by 110








searches for types of renewable energy grew by 90










interest in electric cars grows


car manufacturing
 in april slowed by almost 100 yet
 evs actually gained market share
 accounting for 17 of sales across the eu


it would appear that interest in 
evs
 is growing potentially as a result of a shift in commuter habits and employment behaviour


in fact searches for electric car home charging stations  something we at myenergi have perfected with 
zappi
 our ecofriendly smart 
ev charger
  increased by 60 in the height of the covid19 lockdown


what does all of this mean


the hard work to stop global warming is only just beginning and the true test of the uks resolve to combat climate change is now


as we emerge from lockdown and life returns ever so gradually back to normality there have already been reports of a 
surge in carbon emissions



it is up to us as individuals and as a species to protect our planet to stop using fossil fuels to educate people families businesses leaders and the next generation and to start heavily reducing our carbon footprint 


its encouraging to see more people taking an active interest in the climate crisis and we can only hope that by offering even more 
ecofriendly products
 and 
guides on sustainability
 we can continue asking the questions that need to be asked and providing the answers people seek
