alternating current ac  
is an alternating sine wave which is an electric current that frequently changes direction and as a result the voltage level also changes with the current austrilian homes have ac current running through the mains because ac can travel longer distances over the grid system


alternative fuel vehicle afv
  this is a term used to describe any car that is not fuelled by petrol or diesel eg hydrogen or electricity


b




bev battery electric vehicle
  sometimes referred to as an allelectric vehicle aev runs solely on a battery


c




converters  
converters are devices which convert higher voltage ac currents to a lower voltage dc currents usually for power storage purposes whereby batteries require the current in 12v dc


current 
 this is the flow of electricity through a wire there are currently two types of electric current ac and dc


current transformer ct clamp
  this device usually clamps around the main grid feed below the consumer unit to measure importexport data from and to the grid however it can be used to measure any part of a mains circuit or pv system such as battery storage or solar panels it is essentially a measuring tool which is constantly measuring the flow of current in kw this data then allows users to see realtime energy usage and the flow of current to a particular device in the home through software such as the myenergi app


d




direct current dc
  an electric current which is onedirectional meaning the voltage level is constantly the same batteries always require current in the form of dc which is why convertors and inverters make up part of a pv and battery storage setup to convert mains ac and back again


e




eco charging mode
  this is one of three charge modes for our zappi smart 
ev charger
 this mode is a mixture of both green energy and energy imported from the grid eco mode is designed to minimise the use of grid power and can revert to charging using solely green energy the charging power is continuously adjusted in response to changes in self generation or power being used elsewhere in the home for example evs require a minimum charge rate of 14kw if surplus energy drops below 14kw eco mode will trickle feed energy from the grid to at least charge the ev at 14kw when the propertys surplus energy is higher than 14kw eco mode will only use the green energy generated 


 
eco charging mode
  another charging mode on the zappi this mode ultimately tells zappi to charge using only the surplus selfgenerated green energy from your solar pv or wind systems ecoplus mode means the charge power is continuously adjusted in response to changes in self generation or power consumption elsewhere in the home your ev charging will pause when your self generation drops below 14kw continuing only when more than 14kw or more energy is being generated


electric vehicle ev
  an ev stands for electric vehicle an electric vehicle is a vehicle that runs solely on electricity which is stored in lithiumion batteries evs are regularly charged up using a charger such as the zappi you could say an ev is a laptop on wheels


 


f




fast charging
  a fast charge is the next step up from slow charging not to be confused with rapid charging fast chargers typically have an output of either 7kw or 22kw with 7kw being the most common charger for the home and workplace note it is only possible to charge at 22kw if your building has a threephase supply therefore most residential chargers tend to be 7kw


fast charge mode
  the third zappi charge mode in this mode the vehicle will be charged at maximum power this power can come from a renewable energy source or simply straight from the grid if you dont have solar panels or wind generation zappi will charge just like any ordinary mode 3 plugandgo charge point


fuel cell electric vehicle fcev
  these vehicles are powered by hydrogen they use a system that is like an electric vehicle however energy is stored as hydrogen and is converted to electricity by the fuel cell fcevs do not produce emissions they emit warm air and water only they tend to be less common and extremely expensive when compared to electric vehicles and therefore not readily available to the mass market


full hybrid also known as selfcharging hybrid
  regarded as a low emission vehicle opposed to a zero emission vehicle the car runs solely on either its battery usually smaller than evs or ice though most commonly they can run simultaneously together constantly switching dependent on speed full hybrid vehicles will be banned from 2035 as they still emit carbon into the atmosphere in order to selfcharge the battery and therefore not regarded as good for the environment


g




green energy 
 green energy is defined as power generated from natural sources such as wind water and sunlight


granny charger  
is the slowest and eldest form of electric vehicle charger hence the name granny charging simply takes power from a typical 13amp 3 pin socket in the home and charges at the rate of 23kw charging through a mains socket is 3 x slower than using a fast charger many evs provide a granny charger as a means of emergency charging much like an emergency wheel


grid power 
 this is a term used to describe electricity pulled from the grid ie pylons the grid is simply an interconnected network that delivers electricity from producers to consumers such as uks national grid


h




hybrid vehicle
  hybrid is the term used to describe any car which has both a battery and an internal combustion engine ice there are three main types of hybrids full hybrid mild hybrid and plugin hybrid


i




internal combustion engine ice
  this is an engine which generates power using fossil fuels such as petrol or diesel


inverters  
invert lower voltage 12v dc currents stored in batteries to a higher voltage 110  240v ac current so that the power can be released back onto an ac grid system and utilised


k




kw
  electricity is often measured in watts a kilowatt is simply 1000 watts and is a measurement of electricity particularly in relation to the power drawn by an electric appliance or in this case ev if you think of a kw in terms of the size of a petroldiesel fuel tank the bigger the tank the more fuel the car can take in relative terms the higher the kw of a battery the more electricity it can store


kwh
  stands for a kilowatthour and refers to the energy used if you think of this in terms of food we eat calories to give us energy and the energy used is how many calories burned which can also be quantified as energy so an electric vehicle battery is charged using kw and the amount of energy stored in the battery can be referred to as kwh


l




load balancing
  also commonly referred to as dynamic load balancing this is a software function that monitors the properties electricity usage and adjusts the amount of electricity going to your devices this protects the properties main fuse from being overloaded by your myenergi devices and gives priority to the property


m




microgeneration
  is the energy generated through solar or renewable energy sources on a smaller scale such as a typical residential property with a solar array on the roof


mild hybrid electric vehicle mhev
  this type of ev cannot run solely on battery power the battery is there to support the petrol or diesel engine allowing the car to run more ecofriendly


mode 3 charger 
 a modethree ev charger is permanently charged through a power supply that is directly connected to grid power


n




netzero carbon
  means free from carbon emissions often known as being carbon neutral netzero mean that there is no carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere


o




olev
 the office of low emission vehicles olev traditionally supporting hybrid vehicles which still emit carbon into the atmosphere though in lesser quantities than none hybrid fossil fuel powered vehicles this is now known as ozev


ozev
  the office for zero emission vehicles ozev formerly known as the office for low emission vehicles olev are a team in the uk government which support the movement towards zero emission vehicles


p




penfault technology
  pen stands for protective earth and neutral conductor penfault technology identifies when there is a problem with the pen conductor and prevents an electric shock this is traditionally achieved by installing an additional earth rod however some ev charge points such as the zappi have built in penfault technology eliminating the need to install additional earth rods


plugin hybrid electric vehicle phev 
 this type of ev allows you to charge your battery via a chargepoint the ice or regenerative breaking usually this ev will run from the battery until the charge is low the car will then automatically switch to using fuel from the ice


public charge points 
 most ev drivers tend to opt for a home chargepoint for most of their charging however for those who dont have off road parking or who need to top up their charge on a longdistance journey there are numerous networks of public charge point all around australia  there are typically two types of public charge point fast and rapid rapid chargers are often referred to as dc chargers and these are the quickest to charge usually around 3040 minutes for a full charge


r




rangeextended electric vehicle reev 
 a reev or extendedrange electric vehicle erev is like a plugin hybrid however rather than the car automatically switching to fuel from the ice when the battery gets low with a reev once the battery reaches a certain level a smaller ice powers a generator that supplies the electric motor further extending the vehicles range


rapid charging
  a rapid charge is typically anywhere between 50kw and 350kw output compared with fast which are between 7kw  22kw rapid chargers are the fastest way to charge your ev especially when on the move these are usually found at service stations and charge parks along highways in australia to use a rapid charger it requires a card payment either on the machine itself or via the relevant app and costs vary dependent on the network and location tesla offer ultrarapid charging which is usually between 150350kw of charge


regenerative breaking  
on normal cars braking wastes energy when you brake friction is created when the brake pads come into contact with the brake discs producing kinetic energy regenerative breaking uses the energy generated from breaking and turns it into electricity to recharge your cars battery


s




single phase charger 
 when it comes to electricity phase refers to the power supply a singlephase charger can charge your ev at a maximum of 74kw


slow charging 
 a slow charge typically has an output between 23kw and 35kw 35kw chargers are becoming less common due to the up take in 7kw fast chargers another form of slow charging is directly through a typical 13amp 3pin mains socket often known as granny charging


smart charging
  
for an ev charger to be smart it must be connected to the internet this is to ensure the charger can accept firmware updates in order to keep it future proof and also allows the unit to monitor timeofuse data as well as integrate with other technologies and services


solar power
  solar power is energy from the sun it can be harnessed in several ways including through photovoltaic pv and concentrated solar power systems csp these systems work by absorbing the energy from the sun that shines on the panels which creates electricity


t




tethered
  a tethered ev charger simply means that the cable comes attached to the chargepoint this is a convenient option for home charging if you have only one ev to charge


three phase charger
  a threephase charger can charge your ev at a maximum of 22kw vehicle permitting they are more common on workplace and commercial buildings though modern homes with 3 phase supplies can benefit from faster charge rates


type 1 connector
  type 1 chargers have been phased out in favour of the superseding type 2 connection type a type 1 connector has a total of five pins alongside a clip to lock the charge cable in place whilst charging only a handful of very early evs have the type 1 connection type and almost all modern evs now have type 2


type 2 connector 
 all modern evs come with a type2 connector and is the current industry standard for an ev chargepoint connector unlike the type 1 connector the type 2 connector has a total of seven pins


u




ultralow emission vehicle ulev 
 this is a term used to describe all vehicles that emit extremely low carbonemissions


 
untethered 
 opposite to a tethered an untethered ev charger means the charger does not have a cable hardwired to the charge point the charger only has a socket outlet this offers more flexibility in terms of custom cable lengths and to accommodate both type 1 and type 2 evs most public charge points are untethered


v




vehicle to grid v2g
  vehicle to grid is the process of sending your excess power from your vehicle back to the grid during peak times so if you have left over battery in your car when you get home from work in the evening you can plug your car in and send this energy back to the grid to help support the demand on the grid during this time by doing so this helps to maximise the use of renewable energy


vehicle to home v2h 
 vehicle to home allows you to utilise your cars battery like that of a home battery storage system allowing twoway charging this means similar to v2g if you had excess power left in your battery when you get home from work you can plug your car in and divert this energy elsewhere  the only difference being rather than sending it back to the grid v2h allows you to divert this energy to your home


w




workplace charging scheme wcs 
 the workplace charging scheme is a voucherbased scheme that provides support towards the upfront costs of the purchase and installation of electric vehicle chargepoints for eligible businesses charities and public sector organisations


z




zappi
  the worlds first solar compatible 
ev charger
 made in britain zappi is a smart charger and comes in both singlephase 7kw and threephase 1122kw versions tethered or untethered
