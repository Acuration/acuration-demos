zappi birthday


it has been a birthday to remember for lincolnshirebased ecoenthusiasts myenergi


the ecoproduct manufacturer hailing from binbrook lincolnshire celebrated its 2nd birthday this week and there appears to be no plans for the party to stop


since releasing their smart electrical vehicle charger zappi on the market in november 2017 after a lengthy period of research and development things have gone from strength to strength culminating in the successful launch of their energy diverter eddi and their energyharvesting wireless sensor harvi


a projected 5year business plan has been accomplished within 6 months of trading leading to a remarkable growth in the companys exposure within the electric vehicle and selfconsumption market this incredible rate of progression has been backed with a significant investment of 12 million from highprofile businessmen sir terry leahy former ceo of tesco and bill currie founder of the william currie group as the company look to continue expanding further


jordan brompton business development manager for myenergi is excited to see where the potential of the company can take them the public demand and interest to edge towards a greener more sustainable future is growing at a rapid rate our ethos of developing ecofriendly easy to install solutions to maximise the benefit of solar panels and wind turbines in the home has been wellreceived selling over 4000 of our products across the uk ireland europe and as far as australia already


we have tripled our staff numbers already established a collaboration with a national energy provider  octopus energy  to offer a specific tariff designed for the ev driver and our impending move to a larger new facility will enable us to create links with commercial partners and provide public charging options too


we are extremely passionate about reducing the carbon footprint decreasing demand on our national grid and lowering utility bills therefore to be contributing at the forefront of both the global electric vehicle revolution and our regions renewable energy efforts is something we are immensely proud of
