top 5 reasons to use renewable energy
 


 














by now everyone has heard of renewable energy but are you are aware of just how much of a positive impact it can have on your home bills and most importantly our planet


renewable energy is the key focal point to the myenergi mission of creating a more sustainable future we currently provide tens of thousands of homes and businesses with renewable green energy products but there are still plenty of people yet to make the switch


here are our top reasons why now is the perfect time to start using renewable energy














 






1 better for the environment


fossil fuels are overloading the air with greenhouse gases which are having an alarmingly damaging effect on our planet


sea levels are rising ice caps are melting and temperatures are soaring the climate crisis is real and we need to do all we can to cut down the effects of global warming


enter renewable energy a cleaner more sustainable and recyclable means of powering our homes


saving the planet feels good we know as its part of our green teams key mission is it time you joined us in embracing more natural means to power your home
















 






2 better for our health


every year in the uk its estimated that the equivalent of 40000 early deaths can be linked to breathing in polluted air according to 
british lung foundation



meanwhile it is also reported that 248 hospitals are in areas where 
air pollution is above the world health organisations limit



not only are fossil fuels and global warming damaging our wildlife and environment they are also having a seriously detrimental effect on our health


renewable energy sources such as wind power 
solar panels
 and hydroelectric energy on the other hand are much more natural and therefore ensure cleaner air


































3 energy in abundance


it is widely reported that the amount of energy we can pull from coal is finite while nuclear energy is detrimental to the state of our planet


renewable energy is a whole different story though


as the name suggests renewable energy produces a vast supply of power with the earths resources able to consistently top up the tank


in fact solar wind biomass and hydroelectric power is already generating 
half of germanys output
 while costa rica recently went 300 days on renewable energy










4 cheaper to run


while the initial installation of renewable energy sources can be significant the truth of the matter is that in the long run it will save you money


its important to see the likes of wind turbines and solar panels as an investment the moment you start consuming your own energy  which is effectively endless and recyclable  you will soon see more disposable income in your bank account at the end of each month










5 more control over your own energy


fed up of paying for power from the grid why not selfconsume your own supply and gain control of your electricity


our green products in particular our eddi energy diverter enable you to reduce your reliance on the national grid and instead focus on maximising the energy generated from your wind turbines andor solar panels
