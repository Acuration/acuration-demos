in some locations the radio signal may not be strong enough  for instance where the zappi and hub are a long way apart or there are walls or metal objects in the way that block the signal  the ethernet board has been developed so that zappi 20 can be linked together using a wired ethernet connection to customers internet router to ensure a strong communication




if customer only has one zappi  a hub then ethernet board needs to be added to the zappi and then use an ethernet cable to link the zappi back to the internet router


if customer has more than one myenergi product zappi eddi hub then if the weak radio connection is between the master device and one of your other devices then ethernet board will be needed in each device




important the installation involves opening the case for the zappi so we recommend that this is carried out by a suitably qualified person to make sure that the work is carried out safely and zappi warranty is not affected


the supply to the zappi must be isolated before the cover is removed


faqs


which models does the new ethernet board work with


the new ethernet boards work with zappi 20


the new versions of zappi with serial numbers starting with a 2 or above have built in ethernet and wifi so do not need the extra board


can i use an ethernet extender


if its not possible to wire the ethernet cable directly back to your internet router you can use an ethernet extender  either a plugin power line carrier extender or a wifi extender provided it has an ethernet socket that can be used to link it to your zappi


do i need new firmware on my zappi


to make sure that the ethernet board works correctly it is important to update the firmware on your myenergi device 
before you install the ethernet board


we recommend that you always keep your firmware updated


what about the new myenergi devices that have built in ethernet  wifi


as the latest version of the myenergi devices have built in ethernet  wifi there is no need to fit an additional ethernet board


we recommend that you always connect your myenergi device to the internet if it has the built in ethernet  wifi


what is the maximum distance of the cable that can used between devices


up to 100m
