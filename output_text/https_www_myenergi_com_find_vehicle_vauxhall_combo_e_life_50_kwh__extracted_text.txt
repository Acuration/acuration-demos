charge your ev with power from the grid solar or both


you dont need solar panels or a wind power system to use the zappi but purchasing it today means youre future fit for tomorrow


zappi is an ev charger with a difference zappi can operate as a standard home car charger using power from the grid it also has optional charging modes which use 100 green energy generated from your own home solar pv system or wind generation
