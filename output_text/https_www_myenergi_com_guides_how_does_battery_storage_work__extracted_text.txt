how does battery storage work
 


 












with the rise in renewable energy sources and the need for reliable backup power understanding how battery storage works is becoming increasingly important


battery storage systems are the silent heroes of modern technology powering everything from our mobile devices to electric vehicles and now even homes and businesses but whats going on under the hood of these vital devices how does energy get stored in a form thats instantly accessible and yet can last for hours or even days


in this guide were going to unravel the intricacies of battery storage systems well delve into the science and mechanics of how batteries store and release energy explore different types of batteries and look at how they are revolutionising our energy consumption patterns


whether youre a tech enthusiast a renewable energy advocate or simply curious this blog will illuminate the fascinating powerful world of battery storage so lets dive right in and power up your knowledge






















take control of your energy bills


if youre a homeowner looking to take control of your energy bill then battery storage could be the right option for you battery storage is a technology that stores energy until its needed so you can use it for your own power needs and save money on your energy bills it works by storing electricity generated from clean renewable sources such as wind or solar panels or from the grid during times of low demand such as during the night when prices on some energy tariffs are cheaper it then uses this stored electricity at times when demand is higher such as during peak hours

what is battery storage 


battery storage is a technology that stores energy until its needed


batteries are typically charged using renewable generation such as solar panels but they can also be charged from grid electricity using the grid batteries are charged at night when the grid is less busy and cheaper and then they release their stored power during the day when more people use electricity this means that a battery system can work with or without the need for solar panels

batteries can store energy to use in conditions when solar panels cannot be fully optimised battery storage can also be the perfect solution as a blackout back up ensuring youre never without power
























why should i consider battery storage 


if you are wanting to save money on your energy bills become less reliant on the grid and more selfsufficient battery storage is a great option for you battery storage allows you to take advantage of the price difference between offpeak and peak time electricity and of course if you have solar panels there is no extra cost for solar energy you generate this means that your home will be powered by cheaper greener energy during offpeak times when demand is low and expensive power from fossil fuel generators isnt needed as much for many having battery storage and solar panels means 
charging your electric car
 is totally free to do from your own home you can even sell back any excess energy that is stored in your battery bank at peak times


typically a uk home with solar panels will actually export the majority of the energy produced by them the goal for a household with solar panels is to maximise the amount of solar energy that it actually uses  this is called selfconsumption by using a battery to store excess solar energy rather than letting it essentially go to waste by being exported back to the grid you can boost selfconsumption and use the majority of the energy that you generate from solar panels on your home




















which battery system is right for me 


the first step in determining which battery system is right for you is to think about how much energy you want to store and how much money you can spend on it you should also consider what your current energy usage looks like as well as the power needs of your home or business










you can use the following questions to help guide your decision




how much energy do i need


how much money can i spend


what is my current energy usage


what are my homes power needs


what is my budget for battery storage


where do i want to be in five years




















how can i use battery storage to power my home


battery storage is a great way to keep your home running during an outage or to reduce your energy bill to find out if battery storage could work for you its important to first understand how it works with the grid












connecting your battery storage system to your home


a typical gridtied battery storage system can be installed on the same supply as any other circuits or equipment in your house including appliances and lights if you want to use batteries as backup power they will ultimately provide a separate circuit so they can provide power if the main supply is cut










using battery storage to power my home


once installed properly and connected correctly batteries provide reliable backup power when needed most this can either be at peak times to cope with blackouts or when it is not the right conditions to maximise your solar panel efficiency




















battery storage is a technology that stores energy until its needed so you can use it for your own power needs and save money on your energy bills


















 




its an efficient way to store electricity generated from renewable sources such as solar and wind or take advantage of cheaper night rates from your electricity provider

most home batteries now are lithium technology rather than leadacid and the new libbi home battery from myenergi uses lithium iron phosphate technology which is a stable and safe battery chemistry making it ideal for domestic applications


explore battery storage










 




to work most effectively a battery needs to be able to talk to other devices in the home to know the best time to charge or discharge the libbi battery can have its priority set so that it does not automatically discharge when an electric car is plugged into the homes domestic charge point for example or alternatively set to deplete in order to charge the electric car from the home battery and any excess solar for example using a zappi charger without using grid energy

blackout power capability is provided as an option with a dedicated circuit offering power in the event of a power cut to the home

battery storage can also provide a benefit to the energy system during peak times and periods of peak demand not only does battery storage mean that a household can draw on the battery during these times but the battery may also be used for demand side response where it responds to instructions from energy system operators to either charge or discharge in order to help balance the grid
