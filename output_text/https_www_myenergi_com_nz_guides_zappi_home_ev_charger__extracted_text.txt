home ev charger a guide to zappi
 


 












 






at myenergi we love producing renewable products that accelerate the journey towards a more sustainable future a key part of such a journey is the electric vehicle revolution something zappi our latest creation certainly facilitates


zappi will make owning an electric vehicle even more environmentally friendly by enabling the selfconsumption of green energy each time you charge your car with the ev charger


discover everything there is to know about the innovative ev charger below
























what is zappi and how does it work


zappi is a unique and intelligent device that uses your selfgenerated energy from solar or wind sources to charge your electric vehicle it comes with three modes which it can seamlessly switch between and boosts the effectiveness and efficiency of your power generation


if you have 
solar panels
 you can use any surplus energy you generate to charge your vehicle as opposed to sending it back to the grid not only will this 
reduce your carbon footprint
 and reliance on the grid but it will also massively decrease your energy bills


if you dont have solar panels or wind turbines installed yet dont worry the zappi ev charger will still be of great benefit to you thanks to its unique esense functionality it has the ability to detect when economy tariffs become available you can programme zappi to switch to the best tariff or use its programmable timers for when set tariffs like 
octopus go
 are available this way you will save plenty of money on bills by significantly reducing the cost of charging your electric vehicle


zappi is a dynamic device and can therefore alter its charge rate when appliances in the home are switched on and off this will improve home safety and bring balance to your propertys energy usage preventing fuse damage caused by power surges and any shocking rises in energy bills
















why is there a need for the zappi ev charger


without an effective selfconsumption mechanism like our brilliant eddi people who have installed solar panels or wind turbines are all too familiar with seeing their selfproduced energy flooding into the grid


zappi is the first invention of its kind that uses the surplus energy created from solar panels and wind turbines as well as sensing an economy tariff to power electric vehicles


on top of reducing your reliance on the grid zappi is one of the safest products to install meaning both the installers and users have plenty of reasons to fall in love with it


















how was zappi created


weve spent several years developing and perfecting our products developing a fantastic insight into the market and what people wanted along the way we simply created a product we would want to use


of course people who have installed solar panels and wind turbines in their homes have shown their high level of commitment to the green energy revolution naturally the next place they would turn their attention to is electric vehicles with that in mind we saw an opportunity to create zappi


by installing zappi alongside our range of green renewable products users are given more control over where their energy goes and how they use it which in zappis case would be fuelling their electric cars










why the name zappi


we are all electric car users and there is a popular app call zap map which we and many other electric car drivers use and love we wanted to us a play on words associated with this and electricity in general the name zappi just felt right


our inventions have come from our own heart passion and innovation and so we want them to stand out by giving them their own name and brand rather than forgettable numbers
