company update
 


 








 










myenergi has been growing from strength to strength since we opened our doors in september 2016 and now is a great time for a company update we began in two small units within church view business park in binbrook lincolnshire 


since then we have steadily occupied all the units through the site therefore now operating the whole site although we still are still reviewing our longer term plans with a possible relocation within the next 1824 months we are now currently in the process of a site refurbishment to maximise the capacity and outputs of the existing site in addition to working with the team to create a cool innovative working environment 


so far every unit has undergone some form of change some as minimal as new desk layouts and screens to major renovation including the relocation of the kitchen to relocating rd and creating a new technical support office 


its been a long busy and crazy 4 months for myenergi with the refurbishments the zappi launch and the new additions to the team  we are now a team of 39 through collaborative teamwork weve really gone above and beyond to create a new working space in time for christmas the plans now start for the new year to add some colour and create a cool myenergi workspace 


we have used all local trades for the works windows  doors fabrique decorator lp decorators plumbing saxtons plumbing  heating joinery keith parrott plastering sam brabrook flooring lincolnshire flooring signage md signs electrical fit out lincs electrical and security lincoln security we have been very happy with all of these contractors and they have all worked very well under sometimes difficult circumstances 


the future is bright the future is green
