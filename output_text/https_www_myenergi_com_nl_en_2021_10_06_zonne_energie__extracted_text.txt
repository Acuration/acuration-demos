solar energy all you need to know

solar energy everything you need to know
 


 








 










solar panels are becoming increasingly popular and that is not surprising they allow you to generate your own energy and therefore reduce your energy costs are you curious about how solar energy works and what it can do for you then read on


how do solar panels work


solar panels make use of sunlight and convert it into usable energy that you can use in your home they are sometimes referred to as pv panels which stands for photo voltaic photo means light and voltaic electricity so pv panels are literally panels that create electricity from light solar panels consist of several small solar cells that use photo voltaic to generate energy


what do solar cells do


the creation of solar energy is a complicated process it can be roughly divided into 
three steps





the light from the sun is absorbed releasing the electrons in the solar cells


the electrons move and create a current


this current is caught and passed on to cables






how does solar energy become electricity


when the solar energy has gone through the previous steps it goes via the cables to an inverter here the energy from the solar panel is converted into usable energy for your home


can solar energy be generated at night


many people wonder what happens when the sun goes down or when there is little sunlight in the day when you are away from home during the day you will start using energy mainly in the evening

first of all it is important to know that solar energy can become your first source of electricity but it requires many adjustments in order to go completely offgrid in the evening when the sun has set your solar panels will go into standby mode and your electricity will come mainly from it it is therefore advantageous to look at how you can use energy efficiently in your home we will look at this in the next section




what happens to solar energy that i dont use and how can i become less dependent on the grid


the most ideal option is of course to use your selfgenerated energy yourself or to store it in your home there are many developments underway that explore options for this for example the home battery is becoming more and more effective in use with a home battery you can store the energy that you generate too much during the day for use in the evening or on days when there are fewer hours of sunshine

our innovative eddi is perfect to use your selfgenerated energy in the most optimal way eddi uses your surplus energy to heat your home and provide hot water

with our harvi and zappi products you can also use your energy even smarter they can recognise when offpeak tariffs are in force and thus save you money on your energy consumption

without a storage facility for your selfgenerated solar energy it will disappear into the grid at first you received a nice compensation for this from your energy supplier but this balancing arrangement is being phased out all the time




what are the benefits of solar energy


using solar energy in your home has many advantages the most important benefit is that it is a renewable energy source unlike fossil fuels solar energy will never run out and it is not harmful to the environment

another advantage is that it brings down your energy bills when you combine your solar panels with our eddi you can also reduce your gas bill you will quickly recoup the investment it costs to buy them by the savings in energy costs especially now that gas and electricity prices are on the rise it is extra advantageous to invest in solar panels now

solar panels also require 
little maintenance
 so you hardly have to incur any costs for them

with rising house prices you can gain another advantage with solar panels the value of your home increases should you decide to move in the future you can get more money for your home than say your neighbor with the same type of house without solar panels


what do solar panels cost


the price of solar panels depends on the number of panels that will fit on your roof and the type of panel you want assuming a set of ten panels you will pay about 4400 for installation including vat and installation of the inverter this 
vat can still be reclaimed in the netherlands
 at the tax office in the end you will pay about 3650 for your ten solar panels

what types of solar panels are there


there are different types of solar panels including




monocrystalline black panels these panels are known for their high performance and according to some look the best aesthetically it is one of the more expensive panels


polycrystalline blue panels these panels are cheaper than monocrystal panels but perform comparatively less


thin film panels these solar panels are made of a combination of materials the panels are portable flexible and lightweight they are also considered aesthetically pleasing




then there are flexible solar panels these are lightweight and very versatile in use they are a portable alternative to traditional solar panels they can be rolled up and folded which makes them last longer and can also be used in multiple locations such as a campsite however the disadvantage of flexible solar panels is that they are less efficient than nonflexible panels


have you already installed solar panels


if you already have solar panels on your roof consider adding more if you still have space make the most of your solar energy with our energysaving products do you have any questions about using our products we are happy to help
