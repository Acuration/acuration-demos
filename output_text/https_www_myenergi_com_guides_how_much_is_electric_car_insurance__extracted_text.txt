how much is electric car insurance
 


 




















running costs of evs


with the demand for electric cars on the rise it is no wonder that some of the most commonly asked questions is that around running costs range and other additional costs such as tax insurance and servicing within this guide we aim to help you understand the overall cost of of owning an electric vehicle and insuring one it is no surprise that one of the most frequently asked questions is how much is electric car insurance while the answer isnt such a black and white our guide does give you a good overview regarding the average cost of an insurance premium for an electric vehicle compared to that of a standard combustion engine vehicle


of course when assessing the costs of taxing insuring and servicing your ev you should also take into account the huge savings which you will be making on fuel costs compared to a combustion engine vehicle when taking into account the reduction in fuel costs and tax electric vehicles do typically come out as the cheaper option when it comes to the overall cost of ownership over a fiveyear period
















how much is electric car insurance


through extensive research we found that the average premium price for an electric car is 470 which is compared to the average price of 417 for a typical standard combustion engine car


 


what are the benefits of owning an electric car


















eco friendly


there are an array of benefits that come with the ownership of an electric car the most obvious of these being that they are better for the environment by producing zero emissions this of course in city tax areas such as the london congestion charge means that you do not have to pay that additional expense most buyers who are looking to switch to electric cars are those with an ecoconscious background and are looking for a more green option to help the planet


 










cost savings




when it comes to those who are making a purchase decision based on cost electric vehicles have no road tax which in some circumstances can save you up to 1000 a year just on this expense the annual flat rate on a new combustion engine vehicle is 155 so at a minimum by owning an electric vehicle you are saving on this they are also cheaper to run costing around 23p per miles to run which is considerably less than the average 16p per mile for petrol and diesel vehicles










less maintenace




with an electric vehicle you do not need to worry about regular oil changes or periodically changing incidental parts such as fan belts gaskets and radiator hoses some electric car owners have even reported driving their vehicles 70000 miles or more on 
original brake pads



























different types of car insurance


comprehensive car insurance


comprehensive car insurance is the most premium level of insurance you can get it covers you against all claims to your vehicle and another parties providing all of the details you have submitted to the insurance company are accurate

comprehensive car insurance will typically cover you for




repair or replacement costs if your cars damaged


repair or replacement costs if your cars stolen or catches fire


claims made against you for people passengers and their property


























third party fire and theft

this is an intermediate level of cover which does not cover repairs are costs to your own vehicle but it does cover other road users people and their are property therefore if you are at fault for an accident your insurance company will cover the costs of the damage to the other parties vehicle and any medical costs associated to them but any damages to your own vehicle would not be covered the only instance where this level of insurance covers your own vehicle is if it is involved in a theft or is damaged by fire


third party only

third party only is the most basic level of insurance provided within the uk it is the lowest level that you are allowed to legally drive your own vehicle on it covers the costs and repairs to another parties vehicle but your own vehicle will not be covered at all unlike a third party fire and theft third party only insurance does not cover you if your vehicle is stolen or damaged by fire essentially any repair which may need to be undertaken on your own vehicle will not be covered on your insurance policy




















what factors go into an electric car insurance quote

as with typical standard combustion engine vehicles electric car insurance quotes are dependent on a number of factors two people insuring the same car at the same household can have different insurance quotes for example which could be based on their difference in age occupation or theyre driving history when inputting your details to generate an insurance quotes whether this before a standard vehicle or an electric vehicle the following factors will all be taken into account












your annual mileage


where you park the vehicle during the day and overnight


your driving history


your age


your address


your occupation


family and living arrangements


access to other vehicles


the vehicle itself including safety features and value


the optional coverages you include eg collision comprehensive




















why does it cost more to insure an electric car

it typically costs 12 more annually to insure an electric car than a standard vehicle as electric cars operate differently as they are newer to the market the cost of parts and labour is much more expensive and specialised not all mainstream dealers and garages offer mechanics which can deal with electric vehicles which does therefore make the cost and demand for the services much higher and unique typically an electric car costs more than its standard combustion engine equivalent to purchase outright therefore when it comes to your insurance quote the value of the vehicle being insured can be slightly higher which is therefore reflective in your insurance cost electric vehicles also have expensive batteries and should your insurance company need to cover the cost of these they are pricey again this is representative in the price increase of electric car insurance














more about evs and faqs












how far can an electric car go












the average distance an ev can travel is 211 miles however this is dependent on numerous factors including the size of the battery in kwh the vehicles weight  design and everfluctuating factors such as the weather














what happens when an electric car runs out of battery












if you have never run out of petrol when driving it is unlikely you will run out of battery the concept of recharging is the same as refilling your vehicle wed recommend heading to the nearest charging station when your vehicle reaches between 1520 capacity recharge on a public dc 
car charger
 will take between 1030 minutes dependent on your vehicles charging rates














how many kwh does an ev use












in the perfect conditions an electric vehicle ev will use on average around 025 kwh per mile though this figure will fluctuate slightly based on changes in rolling resistance temperature wind direction and daily weather conditions














how low can my electric vehicle battery go before it needs charging












to maintain the longevity of a vehicle battery it is recommended that you 
maintain a minimum charge of at least 1520
 the average distance between charge points in the uk is 61 miles meaning the bare minimum charge required would be 4 though this is not recommended














what is the longest range on an electric car












620 miles is the official range of the tesla roadster and currently in the top spot for the longest range on an electric car the average between the top 10 longest range vehicles is 342 miles














what is the range of an ev












211 miles is the average range of an ev when comparing 40 of the best selling electric vehicles in 2020 range is determined by many factors including vehicle weight and the kwh size of the battery














how much does electric car charging at home cost












it would cost 777 on average to fully 
charge an electric vehicle at home
 and most users would fully charge once per week this is an average of 3108 per month
