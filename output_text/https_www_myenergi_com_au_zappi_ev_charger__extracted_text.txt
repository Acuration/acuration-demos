more choice more control meet ocpp


zappi is now ocpp support as standard this means you can connect to an ocpp compatible platform which allows you to control and manage your charging experience


what is ocpp


ocpp is a standardised form of communication for ev charging infrastructure regardless of manufacturer it was created to allow compatibility between ev chargers and management software to enable greater convenience and choice for consumers
















what are the benefits


ocpp offers 4 key benefits to zappi users which differ slightly depending on whether you have a single zappi at home or use multiple zappis in a business setting

the next steps


do i need to pay or upgrade


ocpp is a free open source protocol  you simply need to update the firmware on your zappi this update is available to zappi with builtin wifi v21


unsure how to update


if youve never updated your zappi before and unsure how to you find plenty of guides on all our products in our guides  help section

no solar no problem


if you dont have a solar panel system zappi can still operate like an ordinary electric car charging point importing from the grid


you can always add a solar or wind system later

3 modes of  home ev charging


 












eco












this mode is a mixture of both green energy and energy imported from the grid eco mode minimises the use of grid power and can charge using 100 green energy the charging power is continuously adjusted in response to changes in generation or power being used elsewhere in the home


if the surplus generation drops below 14kw some power will be drawn from the grid to top it back up


 














eco












charge power is continuously adjusted in response to changes in generation or power consumption elsewhere in the home your electric car charging will pause if there is too muchimported power continuing only when there is surplus free power available


 














fast












in this mode the vehicle will be charged at maximum power this power can come from a renewable energy source or simply from the grid the cost of charging an electric car also depends on numerous factors including mode and the car itself


if you dont have solar panels or wind generation zappi will charge just like an ordinary mode 3 charging point


 
































set timers


at certain hours of the day energy rates are significantly cheaper with zappi you can use the boost timer option to start charging at times with the lowest rates its a costsaving charging alarm clock for your ev
















no earth rod


zappi is the only ev charger with builtin pen fault technology its the safest choice for an electric car charger eliminating the need to install additional earth rods means no extra costs  an easy install
















pv charging


zappi works in harmony with your solar pv or wind generation meaning you can charge your car using green energy for free if you havent got a renewable energy source at home zappi works just like any other charger in fast mode
















access


the myenergi app allows you to access and control your devices from anywhere in the world visual graphs allow you to monitor your importexport information all in one place
















pincode protected


a 5 digit pin code is a security feature integrated into this smart electric car charging point should you wish to use it it prevents people from changing your settings or using your solar ev charger without permission or tampering
