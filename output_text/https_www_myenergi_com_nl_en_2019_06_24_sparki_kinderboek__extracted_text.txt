he mission is to teach the next generation about renewable energy and electrification to that end this book is the perfect gift for your little ecowarrior who will determine the future of our planet


who is sparki


sparki is a friendly green alien who lives on a distant planet in another galaxy his home planet is not only beautiful but also peaceful when he is happy his belly turns a bright pink colour this gives the spaceship strength so what makes him happy learning about his favourite planet earth you can probably imagine how happy he is to visit our planet on an intergalactic voyage 

when the jolly alien arrives on earth he is impressed by the natural beauty of our planet but he also sees that we are a bit behind his own planet when it comes to sustainability and renewable energy thus begins his first adventure in this myenergi childrens book series 
jordan says when we created the character i immediately saw a story developing around him teaching children about green energy generation and charging electric cars is so important we all have the power of the wind sun and ocean available so why not use it thats what im trying to teach kids
