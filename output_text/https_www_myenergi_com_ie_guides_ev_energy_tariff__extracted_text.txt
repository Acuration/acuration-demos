how ev drivers can benefit from an ev energy tariff
 


 












what is an ev energy tariff


an ev energy tariff is a type of electricity pricing plan designed specifically for electric vehicle owners these tariffs often offer lower rates for charging evs during offpeak hours usually at night when the demand for electricity is lower the aim of such tariffs is to encourage ev charging when the grid is less stressed and to make electric vehicle operation more economical for owners each utility company may offer different ev energy tariffs with variations in rates and charging times so its advisable to explore the options available in your specific location






















why switch to an ev energy tariff


in a recent advisory the 
aa
 highlighted the importance of exploring different electricity tariffs to maximise value for electric vehicle owners


the organisations research indicates that ev drivers could potentially pay up to 35 times more on some tariffs compared to others this could result in an additional yearly expense of over 1000 for some users

saving potential


to illustrate this we are using irelands topselling ev the 
volkswagen id4
 and some of electric irelands rates as examples


if an id4 owner were to use electric irelands payasyougo tariff at 043 per kilowatt hour it would cost approximately 3332 to charge the vehicles 77kwh battery fully


although this figure might seem economical compared to petrol or diesel costs its significantly more than what an ev driver could be paying with a more suitable plan with average annual mileage in ireland being 17000km this tariff could add an extra 1381 to domestic electricity bills


by using smart or dayandnight electricity meters users could benefit from electric irelands night rates at 0215 per kilowatt hour this reduces the cost of charging an id4 battery to about 1659 translating to an annual cost of 688


this is significantly cheaper than the 2300 yearly petrol costs
























the advantage of night boost


further savings can be made with 
electric ireland
s night boost tariff charging users only 0126 per kilowatt hour between 24am although it might not fully charge an empty battery in the limited twohour window it could add around 80km of range for just 190 this should provide sufficient range for many drivers reducing the yearly cost to as low as 404


as per our findings an average irish driver covering about 17000km per year could save up to 1000 annually by choosing the right charging time and tariff if they can make do with an 80km range topup every night the annual cost could be just 40400 said 
blake boland of aa ireland
























alternative ev tariffs


while electric irelands night boost tariff is indeed competitive it is not the only option there are more flexible and costeffective tariffs on the market that offer savings over a longer duration for instance 
energias electric car energy
 plan charges only 0103 per kilowatt hour from 11pm to 8am in winter and 12am to 9am in summer


using this tariff it would cost a mere 793 to fully charge an id4 battery
















our top tips for sourcing the right energy deal for your ev




go direct to the supplier ev friendly tariffs are not accessible on comparison sites so you will need to go direct for the best deal


you must have a smart meter already installed at your home


an ev friendly energy tariff will be most effective at generating savings when used with a dedicated 
ev charger
 not just plugging your car in at the mains
