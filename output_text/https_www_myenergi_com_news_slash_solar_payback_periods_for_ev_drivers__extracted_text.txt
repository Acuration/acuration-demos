working from home can slash solar payback periods for ev drivers


according to insight from the 
office for national statistics ons
 more than 38 of the uk workforce now enjoy either a parthybrid or totally remote role while sceptics have suggested that this trend will begin to fall inline with retreating covid19 cases a recent survey from 
tracking happiness
 found that workers are reportedly happier and more productive than ever thanks to their newfound flexibility as such if anything remote working rates are expected to rise further over the coming years


while this scenario would have been considered almost unthinkable prior to the pandemic multiple lockdowns have demonstrated that a significant percentage of roles can be successfully delivered remotely resulting in a more engaged workforce and offering a number of commercial benefits too indeed alongside better performance greater engagement and increased staff retention organisations offering remote options are said to have a 21 higher profitability margin


alongside professional flexibility there are additional financial benefits available for electric car drivers who work from home and choose to invest in solar panels thanks to the latest developments in ecosmart home energy management technology not only can householders slash their energy bills they can also significantly reduce the payback period of their investment into renewables


savvy saving  investing in solar


when it comes to selfgenerated renewable energy solar pv is a reliable and efficient solution with a realistic price tag and minimal maintenance requirements as technology has continued to evolve and improve it has become highly popular with homeowners nationwide


to tackle the seemingly looming energy crisis data from 
solar energy uk
 reveals that more than 12000 photovoltaic pv installations were undertaken in july  an increase of almost 200 yearonyear in addition installers nationwide have been reporting enquiry surges of more than 1000


while solar panels will invariably help to reduce the grid electricity consumption of any household typically only 45 of selfgenerated renewable energy is consumed while most household energy is used in the mornings and evenings most renewable energy is generated during the middle of the day unless you have a comprehensive battery setup its most likely that youll export sustainable power at periods of low consumption and buy it back at a more expensive rate when you really need it


in the past this scenario has somewhat dissuaded domestic investment into renewable selfgeneration however the latest developments in ecosmart home energy technology have changed things


at myenergi were renowned worldwide for developing pioneering ecosmart energy solutions that maximise the efficiency of selfgenerated supply we help users to harness the true benefits of selfgeneration through marketleading smart technologies reducing their carbon footprint and helping them to take complete control of their energy spend




were best known for designing the markets first ecosmart electric vehicle charging device  
zappi
  a futureproofed solution that alongside operating as a mainsconnected charging device that automatically optimises around your energy tariff to enable charging at both cheaper and greener times from the grid seamlessly integrates with renewable tech to harness selfgenerated energy


the ability for remote workers to effectively soak up excess solar during the day gives zappi users the opportunity to charge for free  quick simple zero emissions motoring while charging your car through mains supply is still far cheaper and more environmentally friendly than running a petrol or diesel car doing it with renewable energy can take ev charging completely off grid  reducing annual bills for electric motoring by upwards of 500 per annum




for those who dont work at home solar is still a great investment if paired with myenergis 
eddi
 the clever diverter diverts surplus renewable energy to domestic heating systems such as an immersion storage or space system to provide users with 100 renewable heat and hot water it can even be paired with a domestic battery device to store selfgenerated energy for use during the evenings


in result a smart home with minimal grid demand powered by completely free renewable energy


embracing the future


remote working is clearly here to stay the benefits for both employers and employees are countless and the positive impacts of a more controlled worklife balance speak for themselves


but rather than rely on grid supply remote workers with solar panels should consider harnessing the benefits of ecosmart energy management to maximise the opportunities available at myenergi were proud to provide innovative ways for homeowners to embrace sustainability while also cutting costs and reducing payback periods through our pioneering product lineup


it might sound obvious but maximising consumption of selfgenerated renewable energy is key to taking total control of your home energy use its a great opportunity and one to seize with both hands
