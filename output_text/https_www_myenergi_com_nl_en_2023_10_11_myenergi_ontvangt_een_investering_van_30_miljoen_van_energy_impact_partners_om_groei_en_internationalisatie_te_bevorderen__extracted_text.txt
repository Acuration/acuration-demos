myenergi receives 30 million investment from energy impact partners to drive growth and internationalization
 


 








 










british manufacturer of smart energy technology for private homes myenergi has secured a 30 million investment to support significant future growth and internationalization from 
energy impact partners
 eip this follows the 30 million debt financing myenergi received from hsbc 
earlier this year
 to further drive expansion


lee sutton and jordan brompton founded ukbased myenergi in 2016 with the goal of removing barriers to a greener future including the technological behavioral and financial challenges related to the rapid adoption of smart energy products in doing so the company committed to an easy transition to renewable energy


myenergi has been recognized as 
one of the top 30 fastestgrowing private companies
 in the country with an average annual growth rate of more than 125 over the past three years it produces a range of ecosmart home energy technologies including the industryleading zappi solar compatible electric vehicle charging point the eddi power inverter and the libbi smart home battery


eip is a global investment firm focused on investing in the energy transition by supporting companies developing solutions that will shape the future of energy and climate this includes missiondriven highperformance technology companies from the uk and europe such as myenergi that are contributing to safer more flexible and cleaner energy sources


as part of the equity investment nazo moosa managing partner of eip europe will join myenergis board of directors along with sir terry leahy former ceo of tesco and peter richardson former coo of dyson transportation accounts for nearly a quarter of global energyrelated co2 and road transport accounts for the lions share of it eip targets the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions moosa said we are proud to support lee and jordan who have built a truly unique company in the climate sector that is both rapidly growing and profitable zappi is already one of the leading charging station manufacturers in the uk and ireland and with the success of their libbi home battery we believe myenergi is in pole position to become the leading provider of home energy management systems


lee noted we are pleased to have found an investor in eip that truly understands what we stand for our mission vision and values the expanded team will allow us to further expand products and services within our home energy system making our solutions available to even more consumers worldwide the investment will help develop our next generation of products and innovations including our planned growth in network services  such as dsr demand side response ed which will allow us to better support our customers in their transition to more selfconsumption and less reliance on the grid we will also invest in service excellence to ensure our customers benefit from the best support


jordan added as we transition to a zeroemission future it is essential that consumers are offered simple and convenient ways to make the switch from fossil fuels to clean green renewable energy we are really excited about eips investment which will help bring our ecosmart products to more households so that our customers can monitor manage and maximize their home energy use as well as reduce their emissions streamline their energy bills and ultimately enable them to become more energy independent
