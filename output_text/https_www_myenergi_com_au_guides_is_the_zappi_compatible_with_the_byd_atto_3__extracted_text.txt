is the zappi compatible with the byd atto 3
 


 












looking to get yourself a gorgeous new byd atto 3 youll need to know a few things like is it a good buy is it affordable how long does it take to charge and most importantly whats the best choice for your byd atto 3 home charger theres lots of questions but we can tell you that not only is the byd atto 3 a great family ev with tons of features but it is also compatible with myenergis zappi














 






can i use a normal power outlet or gpo for byd atto 3 home charging


yes you can charge your byd atto 3 using a normal power outlet at your home you can charge most evs at home using the mains but theres a pretty big downside in fact theres several




trailing wires


no connectivity


no app


no charge range control




for these reasons plus the time it will take to charge your byd atto 3 at home it makes sense to upgrade your athome ev charging and look at getting a zappi installed


























how long will it take to charge a byd atto 3 from a general power outlet or gpo


if you were to just plug your byd atto 3 into the gpo to charge you would be looking at least 24 hours to get to full charge who has time for that


this is due to the lower voltage of power which can be diverted plus it only has one setting  no eco or rapid charging


























is zappi the best byd atto 3 home charger


of course thats why youre here right the zappi has three charging modes which are all perfect for charging your byd atto 3 eco eco and fast












eco charging












this mode features a mix of both green energy and energy imported directly from the grid if you are using solar panels this is the best choice for charging your byd atto 3


even if you dont have solar panels its still a good choice as it will use energy from the grid when it is cheapest for example overnight














eco plus charging












with this mode your charge power is continuously adjusted in response to changes in power consumption elsewhere in the home


the zappi will pause the charge to your byd atto 3 if there is too muchimported power continuing only when there is surplus free power available














fast charging












in this mode your byd atto 3 will be charged at maximum power this power can come from a renewable energy source or simply from the grid


in this mode the byd atto 3 can be fully charged in the quickest time




















 






byd atto 3 home charger


byd atto 3 base model does 320 km and the extended 420 km and uses lithium iron phosphate batteries byd has an impressive history making lithium batteries having produced 50000 electric buses and a million odd battery passenger cars so they know their stuff


having the right ev charging equipment at home to charge up your byd atto 3 is vital while there are a growing number of public and workplace charging points across australia there is still a high demand for efficient charging at home for both convenience and costsaving


the byd atto 3 is a good solid family electric car with towing capability and a vehicle to load feature which allows you to power 240v loads from your ev battery its also one of the more affordable ev models available in australia which will make it very appealing to a lot of people
