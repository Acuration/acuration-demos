put the brain into your solar pv system


are you ready to take control of your solar energy


with eddi you no longer have to give away or sell your unused electricity back to the grid say goodbye to wasted potential and hello to a smarter energy future this remarkable device allows you to maximise the consumption of your selfgenerated solar or wind energy by diverting it to power various aspects of your own property 
heat water with solar
 and optimising the efficiency of your heat pump or boiler the possibilities are truly endless


dont miss out on the opportunity to be in control of your energy destiny join the thousands of satisfied customers who have already embraced eddi and experience the difference it can make in your life

eddi is intelligent


watch your energy go further with eddi


eddi easily connects into any existing microgeneration system when added eddi continually makes intelligent decisions every 1 second about how and where your energy generation is used around the home eddi offers 6 key functions  













solar power diversion  












eddi redirects surplus solar or wind power within the property optimising the use of selfgenerated energy instead of exporting it to the grid as a result you can heat water using solar energy at no cost














low generation trickle charging 












eddi efficiently heats your water with minimal solar generation 1kwh unlike heat pumps and ev chargers that typically require around 14kwh to start this allows eddi to gradually charge your hot water when the heat pump is inactive















heat appliance switching  












eddi adjusts heat appliances based on generation levels and water temperature optimising the most efficient method to maintain heated water














enhanced hot water functionality 












eddi promotes destratification ensuring hot water circulates evenly within the tank instead of accumulating at the top its secondary circulation function helps distribute hot water throughout your property during peak times providing instant access to hot water














advanced app control












use the 
myenergi app
 to adjust and optimise the settings of your ecosmart tech devices to achieve maximum efficiency of your heat appliances and other smart devices set timers for your boiler through the myenergi app














smartgrid ready












eddi is a futureproof eco smart technology and connects to the internet through wifi or ethernet allowing it to fully integrate and work in harmony with other future smartgridready products around the home such as heat pumps 
battery storage systems
 such as libbi and 
ev chargers
 such as zappi












































 






run your heat pump with the intelligence of eddi


if there is not enough solar generation to powerup the heat pump eddi takes over the task of heating water using any available solar we call this low generation trickle charging


eddi can fully heat your water using much lower amounts of solar generation such as during winter mornings late summer evenings or when its overcast ultimately improving the life and efficiency of the heat pump and prevents reliance on top ups from the grid


eddi becomes the automatic heat appliance switch dependent on the level of generation switching between the heat pump during hours of optimum generation or eddi trickle charges with the immersion heater during periods of lower generation dependent on your chosen settings and preferences

smart tariff tracking


our eco smart technology makes intelligent decisions based on your self generated power and the energy tariff you are signed up to this allows your myenergi devices to optimise for drawing energy from the grid at the lowest possible rate per kwh


 










 




exceeding safety standards


safety is of paramount importance every myenergi product is engineered to the highest standards possible in terms of energy efficiency but we place equal importance on safety while we adhere to all industry safety standards we are always looking to provide the safest experience possible for our installers and users thats why we were the first to introduce pen fault testing ahead of every other manufacturer


 




























eddi comes with a 3 year warranty


as well as having our excellent technical support team on hand to answer any of your questions and queries eddi also comes with a 3year warranty once your myenergi eddi has been installed please register your individual products to take full advance of the 3year warranty support
