how to reduce your carbon footprint 5 tips
 


 












 






reduce your carbon footprint


living a greener life can help fix your january blues as well as save the planet


so what better new years resolution than reducing your carbon footprint


take part in green january this month to discover just how easy it is to become part of a sustainable future




















what is a carbon footprint


a quick google search will tell you that a carbon footprint is defined as the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the activities of a particular individual organization or community but what does that have to do with saving the planet


carbon dioxide accounts for almost 85 of all emissions and is a large contributing factor to global warming an increase in the release of co2 has had a damaging effect on climate change the greenhouse effect and human health check out the guide below to learn more on this


the impact of carbon dioxide on air pollution










how do i calculate my carbon footprint


ten years ago the uk government announced the climate change act 2018 which set a target to ensure that the net uk carbon account for the year 2050 is at least 80 lower than the 1990 baseline in 2017 we were sitting at 42 lower than the 1990 emissions levels


the average brits carbon footprint sits at 91 tonnes per year according to the 2014 statistics you can work out your own carbon footprint using a carbon footprint calculator


















2 changing your diet to reduce your carbon footprint


veganism has been a huge discussion point in recent weeks what with piers morgans highly publicised sausage roll outrage and the new mcdonalds vegan happy meal


tesco labelled veganism the fastest growing culinary trend of 2018 with the percentage of vegans increasing tremendously in the last 12 months so much so that large companies such as greggs and mcdonalds are having to update their menus


but what effect does eating meat have on your carbon footprint we hear you ask


university of oxford researchers recently discovered that cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce your carbon footprint from food by up to 73


meat and dairy account for 60 of agricultures greenhouse gas emissions while the meat industry has caused substantial deforestation across the world not to mention the fact that livestock emissions from fertiliser and methanebased cow waste make up between 145 and 18 of total global greenhouse emissions


those looking to reduce their carbon footprint when it comes to food should also set a new years resolution to buy more locally produced products it may seem easy to eat food that has travelled halfway across the world to make it to your plate but transported goods are a massive contributor to global warming














3 reduce your carbon footprint while driving


need your car for work and other commitments changing how you drive can still tremendously reduce your emissions for instance speeding and unnecessary acceleration can reduce your milespergallon by 33


this year try to be warier of how you use your vehicle seemingly little things like avoiding sitting in traffic by taking alternate routes or driving outside of rushhour combining errands to reduce backandforth trips and ensuring your tyres are properly inflated all contribute to reducing your carbon footprint when travelling


if you do need a vehicle but want to significantly reduce your ecological footprint we recommend driving an electric car which studies show 
are able to cut greenhouse gas emissions by half
 combine this with 
zappi
 our new intelligent electric vehicle eco charging point and you will significantly reduce your carbon footprint in no time at all














4 replace your lightbulbs with leds


in 2017 
led bulbs reduced 570 million tons of carbon emissions
 this type of illumination requires 
20 less power
 than regular household lighting yet can last up to 15 times longer so have you joined the led revolution yet


95 of the energy used by 
led lights
 is converted into light with only 5 wasted as heat this is of course a huge environmental improvement on regular lightbulbs there is no better time to start saving energy and money on bills than january


dont hesitate to 
get in touch
 if you would like to learn more ways to reduce the amount of energy used in your home














5 recycle more


an obvious tip but one we could not leave out recycling thanks to recent technological advances in recycling technology it has never been easier to ensure you are conserving resources when it comes to waste


are you recycling as much as you should be did you know for example that a staggering 
1 billion christmas cards will end up in bins
 each year thats the equivalent of 33 million trees this year why not use 
recyclable christmas cards
 as a simple way of carbon offsetting


in terms of household waste make sure you have two bins in your home for recyclables and nonrecyclables and do your research on what items belong where if you are ever in doubt refer to one of the many 
recycling guides
 available online














carbon offsetting  one step at a time
