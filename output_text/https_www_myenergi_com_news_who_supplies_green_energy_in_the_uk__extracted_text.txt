our list of green energy suppliers in the uk
 


 








 










359 of the power generated in the uk was renewable in 2022 according to a 
recent report
 the question is are you part of the 359 helping to save our planet or is your home contributing to the climate crisis


it is our mission to get that number up to 100 but we cant do it alone thats why we need green energy suppliers in the uk


renewable energy also known as green energy is produced via sources that are far less damaging to the environment than fossil fuels the likes of gas and coal power are huge contributing factors to global warming an issue that is killing our precious home


the good news is that at myenergi we are joined by many energy providers in expanding the uks renewable energy usage and reducing our nations reliance on the grid


follow our steps and guidance to ensure your home is powered by green renewable energy to ensure youre reducing your carbon footprint and tracking your 
energy usage



what is a green energy supplier


a green energy supplier is a company that generates the power it provides for its customers homes via renewable sources such as




hydroelectricity


solar power


wind power




independent renewable energy providers


as mentioned earlier 359 of the national grid is green with 423 made up of gas and nuclear and the remainder coal and oil


independent companies have led the charge in green energy from the grid for a while now with the likes of 
octopus energy
 
shell
 and 
ecotricity
proving popular choices


ecotricity is the uks largest green supplier their 
electricity is 100 green
  made from the sun and the wind they generate about 20 of it themselves and the rest is certified green energy we buy from other green generators or via the wholesale market


octopus energy meanwhile boast that all of their smart tariffs feature 100 renewable electricity and no exit fees they are starting to lead the charge in the race for renewables and are the only 
electricity supplier
 approved by which


large suppliers offering green energy


if you would prefer to go with a longerstanding energy provider some of the larger suppliers offer renewable power


this relatively new offering likely stemmed from the increased attention and publicity the climate crisis campaign has received in the press alongside the many companies offering green renewable energy products


you can now ask for renewable energy from the following providers




british gas


eon


edf


npower




selfconsume your own renewable energy


those of you who really want to make a big step towards sustainability and the renewable sector should seriously consider 
generating your own green energy
 youll even be able to grab some free and green miles with our zappi 
ev charger


installing solar panels or a wind turbine can tremendously reduce your bills as well as your reliance on the grid this together with our innovative eddi 
 power diverter
  which seriously reduces the risk of wasted energy  will make your home much more sustainable and better for the environment
