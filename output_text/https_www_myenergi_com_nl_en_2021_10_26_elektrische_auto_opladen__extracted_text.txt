electric car charging how does it work
 


 








 










charging an electric car can be done at a private charging station or at a commercial charging station how does it work and what is the cheapest way to charge your car we would like to answer your questions below

an electric car runs by means of a battery that you need to charge you can charge on the road at a 
charging station
 or charge at a charging station at home or on the street

in this article we will tell you more about

what does charging cost


how can i charge my electric car at home

how can i charge my electric car


you use a charging cable to charge your electric car in the netherlands a type2 plug also known as a mennekes plug is used for electric cars if you want to charge your car at home you will need your own charging station or wall charger will you be charging your car on the road then you often need a charging card or app to make use of public facilities


how long does it take to charge


the charging time depends on the size of your battery in kw and the speed of charging in kwh for an average battery of 54kwh a 50kwh public charger will take about 64 minutes to fully charge the car an average home charger of 7kwh will take about 7 hours and 42 minutes




what does charging cost


charging your electric car at home is the cheapest this is because you then pay the normal electricity price on average the electricity price is between 022 and 025 per kwh however you will first need to purchase an ev charger for your home

charging at public charging stations can vary greatly in price on average you will quickly arrive at 041 per kwh at a fast charger it is even 060 per kwh in addition some neighborhoods with public charging stations have paid parking these costs are then added when you charge your electric car


how can i charge my electric car at home


do you have your own garage or driveway then you can have your own charging station or wall charger installed how fast you can charge at home depends on your power connection with a singlephase connection you can charge less quickly than with a threephase connection in some cases it is also wise to use a power distributor in your meter cupboard do you cook with an induction hob or use a heat pump these devices also consume power just like your electric car




is it safe to charge at home


when you have your charging station or wall charger installed by a licensed 
installer
 you can safely charge your electric car at home there are strict requirements in europe that a charging station and wall charger must meet it is not wise to charge your electric car via a normal wall socket the charging cable can then get too hot and cause a fire get your charging station installed by a professional

are you using zappi then you have the only ev charger with builtin pen fault technology which is the safest choice when it comes to electric charging earthing pins are unnecessary so you have no extra costs and can easily install your charger ev charger zappi also allows you to control monitor and update your charger from your phone tablet or computer




what is the advantage of zappi


zappi is one of the most futureproof ev chargers on the market it is a smart ecocharger that makes it easy to use solar and wind energy that you generate yourself you can also use zappi as a plug and go charger via power from the grid the advantage of zappi is that the system can be set to offpeak tariffs so you can charge your electric car during the most advantageous times zappi is available in a 7kwh or 22kwh version with a type 2 cable in black or white


more about zappi


charging an electric car with solar panels


now the 
balancing scheme
 for solar panels is being phased out many owners are wondering how they themselves can still benefit from their surplus solar energy after all you will no longer receive compensation for it after 2023 when you feed it back into the grid one way you can take maximum advantage of your selfgenerated energy is to use it to charge your electric car this makes it even cheaper to charge at home

ev charger zappi has a smart feature that allows it to communicate with your solar panels it does so through a small device called harvi harvi is able to exchange data with other myenergi devices thanks to 
harvi
 your surplus energy does not go straight back to the grid but is first checked to see if it can be used by your own devices for example zappi allows you to charge your electric car with the surplus and provides 
eddi
 ensure that your water is heated with it how your solar energy is used depends on your preferences and which mode you select
