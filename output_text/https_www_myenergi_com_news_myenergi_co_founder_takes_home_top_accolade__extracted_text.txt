myenergi cofounder presented with national stem award
 


 








 










jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi has been named in the 2023 list of inspirational business women in stem  construction run in conjunction with natwest jomas associates and the federation of small businesses the initiative celebrates entrepreneurs that are challenging the status quo tackling underrepresentation and acting as role models to the next generation


 


a true leader in the sector and a champion of women in business the judges were impressed by jordans pivotal role in driving our rapid growth alongside her commitment to leading the transition to electrification as one of the uks fastestgrowing businesses were renowned for our industrydefining portfolio of ecosmart solutions that help users to reduce reliance on mains energy supply


 


commenting on the news jordan said when we founded myenergi the vision was simple  create a positive impact push the boundaries of possibility and change the world through pioneering green technologies in the few years since weve built a global brand and helped householders all over the globe to reduce their reliance on mains supply


 


throughout our whirlwind journey weve been firmly committed to tackling underrepresentation within stem its a subject very close to my heart as an entrepreneur who was told as a school leaver that her career options were either in hairdressing or travel and tourism ever since ive been committed to challenging the status quo and giving others a voice


 


making the list alongside such an incredible lineup of inspirational women is a real honour it makes me so proud of the myenergi journey how far weve come and the mountains were moving to inspire the next generation to consider roles in the sector
