myenergis ultimate guide to greenland
 


 








 










population of greenland






as of sunday 8 august 2021 the current total population of greenland is 56878



nuuk  14798


sisimiut  5227


ilulissat  4413


qaqortoq  3224


aasiaat  3005






around 29500 of the greenland population are male and roughly 26400 are female


the greenland population is equivalent to 000073 of the total world population



population density is 0026 people per sq km






greenland is the most sparsely populated country in the world


88 of greenlanders are principally of inuit or eskimo descent


the official languages of greenland are greenlandic and danish




geographic data






greenland is the worlds largest island and lies in the atlantic ocean northeast of canada


the island covers about 836000 sq miles


one of greenlands most prominent features is its massive ice sheet which covers more than 80 of the country


all of greenlands cities are built along the 27394mile coastline as its the only area in the country thats icefree




environmental data






80 of the island is covered in ice


along the northcentral coast the climate is arctic and summer temperature average around freezing  0 degrees celsius


in the south the climate is milder



nuuk is the most populated city in the south with temperatures varying between 11c and 10c rarely going below 18c or above 12c






july is the only month when greenlands temperature reaches above freezing


greenland is one of the best countries in the world for clean air and because the humidity is low visibility is excellent




unique factors about greenland




 




greenland is the worlds largest island


the name greenland means land of people


greenland is more than three times the size of us state of texas


despite having a land size of 216 million sq km there are no roads or railway system that connects settlements to one another  there are roads within the towns but they end at the outskirts


greenland is the worlds least densely populated country


the capital nuuk is one of the worlds smallest capital cities by population and the worlds most northern country capital


scientists have estimated that the greenland ice sheet is between 400000 and 800000 years old


greenlands first ever world televised motor sport race will take place on 28th  29th august 2021 which will be the extreme e series find out more 
here




 


wildlife facts






greenland has the worlds largest national park which is one of the reasons for its widespread and abundant wildlife and as its so vast and relatively accessible the wildlife thrives and is undisturbed


the countrys plant life is characterised as tundra vegetation as is consists of plants like sedge and cotton grass


several species of land mammals live on the island including polar bears musk oxen reindeer arctic foxes snow hares ermines and lemmings


seals whales cod salmon flounder and halibut are found in the surrounding waters and greenlands rivers contain salmon and arctic char


certain species like blue whale are protected and cannot be fished and each administrative area has a certain quota of whales seals and fish assigned to it to ensure theres no over fishing




existing renewable infrastructure






greenland has ambitions to become a sustainable island with 90 renewable energy by 2030


hydropower is the main renewable source that provides 6070 of greenlands entire electricity needs



this is generated by five hydropower plants which proved energy to the communities of qaqortoq narsaq nuuk sisimiut ilulissat and tasiilaq










existing ev infrastructure






the greenland government has recognised that the problem with owning electric cars in greenland is the lack of access to charging facilities for those living in apartment buildings



this is more than 70 of housing stock in nuuk






in 2016 the public energy supply company nukissiorrfiit and the government started a pilot project to test the charging stations for evs using surplus energy from the local hydropower plant in nuuk



in the project charging stations were installed by three apartment buildings with one rapid charging station in a public area of the city








 


length of daylight in the summer months in greenland






every year the sun does not set from may 25 to july 25 and stays visible throughout the entire day and night



on the arctic circle the midnight sun only lasts for about half an hour however the further north you get the longer it lasts






june 21 is the longest day of the year and known as the summer solstice




opportunity for mass solar fields in greenland


 




solar cells can reduce the import of diesel in greenland


mass solar fields would work well in greenland where the lighting conditions are good for a large part of the year


the current grid in greenland is run by the multifunctional utility nukissiorfiit which has hired the danish energy association as a consultant to analyse which technical adaptations are needed in order to use solar energy without compromising electrical security or system stability



nukissiorfiit selected the villages of ilimanaq and paamiut as case studies to analyse how specific solar projects affect the grid


paamiut  relatively east to adapt a pv system to the grid but solar cells can force the diesel plant to run less efficiently which will affect the economy


nukissiorfiit  has an advantage of having 46000 intelligent electricity heat and water meters already installed which means they have already take the first steps towards utilising the potential of flexible consumption






manoeuvrable solar fields are a necessity in order to control new production



when solar panels produce more energy than the residents and companies can use greenland will need to limit their production


without flexible power consumption or energy storage there will be a loss of electricity from solar cells as well as an economic loss for the owners of solar cells


there can also be limitations to batteries in the cold climate of greenland


myenergis eddi solar diverter is being installed at a school in greenland along with a solar array battery storage and harvi unit to create a microgeneration system which will negate the need for noisy diesel generators which can be replicated across greenland to work towards their carbon neutral targets this is a joint venture between myenergi xite energy  extreme e known as the legacy programme read more about the programme
