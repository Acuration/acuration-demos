what is a smart ev charger
 


 












smart charging is like giving your electric vehicle a bit of brainpower when it comes to juicing up by connecting it to the grid your ev charger can have a good ol chat with your car the folks running the charging station and even the energy company all through data links its not just plugging in and hoping for the best its a smart coordinated effort to get your vehicle charged up just right


 


 






















what kw car charger do i need at home


here in australia most homes are hooked up with a single phase ac supply limiting the charging rate to 7kw thats why 7kw chargers are the typical choice for domestic home charging


however theres a change in the wind some of the newer builds are getting equipped with a threephase ac supply if your place is rigged like that youre onto a winner you can amp up the charging speed and might want to look into a 22kw charger


so these 22kw chargers theyre finding their way into smaller commercial joints workplaces or those brandspankingnew developments a bit of aussie charging wisdom for you




















what is a smart ev charger


a truly intelligent smart ev charger will also have the ability to integrate with other renewable energy sources such as solar panels domestic wind turbines battery storage and  work harmoniously with elements such as air source heat pumps and wider renewable energy technologies around the building


other factors such as how it can save customers money through integration with time of use tariffs and economy tariffs should also be considered when selecting a smart charger


zappi is a popular choice for those looking for a truly intelligent smart charger as it ticks all the boxes of what is considered a smart charger










zappi has been carefully designed to include several features and functions to give users complete control of their electric car charging experience such as the ability to utilise time of use and economy tariffs allowing users to schedule chargers at times when energy tariffs are at their lowest thus encouraging energy consciousness


not only does myenergi design their products for the complete userfriendly experience but equally with the installation process in mind reducing face fix cabling and the need to reduce disruption to existing buildings was an important factor in the product design process


accessories such as the harvi product is an energy monitor which transmits import  export data to the other myenergi devices every 1 second completely wirelessly and negates the need to run wired ct clamps between devices


















which ev charger is right for me












untethered chargers


untethered chargers are those chargers without a fixed cable instead youd use your own cable typically the one that comes with your ev


the benefits of these untethered units include


 for those with type 1 vehicles youd need a specific type 1 to type 2 cable so theyd likely go for an untethered setup


 if youre after a particular cable length say you need a whopping 12m to reach your vehicle keeping in mind tethered units usually have a 65m cable preattached


 they tend to look a bit tidier though thats up for debate  beautys in the eye of the beholder after all


 they are aesthetically neater subject to opinion










tethered chargers


tethered chargers come with a cable permanently fixed to the unit this cable rocks a type 2 plug which has stamped its mark as the global industry standard making it a good fit for pretty much all the latest evs just a heads up there are a few early bird type 1 models out there  if youve got one of those you might want to look into the untethered option


the perks of tethered chargers include


 the main drawcard is convenience with a tethered unit theres no mucking around with unpacking and repacking a detachable lead every time you need a charge makes things a whole lot easier










7kw chargers


for home charging stations here in australia the 7kw chargers are the top pick theyre the best bet for both current homes and most of the new builds that come with a single phase supply if youre thinking of setting up a charger at your place this ones a solid shout










22kw chargers


for smaller commercial spots and workplace charging setups in australia the 22kw chargers are the goto but its not just businesses  some of the latest home developments especially the swanky new ones might opt for a 22kw charger if theyre rigged up with a threephase supply if youve got that setup its definitely worth considering




















what is fast car charging


fast car chargers are ultimately ev chargers which charge at rates between 7kw  22kw ac the process simply involves putting more electricity into your cars battery at a faster rate where a typical 3 pin 13amp plug socket in the home would charge at the rate of 23kw fast chargers charge at more than three times the speed 22kw in comparison charge at more than nine times the speed


 23kw 3 pin plug socket known as granny charging  
would take around 
24 hours
 on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle  note most hybrids have very small batteries when compared to full evs


 35kw chargers know as slow chargers  
would take around 
16 hours
 on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle  note most hybrids have very small batteries when compared to full evs


 7kw chargers known as fast chargers  
would take around 
8 hours
 on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle


 22kw chargers known as fast chargers  
would take around 
34 hours
 on average to fully charge from 0  100 dependent on vehicle


fast chargers are not to be confused with rapid chargers or super chargers which are the types of charger youd use on longer journeys when you require a full charge in less than an hour
