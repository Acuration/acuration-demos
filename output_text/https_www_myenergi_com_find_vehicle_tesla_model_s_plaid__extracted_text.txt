tesla model s plaid charging guide


in the realm of electric vehicles the tesla model s stands as a paragon a harmonious blend of luxury high performance and cuttingedge technology since its debut the model s has continually redefined expectations for what an electric car can be combining breathtaking acceleration and unparalleled range with a suite of luxury features and teslas signature futuristic appeal


the tesla model s isnt just about getting from point a to b its about the journey the innovation and the experience this vehicle a beacon of teslas ingenuity offers an unrivalled electric driving experience with its sleek aerodynamic design and an interior that combines comfort with hightech functionality the model s appeals to those who seek both style and substance in their vehicle
















 






can i charge a tesla model s plaid at home


with tesla supercharging points becoming increasingly more common its easy to forget that charging your electric vehicle at home is a costeffective sustainable solution with an 
ev charger
 such as zappi you can use excess energy from your home solar panels to charge the model s to keep your ev even more environmentally friendly than ever before


if opting to charge your model s at home overnight you may also be eligible for a reduced rate on your electric tariff which makes charging your ev overnight extra appealing






















how long does it take to charge the tesla model s plaid


13 hours 34 minutes


 






using a standard 
7kwh charger
 such as zappi it would take 13 hours 34 minutes to fully charge your 95kwh battery the tesla model s also has the capability to be charged on the 22kwh zappi which would reduce this charging time down to 10 hours 15 minutes














what is the range of the tesla model s plaid


345 miles






the range of the tesla model s plaid with the 95kwh battery differs between 255 miles and 490 miles depending on your driving conditions and the type of road typically the average range from a full charge will be around 345 miles














how much does it cost to charge the tesla model s plaid


713






it could cost just 713 to charge the tesla model s with the 95kwh battery when fully utilising offpeak charging on an octopus intelligent tariff at 0075pkwh in contrast peak charging on a standard rate of 034pkwh can cost 3230 to charge up




















 






how much does the tesla model s plaid cost


a brand new tesla model s starts at around 56000 with an estimated on the road cost of closer to 80000 however tesla has a seemingly endless list of modifications upgrades and extras which can be added on for a cost which can exceed 140000 the tesla model s plaid is currently retailing at 100000


this price does put the tesla model s as one of the most expensive electric cars on the market however with a massive range to choose from an incredible attention to detail in every aspect of this car its easy to see why it is so popular


prices correct as of november 2023
















 






is the tesla model s plaid reliable


with up to 4 years vehicle warranty and up to 8 years battery life guarantee even without the reliable reputation of tesla you can be sure your the model s will be reliable


even on a used model s  tesla offers up to a one year warranty or the remainder of the initial 4 year warranty whichever is longer
















 






does tesla model s plaid have free supercharging


although some tesla models can include some free supercharing this is not for the lifetime of the car and usually comes as an extra or with the top end models with the growing popularity of tesla in general the company reduced the number of unlimited free supercharging which once came as standard


tesla users will need to check their tesla app under specs and warranty to find out how much free supercharging they qualify for after which they will be charged at a standard rate which fluctuates but can be around 69pkwh regular supercharging users can choose to pay a monthly subscription which will allow them to pay a reduced price of 50pkwh
















 






does the tesla model s plaid have air suspension


yes when the tesla model s starts you may hear the sound of the compressor as the air suspension systems reservoir fills with air although the smart air suspension was an optional extra for the model s in 2014 it became standard in all models released after 2017


the purpose of adaptive air suspension offers the driver the choice between a softer or firmer ride based on their preferences as well as offering a more level height between the front and rear when carrying loads
