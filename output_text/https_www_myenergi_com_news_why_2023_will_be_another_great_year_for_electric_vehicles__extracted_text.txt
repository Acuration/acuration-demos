why 2023 will be another great year for electric vehicles
 


 








 










despite doom and gloom stories about electric motoring dominating the national press for the first few weeks of the year it is clear to anyone who looks at the data that 2023 will be a great year for electric vehicles in the uk


by the end of 2022 more than 11 million electric cars had been registered in the uk in the modern ev era since 2010 taking 12 years to reach that figure the smmt forecasts that the next 11 million will be registered in the next two years with more than 22 million expected to be on the road by the end of 2024


while electric car registrations in 2022 were undoubtedly affected by the global chip shortage and issues relating to the war in ukraine  notably supply constraints on wiring looms  they were still 21 higher than the previous year and we can expect annual growth rates of around 30 for the next two years


for all the media hype around people potentially switching back to petrol or ditching the thought of an ev it is important to remember that this is still very much a supplyconstrained market


with 483000 new electric cars expected to be registered in 2023 and perhaps as many as 200000 used electric cars changing hands we may see around 700000 transactions of evs this year however in a market of well over 7 million new and used car sales that means that if any more than 10 of the car buying market wants to go electric in 2023 the simple fact is that there will not be enough supply to go around


for new car buyers especially company car drivers going electric is a virtual no brainer there are plenty of electric vehicles available for the price of the uks average new car and running costs for the vast majority of ev drivers will be lower thanks to a majority being able to rely on home charging


while it is still true that options are more limited for used car buyers the picture is changing very fast at the time of writing almost 27000 used electric cars including plugin hybrids were listed on auto trader representing just under 7 of all used stock


this year should see a major increase in the volume of electric cars hitting dealer and independent forecourts in the uk thanks to the enormous annual growth in new ev registrations back in 2020 when the market grew by over 140 with more than 175000 registered the tesla model 3 was supplied in particularly large volumes so we can expect to see a significant number in the wholesale and retail markets over the coming months


while energy prices remain relatively high the other major factor supporting the growth of the ev market will be the growth in domestic solar installations in 2022 we saw the home solar sales more than triple compared to 2021 and we believe that trend will continue in the coming years following rises in the cost of electricity the business case for domestic solar has never been stronger in the postsubsidy era


for the majority of households that have a car the data indicates that private offstreet parking is also available meaning that home charging should be an option for them charging an electric vehicle at home is already invariably cheaper than charging on the public network with recent research showing that petrol would need to fall below 1 per litre  something it has not done since 2009  to make the average electric car more costly to run than an equivalent petrol variant


domestic solar makes ev adoption even more of a nobrainer with the marginal cost of charging being as low as zero when the sun is shining and when the sun isnt shining the addition of a smart home battery either soaking up solar energy or cheap offpeak electricity overnight can reduce the cost of charging compared to standard grid electricity tariff rates


we have also seen headlines relating to car manufacturers taking their foot off the gas so to speak when it comes to electric vehicle production this seems utterly unbelievable given the imperative for manufacturers to hit their fleet average emissions and therefore needing to sell as many electric vehicles as possible to offset higher emissions from other models


when a narrative emerges it is incredibly tempting for commentators to jump on the bandwagon and dig around for biased and selective evidence to add to the fearmongering and negativity


but the facts and forecasts speak for themselves and  while we cannot afford to be complacent  they point to 2023 being another great year for electric vehicles
