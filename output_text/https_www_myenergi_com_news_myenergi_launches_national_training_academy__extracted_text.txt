myenergi launches national training academy


earlier this year we unveiled plans to launch a dedicated education hub at our stateoftheart eco headquarters in stallingborough the 
myenergi academi
 opened its doors to its first intake of apprentices last month with the aim of supporting our ambition to find the team members of tomorrow our apprenticeships and internships are open to all ages and are available across engineering finance hr facilities and training and development we also have future plans to introduce more opportunities including in specialist areas


applicants can expect to develop a wide range of business skills including technical knowledge leadership ethics and management plans are also already underway to create a postgraduate scheme for launch next year


the academi will also serve the evergrowing internal staff development with an internal training prospectus that will cover renewables energy sustainability and the circular economy as well as supporting the longterm career opportunities available within the sector the internal training programme will be delivered to give anyone joining us the kickstart they need in this new and exciting industry


jordan brompton cofounder and cmo at myenergi commented myenergi is growing at an exceptional rate and following the success of our internship programme introducing an apprenticeship scheme seemed like the next logical step towards our goal of identifying the talented team members of tomorrow


operating at the heart of the humber renewables cluster has enabled us to recognise the need for highly skilled and enthusiastic employees the academi will provide us with an opportunity to bolster our workforce as well as support the region in which we operate


were passionate about the local area so aiding its development and that of the renewables sector is so important to us were excited to get the programme underway and continue investing in our business


myenergi has already grown significantly from just two employees in 2016 to more than 350 team members in the uk alone with subsidiaries in ireland australia and the netherlands the company recently shipped its 300000th unit with revenues having increased by 617 since 2019
