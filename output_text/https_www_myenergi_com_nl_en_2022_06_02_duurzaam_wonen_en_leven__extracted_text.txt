10x sustainable living and living
 


 








 










more and more people are concerned about the climate in addition due to rising energy prices sustainable living and living is becoming more and more interesting but how do you start and what can you think about

to combat 
climate change
 and save our planet it is important that we all take small steps towards a more sustainable way of living and living do you also want to 
reduce
 your 
carbon footprint
 and make more environmentally friendly choices then be sure to read on and discover our 10 tips


1 plasticfree bathroom


one small step that everyone can take to live more sustainably is to use less plastic the bathroom is the perfect place to start look around your bathroom and count how many 
plastic containers
 you see start recycling them into the right bin when you run out even better is to switch to 
plasticfree alternatives
 to inspire you here are some tips




use environmentally friendly cleaning products
 sustainable cleaning brands do not use chemicals or other toxic substances this is not only good for the environment but also for your own health another cheap multipurpose cleaning product is 
vinegar
  it is not always necessary to buy expensive cleaning products


buy biodegradable toothbrushes and use reusable cotton pads 
that way youll put less strain on the environment want to go a step further use toothpaste tablets instead of plastic tubes


use a block of soap instead of a liquid one
 you can also easily replace shampoo bottles with a shampoo bar


prefer not to buy individual bars of soap then buy in bulk
 by buying in bulk you save a lot of packaging material after use dispose of the packaging in the appropriate bin and recycle it in some shops you can also buy refillable shampoo and shower bottles that you can refill yourself in the shop


use recycled toilet paper
 




2 eat with the seasons


buying products that are not in season often means that they have travelled a long way to your kitchen it is not easy to avoid products that have been imported but you can buy 
seasonal products
 more often also choose local products more often

local food is also fresher often tastes better and contains more minerals and vitamins to keep food fresh for a long time vegetables that are imported are often sprayed with all kinds of chemicals




3 bring your own water bottle


a very simple step you can take toward sustainable living and living is to carry a reusable water bottle with you take your own water bottle to the office on the train or on a day out and refill it when it is empty

the tap water in the netherlands and belgium is good to drink so you can get water almost anywhere when you need it


4 preventing food waste


some statistics on food waste that are not easy to deal with




13 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions come from the food industry


13 of all food worldwide is wasted in the netherlands alone 2 billion kilos of food is wasted annually and in belgium almost 4 billion source 
samen tegen voedselverspilling
 and 
roels  van gijseghem





if you would like to live and work sustainably then preventing food waste is a good step wastage does not only occur among consumers but companies play a major role in this however as a consumer you can also make a contribution to preventing food wastage




first look at what you already have in your house what needs to be used first and what do you still have in stock


do your shopping with the help of a list this way you are less likely to buy unnecessary products extra tip never go shopping on an empty stomach


cook to order did you make too much food see if you can freeze it to eat later


products with a tht date can often still be eaten after this date although the taste may deteriorate smell look and taste before you throw it away products with a tgt date should be thrown away immediately the difference between these dates is explained in the video below 







5 use public transport walking or cycling


we are used to quickly taking the car to go shopping or to avoid going to work in a rainstorm yet public transport cycling or walking has many advantages




fewer vehicles on the road reduce co2 emissions


fewer greenhouse gases mean cleaner and healthier air


walking and cycling are good exercise and help you get your daily exercise


it can be much cheaper




not all places are equally accessible by public transport and some train tickets are very expensive but with small adjustments you can go a long way for example see if you can ride with a friend or colleague that way together you can take a step towards a sustainable life




6 think about an electric car


cant live without your car then consider switching to an 
electric model
 electric cars are quiet clean and a lot more durable than a regular petrol car more and more manufacturers are putting electric models on the market so there is more and more choice

if you also use your own ev charger such as our 
zappi
 you can greatly reduce your co2 footprint and energy bill read more about the 
benefits of electric
 cars


7 green energy


sustainable living goes hand in hand with using green energy this can be done in various ways




have 
solar panels
 installed on your roof to generate your own energy or 
rent solar panels


switch to a 
green energy supplier
 energy companies are increasingly supplying power from solar farms or 
windmills





want to know more check out these blogs




what is renewable energy


what is the difference between green and renewable energy


selfconsumption of green energy how does it work






8 switch off devices


did you know that an appliance uses energy even when it is plugged in but you are not using it this is called 
stealth consumption
 by unplugging appliances when you are not using them and turning them off instead of putting them on standby you avoid using energy unnecessarily do you often forget to do this it may help to use a power strip with a switch

preventing standby consumption is one of the simplest steps to sustainable living and living


9 zero waste shopping


more and more companies are aware of their impact on the climate and want to help you live and work sustainably as a result more and more zero waste alternatives are appearing on the market in many cities you can already find zero waste shops and there are also supermarkets that deliver groceries to your home in reusable pots and bottles this saves a lot of waste whats more many of these products are also plantbased and fairtrade


10 fly less


we are not saying that you should never fly again but sustainable living and living does not go well with air travel 
one of the biggest polluters is still the plane it is ideal for travelling long distances but it is not very environmentally friendly for shorter distances it is better to use an electric car or the train by the way there is still plenty to discover in your own country do you want or have no choice but to travel by plane then try to compensate for your flight
