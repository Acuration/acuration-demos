polestar 2 vs tesla 3 which is new zealands best ev
 


 












whats our verdict on the polestar 2 vs tesla 3


when it comes to a premium ev tesla has dominated the market for the last few years


however with the launch of the polestar 2 singlemotor fwd model earlier this year this has brought a new rival for the base tesla model 3 rwd



here at myenergi new zealand we are often asked if our electric car chargers are compatible with the tesla model 3 and the polestar 2 when it comes to charging your ev the zappi is the rising star in new zealand and is the perfect charging partner regardless of your choice between tesla and polestar



zappi is the smart charger with a difference not only does it have capabilities to fast charge your electric vehicle it can also harness power from solar to run your ev for free

a range of 507 kms

charging times 27min peak rate 150kw 1080 11hr 45min

vehicle aesthetics
















to many the polestar is more aesthetically pleasing than the tesla looking like a modern ev without being radically different the front and back of the polestar have been noted to be more characterful than the tesla


while the polestar weighs around quarter of a tonne more than the tesla and is a few centimetres taller on physical onlook this isnt overly noticeable and appear to be a very similarsized family ev


that clever suspension fitted to the polestar is actually adjustable allowing you dial in a bit more comfort when you arent in a hurry theres one small issue though in most cars adjusting the suspension involves nothing more than pressing a button on the dashboard whereas in the polestar you need to jack the car up and physically twist a knob on the end of each of the four dampers


internally both of these premium evs have opted for a minimalistic look and it really works tesla however causes controversy and split opinions on how minimalistic the interior has become while some praise the enormous 150in central touchscreen others find it a real faff






all internal controls including adjusting the door mirrors and steering wheel require you to delve into the touchscreen and fiddle around with buttons as someone who is not quite as techsavvy this can be a longwinded process this touchscreen really takes the tech inside the tesla to the next level with the ability to play games and even watch netflix for longdistance travelling with children this can certainly be a selling point while others can find it more distracting than a benefit


the polestar is certainly better equipped right from the off with standard equipment including




360degree cameras


blindspot indicators


apple car play and android auto support


handsfree trunk












 
























the costs


based on a typical finance quote for the polestar versus the tesla the polestar is certainly much better value for money assuming 10000 miles a year and a threeyear term the polestar would come in at just 127120 in comparison to the tesla that will set you back a hefty 166929month in a threeyear cost breakdown which factors in the depreciation insurance servicing road tax and electricity costs the pricing is much more aligned with the polestar totalling 5676482 and the tesla at a total of 5608448


 
































our verdict














despite the longer range the tesla just isnt quite cutting it for us


for day to day driving and family needs the polestar wins this battle hands down when assessing the features design and costs the polestar is much more fun to drive a smoother ride and complete with those luxury features and unique design
