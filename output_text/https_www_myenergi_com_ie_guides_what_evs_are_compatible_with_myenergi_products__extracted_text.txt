what evs are compatible with myenergi products
 


 












were proud to make renewable energy products and an 
electric car charger
 that works in harmony with a fantastic range of electric vehicles evs


with government incentives in place such as scrapping of the bik tax on electric company cars to make the uk 
carbon neutral by 2050
 evs are rapidly becoming the 
future of the transport industry



following the success of teslas range of evs many automakers have invested resources in the electric market as the battery technology develops further electric cars are only going to become more efficient and sustainable


new innovative charging and green technologies are making owning an electric car the most sensible environmental and economical option for many motorists but how do evs interact with such tech you ask


check out our guide to learn which models are compatible with our zappi harvi and eddi














what is zappi














 






zappi  the worlds first solar home ev charger


firstly lets introduce zappi  our ecosmart ev charger zappis versatility means it can use electricity both from the grid and from domestic renewable sources  like wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels


capable of charging your car using 100 free renewable energy from your solar pv or wind generation zappi puts sustainability straight into the hands of the user


even if you havent got a photovoltaic system or something similar zappi can import electricity from the grid if you do have a pv system zappi gives you the ability to charge your vehicle with surplus energy thats generated from your own solar panels and wind turbines

zappi home ev charger explained




our zappi is for sale with two different connectors type 1 and type 2 this means that almost every ev is compatible and can be loaded with zappi


the zappi can also alter its charging strength to be compatible with your ev and can adjust depending on grid changes to save you money








can zappi be used by hybrid cars


standard hybrid cars are similar to petrol or diesel engined vehicles the difference is in the engine as hybrids have a regular combustion engine 
and
 an electric motor  meaning theres no need to charge


however some manufacturers are creating plugin hybrids or phevs that have more powerful batteries that can be recharged by plugging in the car 
the land rover phev
 or 
mitsubishi outlander phev
 for instance are plugin hybrids compatible with our zappi charger








why does zappi have different charging modes


zappi has three different types of charging mode fast eco and eco these modes give you the power to decide how quickly and economically to charge your ev


fast charge


on fast charge zappi prioritises time by using energy from your renewable generator and the grid


eco mode


on eco mode zappi becomes an intelligent device that adjusts the charge rate to minimise taking energy from the grid by only taking the energy it needs zappi is wired into your homes electrical switchboard so it can sense when excess electricity is sent to the grid


eco mode


when zappi is set to eco mode it detects electricity going out to the grid and turns itself on to start charging your car whilst also matching the charge rate with the amount of electricity currently being exported








what evs are compatible with other myenergi products


our zappi harvi and eddi are all engineered to work in harmony together  making easy selfconsuming renewable energy a reality for everyone


app


the 
myenergi app
 allows you to remotely control and monitor all of your myenergi devices


eddi


the eddi is a 
solar power diverter
 that can be used alongside gridtied pv or wind turbine systems it diverts excess energy from the microgeneration system to heat water or rooms rather than exporting it back to the grid


harvi


the harvi is used alongside zappi and eddi and is an energyharvesting wireless sensor that measures how much energy is generated and how much goes to the grid


















the renewable energy dream


our dream at myenergi is for everyone to have access to generating and using renewable energysaving the planet and protecting the future for generations to come
