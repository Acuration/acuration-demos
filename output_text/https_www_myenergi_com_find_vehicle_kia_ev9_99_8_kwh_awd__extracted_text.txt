kia ev9 998 kwh awd charging guide


at the heart of this revolutionary vehicle is a visionary approach that seamlessly intertwines form and function the ev9s futuristic design is a testament to kias forwardthinking ethos challenging traditional notions of what an electric vehicle can be its sleek lines aerodynamic contours and attention to aesthetic detail not only make a bold visual statement but also contribute to the vehicles overall efficiency and performance
















 






how to charge the kia ev9


charging the kia ev9 is designed to be efficient and convenient catering to the needs of modern electric vehicle owners most ev drivers opt for the ease of using a 
home charging point
 the ev9 can be charged at home using a level 2 home charger this method allows owners to conveniently charge their vehicle overnight ensuring it is ready for daily use


whilst on the go the ev9 is compatible with public charging stations including fastcharging options the ev9 is also compatiable for the extensive tesla supercharge network for fast charging on the move






















how long does it take to charge the kia ev9 998 kwh awd


13 hours and 34 minutes


 






using a standard 
7kwh charger
 such as zappi it would take 13 hours and 34 minutes to fully charge your 95kwh battery the kia ev9 998 kwh awd also has the capability to be charged on the 22kwh zappi which would reduce this charging time down to 10 hours and 15 minutes














what is the range of the kia ev9 998 kwh awd


265 miles






the range of the kia ev9 998 kwh awd with the 95kwh battery differs between 190 miles and 380 miles depending on your driving conditions and the type of road typically the average range from a full charge will be around 265 miles














how much does it cost to charge the kia ev9 998 kwh awd


713






it could cost just 713 to charge the kia ev9 998 kwh awd with the 95kwh battery when fully utilising offpeak charging on an octopus intelligent tariff at 0075pkwh in contrast peak charging on a standard rate of 034pkwh can cost 3230 to charge up




















 






where is the kia ev9 made


kia is known for its global production strategy and despite being a korean manufacturer kia now makes all of the ev9s in west point georgia us the kia ev9 is one of the first evs to be manufactured at the 200 million manufacturing plant
















 






where is the charging port on the kia ev9


the kia ev9 features a combined charging system ccs socket conveniently located on the righthand side of the vehicle this design facilitates ultrafast charging capabilities reaching speeds of up to 210 kw the vehicle achieves this remarkable charging efficiency through a versatile multiinput charging system ensuring compatibility with both 400v and 800v infrastructure
















 






next generation ev


the kia ev9 represents kias bold step into the future of electric mobility promising a driving experience that seamlessly blends innovation and sustainability as the ev9 hits the roads it is poised to reshape the landscape of electric vehicles setting new standards for the industry and inspiring a new generation of ecoconscious drivers
