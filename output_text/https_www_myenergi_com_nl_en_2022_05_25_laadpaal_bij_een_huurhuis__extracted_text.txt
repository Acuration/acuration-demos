charging station at a rental property
 


 








 










are you considering going electric then its a good idea to consider how you will charge your car the cheapest way is with a home ev charger many also like to charge the car as close to home as possible of course with your own home and driveway this is very easy to do but what if you have a rental property is a charging station at a rental property also possible

if you have a house for sale you own your home and decide what to do with it with a rental property ownership and therefore control of the property lies with the landlord some rental properties also allow you to rent your own driveway or parking space in a garage with most homes however this is not the case


charging station at a rental property


do you have your own driveway and want to have a charging station installed there then as a tenant you will need to get written permission from your landlord first the costs for the charging station at a rental property are generally for the tenant if you are going to leave the property after some time the property will often have to be returned to its original condition this means that you will have to remove the charging station and pay the costs for it yourself if a subsequent tenant would like to take over the charging station other arrangements can of course be made

during the installation of 
the charging station
 in some cases the meter box will have to be modified for this you often do not need permission from your landlord because this falls under 
home improvement
 however even here the costs incurred are the responsibility of the tenant


public charging station


cant place a charging station at your rental property or wont get permission from your landlord then you can request a public charging station from the municipality not every municipality will grant your request check with your own municipality for the conditions and rules

of course you can also use already installed public charging stations many shopping centers or public parking garages already have charging stations
