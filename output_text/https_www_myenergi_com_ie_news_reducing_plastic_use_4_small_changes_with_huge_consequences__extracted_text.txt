how to reduce plastic use 4 small changes with huge consequences
 


 








 










in the last 60 years the worlds annual consumption of plastic materials has increased from 
5 million to nearly 100 million tonnes
 the uk contributes 5 million tonnes of plastic waste every year 
to put the above statistic into perspective 100 million tonnes of plastic is the equivalent of 2 trillion 2litre drinks bottles so how to reduce plastic use


what effect does plastic waste have on the environment


plastic can take up to 500 years to decompose making it one of the biggest threats to the environment its toxic pollutants can have a detrimental effect on land water and air and are a major danger for wildlife


greenpeace
 claims a truckload of plastic enters our oceans every single minute  killing marine life and threatening precious ecosystems litter which largely consists of plastic waste can trap and hurt organisms animals and fish thus upsetting not only food chains but also our economy


industries such as fishing shipping and tourism have all suffered from the increase in plastic waste filling our oceans but the damage is not limited to the seas with plastic toxins also making their way into all water sources including drinking water as well as on land


nonrecyclable plastics are a major issue for the planet burning these materials release toxins that leak into the environment causing air pollution and in some cases respiratory issues however we are running out of space for landfills and dumps which also remain harmful to animals and groundwater sources


what we can do to stop this


here are a few very small and simple steps that will make hugely significant strides in reducing plastic use and pollution


research your recycling


most families according to statistics throw away 40kg of recyclable plastic every year while nonrecyclable plastics remain a key debate there is no reason why we should be throwing away the materials that can be reused 




its crucial that we take more care in checking what can and cannot be recycled to reduce the damage we are doing to the environment
 
 
 
 


change your drinking habits to reduce plastic waste


how many bottled beverages do you buy and throw away once youve finished drinking them what if you had just the one bottle that you carried with you everywhere instead 




carrying and using your own flask and bottle for hot and cold drinks is a minor change that can have tremendous benefits the uk now has 
water refill stations in every town and city
 making it even easier to stay hydrated without causing further pollution 
find your nearest refill station
 today




another habit to avoid is drinking from plastic straws as these can be incredibly damaging for the environment straws were actually named in the 
top 10 items picked up on beach clean ups
 




despite being used only once for around 20 minutes a straws destructive legacy lasts hundreds of years destroying habitats and killing endangered aquatic species before they break down they never biodegrade




additional changes you can make include getting your milk delivered in reusable plastic bottles  as opposed to buying pints in plastic bottles  and choosing wine bottles with natural corks not plastic or metal caps


reduce plastic waste when you shop


if possible singleuse plastics are a major thing to cut out much like straws and plastic cutlery excessive food packaging is one of the main preventable causes of plastic waste




next time you shop aim to cut down your use of plastic by buying loose fruit and vegetables as opposed to the prepackaged stuff these items tend to be cheaper fresher 
and 
better for the environment so theres no excuse




always bring reusable bags with you when shopping too a bag for life is a much better option for living greener and avoiding needless expenditures on plastic bags the 
5p plastic bag scheme has seen singleuse plastic bag sales fall by 86
 in the last few years but more can still be done to save our planet


stop chewing gum and use a biodegradable toothbrush


brits are the second biggest consumers of gum in the world with the average uk citizen chewing approximately 
130 sticks every year
 why is this so bad for the environment you ask




gum is one of the largest contributors to litter with a study finding 
250000 blobs of it on oxford street
 alone back in 2000




most gum is made up of a nonbiodegradable butadienebased synthetic rubber formed from a similar plastic product as car tyres to learn more about the effect chewing gum is having on our environment check out 
just one oceans guide



what more can we do to help the environment


in october 2018 the government produced its 
uk statistics on waste
 this highlighted the eu target for the uk to recycle at least 50 of household waste by 2020


there is plenty we can do individually and as a society to reduce our plastic waste one small step at a time can do wonders to save our planet are you ready to take greenpeaces pledge to put a stop to plastic pollution and keep our oceans clean 
sign it here



reducing your carbon footprint
 and plastic waste is just the beginning learn how we are helping to create a sustainable future by exploring the 
myenergi mission
