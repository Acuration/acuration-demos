benefits of charging your electric car at home
 


 








 










of course it is very convenient to park your electric car next door and be able to charge it right away for your next trip but did you know that charging your electric car at home has even more advantages


cheap loading


charging an electric car at home with the help of a 
charging station
 or wallbox is the most economical way to charge the rate you pay for energy at home is often much lower than what you would pay at a public charging station unique to our 
smart ev charger zappi
 is that the system can be set to charge at the most advantageous times for you do you use flexible energy tariffs zappi monitors energy prices 247 and thus knows exactly when you can charge at the cheapest rates


free driving with your solar energy


do you have solar panels and thus generate your own power zappi can easily make optimal 
use of this power
 to charge your electric car when you charge your electric car at home with your own power you can drive for free of course you pay for the purchase of the solar panels but the electricity is free so you drive even cheaper


always a place


with a home charging station you never have to look for a place to charge your electric car or wait at a charging station again you park your car and connect the charger to your charging station at zappi you can specify when you want the car to be charged again one of the biggest advantages of charging your electric car at home is that you have little to worry about during the charging process you dont have to wait and can get back in your car in the morning to drive to work
