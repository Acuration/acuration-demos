types of car charger explained


 


 


 


 












type 1 electric car charger












type 1 electric car charging is a 5pin design that comes with a tether to prevent it from being pulled out of the charging port this type of charging point is the dominant variation in asian japanese and american markets it is less commonly seen in ireland uk and mainland europe type 1 chargers only adds about 4 miles of range per hour rph depending on the cars make and model so it often referred to as slow or emergency charging in ireland a type 1 charger is commonly misdescribed as the standard 3pin sockets we have everywhere in ireland this is a 3pin charger not a type 1 electric car charger


 


 


 


 














type 2 electric car charger












the type 2 car charger is typical of most chargers found in ireland uk and mainland europe type 2 models are known as such for their 7pin design dont have these latches instead to hold them securely to the vehicles they utilise a locking pin that locates and secures the plug in place this type of charger will provide your electric car with about 25 miles of range per hour rph but can also offer different charging speeds for example eco or fast

how can i get a car charger installed at home












there are two main types of ev charging station fast charging for homes and rapid charging for public chargers most home electric car chargers use 
ac charging
 however when rapid charging is required  for instance at motorway service stations  
dc charging
 is typically used as it is quicker


we are seeing a rapid increase in the number of charging stations in irish workplaces  particularly from companies that have 
electric fleets
 charging at work is becoming an increasingly popular facility  and many businesses are utilising the governments 
workplace charging scheme
 wcs which is a voucherbased option that provides financial incentives for installing ev chargers

giving you more control


more choice more control meet ocpp


zappi is now ocpp supported as standard this means you can connect to an ocpp compatible platform which allows you to control and manage your charging experience


what is ocpp


ocpp
 is a standardised form of communication for ev charging infrastructure regardless of manufacturer it was created to allow compatibility between ev chargers and management software to enable greater convenience and choice for consumers
















what are the benefits


ocpp offers 4 key benefits to zappi users which differ slightly depending on whether you have a single zappi at home or use multiple zappis in a business setting
