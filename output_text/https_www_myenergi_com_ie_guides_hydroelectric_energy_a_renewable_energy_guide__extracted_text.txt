hydroelectric energy a renewable energy guide
 


 












hydroelectric energy is the biggest source of renewable power in the world contributing 71 of renewable electricity


not sure what exactly hydroelectric energy is or how it can benefit your home and the planet as a whole follow our guide to learn everything you need to know about the clean renewable green energy source
















what is hydroelectric energy


the term hydro is of greek origin meaning water therefore hydroelectricity is simply electric power generated through the water


moving water has been used for many years to generate power and in more recent times it has grown to become the leading source of renewable electric energy


the largest hydro plants are currently located in china brazil russia canada and the us


















 






how does hydroelectricity work


hydroelectric energy is power generated through the power of flowing water which spins a turbine connected to an electric generator due to waters predictable nature hydropower is actually one of the most dependable and reliable sources of renewable energy


hydro generators can vary tremendously in size ranging from as small as 50kw up to a whopping 2000kw like the hoover dam


usually a hydropower system is constructed via three elements a power plant from which the electricity is produced a river or dam that can be opened and closed to control the flow of water and finally some form of the reservoir in which the water can be stored


with such a simple yet innovative system in place you have a great level of control on the flow of energy which is of course a huge advantage particularly if you are using it with other renewable energy sources such as wind power or 
solar panels

















 






how sustainable and renewable actually is hydropower


in 2017 thanks to hydropower replacing coal in many countries the world prevented up to 4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases  and avoided a 10 per cent rise in global emissions from fossil fuels reports 
hydropowerorg



in total that year there was enough hydropower electricity generated to provide electricity for one billion people


while hydropower creates free stable and clean energy there are a few criticisms of this renewable energy source one being that the initial construction of the largescale plants can be costly and can potentially disrupt ecosystems and local surrounding communities
















what are the different types of hydroelectric energy


















1 
storage hydropower


electricitypowered through the release and flow of water from a large reservoir using a dam system the water surges through a turbine which is then used to provide power towards the generator


 


3 
pumpedstorage hydropower


gathering power from water that is pushed between lower and higher reservoirs using pumps powered by surplus energy when demand is high the turbines release water from the upper reservoir down below to produce power










2 
runofriver hydropower


this system utilises the power generated from the flowing water of a canal or penstock to activate a turbine generally these systems do not entail a storage facility unlike the storage hydropower runofriver systems are particularly useful for continuous steady supplies of power


 


4 
offshore hydropower


a hydropower energy source that uses the power of waves and currents to produce electricity from the oceans


it is not unusual for these four technologies to sometimes overlap and entwine in bigger more varied hydropower systems


















what next


 


hydroelectricity currently contributes 
16 of the worlds electricity
 considering that this is the most popular and widely used source of renewable energy we still have a long way to go before were completely renewable and sustainable no longer damaging planet earth with fossil fuels and unnecessary waste
