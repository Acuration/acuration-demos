offshore renewable energy catapult everything you need to know
 


 












 






offshore green energy


the uk is at the forefront of wind power with the offshore renewable energy catapult leading the way for businesses to transition from fossil fuels to renewables


as the world leader in offshore wind we have more wind farms installed for our countrys capacity than anywhere else


already our offshore wind powers the equivalent of 45 million homes and were not stopping there
















what is the offshore renewable energy catapult




the offshore renewable energy catapult or ore is a technological innovation and research centre for offshore wind wave and tidal energy they are a team of over 140 consultants researchers designers developers and testers that work alongside businesses to help them create offshore renewable energy technology


founded in 2003 they have two bases in glasgow and blythe which is in northumberland














what do the ore do




the ore catapult works in partnership with businesses  from micro enterprises to the uk government   to create implement and later commercialise renewable energy technology


utilising their expertise and facilities they work alongside the heavyweights of the offshore renewables industry  from the industrial suppliers to the owners  to improve existing technologies and develop newer ones in the uk


the catapult also encourages new companies and technologies to follow the same development process by applying research created in their own academic base


they have worked alongside approximately 600 smes small to medium enterprises have completed over 250 research projects with another 100 on the way and have supported over 140 companies in their renewable product development














how does the offshore renewable energy catapult work
















the catapult is divided into three sectors




the operations and performance sector works with the owners and operators of renewable energy equipment manufacturers specialising in operations and maintenance they drive improvements in fleets of existing wind farms to make them more efficient longerlasting and optimised to keep the uk at the forefront of offshore renewable energy


the testing and validation sector applies their expertise to support the development of renewable technologies working with researchers industrial partners and innovators to drive the development of new technologies and optimising existing ones


the research and innovation sector supports the development and commercialisation of renewable technologies through applied research in collaboration with uk academia and small enterprises


















what that means for us


















what are their plans for the future


the catapult wants to be the worlds leading offshore renewable energy technology centre theyve already announced plans to expand to lincolnshire and the humber area creating between 50 to 70 jobs and enriching the local community in the next ten years


in the immediate future they have plans to take on 70 more employees and create new centres in hull fife and south wales they also want to expand to four academic research hubs to continue working in their 55 research positions










how does this affect us in the long term


from the perspective of lincolnshire locals we couldnt be more excited about the prospect of the catapult working so close to myenergi hq in the coming years


the opportunity to enrich the local community and breathe life into industrial areas such as grimsby is a cause very close to our hearts


on a national level the creation of a streamlined controlled and globally industryleading supplier of offshore renewable energy being based in the uk is fantastic for all of us


the catapult predicts that the uk is capable of generating enough offshore energy to power the entire country with even more spare to export to europe  benefiting our uk economy too


on a global level the dawn of renewable energy is upon us  giving us all hope for the future and something to be proud of


















and lastly


it gives us a real sense of joy and hope at myenergi to see real industriallevel change being implemented throughout the country to generate renewable energy that will soon become accessible to all our fight to protect our planet isnt easy but with companies like the ore catapult leading the way there is the chance for real optimism looking towards the future
