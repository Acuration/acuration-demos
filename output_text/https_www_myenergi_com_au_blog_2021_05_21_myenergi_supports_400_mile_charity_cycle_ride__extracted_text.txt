myenergi supports 400mile charity cycle ride
 


 








 










on your bike for charity


myenergi pioneer of the worlds first ecosmart ev charging device is throwing its full support behind electrical installation expert nrt eco as the team saddles up for a gruelling 400mile cycle ride across the uk to raise money for charity


 


with the aim of collecting more than 15000 for 
the climate coalition and fuel poverty action
 three team members from nrt eco and a rider from gridserve will depart from the nrt group headquarters in banstead on thursday 3
rd
june the peloton will visit six counties in just four days


 


at the halfway point the group will arrive at the 
myenergi
 facility in lincolnshire where theyll be welcomed with a meal cooked by a local restaurant and bespoke physiotherapy sessions the ride will culminate at the gridserve allelectric forecourt in braintree essex a staggering 2035km later




 


adam smith divisional director at 
nrt eco
 commented the nrt eco division was founded to support the uk governments target of achieving net zero carbon by 2050 from battery storage systems and solar pv to smart home technology energy assessments and electric vehicle charging points such as the myenergi zappi we install a wide range of solutions to help households become greener


 


as part of our efforts to promote decarbonisation we wanted to do something different to raise awareness about eco living as well as raise valuable funds for two charities close to our hearts the support from the industry has been amazing  weve been blown away by the donations messages and positive feedback


 


jordan brompton cofounder and cmo at myenergi added as an approved myenergi installer we wanted to do all we could to help adam and the team smash their targets and raise widespread awareness of eco living


 


alongside providing a tlc session at our hq and providing funding towards gear for the ride well be promoting the event far and wide its a great cause and were keen to drive further awareness if you havent already head over to the fundraising page and donate today
