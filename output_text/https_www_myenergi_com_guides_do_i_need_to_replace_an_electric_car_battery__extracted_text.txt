do i need to replace an electric car battery
 


 












one of the biggest concerns for drivers interested in making the switch from petroldiesel cars to an electric vehicle is the battery life


will they need to replace the battery every 2 years 5 years there is a lot of misinformation out there so its important to know the facts before you make your purchase














 






the difference between ice and ev engines


aside from the obvious  the type of fuel they use  ev engines are distinctive from the traditional way in the fact that they include far fewer parts


combustion engines are prone to wear and tear simply because of the high number of moving parts used to make them ev batteries are far simpler and more streamlined meaning theres less chance of breakdown

























electric car battery technology


with an ev battery like most electric batteries every time it is depleted and you recharge your battery it is undergoing a cycle that impacts its longevity


this is known as a cycle of discharge and its the same as when you charge your phone battery the more you charge an electric battery the less overall life it has




















battery degradation


a lot of work has been put into making sure your ev battery has a long lifespan one of the most important changes is ensuring that the ev battery never runs dry


for evs batteries are made so that drivers dont use the full amount of power stored in the battery reducing the number of cycles the battery goes through


ev batteries are known to degrade faster if the following circumstances are regularly met




the battery is repeatedly used down to zero and then is charged back to full


the battery is frequently charged using a fast charge mode












it is recommended that you keep your ev charge between 20 to 80 to make the battery last longer

additionally ev manufacturers are aware that their batteries need to have a substantial lifespan and so are designing their batteries to last as long as possible while still adhering to 
ecofriendly standards


on average youll find your ev battery has a warranty of 5 to 8 years nissan states that that its electric car batteries will last eight years or 100000 miles for example and tesla offers a similar warranty


however the current prediction is that these batteries will have a lifespan of at least 10 to 20 years


















 






recycling your ev battery


ev batteries are green in more ways than one as well as providing green energy for driving once the battery is no longer usable for your vehicle it can still be used in your home


ev batteries can work as storage for your home pv systems storing the energy you generate from your solar panels or from wind energy
























the smart choice


making the decision to switch to an electric vehicle is not only a great choice for the environment but it could also save you money in the long run


by charging your ev battery in the smartest ways and reusing your batteries in your home energy systems evs can last longer and give you more life than any standard combustion car
