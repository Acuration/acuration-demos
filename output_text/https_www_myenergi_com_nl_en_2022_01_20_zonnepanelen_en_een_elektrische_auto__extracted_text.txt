solar panels and an electric car
 


 








 










the cheapest way to charge your electric car is with your own charging station and electricity you generate yourself solar panels and an electric car are therefore an ideal combination why we are happy to explain


combining solar panels and an electric car


solar panels
 generate green electricity that you can use in your home but which you can also use to charge your electric car exactly how many solar panels you need depends on how much power you expect to use per year on average for your car and household appliances what capacity your chosen solar panels can deliver and the position of your roof

anwb calculated that the 
volkswagen id3
 of 58 kwh  145 hp 
requires 8 solar panels
 just 
to charge the car
 and then you still dont have power for household appliances it is therefore a good idea to calculate your approximate energy requirements


how do i use solar energy to charge my car


own solar panels and an electric car are a perfect combination you can use the free power you generate to charge your car our smart ev charger 
zappi
 checks if you have generated solar power and uses that power to charge your electric car did you not generate enough power or do you have no solar panels then zappi uses energy from the grid via different modes zappi can be set to charge your electric car only when the most advantageous tariff applies


what happens to the surplus


in the sunny summer months you may generate more energy than you consume electricity that you do not use flows back to the grid with the abolition of the balancing scheme you will soon no longer receive compensation for this you are therefore giving away free electricity thats a shame of course it is therefore a good idea to look at alternative ways 
in which you can still use the power yourself
 if you do not yet have an electric car it is worth considering buying one you can then use the surplus energy to charge your car this way you will waste less

do you already have an electric car and already use your solar energy for charging in that case our smart energy converter eddi offers a solution with 
eddi
 you can in fact use the surplus to heat your home this way you save even more on your energy costs
