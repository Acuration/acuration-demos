myenergi lands 30m investment from energy impact partners
 


 








 










british smart home energy technology manufacturer myenergi has secured an investment of 30m to support significant future growth and internationalisation from 
energy impact partners
 eip this follows on from the 30m debt finance myenergi secured from hsbc 
earlier this year
 to further fuel its expansion


lee sutton and jordan brompton founded ukbased myenergi in 2016 with the purpose of removing the barriers to a greener future including the technological behavioural and financial challenges relating to fast adoption of smart energy products setting the company on a mission to pioneer a simple transition to renewable energy


myenergi has been recognised as one of the countrys 
top 30 fastestgrowing private companies
 with average annual growth of more than 125 for the past three years it manufactures a range of ecosmart home energy technologies including the marketleading solarcompatible zappi electric vehicle charge point the eddi power diverter and the libbi smart home battery


eip is a global investment firm focused on investing in the energy transition by supporting companies developing solutions that will define the future of energy and climate this includes missiondriven high impact uk and european tech companies like myenergi that contribute to safer more flexible and cleaner energy sources


as part of the equity investment eips nazo moosa managing partner eip europe will join the myenergi board alongside sir terry leahy former ceo of tesco and peter richardson former coo of dyson transportation is responsible for nearly a quarter of the global energy related co2 and road transport makes up the lions share of it eip targets the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions moosa said we are proud to back lee and jordan who have built a truly unique company in the climate sector that is both growing rapidly and is profitable zappi is already one of the leading 
ev charger
 brands in the uk and ireland and with the success of its libbi energy storage product we believe myenergi is in pole position to become the leading home energy management provider


lee commented we are delighted to have found an investor in eip that truly understands our purpose mission vision and values with the teams extensive support we will be able to further expand the products and services offered within our home energy ecosystem making our solutions available to even more consumers worldwide the investment will help to deliver our next generation of product development and innovation including our planned growth in grid services  such as demand side response allowing us to better support our customers in undertaking their own home energy transition we will also be investing in service excellence to ensure that our customers benefit from the best frontline support


jordan added as we transition to a net zero future its vital for consumers to be given easy and convenient ways to make the shift away from fossil fuels towards clean green renewable energy we are really excited by the investment from eip which will help to bring our ecosmart products into more households enabling our customers to monitor manage and maximise their home energy as well as reducing their emissions streamlining their energy bills and ultimately empowering them to become more energy independent
