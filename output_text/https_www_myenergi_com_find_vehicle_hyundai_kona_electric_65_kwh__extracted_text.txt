whether youre navigating the urban jungle or exploring the great outdoors this compact suv is ready to accompany you on your journey making a bold statement wherever it goes


join us as we delve into the remarkable features and qualities that make the hyundai kona ev an exceptional vehicle in its class redefining what it means to drive with style comfort and excitement
















 






is the hyundai kona reliable


although there is no official data yet for the new hyundai kona electric offering hyundai as a manufacturer scored incredibly well when it comes to user experience and reliability the original kona ev was top of the class in the best cars to own survey in 2021 and was an impressive overall 4th place score for reliability when compared to 75 other cars






















what is the range of the electric hyundai kona 64kwh


240 miles






the range of the hyundai kona with the 64kwh battery differs between 170 miles and 360 miles depending on your driving conditions and the type of road typically the average range from a full charge will be around 240 miles














how long does it take to charge the hyundai kona 64kwh


9 hours and 8 minutes


 


 






using a standard 7kwh charger such as zappi it would take just over 9 hours to fully charge your battery the kona also has the capability to be charged on the 22kwh zappi which would reduce this charging time down to 7 hours














how much does it cost to charge the hyundai kona 64kwh


480


 






it could cost just 480 to charge the hyundai kona 64kwh battery when fully utilising offpeak charging on an octopus intelligent tariff at 0075pkwh in contrast peak charging on a standard rate of 034pkwh can cost 2176 to charge up




















 






where is the charging port on the hyundai kona 64kwh


the charging port can be located behind a flap that would be a grille in a nonelectric vehicle meaning easier access to public charging points regardless of which side of the station you have to park your car the door to the charging point is also heated which allows you to charge your car even in extreme cold weather a feature which many evs dont have
















 






can i charge the hyundai kona at a tesla supercharger


as standard the hyundai kona can accept a multitude of different chargers including the tesla supercharger network as well as standard 
7kwh home charger
s like the zappi the hyundai kona charges relatively quickly considering its size and distance capabilities
















 






how much does the hyundai kona ev 64kwh cost


the 64kwh model of the hyundai kona  starts from 38595 and can range up to 45980 with all of the optional extras available to create a more comfortable experience for both driver and passenger the 
smaller battery and range model
 starts at 34995 this puts the hyundai kona as one of the cheaper evs on the market and undercuts the byd atto 3 this is still around 10000 more than the petrol offering of the same hyundai kona
