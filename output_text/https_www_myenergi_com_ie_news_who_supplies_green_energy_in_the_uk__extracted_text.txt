our list of green energy suppliers in the uk
 


 








 










33 of the power generated in the uk was renewable in 2018 according to a 
recent report
 the question is are you part of the 33 helping to save our planet or is your home contributing to the 
climate crisis



it is our mission to get that number up to 100 but we cant do it alone thats why we need green energy suppliers in the uk


renewable energy also known as 
green energy
 is produced via sources that are far less damaging to the environment than fossil fuels the likes of gas and coal power are huge contributing factors to global warming an issue that is killing our precious home


the good news is that at myenergi we are joined by many energy providers in expanding the uks renewable energy usage and reducing our nations reliance on the grid


follow our steps and guidance to ensure your home is powered by green renewable energy to ensure youre 
reducing your carbon footprint
 and 
tracking your energy usage



what is a green energy supplier


a green energy supplier is a company that generates the power it provides for its customers homes via renewable sources such as




hydroelectricity


solar power


wind power




independent renewable energy providers


as mentioned earlier 
33 of the national grid is green
 with 615 made up of gas and nuclear and the remainder coal and oil 


26 of people have not yet switched to green energy because they dont know enough about it


independent companies have led the charge in green energy from the grid for a while now with the likes of 
bulb
 and 
ecotricity
 proving popular choices


bulb is the uks largest green supplier offering cheaper simpler and greener power to homes across the nation the tech startup has been
 praised for its excellent customer service
 and affordable tariffs


ecotricity meanwhile kickstarted the green energy movement back in midnineties and continue to lead the charge as the 
worlds first renewable supplier



other options for those among you considering the switch to a green energy supplier are




tonik energy


ovo energy


good energy


octopus energy


bristol energy


pure planet


ebico


coop energy




large suppliers offering green energy


if you would prefer to go with a longerstanding energy provider some of the larger suppliers offer renewable power 


this relatively new offering likely stemmed from the increased attention and publicity the 
climate crisis campaign
 has received in the press alongside the many companies offering 
green renewable energy products



you can now ask for renewable energy from the following providers




british gas


sse


eon


edf


scottish power


npower




selfconsume your own renewable energy


those of you who really want to make a big step towards sustainability and the renewable sector should seriously consider 
generating your own green energy



installing 
solar panels
 or a 
wind turbine
 can tremendously reduce your bills as well as your reliance on the grid this together with our innovative 
eddi
 device  which seriously reduces the risk of wasted energy  will make your home much more sustainable and better for the environment
