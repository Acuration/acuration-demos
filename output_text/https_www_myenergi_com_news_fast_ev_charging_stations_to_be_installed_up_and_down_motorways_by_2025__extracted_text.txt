fast ev charging stations to be installed up and down motorways by 2025
 


 








 










brace yourselves for a greener future


myenergi is overjoyed to announce that the european union eu has taken a monumental stride towards ecofriendliness the eu parliament has enacted a law that by 2025 ev fast charging stations will be installed across all significant transport corridors this is a clear victory for the green revolution and its one that perfectly aligns with our mission here at myenergi


this audacious yet crucial strategy is designed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles shrinking the eus carbon footprint in the process this initiative is perfectly aligned with the eus commitment to adhere to the paris climate agreement and we wholeheartedly believe it will transform the landscape of the automobile industry


lets delve into the details of this landmark law


it mandates that ev fast charging stations are to be installed every 60 km on highways ensuring no major road in the region is devoid of easy access to ev charging this eliminates a considerable hurdle to ev adoption  range anxiety providing a significant boost to electric vehicle transition the readily available fastcharging stations will facilitate impromptu charging speedy contactless payments and longer anxietyfree ev journeys


here at myenergi we cant help but celebrate this forwardthinking legislation


this eu mandate is a total gamechanger one that fits snugly with our ethos of nurturing a sustainable future it wont just ramp up the prevalence and accessibility of evs but also catalyse our journey towards collective environmental objectives  jordan brompton


jordan went on to say the integration of ev fast chargers along all key transport arteries is a bold statement of the eus resolve to confront climate change headon we think its a phenomenal leap forward for ecofriendly mobility and were thrilled to be part of this gamechanging journey


in summary this law lays a robust groundwork for the european unions sustainable future casting a hopeful light for green tech companies like ours ev manufacturers and above all our beautiful planet as more legislation emerges to foster green technology we can look forward to a seismic shift towards a more sustainable world
