10 new years resolutions to help the environment
 


 








 










with 2020 just around the corner people are beginning to think of their new years resolutions for the next 12 months


a new year presents the ideal opportunity to set goals and make positive changes in your life it is our mission to make such changes to our planet with the help of renewable energy and sustainability


there has never been as much focus on saving our planet from the doom and gloom of 
global warming
 and 
climate change
 than now this means that 2020 is the perfect time to create new years resolutions centred around 
reducing your carbon footprint
 and living a greener life


1 make your bathroom plasticfree


the first thing we must all stop doing is treating bathroom waste as if its exempt from the recycling process 


plastic shampoo bottles are more likely to end up in the general waste bin because a lot of people neglect to separate out their bathroom rubbish here are a few ways in which you can increase sustainability in your bathroom




use environmentally friendly cleaning products
 brands such as 
method
 are nontoxic and contain as few chemicals as possible they do a great job and have the benefit of smelling really nice


buy 
biodegradable
 cotton buds and toothbrushes 
cotton buds tend to get flushed down the toilet find their way to the ocean and do a huge amount of damage to the marine life that ingests them wooden toothbrushes are also available


use bar soap rather than heavily packaged liquid soap
 ensure it doesnt contain 
palm oil
 you can also get plasticfree shampoo bars


buy shampoos shower gels etc in bulk
 this reduces the overall amount of packaging especially if you buy refillable products from companies such as 
faith in nature
 which has refill stations across the country


its easy to find recycled toilet paper but it generally comes in plastic packaging
 toilet rolls from 
who gives a crap
 are packaged in an environmentally friendly way and delivered to your door and they donate 50 of their profits to help build toilets for people in need




 


2 eat with the seasons


eating foods that arent in season inevitably means buying products that have been transported a significant distance for your enjoyment 


it wouldnt be easy to give up everything that has been imported but the more locally produced seasonal goods we consume the better


eating the seasons
 mean we 
reduce the energy and associated co2 emissions required to get food to our table 


locally produced seasonal foods are fresher and therefore taste better and provide higher levels of vitamins and minerals imported vegetables have often been treated with chemicals or gasses postharvest to extend their shelflife


seasonal food is also generally less expensive than imported food that is out of season in the uk


3 carry your own water bottle


you may think that as long as you recycle your water bottles youre not doing any harm however recycling costs money and is a complicated process often meaning than not all of the bottle is recycled anyway 


its a far better idea to carry your own bottle and refill it when its empty there are lots of 
different types to choose from
 some are very light some have a lovely design some keep drinks cool and you can add fruit to some for a little bit of flavour


4 use public transport walk or cycle


it doesnt always seem especially convenient to take public transport walk or cycle however there are so many benefits and we recommend giving it some serious thought




less vehicles on the road reduces emissions that harm the environment


fewer emissions result in healthier air for peoples lungs  especially in cities and for those at exhaust level  iechildren


walking and cycling are great exercise


it could be much cheaper for you




you could even compromise by using a 
park and bike
 system


of course some areas are not well served with public transport and some rail season tickets are extremely expensive 


if you rely on a car to get to your place of work offer to share with a colleague  if you work in a big city you may get there more quickly than everybody else thanks to 
carsharing lanes



5 cut down on food waste


heres a couple of statistics that arent very easy to digest 




a third of food produced in the world every year is lost or wasted thats 
approximately 13 billion tonnes


per capita waste by consumers is over 10 times higher per year in europe and north america than in subsaharan africa south and southeastern asia




consumers arent responsible for all of this  some is destroyed at the farm gate because it might not be the correct quality  but theres still a lot we can do to reduce this obscene amount of waste such as




support retailers offering imperfect fruit and vegetables at lower prices such as 
morrisons wonky
 range


steer clear of 2 for 1 and 
bogof 
deals in supermarkets unless you are absolutely sure the items are something you will definitely consume or something you can freeze for a later date


learn to make soups stews and smoothies to use up fruit and vegetables that are past their best the benefit of doing this ensures youll get your 
5ada
y


remember that best before dates are just that  best before if it looks tastes and smells fine then it will be fine the important date to take notice of is the use by date these are applied to products that become unsafe to eat quite quickly even though they may look fine




6 use renewable energy


renewable energy has never been more accessible




install rooftop 
solar panels
 or even a small wind turbine depending on where you live and local restrictions


replace your standard boiler with a 
biomass boiler



if you live near a stream or river you could even look into 
hydro power



choose a 
green energy supplier
 prices may not be quite as competitive as a standard supplier but they are beginning to come down




more info on this can be found here




what are the 5 types of renewable energy


top 5 reasons to use renewable energy


who supplies green energy in the uk




7 switch off appliances when not in use


did you know that 
electricity still runs inside an appliance while its switched off if its left plugged into a live wall socket


according to 
the energy saving trust
 we could also save ourselves around 80 per year on our electricity bills if we didnt leave items on standby


the main culprit for wasting energy in our homes whilst on standby is the television which is on standby for an average of 11 hours per day costing 238million annually wow


after that computers tablets mobile phones settop boxes and consoles waste the most energy on standby as well as saving money and energy its worth remembering to switch off a computer as its lifetime is dependant on how much its in use just dont unplug your sky box if its set to series link


make sure you and the rest of your family dont leave lights blazing in rooms youre not even in and install some 
led light bulbs
 which not only use less electricity but last longer reducing the need to recycle them 


8 have your food shop delivered or walk to the shop


most supermarkets offer a delivery service these days its a great option not only does it save you time and money because theres less browsing but one van delivering to 10 houses is much more environmentally friendly than 10 cars driving to a supermarket 


in april 2019 
sainsburys began making deliveries
 in some electric vans its highly likely others will follow 


walking to the shops is obviously a great idea if you can the exercise and fresh air is good for you and chances are youll buy less if you have to carry it home therefore less waste


waitrose is beginning to offer customers the chance to refill reusable containers in some of its stores in a new initiative  
waitrose unpacked
  


zero waste shops
 are beginning to crop up all over the country the advantage of these is threefold if not more




you buy only as much of a product as you need therefore reducing waste


there is no singleuse packaging and no plastic carrier bags


the products stocked tend to be conscientiously sourced  fairtrade items nontoxic cleaning products nut butters ground in store etc




9 consider an electric vehicle


electric cars
 are quiet clean relaxing to drive and inexpensive to run


more and more manufacturers are introducing electric vehicles and although they may be more expensive now prices will come down and you will save on fuel and road tax


factor in 
zappi
 our innovative sustainable renewable energy car charger and youll be seriously reducing your carbon footprint and bills in no time

uks top 6 electric vehicles


10 fly less


there are plenty of ways to travel that dont involve flying and plenty of places to visit that dont require an aeroplane to get you there 


why not try and take a year off flying and visit some of the incredible sights the uk has to offer or take a boat or train to the continent


if you have to fly and many people do for work family occasions etc then you could look into 
carbon offsetting
 the idea is that the amount of co2 generated by your particular trip is reduced somewhere else 


this may be via a forestry project reducing trees cut down or planting new ones or by reducing fossil fuels by investing in renewable energy elsewhere 


carbonoffsetting is a little controversial and seemingly loved by celebrities 


some carbon offsetting companies appear to be in the business to make a profit rather than helping the planet and the idea that you can pay to ease the guilt rather than change your habitslifestyle are factors that need to be overcome before it will be perceived as a universally viable idea but the intention is there and every little helps


2020 is your year to shine


make 2020 the year you give serious consideration to helping the environment we all share and lets band together to leave our home in the best condition possible for the next generation
