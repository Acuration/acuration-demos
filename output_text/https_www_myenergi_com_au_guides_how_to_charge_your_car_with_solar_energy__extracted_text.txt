how to charge your car with solar energy
 


 












one of the most common questions that drivers have is whether they can charge their cars using solar energy as these vehicles become increasingly more common on our roads many homeowners are adding charging points to their properties however with energy costs rising substantially it is becoming increasingly more expensive to charge these vehicles using traditional energy sources


so if you are wondering how to charge your car with solar energy we have explored the topic further














 






what is solar energy


before we look at how to charge your car with solar energy we thought it was first important to understand exactly what it is for many people when we talk about solar energy the first thing that comes to mind are large solar panels on the roof of their house


the actual technology though works by converting the energy that the sun emits into usable electricity each panel is made up of hundreds of cells which are made from a semiconductor such as silicone this semiconductor works by absorbing sunlight to create a flow of electrons or a current this current then goes to an inverter which changes it from direct current to usable alternating current
























how to charge your vehicle with solar


that energy can then go directly to your appliances to charge your home to a battery to be stored for later use or back to the grid for a rebate on your bills wondering how to charge your car with solar from there myenergi is here to help you


we are a passionate team striving to make renewable energy more accessible for everyone and zappi our unique solar car charger will help you to unlock the power of the sun as the worlds first solar electric vehicle charger zappi not only operates as a standard 
ev charger
 but it also features a range of optional charging modes that help you to utilise 100 of the energy generated from your solar panels


these chargers are very quick to install and the intuitive design ensures that it is highly userfriendly when paired with our myenergi app users can unlock a wide range of features such as monitoring the current status scheduling timers to use the most economical tariffs and even a boost function
















what are the benefits of charging your car with solar



now you know how to charge your car with solar what are the benefits of doing so




















lower your carbon footprint


one of the biggest benefits of charging your car with solar energy is that it helps you to lower your carbon footprint even further the use of evs reduces your need to use fossil fuels and by being able to utilise renewable sources such as the sun lowers this even further










save money


using solar power to charge your electric vehicle not only helps you to lower your carbon footprint even further but it can also save you money with energy costs continuing to spiral charging your electric vehicle using the national grid is becoming increasingly more expensive










flexible


the ability to charge your vehicle with solar energy also gives you greater flexibility you will be able to harness the energy of the sun even on cloudy and rainy days however should you not be able to generate enough power then you will be able to utilise the national grid as normal










improve property value


finally another major benefit of incorporating solar power into your home is that it can help you to improve the overall value of your property as renewable energy becomes more common and the production of petrol and diesel vehicles stops then the ability to sustainably charge your ev from home will become a major attraction
