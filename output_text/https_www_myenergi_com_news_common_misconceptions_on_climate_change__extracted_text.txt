climate change facts  common misconceptions
 


 








 










the world has finally reached a point where climate change is no longer a controversial topic 


we know climate change needs to be acted upon much quicker than ever before and complete denial of global warmings existence is rare 


that said there is still confusion surrounding what climate change actually is so were here to help separate the fiction from fact lets dive in with five of the most climate change facts and common misconceptions


1 climate change is nothing new  the earths climate has always changed


when we talk about climate change today we mean manmade or 
anthropogenic
 climate change its true that over the last 4 billion years the climate has changed a lot but what we are concerned with now is the effect that humans are having on the planet by burning coal oil and gas to produce energy to fuel our homes and cars and cutting down trees to produce the food we eat


there have always been cycles of warming and cooling but in the past these have taken thousands of years currently were seeing the same changes happen over the space of just a few decades


rising levels of 
carbon dioxide
 in the atmosphere correspond with the earths temperature rising so much so that 
17 of the 18 warmest years on record have all taken place since 2001


as the temperature rises the sea ice also begins to melt and the sea level rises the worlds oceans have actually  risen by 27cm in the last 20 years


2 plants need carbon dioxide so surely the more we produce the better 


carbon dioxide itself isnt actually bad theres just too much of it on earth yes plants and forests do need carbon dioxide to survive and they do a great job of absorbing and storing vast quantities of it however we are producing more year on year since the 
industrial revolution
 whilst destroying vast swathes of forest in order to produce food  


the result of this drastic change is that the carbon dioxide has nowhere to go and traps the heat trying to leave the earths surface


3 animals will adapt to survive the changing conditions


it is true that animals and plants are masters at adapting to changes in their environment although in the past they have been able to adapt over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now they need to change quickly which will be too much of a challenge for many species


 


if they cant adapt then they must move but their 
habitats
 are increasingly being destroyed in order to grow food or build roads and houses meaning the majority of animals have fewer places to go


polar bear populations for instance are predicted to decline by 30 in the next 30 years this is because they need the sea ice to get to land in the autumn and to feed their young in the spring but its forming later and melting earlier each year  they cant adapt to changes as dramatic as this in the space of a generation and they have nowhere to move to




4 renewable energy is a licence to print money


this may come as a surprise but generating electricity using 
renewable energy
 from solar panels and onshore wind farms is actually far cheaper than producing energy using fossil fuels or gas


yet the eu hands over 10 billion a year to the uk as a subsidy to support our use of fossil fuels why when the alternative is cheaper and cleaner


5 we dont need to worry about climate change yet


we cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and leave the next generation to sort out the problem 


the problem is happening now 


leading climate scientists have warned that we only have 12 years to limit global warming to a maximum of 15c and avoid complete climate breakdown


final words about climate change facts


the climate change that is being caused by us at this moment is a huge environmental crisis and we must do all that we can to stop it and try to heal the damage we have already caused


climate change is causing disease migration and poverty across our entire planet the home that we depend upon and that we must ensure our childrens children are able to depend upon too
