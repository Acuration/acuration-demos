benefits of an energy diverter maximising the use of solar power
 


 












harnessing solar power has become a popular choice for many households and businesses in 2023 one essential component that maximises the utilisation of solar energy is an energy diverter in this article we will explore the benefits of an energy diverter and how it optimises the consumption of solar power






















what does an energy diverter do


at its core an 
energy diverter
 captures excess energy generated by a home renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic pv wind or hydro systems and redirects it for local consumption instead of exporting it back to the grid the most common use of an energy diverter is for water heating although it can also be utilised for space heating and battery charging
















why have an energy diverter


the decision to install an energy diverter depends on various factors including local regulations and the price difference between imported and exported energy in ireland for example the feedin tariff fit scheme incentivised the utilisation of selfgenerated electricity instead of exporting it back to the grid although the fit scheme closed to new applications in 2019 existing participants will continue to receive the tariff payments for the agreedupon term moreover the smart export guarantee seg was introduced in 2020 to replace the fit scheme in locations where exporting electricity is forbidden or where tariff rates for imported and exported energy are the same having an energy diverter becomes crucial to optimise onsite energy usage

how does an energy diverter work


an energy diverter operates by measuring the net energy flow at the grid connection point and controlling a load typically a water heater to maintain a balance where energy is neither imported nor exported the control methods used by energy diverters include burst mode phase control and pulse width modulation these methods involve switching the power to the load on and off at different rates with burst mode being a popular choice among amateur constructors due to its simplicity and costeffectiveness
















the benefits of an energy diverter


one of the significant benefits of an energy diverter is the maximisation of selfconsumption of solar energy instead of allowing excess solar energy to be wasted or exported back to the grid at a lower price an energy diverter diverts the surplus energy to auxiliary devices or systems within the premises by prioritising the consumption of solar energy homeowners and businesses can reduce their dependency on grid electricity and make the most of their selfgenerated power


















reduced dependency on grid electricity


by utilising an energy diverter property owners can significantly reduce their reliance on grid electricity excess solar energy that would otherwise be wasted or sold at a lower price can be redirected to power various loads such as electric water heaters or immersion heaters this allows for efficient use of solar power to meet the energy demands of the property leading to decreased dependence on conventional electric heating methods and resulting in energy cost savings










financial savings


the financial benefits of using an energy diverter are twofold firstly by consuming a higher proportion of selfgenerated solar energy homeowners and businesses can minimise their electricity bills by reducing the amount of grid electricity they need to purchase secondly through the optimization of onsite energy usage the overall efficiency of the solar power installation is enhanced resulting in longterm financial savings










increased efficiency of solar power installation


integrating an energy diverter into a solar power system increases the overall efficiency of the installation by diverting excess solar energy to designated loads instead of exporting it back to the grid homeowners and businesses can maximise the utilisation of their selfgenerated power this increased selfconsumption contributes to a more sustainable and ecofriendly approach to energy consumption reducing the carbon footprint associated with traditional grid electricity


























maximise selfconsumption


in conclusion an energy diverter plays a crucial role in optimising the utilisation of solar power by capturing and redirecting excess energy for local consumption it maximises selfconsumption reduces dependency on grid electricity and leads to financial savings additionally it enhances the overall efficiency of solar power installations promoting a greener and more sustainable energy ecosystem
















frequently asked questions


















are there any specific regulations regarding the use of energy diverters


 
																							regulations may vary depending on the location some places have restrictions on exporting electricity making it crucial to maximize onsite energy consumption its advisable to consult local regulations and seek professional advice												

										






can an energy diverter be used for purposes other than water heating




yes energy diverters can be used for various applications including space heating and battery charging








how does an energy diverter benefit homeowners and businesses




an energy diverter benefits homeowners and businesses by maximising the use of selfgenerated solar energy reducing reliance on grid electricity and resulting in financial savings
