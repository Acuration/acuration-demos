the harvi renewable energy harvesting device
 


 








 










picture this youve just installed a system that will enable you to self consume energy and reduce your carbon footprint what next measuring how much energy and money you are saving of course


how do you keep track of the energy your sustainable products and renewable sources is saving we hear you ask say hello to 
harvi
 the perfect device for measuring the effectiveness of your amazing efforts towards saving the planet


what is harvi


used in conjunction with 
zappi
 and 
eddi
 harvi is an energy harvesting wireless sensor that measures your power output using a current transformer ct


harvi covers all bases as it is able to measure power youve generated yourself and from the grid therefore demonstrating the huge savings you make after installing our smart 
sustainable green products



jordan brompton our cofounder and sales director says harvi is the reason why all of our products work so well together nobody on the market does what we do in the sense of looking after the whole homes energy


how does harvi work


by harvesting the power from a sensor clipped between your electricity meter and consumer unit harvi transmits the import and export information to the load controlling devices without the need for batteries or wiring


how is harvi able to operate without batteries or electrical wiring this clever device is powered purely through the energy harvested from the ct which is used to transmit the measurements to the 
zappi
 andor 
eddi



harvi can transmit a signal to your products to show what direction the energy is going in and how much youre using purely from the force field created around the cable says jordan it then harvests that energy to power itself


measurements from harvi are extremely fast and accurate and our wireless power sensor is configurable for the grid generation and storage management this flexibility enables you to get a complete overview of your power consumption in terms of




how much youre saving


how much youre using and


where youre using your power




all without the hassle of changing batteries


harvis compatibility with other myenergi products


if someone has 
solar panels
 and an eddi zappi and harvi installed theyre able to control the flow so that they can split the surface energy between the hot water and the car charging says jordan


if youve got a battery in your home or any thirdparty batteries like a 
tesla
 or solarwatt we can control the energy so that it goes to the battery first then to our products youll then be able to see what the battery is doing on our app


when used in unison something that is made extremely easy thanks to their compatibility and efficiency our sustainable green products give you full control over your home to show you the flow of energy

in addition to increased accuracy and transparency when it comes to your 
carbon footprint
 there are many benefits to installing harvi especially if you are already using an eddi andor zappi


harvi allows so much flexibility and practicality regarding the installation of the products and it can be stored in a convenient easily accessible place thanks to its wall mountability


if you want to track various energy devices across a large space youll be pleased to know that multiple harvi devices can be used simultaneously on a site too
