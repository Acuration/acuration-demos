what is the difference between tethered and untethered ev chargers
 


 












as an electric vehicle ev owner or potential owner in ireland youll probably be considering home charging solutions to enhance your convenience with several options to choose from its essential to grasp the distinctions between tethered and untethered chargers so you can decide which one is best suited to your needs at myenergi were dedicated to offering you a comprehensive guide tailored for the irish market ensuring you make an informed decision about the perfect home ev charger for you


tethered vs untethered chargers the key difference


the primary distinction between a tethered ev charger and untethered ev charger lies in the charging cable tethered chargers feature a permanently attached cable while untethered chargers offer a detachable one


explore an ev charger for you






















is a tethered ev charger more expensive than untethered


when evaluating the costs of tethered and untethered ev chargers in the irish market its important to note that tethered chargers generally have a higher upfront cost since the cable is included in the price on the other hand untethered chargers are initially less expensive but you may need to buy a charging cable separately which could reduce the price difference however its worth mentioning that the zappi a specific model is priced the same regardless of whether it is tethered or untethered this makes the zappi an ideal solution for both scenarios ensuring flexibility and convenience for irish ev owners


is a tethered ev charger more secure


tethered chargers provide enhanced security compared to untethered chargers in the irish market thanks to their permanently attached cable which prevents theft on the other hand untethered chargers with detachable cables are more susceptible to theft however many models offer additional security features such as pin protection or cable locking to mitigate this risk to ensure the safety of the cable it is advisable to disconnect and store it out of sight when it is not in use this precaution helps to safeguard your charging equipment and prevents unauthorized access or theft




















what is a tethered ev charger


tethered chargers have gained popularity among ev owners in ireland primarily due to their convenience with a tethered charger you can easily unwind the cable from the charging unit and plug it directly into your vehicles charging port similar to using a petrol or diesel pump the charging cable is included as part of the units overall cost eliminating the need for a separate purchase


while the convenience factor often influences ev owners to opt for tethered chargers its important to be aware of their limitations one limitation is the fixed cable length which may restrict charging flexibility depending on the location of the charging unit and the position of your vehicle additionally compatibility issues may arise if your vehicle requires a different connector type such as type 1 or type 2 than what is provided by the tethered charger its essential to ensure compatibility between the charger and your vehicle to avoid any compatibilityrelated challenges










what are the pros of a tethered ev charger




charging cable included in the units price


convenient charging process


reduced risk of cable theft




what are the cons of a tethered ev charger




limited cable length provided by the manufacturer


restricted to either type 1 or type 2 charging connections so if you change your car in the future you would need to ensure you still buy the same type or purchase a new charger




















what is an untethered ev charger


untethered chargers featuring detachable cables provide a greater level of flexibility for ev owners in ireland they allow you to use either your own charging cable or the one that comes with your electric vehicle this flexibility enables you to take the cable with you for public charging or accommodate guests who need to charge their evs at your home


despite their flexibility untethered chargers are generally considered less convenient compared to tethered chargers as they require you to connect and disconnect the cable each time you charge however they offer the advantage of being more futureproof if you need a longer cable or a different connector type in the future you can simply replace the cable without having to purchase an entirely new charging unit


moreover untethered chargers can contribute to a neater aesthetic as the detachable cable can be disconnected and stored out of sight when not in use this helps maintain a tidier appearance in your charging area while keeping the cable protected and easily accessible when needed


















what are the benefits of an untethered ev charger




easily replaceable charging cable


tidier appearance when not in use


greater flexibility for charging on the go












what are the drawbacks of an untethered charger




charging cable often sold separately


less convenient than tethered chargers


potential need for regular cleaning and secure storage




















 






both tethered and untethered chargers have their pros and cons so carefully consider your specific needs and usage patterns before making a decision replacing a charger can be expensive so gather as much information as possible to make an informed choice


tethered units are generally more convenient for home charging while untethered units offer increased flexibility with their detachable cables usable both at home and on public chargers


ultimately the best charger for you depends on your individual preferences requirements and charging habits take the time to evaluate both options to find the ideal home ev charging solution for your lifestyle
