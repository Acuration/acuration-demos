is the zappi compatible with the tesla
 


 












what are my options for a tesla home charger


so the big question is the zappi compatible with the tesla yes it is but to give you all the information you need to make your decision lets look at the facts


when it comes to choosing a tesla home charger there are numerous options available to you however depending on your requirements and usage some are better than others


Â 














 






can i use a normal outlet to charge my tesla at home


yes you can charge your 
tesla
 using a normal power outlet at your home but should you


one issue with this is unless you have a garage it will mean trailing wires from your indoor power source through windows or doors


another thing which you might not have considered is that the standard charging outlet provided with all teslas has no connectivity theres no smartphone app no charge range control and isnt solar aware this means that you wont be getting the best rate of charge for your ev


plus the time it will take to charge your tesla at home would be much longer than if you had a dedicated tesla home charger
















 






how long will it take to charge my tesla from the outlet


simply plugging your tesla regardless of the model into your outlet could take upwards of 24 hours to reach full charge


this is due to the lower voltage of power through your home outlets and you cant control how fast or slow the charge takes
















can zappi be my new tesla home charger


the 
zappi
 has been designed to make home charging more efficient and costsaving with three charging modes available eco eco and fast












eco charging












this mode is a mixture of both green energy and energy imported from the grid this is perfect for charging your tesla with solar panels but if you dont have them it will use energy from the grid when its at the cheapest rate such as overnight














eco plus charging












charge power is continuously adjusted in response to changes in generation or power consumption elsewhere in the home your ev charger will pause if there is too muchimported power continuing only when there is surplus free power available














fast charging












in this mode the vehicle will be charged at maximum power this power can come from a renewable energy source or simply from the grid in this mode your tesla can be fully charged in no time at all
