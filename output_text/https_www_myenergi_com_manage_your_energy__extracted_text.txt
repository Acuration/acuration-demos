minimise carbon and cost maximise convenience


both the zappi 
ev charger
 and eddi energy harvester are designed to be eco smart this means they arent just connected to the internet and to each other but they can make intelligent decisions about when and where to divert your power


this allows you to manage how much power comes into your property from the grid and how much from your self generated power


to manage your energy our eco smart technology considers a number of factors such as carbon cost convenience and the energy tariff you use whilst reducing your energy spend and carbon emissions are of paramount importance we understand that maintaining your current lifestyle has to come first a sustainable future that has a positive impact on the environment and a minimal impact on your day to day life is the ideal
























our devices arent just smart


theyre intelligent


whilst smart devices sound impressive often the term is used to describe the fact that the device can be connected and controlled via the internet whilst that is convenient we need technology that makes intelligent decisions on our behalf about when and where to draw power thats exactly how our eco smart technology operates  it takes the burden of making decisions to allow you to get on with your day


smart  connected


the device can be controlled by a user via the internet


eco smart  adaptive


the device makes intelligent decisions without intervention


























giving you more control


ocpp makes managing your energy even easier


zappi is now ocpp supported as standard this means you can connect an ocpp compatible platform which allows you to control and manage your charging experience when it comes to managing your energy you now have greater visibility and control


control who accesses your 
zappi


whether its friends family or even a neighbour  you can now control who can access your 
zappi
 via individual 5 digit pin codes 


control how they use your zappi 


as each user has a pin code you can also set the default charging mode available to them fast eco eco when they plug in 


keep track of usage


understanding more about how your zappi is used allows you to make better decisions when it comes to managing your energy


























eco smart technology  tariff tracking


our eco smart technology makes intelligent decisions based on the energy tariff you are signed up to allowing it to optimise for drawing energy from the grid at the lowest possible rate per kwh
