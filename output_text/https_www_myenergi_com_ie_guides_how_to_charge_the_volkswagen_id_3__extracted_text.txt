how to charge the volkswagen id 3
 


 












the volkswagen id3 is one of the most popular electric cars on the road in ireland and northern ireland doubling their registrations in 2021 compared to 2020Â  the id3 is a similar size to the vw golf and a more compact version of its big brother the id 4














 






can i charge the volkswagen id 3 at home


the volkswagen id3 uses a type 2 charger which is a typical home ev charger the zappi can be plugged into the id 3 for three levels of charging based on your unique requirements and schedule fast charging will charge your car directly from your own solar panels or from the grid as quickly as possible ecocharging is best used overnight when the costs of electricity are typically lower and offpeak charging will take longer but ensure that you are charged at the lowest cost possible
















what charger does the volkswagen id3 use


all vw electric cars including the id 3 come equipped with a type 1 120volt charger which works well for occasional or emergency use but isnt ideal to be charging your vehicle on the regular using this type of charger can be both costly and could take up to 50 hours to fully charge


typically owners opt for purchasing a type 2 charger the volkswagen id 3 is equipped with a type 2 connector for charging which can be used at home work or public charging points across the uk


how much does it cost to charge the volkswagen id 3


the cost of charging any ev always depends on a number of factors from the type of charger used location and setting used for example rapid charging will typically cost more than eco charging done offpeak however if youre looking to calculate the average cost of charging your volkswagen id 3 at home this is around 1924 from empty to full

charging your id 3 using a rapid public charger will always cost slightly more but is convenient for recharging when pressed for time or parked up for a period the average cost to take the id 3 from 20 charge to 100 is around 2226 on a public charging point


of course we cannot comment for all public electric charging points as privately owned chargers can have their own rates and differences in tariffs


what is the range on the new volkswagen id 3 2021 model


the range on the id 3 is significantly less than its big brother the id 4 which tops at tops 500 kms the range on the vw id 3 is 450 km


where is the charging port on the volkswagen id 3


the location of the charging port on the volkswagen id 3 is important unlike pulling up at a fuel station where you can select the pump based on the fuel cap location if youre looking to install a home ev charger then you will need to be sure this will easily reach the location of your charging port on your electric car the volkswagen id 3 charging point is located on the back of the driver side of the car
















 






how long does it take to charge the volkswagen id 3


the time it takes to charge the volkswagen id 3 is based on a number of different factors from the type of charger used to the location home chargers and public chargers for example charge evs differently due to the kw of power


using a typical 7kw charger at home the charge time is 9 hours and a half hours charging using a 11kw charger however reduces this time down to just 6 hours 15 this is a large contrast to using the 3pin charger which comes with the vehicle on purchase this can take up to 35 hours to charge from 0 to 100


however public charging stations found in car parks and service stations can power your battery using anywhere between 50 to 150kw meaning your charge time can be dramatically reduced in the volkswagen id 3 to between 30 and 60 minutes
