nissan ariya 63kwh charging guide


although the electric car technically predates the petrol engine with experimental prototypes in the 1830s nissan has been pioneering the modern electric car since the release of the nissan leaf in 2010 despite getting a head start even on tesla the nissan ariya wasnt released until 2020 and is only the second allelectric offering in the impressive nissan fleet


with more than a decade between the two models its no wonder that the much anticipated nissan ariya quickly rose in popularity and is one of the most searchedfor evs on the market if youre still not sure if the nissan ariya is your next dream ev check out the answers to some of your mostsearchedfor questions
















 






how to charge the nissan ariya


the nissan ariya like many other evs currently cannot be charged using the tesla supercharger fast charging system however nissan has announced that their 2025 model will be compatible with supercharging


despite not being able to use fast charging at the moment the nissan ariya can still be charged using charging stations in all manner of public car parks you can also install a 
home charger
 such as the zappi for more convenient charging and at a reduced cost if you have solar panels at home you may also want to utilise zappi with these for even cleaner driving






















how long does it take to charge the nissan ariya 63kwh


9 hours








using a standard 
7kwh charger
 such as zappi it would take 11 hours to fully charge your 63kwh battery


 














what is the range of the nissan ariya 63kwh


205 miles






the range of the nissan ariya with the 63wh battery differs between 145 miles and 305 miles depending on your driving conditions and the type of road typically the average range from a full charge will be around 205 miles














how much does it cost to charge the nissan ariya 63kwh


473






it could cost just 473 to charge the nissan ariya 63kwh when fully utilising offpeak charging on an octopus intelligent tariff at 0075pkwh in contrast peak charging on a standard rate of 034pkwh can cost 2142 to charge up




















 






where is the charge port on the nissan ariya


to charge your nissan ariya simply attach your electric charger to the charging port near the front passengerside door and connect it to any appropriate charging source


unlike many car manufacturers nissan supplies a charging cable giving you slow charging from any of your regular home outlets it should be noted that this will take longer than plugging into a designated charging station as the output of power from your home sockets is considerably less
















 






how much is the nissan ariya


starting from a reasonable 33645 for the 63kwh engage the nissan ariya comes in 9 different models including the midrange 87kwh advance priced at 48145 and ranging up to the e4orce 87kwh evolve starting from 59025


with the vast array of optional extras available fully customising your nissan ariya could cost you up to 67405 which is still very reasonable when compared to other electric vehicles such as the tesla model y which offers many similar features for a larger price point


prices correct as of october 2023
















 






how big is the nissan ariya


the nissan ariya is a little larger than the qashqai and is a pretty standard overall size for its category despite the ample passenger room in the ariya more so than the kia evq nissan has chosen to prioritise storage for your gadgets rather than for your luggage


the boot is a little smaller than many of its rivals with a maximum storage capacity of 466 litres one thing to bear in mind is that the fourwheel drive models drop to 408 litres giving you even less space that being said nissan has designed the ariya to not have a transmission tunnel unlike most other electric cars meaning there is a flat floor giving passengers greater leg room
















 






how high is the nissan ariya


measuring 166m tall the nissan ariya will have no trouble fitting under bridges and tunnels although its not as large as some of its rivals such as the hyundai ioniq 5 its still a pretty substantial car


if youre worried about parking this large car dont be there are plenty of cameras to help you park as well as excellent visibility which no doubt had a hand in acquiring the 5star ncap rating of the nissan ariya


however the back view is partially obstructed by some hefty rear screen pillars which may cause you to alter the view you rely on when squeezing into those tight car parking spaces
