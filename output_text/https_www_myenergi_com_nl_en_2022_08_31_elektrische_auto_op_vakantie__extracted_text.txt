taking an electric car on vacation is it possible
 


 








 










is it possible to take an electric car on vacation what about charging and what do i need to consider we would like to give you some tips when going on vacation with an electric car

it is quite possible to go on vacation with an electric car it is a cleaner way of traveling than going on a trip with a fuel car and also much more environmentally friendly than traveling by plane however you will have to make some more preparations for it


what should i consider when taking an electric car on vacation


to be carefree on the road there are a number of points you can check in advance when taking an electric car on vacation




plan your route in advance and see where there are charging stations


check if your charge card works abroad


how much luggage do you take and do you drive with a trailer or caravan




charging points on the go


in the netherlands and belgium there are plenty of charging stations on the road abroad however this can vary it is therefore a good idea to check in advance where you can 
charge
 your car on the road plan your route so that you always have some extra kilometers left before you really need to recharge that way you wont end up with an empty battery unexpectedly

with various apps like chargemap plugsurfing or pump you can easily plan your route based on your car type and destination the apps calculate the most ideal route with sufficient charging points along the way


tip
 check in advance if your destination has charging points at the accommodation or book an extra nights stay at a hotel with charging points to charge your car in between trips


charge card abroad


not all charging cards work abroad before you leave check whether your card can be used at foreign charge stations at some charge points you can also pay with your phone or pay online via a qr code


how much luggage do you take and do you drive with a trailer or caravan


are you going on vacation with an electric car and want to take a caravan or trailer with you then remember that this is not possible with every car not every electric car can be fitted with a tow bar in addition your battery will run down faster when you are travelling heavily loaded take this into account when planning your trip


on winter sports with an electric car


are you going on a 
ski vacation
 and want to travel with an electric car because you will be driving in cold temperatures your battery will drain faster take this into account when planning your trip also dont forget to install winter tires and bring snow chains
