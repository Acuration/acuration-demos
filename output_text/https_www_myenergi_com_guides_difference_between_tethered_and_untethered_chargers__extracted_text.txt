what is the difference between tethered and untethered ev chargers
 


 












as an electric vehicle ev owner or potential owner youll likely be exploring home charging solutions for added convenience with a variety of options available its important to understand the differences between tethered and untethered chargers to determine which one best suits your needs at myenergi were here to provide you with a comprehensive guide to make an informed decision on the ideal home 
ev charger
 for you


tethered vs untethered chargers the key difference


the primary distinction between a tethered ev charger and untethered ev charger lies in the charging cable tethered chargers feature a permanently attached cable while untethered chargers offer a detachable one


explore an ev charger for you






















is a tethered ev charger more expensive than untethered


when weighing the costs of tethered and untethered ev chargers consider that tethered chargers typically cost more upfront as the cable is included in the price untethered chargers are initially cheaper but you may need to purchase a charging cable separately potentially minimising the price difference however the 
zappi
 is the same price regardless of being tethered or untethered making it the perfect solution for both uses


is a tethered ev charger more secure


tethered chargers are more secure than untethered chargers due to their permanently attached cable preventing theft untethered chargers detachable cables are more susceptible to theft but many models feature added security measures such as pin protection or cable locking to keep the cable safe its best to disconnect and store it out of sight when not in use




















what is a tethered ev charger


tethered chargers are popular among ev owners due to their convenience simply unwind the cable from the charging unit and plug it into your vehicles charging port much like using a petrol and diesel pump the charging cable is included in the units overall cost


while the convenience is what sways most ev owners to buy a tethered charger they do have limitations the fixed cable length can restrict charging flexibility and compatibility issues may arise if your vehicle requires a different connector type type 1 or type 2










what are the pros of a tethered ev charger




charging cable included in the units price


convenient charging process


reduced risk of cable theft




what are the cons of a tethered ev charger




limited cable length provided by the manufacturer


restricted to either type 1 or type 2 charging connections so if you change your car in the future you would need to ensure you still buy the same type or purchase a new charger






























tethered vs untethered






























what is an untethered ev charger


untethered chargers with their detachable cables offer greater flexibility they allow you to use your own charging cable or the one that comes with your electric vehicle this means you can take the cable with you for public charging or accommodate guests needing to charge their evs at your home


despite their flexibility untethered chargers are less convenient than tethered chargers as youll need to connect and disconnect the cable each time you charge however they are more futureproof allowing you to replace the cable if you need a longer one or a different connector type without purchasing a new charging unit


aesthetically untethered chargers can also appear tidier as the cable can be disconnected and stored out of sight when not in use










what are the benefits of an untethered ev charger




easily replaceable charging cable


tidier appearance when not in use


greater flexibility for charging on the go




what are the drawbacks of an untethered charger




charging cable often sold separately


less convenient than tethered chargers


potential need for regular cleaning and secure storage




























both tethered and untethered chargers have their pros and cons so carefully consider your specific needs and usage patterns before making a decision replacing a charger can be expensive so gather as much information as possible to make an informed choice


tethered units are generally more convenient for home charging while untethered units offer increased flexibility with their detachable cables usable both at home and on public chargers


ultimately the best charger for you depends on your individual preferences requirements and charging habits take the time to evaluate both options to find the ideal home ev charging solution for your lifestyle
