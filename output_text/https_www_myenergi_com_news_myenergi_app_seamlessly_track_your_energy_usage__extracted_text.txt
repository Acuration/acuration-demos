myenergi app seamlessly track your energy usage
 


 








 










after months of tireless work from our developer team the myenergi app is now being used by renewable energy users across the world


the myenergi mobile app much like every new addition to our 
green product range
 works seamlessly and extremely effectively with each of our efficient innovative energysaving devices


discover the perks and capabilities of the myenergi app now available on android and the apple app store in our goto guide


what can the myenergi app do


we have created the myenergi app to offer our users an even more seamless experience when saving energy and money on bills with our products


after installing the app on your mobile device users will be able to track how much energy they are using and saving through selfconsuming their own energy via 
zappi
 our ecosmart electric vehicle charger and 
eddi
 our microgeneration energy diverter 


how does it work with other myenergi products


the ability to track your green energy usage through the myenergi app is made possible through our hub device


what does the myenergi hub do you ask well hub monitors the flow of energy from your renewable resources solar panels and wind turbines for instance as well as the grid calculating how much energy you are both using and saving


users of the app are also able to control their smart devices such as zappi and eddi remotely


together with the hub the myenergi app is the onestop shop that underlines the amazing savings and positive impact on the environment that your renewable energy and sustainability efforts are creating


what do users say


on the google play store the myenergi app currently has a 48star out of 5 rating heres what some of our users have to say after downloading it


gordon smith says it has taken a while to get here but it looks to have been worth the wait simple but comprehensible graphics and how great it is to be able to control zappi irrespective of the weather well done myenergi team


meanwhile niall otoole also rewarded it with 5 stars stating great simple app that works and tom blincoe says app works perfectly very clean and neat design


elsewhere on the apple app store the 
myenergi app
 has earned a 38star rating with users describing it as a nice app that responds very quickly to power flux and works beautifully


how do i get the myenergi app


download the app via the google play android store


download the app via the app store apple


how do i use the myenergi app


once youve downloaded the app youll need to add the location of your myenergi devices only registered sites your home place of work etc are able to do this


unsure whether your site is registered dont worry simply check the colourcoded led state of your myenergi hub device




red  this means that your device is not yet connected to your router you will need to connect to your router and pair with your other myenergi devices eddi andor zappi in order to register


blue  if the led is blue its telling you that your site is connected to the router but not yet registered you can register your site via the simple stepbystep process that greets you once you open the myenergi app


green  congrats your site is already registered simply click the connect to a site that is already registered on the app and youll be well on your way
