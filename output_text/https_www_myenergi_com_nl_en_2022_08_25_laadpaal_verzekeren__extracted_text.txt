when you have a charging station installed at your home you obviously dont want anything to happen to it its good to look at your insurance and what is and isnt covered is it necessary to insure a charge post well be happy to tell you more about it


what should i look for when insuring a charging station


first of all it is good to know whether damage to your charge point is already covered by one of your existing insurance policies check your policy or contact your insurer it is also good to know how much coverage is available and whether it is sufficient if necessary you can still increase the coverage whether your charge point is insured or not also depends on the type of home you live in we explain it further below




insuring a charging station with a house


do you have a house to buy then you are often required by your mortgage provider to take out building insurance this insurance compensates for damage to all items that are permanently connected to your home and the surrounding land this means that a fixed charge point is also insured it is advisable to inform your insurer that you have had a new charge point installed you can also check in your policy whether your coverage is sufficient


charging station at an apartment


do you live in a condominium and have a charging station installed on the property it is often not necessary to insure your charge post separately it is often included in the home contents insurance policy under the policy covering owners interest in the case of an owneroccupied apartment the owners association often provides buildings insurance the coverage may not be sufficient for additional items that you have installed with the owners interest policy you have additional coverage on your home contents insurance you can find out how much coverage this is by asking your insurer it is a good idea to let your insurer know that you have had a charge point installed
