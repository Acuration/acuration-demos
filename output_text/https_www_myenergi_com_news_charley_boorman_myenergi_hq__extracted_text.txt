tv adventurer charley boorman sets off on a green journey with 
myenergi 


picture this sunshine a gentle autumn breeze rolling golden fields narrow winding roads and the sound of silence


yes it was none other than charley boorman on his electric harley davidson livewire


here at myenergi we pride ourselves on innovating some of the most intelligent and advanced greentechnology on the market our vision and ideas paired with a conscious shift into sustainable living are helping to guide the industry forward our passion for creating a better future for both people and our planet has lead us to cross paths with tv adventurer and motorbike enthusiast charley boorman


charley travelling to binbrook


 


charley best known for cohosting the adventurepacked long way tv shows with fellow actor and friend ewan mcgregor has recently had installed our multiaward winning product the 
zappi
 the smart electric vehicle charger is now situated comfortably in charleys eco home in london


with an electric harley davidson being the latest edition to his bike collection zappi makes sure the 
livewire
 
is ready to ride on any adventure charley wanted to demonstrate his interest in electric vehicles and ecosmart products by filming a minidocumentary for 
youtube
 he hopes sharing his experiences will help influence others to follow a similar path in moving towards a greener way of living he has just returned from his latest global adventure through south and central america up to los angeles on his electric motorbike for his new tv show the long way up




this experience of riding purely on electricity has been pretty transformative for me and so i have decided to 
team up with 
myenergi 
who innovate and manufacture revolutionary green energy products 
i am going on 
a green journey with them to gradually transfer my own home and vehicles to using cleaner and greener energy




says boorman

charleys values passion and adventurous spirit are very similar to our ambitions at myenergi so we hope he is going to be impressed by our products we love the idea that a zappi will be powering his bike or family electric car after his epic electric adventure we feel were the perfect fit to help him on his personal journey to an ecolifestyle


says myenergi cofounder jordan brompton


charley traveled north at the end of september 2020 to meet with the myenergi family each department was excited to give him a sneak peak at where all the magic happens in this short film you too will get a glimpse into how our products are manufactured from start to finish in the uk zappi eddi harvi and hub are enabling homeowners businesses to manage renewable energy generation storage and consumption costs efficiently


charleys values passion and adventurous spirit are very similar to our ambitions at myenergi so we hope he is going to be impressed by our products we love the idea that a zappi will be powering his new bike after his epic electric adventure we feel were the perfect fit to help him on his personal journey to an ecolifestyle 


says myenergi cofounder jordan brompton


charley at the myenergi warehouse


 



there is so much enthusiasm right now around renewable energy and the opportunities we all have to create healthier more sustainable lifestyles it is great to see the myenergi team at the forefront of new developments and ideas and take a leading role in these exciting times 


says brompton


as more people are taking the electric vehicle industry more seriously the uk government have announced plans to ban sales of new petrol diesel or hybrid cars this will be brought forward from what was initialy to be 2040 to 2035 the change comes after experts said 2040 would be too late if the uk wants to achieve its decarbonising target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050


much of the ev industry is focusing solely on electric cars but with that being said influencers such as charley are keeping motorbikes on the map we never thought we would see the day harley davidson brought out a quiet bike though 2020 has been full of surprises
