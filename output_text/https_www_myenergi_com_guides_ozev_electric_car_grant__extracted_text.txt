2022 ozev update


from 
1st april 2022
 the government ozev grant known as the electric vehicle homecharge scheme evhs will no longer be open to homeowners including people with mortgages who live in singleunit properties such as bungalows and detached semidetached or terraced housing installations in singleunit properties need to be completed by 
31 march 2022
 and a claim submitted to the driver and vehicle licensing agency dvla by 
30 april 2022



the scheme will remain open to




homeowners who live in flats


occupiers of rental accommodation


landlords




the scheme is also transitioning to a new online service which is not yet available  more details to follow
















what is ozev


ozev stands for the 
office
 for 
zeroemission vehicles
 ozev ozev replaced olev which stands for 
office
 for 
low emission vehicles


boris johnson recently announced the ban on the sales of fossil fuel vehicles in the uk from the date 2030 this prompted the government to tweak the name of the department responsible for supporting the roll out of ev charging infrastructure from olev to ozev a switch in terminology from low emissions to zero emissions which is more in keeping with net zero carbon ambitions


ozev are a team of government officials whom are supporting the transition from fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles ozev will be responsible for though not limited to research and development within the ev sector and providing grants and funding to support ev charging infrastructure across the uk


the ozev team are a part of the department for transport and the department for business energy  industrial strategy






















ozev electric car grant scheme


with the ozev grant previously olev scheme you can claim back from the government up to 350 off your product and installation


the ev homecharge scheme has been in place for over a decade 2010 with the workplace charging scheme not long behind since 2016 the office for zero emission vehicles ozev have reduced the grant since its original starting level of 1000 the ev homecharge scheme grant has decreased by more than half and will continue to drop the same holds true for the workplace charging scheme


there are many benefits to using the ozev grant scheme the grants allows you to charge domestic vehicles company cars or fleet vehicles this helps to shrink your carbon footprint save on fuel and reduce vehicle maintenance costs




















ozev grant eligibility checklist


1 own an ev or are planning on purchasing an electric vehicle within 4 months of the application


2 you must have offstreet parking such as a driveway


3 the charger model must be ozev approved such as the myenergi zappi


4 the charger must be smart enabled requires an internet connection










5 your chosen installer must be an ozev approved installer find ozev approved installers


6 grants can be applied for 4 months prior to the charger installation or ev registration


7 you can apply for two ev charge points per household if at least two evs are registered to that address


8 an extra 300 is available in scotland through the energy saving trust




















how to apply for an ozev grant


the first thing to bear in mind is the ozev grant evhs must be applied for on behalf of yourself by an ozev approved installer it is a common misconception where customers believe they can claim the grant directly from the government


the grant is not passed to the customer as a monetary transaction ie you will not receive 350 in your bank account instead the 350 is deducted from the price of the installation  charger and reclaimed from the government by the ozev approved installer






it is completely up to you in which order you proceed for example you may prefer to purchase the charger first and then get a number of quotes from our approved installer network or the installer can complete the whole process on your behalf including the recommendation and purchase of the charger


myenergi gives the customer complete control of their installation journey and this allows the customer to pursue and receive the best possible prices for the installation whist giving all approved installers a level playing field for which to quote
















 






what is an electric car grant


there are many different government grants available to support drive and encourage the transition from petrol and diesel vehicles over to plugin electric vehicles

electric vehicles dont release carbon and dangerous gasses into the atmosphere and therefore are much better for the environment governments worldwide are driving the notion towards a netzero carbon target in an attempt to slow the pace of global warming amongst many other major benefits which include increasing the uks ev manufacturing and design sectors to create new skills and jobs and creating cleaner air in our towns and cities thus improving our overall health
















government support for electric cars


therefore the government wants you to consider switching to electric vehicles as soon as possible and is willing to support you through the process financially those who adopt early are usually able to take advantage of the greater financial savings a government electric car grant such as these tend to come down as knowledge and infrastructure progress  for example the olev electric car grant scheme which is designed to support the purchase and installation of an electric charger was lowered from 1000 to 500 in 2018 and then most recently lowered to 350 which is still a saving worth taking advantage of whilst it is still available
