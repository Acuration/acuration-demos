a growing opportunity


since myenergi launched in 2016 we have seen the demand for our products increase the electric vehicle ev market is growing year after year and increasing public awareness of the climate crisis means that renewable energy and evs will become the standard around the world the ability to promote and install 
ev
  renewable technology gives our installers an advantage in the market as many electricians are not yet familiar with the technology and its capabilities


























keeping it simple for everyone


we know that the acceptance of any new technology depends on simplicity and ease of use  its about convenience not compromise therefore when designing our products we not only think about how end users will interact with our technology but we also make sure that everything is optimized for ease of installation


the easier our products are to install and use the more likely they are to be adopted by users and installers alike and the further we are toward a sustainable future






























 




free training


although our technology and interfaces are designed for simplicity we know that electric vehicles and renewable energy technology can be something unfamiliar thats why we offer all our installers free comprehensive training and access to technical support directly from our benelux headquarters in maastricht










 




full technical support directly from our headquarters


when working with installers promoting myenergi products we recognize the importance of protecting their name and reputation by providing worldclass customer service thats why we have a dedicated team of technical specialists ready for installation service and any other questions that may arise as well as a full suite of online resources to ensure that every myenergi customer gets the most out of their device and feels supported on their ev journey
