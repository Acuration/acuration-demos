please be aware that our installer schemes inc authorised subcontractor are not designed for continuous lead generation  


 


the product champion scheme is designed to provide highquality skilled passionate and trusted thirdparty installers with the tools and visibility they need to effectively outperform any competition from nonaffiliated installers who have not undergone myenergi training and that dont actively advocate our products 
if you are interested in becoming an authorised subcontractor and serve as an extension of our internal resource as and when service demand fluctuates 
the process now involves an internal selection method 
associated with our product champion scheme opposed to application therefore the first steps are to ensure you access all the available free training and then participate in the product champion scheme very occasionally we will open application windows for subcontractors where we deem it necessary
