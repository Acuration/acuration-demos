leading the charge in ireland  the new market leader
 


 








 










we are delighted to announce that 
myenergiie
 is now the market leader in ireland for home ev charging


zappi our innovative electric vehicle power outlet is leading the charge in ireland while eddi is following close behind as the diverter of choice for the irish installer 


how are we leading the charge












achievements such as this dont happen overnight and we could not have done it without our amazing distributor 
bhc distributors
 our green team at myenergi hq and our fantastic products


irelands electric vehicle and solar pv sales were just getting going when our products were introduced to the market this gave bhc distributors the perfect opportunity to show suppliers our groundbreaking products just as renewables were becoming increasingly popular in the country


recent research from 
cornwall insight
 has found that the average range of electric cars available on the uk market exceeds 200 miles in light of their increased availability and capability more people are open to purchasing an ev and are therefore likely to invest in the impressive products that make owning one so seamless and efficient


myenergi award success


zappi was entered into the 2017 
seai energy show awards
 and 
won the product of the future category
 while also appearing at exhibitions and energy shows across the uk


our continued presence at awards and shows has opened the eyes of many people to our sustainable energysaving products in the uk ireland and europe if youd like to discover more about our journey check out the 
myenergi story



our suppliers  installers


our 
green products
 are reliable effective and save people money but ultimately a great deal of our success in ireland as well as northern ireland and the rest of the uk  europe stems from the suppliers and 
installers
 who love 
zappi
 
eddi
 and 
harvi
 and are so proud to use them


there is a great network of installers in ireland who love the products and continue to purchase from us says pearse mchenry managing director of bhc distributors we are very lucky to work with a great bunch of companies and we hope to continue these relationships in the coming years


we try to work and develop relationships with competent installers who want to sell good quality products we also encourage them to attend training events which we hold jointly with myenergi in ireland


pearses role at bhc is to choose the products we really want to sell and engage with the manufacturers to make that happen


when i heard about myenergi coming to the market with the eddi and zappi i just knew we had to get involved we have developed a wonderful working relationship since that initial phone call


what are irelands favourite myenergi products


zappi
 is the most popular choice at the moment and they go out to installers as fast as they come into stock according to pearse


however pearse says there is another emerging favourite 
eddi
 sales have risen exponentially in the past 6 months as the solar pv market in ireland has started to flourish it is the installers product of choice


why has ireland chosen myenergi


the irish market likes quality and good value for money pearse says on the whole ireland does not just find the cheapest fix but rather the best quality solution


the irish market will research and purchase what has the greatest quality price and longevity that pretty much sums up myenergi so we knew the products would be a success


myenergi ireland


we are thrilled to achieve such great success in ireland and to be a firm favourite among installers over there perhaps our green energy revolution has been blessed with the luck of the irish


its wonderful to see the amazing work of everyone involved with myenergi helping to reduce peoples energy bills and contribute towards saving our planet and we cant wait to continue our success all over the world
