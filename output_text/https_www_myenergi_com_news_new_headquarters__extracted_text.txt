our new 15500 square foot myenergi flagship headquarters
 


 








 










were extremely excited to announce plans for our new 15500 sq ft myenergi flagship headquarters on a brandnew 26 million business park development in lincolnshire


the move will enable us to develop more innovative 
renewable energy products
 and continue manufacturing the groundbreaking devices that have proved so popular among sustainability and green energy enthusiasts around the world


thanks to the uks increased focus on 
renewable energy
 and our fantastic customers we have outgrown our current premises however the new headquarters will significantly increase production manufacturing and the size of the team which has already grown from six to 60 people in just 3 years


were so proud of how far we have come and cannot wait to move into the new premises says jordan brompton our cofounder and sales director


this could not have been achieved without our amazing team and wonderful customers so i would like to thank everyone who has helped us get to where we are


our continued plans for expansion include the release of exciting new green energy products and the construction of a large warehouse on the adjoining site of their new premises on stallingborough business park


dr chris horne our commercial director says this is an exciting development for myenergi as we continue to grow by investing in uk manufacturing and committing to local employment


its been great working with nelc to develop the detailed plans for our new headquarters their team has taken the time to really understand our business and then deliver a building that meets all our requirements we cant wait to move in




the park is part of the recent 42m south humber industrial investment programme shiip which supported by the european regional development fund erdf is set to transform north east lincolnshires industrial fortunes through ecological mitigation creating wetland habitat and enabling new development in the area


im delighted to have myenergi sign on the new site further cementing our credentials as a key part of the energy estuary says cllr john fenty cabinet member at north east lincolnshire council for regeneration and skills 


weve a long way to go to make sure that the business park fulfils its potential but with myenergi having the confidence to choose our area others will follow
