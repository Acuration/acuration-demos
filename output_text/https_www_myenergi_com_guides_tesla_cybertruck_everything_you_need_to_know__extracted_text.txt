tesla cybertruck everything you need to know
 


 












tesla cybertruck


since its november 2019 unveiling the tesla cybertruck has been turning heads and raising the eyebrows of motorists environmentalists and electric vehicle enthusiasts across the globe


with an increasing demand for sustainable alternatives to all aspects of our lives  from shopping bags to how were powering our homes  teslas new model is the latest in a constant flow of new and exciting advancements in the sector


very little generates as much interest and anticipation than a new addition to teslas electric vehicle range not in the least for jordan our myenergi director who has actually preordered a cybertruck herself


from teslas chief designer taking a steel ball to the bulletproof exterior windows and shattering the glass to the tesla cybertrucks capabilities and design follow our guide to learn everything you need to know about the upcoming new model


















what is the tesla cybertruck


the cybertruck is teslas first electric pickup truck hailed as the future of the auto industry tesla ceo elon musk has said that that design is cyberpunk and inspired by the film blade runner but its not just the futuristic exterior that has people talking


what makes cybertruck so impressive


musk has claimed that the cybertruck can withstand the impact of a sledgehammer and a 9mm calibre bullet the entrepreneur  and myenergi hero  also says the electric vehicle has autopilot as standard and that it can go 060mph in 29 seconds as well as tow over 7500lbs


the dramatic specification doesnt stop there the interior of the cybertruck includes




a 17inch display screen in the center


seating for 6 people on two bench seats


a marble effect interior made from sustainable nonpetroleum based resins




how does the tesla cybertruck work


the cybertruck uses selflevelling suspension and some models will have allwheel drive with the option to choose between one two or three engines the electric vehicle also includes onboard power inverters supplying 120 and 240volt electricity and an air compressor allowing for the use of power tools and pneumatic tools


the exterior of the cybertruck is stainless steel sheet metal engineered to be bullet resistant all the vehicles will have the hardware capabilities to become self driving tesla is already accepting preorders with a 7000 full selfdriving option


musk has also said that he would love for the cybertruck to become selfpowered in the future in a tweet he confirmed there will be optional solar panels that could add 15 miles per day


is there anything else like the cybetruck


competitors such as ford and rivian are already rising up to meet the challenge releasing competitors with equally impressive specifications the us bestselling vehicle the ford f150 is starting production on an electric version in 2021


musk has already hit back rising to the challenge on twitter of a proposed tugofwar between the ford and tesla vehicles the video footage of the event shows the cybertruck pulling the ford uphill with ease


the rivian r1t electric pickup is another cybertruck rival that has generated a huge amount of anticipation for its release in late 2020 it has a similarly futuristic design four engines for each wheel and it can estimate how much friction exists between the tires and the surface allowing it to perform a controlled 360 rotation














 






when will the cybertruck be available to buy and how much will it cost


in november 2019 tesla said that cybertruck production was scheduled to start in late 2021 and then expand to offer more models in 2022 all the specifications however are for models being released in the us it is unclear for aspiring uk owners if the model will be the same


prices in the uk start from 31000 for an entrylevel single motor vehicle the dual motor midrange edition will cost 39000 and the trimotor at the top of the spectrum will cost 54000
