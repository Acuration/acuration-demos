how much battery storage do i need
 


 












as we all start to feel the pinch of the rising cost of living crisis its safe to say that trying to find more affordable ways to provide energy to your home is a top priority with that in mind many are now considering home battery storage systems which can store energy for you to use in your home


whether you have solar panels or not a battery storage system is an ideal investment for your home to save you money on your energy bills to find out more information about libbi you can read all about it 
here



meet libbi














 






battery storage without solar panels


many energy providers offer flexible tariffs where the cost of energy is cheaper at offpeak times often referred to as
 timeofusetarrifs
 this might be appealing if you work unconventional shift patterns or for setting your washing machine to spin whilst youre asleep however the majority of us would like to watch tv and make a cup of tea during peak times


this is where a battery storage system like 
libbi
 comes in handy by charging the battery during offpeak times you can then use this stored electricity during peak times to keep your costs down if you work from home this could save you hundreds of euros over the year


by choosing 
libbi
 you can monitor and control your battery storage system using the myenergi app on your smartphone or tablet meaning youre always in control if you choose to make the switch to solar panels in the future libbi can be easily integrated as both a solar battery storage system and a solar inverter saving you more money if you choose to make the switch
















 






battery storage systems with solar panels


when it comes to using battery storage with solar panels that is when youre really going to see the benefit and moneysaving capabilities of 
libbi
 by storing excess solar energy when your panels are generating more than you need libbi can store this meaning you wont need to rely on the grid during the evenings or particularly on rainy days


usually if your solar panels generate more electricity than you need you would send this back to the grid this is great for providing sustainable energy for your neighbours but not so great when you then have to spend more money on electricity during times when your panels arent producing enough utilising a battery storage system will ensure this doesnt happen and you can be confident that your home is utilising as much renewable energy as possible


if you want to find out more about exactly how solar panels work with a solar battery system you can

what is libbi


libbi
 is a modular battery storage system which can work with both solar panels and grid energy as well as wind power generation sources by offering modular options starting at 5kwh libbi can grow with you ensuring you always have the right amount of storage that you need


in the event of a power outage 
libbi
 can provide electricity to a dedicated circuit or socket thats connected to the libbi backup output this means you can still have access to some electricity when the rest of your street is in darkness


although there are many benefits to libbi what makes it stand out from the crowd is how adaptable it is from the modular design to its ability to integrate with a wide range of power sources libbi is the ideal battery storage system for any home

eddi
 to heat your water










grid or green

we will help you to ensure youre getting the most out of libbi possible










simple remote access

how much battery storage will i need


this will depend on a range of different variables including your current energy usage your plans for the future your homes power needs and your budget that being said just one 
libbi
 5kwh battery storage module is enough to allow you to watch tv for 89 continuous hours or provide lighting to an average 3bedroom home for 144 hours


although we dont recommend trying to watch tv for 89 hours straight without a break just think about what else that could mean for your home considering that on average one hour of tv is the same as boiling the kettle 48 times  think of all of the cups of tea libbi could provide you with on a single full charge
