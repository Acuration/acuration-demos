myenergi pushes the button for 2022 nitro rx season
 


 








 










myenergi pioneer of the worlds first ecosmart ev charging device is set to welcome motorsport icon jenson button to the xite energy racing team for this years nitro rx season


the british outfit will compete in group e electric which will see some of the most exciting racing anywhere in the world


debuting at lydden hill in june the series brings together the fastest offroad evs with the wildest tracks in rallycross to create a revolutionary new racing format button will partner team ownerdriver oli bennett with the pair taking to the track in a brace of myenergibranded fc1x allelectric race cars


capable of hitting an impressive 060mph in just 14 seconds the 1070bhp fc1x is truly redefining ev capability boasting the most power of any car in rallycross its perfectly primed to take on the huge jumps of nitro rx and demonstrates the gamechanging potential of electrification


jordan brompton cofounder and cmo of myenergi commented its a privilege to welcome jenson to the xite energy racing fold for this years nitro rx season through our sponsorship of the team were looking to establish a revolutionary new racing format and bring the excitement of offroad ev motorsport to the global stage


over the past 12 months weve built a strong relationship with oli and the xite energy team taking electric racing and our passion for the planet to the masses our two brands go handinhand as innovative forwardthinking businesses looking to drive the future of sustainability


i want to go racing added jenson i love racing i love competing and i want to have fun im looking forward to racing 
nitro rx with xite energy  a team which has great experience of not just rallycross but also racing electric vehicles


rallycross is night and day different to formula 1 and thats why i love it i left f1 after 17 years because i wanted to try something new im all about new challenges im a racing driver not a formula 1 driver so new challenges are what im all about i felt i achieved what i needed to in formula 1 so its nice to try different things


oli bennett ownerdriver at xite energy racing concluded were a british team taking on the world theres no bigger or better driver to represent the team and what the team stands for than jenson were hugely excited about whats to come


as well as the circuit experience he brings one of the things you notice immediately is the level of professionalism you dont become a formula 1 world champion without knowing how to get the best out of the car the engineers the team and everybody around you i feel as an organisation weve already benefitted hugely from having him with us


the xite energy racing powered by myenergi team will begin their test programme with the fc1x in the coming weeks
