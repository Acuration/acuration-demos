how is renewable energy doing in the netherlands

what is the state of renewable energy in the netherlands
 


 








 










cbs
 recently reported that in 2021 33 percent of the total electricity production came from renewable sources that year production increased by 22 percent compared to the previous year a nice development below we explain how renewable energy is distributed in the netherlands


what are the sources of renewable energy in the netherlands


the netherlands is in the european middle range in terms of renewable energy use however this use is on the rise in 2021 our share was 34 percent compared to 26 percent in 2020

production from solar increased by 30 percent from wind by 17 percent and from biomass by 23 percent electricity production from natural gas decreased by 22 percent this decline is partly due to the large increase in the price of gas


what about in europe


in 2019 
34 percent of energy consumption
 came from 
renewable sources
 by 2020 this figure had already risen to 37 per cent two thirds of the total production came from wind and hydroelectricity in addition 14 percent came from the sun 8 percent from biomass and 8 percent from other renewable sources solar energy is the fastest riser in 2008 only 1 percent of the production consisted of solar energy


what is the difference between renewable energy and clean energy


clean energy
 is produced under nonpolluting and harmless conditions most renewable energy is clean but not all clean energy is renewable nuclear and coal power plants that emit less harmful gases can also produce clean energy they do not of course produce renewable energy

renewable energy is renewable and of course recyclable the sources that emit the least harmful gases are wind and solar energy if we look at these two forms of renewable energy in the netherlands we see that there are about 1200 windmills and 15 million households with solar panels of all renewable sources these two sources provide the most energy in the netherlands


why should we choose renewable energy in the netherlands


to combat the effect of 
climate change
 and reduce our co2 emissions renewable energy has become increasingly important in the netherlands all over the world we need to look for more sustainable sources to preserve our earth

generating energy at home has also become increasingly popular in recent years many people see the 
benefits
 such as saving on energy costs reducing your 
carbon footprint
 and contributing to a better climate


what else can we do


the solution is simple the more fossil fuels we replace with renewable energy sources the better it is for our planet to combat climate change we need to use our natural resources as efficiently as possible this can be done by generating energy as sustainably as possible and increasing capacity with green energy products such as 
zappi
 
eddi
 and 
harvi
 this will make us less dependent on the grid and new energy production
