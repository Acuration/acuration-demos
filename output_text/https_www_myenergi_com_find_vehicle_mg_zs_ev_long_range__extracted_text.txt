mg zs ev long range charging guide


as one of britains oldest car manufacturers mg has changed a lot since its conception in the 1930s although their cars are no longer made in britain since their return they have become a familiar sight on british roads


with the growing popularity of electric cars partly due to upcoming government regulations now is the perfect time to make the switch from petrol to electric mg has continued to expand their range of electric vehicles including the mg zs which is designed for the whole family
















 






can i charge the mg zs long range ev at home


yes as with the majority of electric vehicles the mg zs long range can be charged at home with the help of an at 
home charger



a dedicated home ev charger gives you the power to charge your ev in the most economical way combined with an ev charging tariff you can also benefit from reduced rates on your electric for being an ev owner






















how long does it take to charge the mg zs ev long range


9 hours and 45 minutes


 






using a standard 
7kwh charger
 such as zappi it would take 9 hours and 45 minutes to fully charge your 683kwh battery


 














what is the range of the mg zs ev long range


230 miles






the range of the mg zs ev long range battery differs between 160 miles and 345 miles depending on your driving conditions and the type of road typically the average range from a full charge will be around 230 miles














how much does it cost to charge the mg zs ev long range


512






it could cost just 512 to charge the mg zs ev long range when fully utilising offpeak charging on an octopus intelligent tariff at 0075pkwh in contrast peak charging on a standard rate of 034pkwh can cost 2322 to charge up




















 






is mg zs reliable


the mg zs comes with a 7 year 80000 mile warranty which is way above industry standards suggesting that mg are very comfortable with the reliability of their vehicles


the mg zs ev is the perfect family car especially when compared to its petrol counterpart with an ncap safety score of 5 stars thanks to its range of safety equipment installed as standard its miles apart from the 3star rated petrol mg zs which received some poor ratings for infant safety
















 






does mg sv have apple carplay and android auto


yes all mg models come with an entertainment feature which allows apple carplay and android autoas standard one of the good things about mg is that they include many of the higherend features which other manufacturers offer as extras as standard


every model of the mg sv ev comes with mg ismart 360 parking cameras and a 101 touchscreen display as standard the higher end models also come with wireless phone charging and 6 speakers rather than
