are all electric car chargers the same
 


 












over the last few years electric vehicles have become a common sight on our roads as technology continues to advance these cars are becoming more affordable while offering more range and stronger batteries however as the market becomes packed with new manufacturers one question that many drivers have is are all electric car chargers the same


this is a very valid question purchasing an electric vehicle is a big investment and being able to understand the various chargers is crucial to ensuring you can find the right vehicle for you so are all electric car chargers the same we thought we would take a closer look














what are the different types of car charger


there are a variety of different types of 
car charger
 on the market the most common include












type 1 plug


the type 1 electric charger plug is incredibly common around the world this fivepin connector was the original type of charger for the first electric vehicles on the market and it is designed for fast and slow charging on an alternating current ac


a type 1 plug is able to accept a power charge of between 3kw and 7kw and although it is rare to find a compatible public charger all vehicles that come with a type 1 charger will have an adaptor










type 2 plug


while the answer to are all electric car chargers the same is no type 2 chargers are by far the most common in the world in europe all manufacturers of evs now need to fit the sevenpin type 2 plug as standard


just like type 1 these types of charger are suitable for slow and fast charging and can handle up to 22kw this style of charger can also be locked to your car ensuring you can have complete peace of mind that nobody will be able to disconnect it if you are away from the vehicle










combined charging system


the combined charging system or css as it is otherwise known is the most popular connector for direct current dc rapid charging the vast majority of new electric vehicles on the market are fitted with both a type 1 or 2 ac charger and a ccs alternative


the heavyduty and robust twopin plug allows drivers to charge their vehicles at rapid charging stations with these sockets able to accept up to 350kw




























tailored charging for your car


the answer to the question are all electric car chargers the same is no however the vast majority of electric vehicles do carry the same style of charger here at myenergi we know how important electric and hybrid vehicles are to a greener and brighter future


that is why we pride ourselves on delivering innovative green technology that can transform your living and working environments so if you are looking for fast chargers to charge your electric vehicle get in touch with our experienced team to find out more
