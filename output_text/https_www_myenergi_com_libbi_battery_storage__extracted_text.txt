libbi is


a modular battery storage system that adapts to your needs


we created libbi to store your electricity to use it when you need it most it allows you to capture as much surplus solar electricity as possible whilst integrating with your existing myenergi devices


libbi is modular by design each module can store up to 5kwh of electricity so combining 4 of them together would provide up to 20kwh of storage

libbi gives you


ultimate control of how you use your stored energy


libbi isnt just a battery storage system its eco smart this means it makes intelligent decisions about when it provides and stores electricity based on how much energy you use how much you generate with your solar and the electricity tariff you use










control

your surplus self generated electricity decreasing your dependency on the electricity grid

libbi is smart


intelligently connected easy to operate


libbi seamlessly connects to your existing myenergi devices this allows it to make intelligent decisions about when to charge or drain your battery based on your usage your tariff and your self generated electricity it performs 5 core functions












solar charging 












dont give your free and green excess solar generation back to the electricity grid store your electricity through the day and use it during the evening especially during expensive peak periods














grid interactivity












dont have solar make the most of cheaper overnight electricity rates by charging your libbi and utilize this stored energy during peak periods putting money back in your pocket


if youre on a plan that rewards you for exporting to the grid you can now use the energy youve stashed in your libbi this energy might be from your solar panels or if you dont have solar those times when electricity was cheaper














advanced control












you have ultimate control of what you want libbi to do and when you want to do it set priorities in the myenergi app to control the libbi to charge and drain to suit your needs


want to save some space for solar if youve chosen to let your libbi charge from the grid you can now pick how much capacity to use this way you can make space for any solar you expect to get tomorrow

faqs


ask us a question












i dont have solar is this product right for me












if you have a time of use tariff from your electricity provider libbi will optimise charging around cheaper periods and will store it for you to use during more expensive peak times


if youd like to add solar in the future you can do so at any time without needing to purchase a separate solar inverter as the libbi system includes one














will libbi work with my zappi and eddi












absolutely libbi has been developed to work in harmony with our existing products connecting your home battery storage to our energy ecosystem

using the intuitive preferences in our mobile app you can control when libbi will drain to your zappi 
eddi
 and home enabling you to make decisions on how you want to use your stored electricity














what is a time of use tariff












time of use tariffs tou are available from some electricity suppliers on these types of tariff you can benefit from cheaper prices at certain times of the day these times are usually offpeak when there is less demand on the electricity grid














will libbi work with an agile electricity tariff












yes customers who are on an agile tariff for example intelligent octopus can optimise their libbi charging around cheaper price periods


libbi offers customers the option to charge solely from solar pv or from solar and the electricity grid combined meaning you can make the most of selfgenerated electricity whilst also charging using cheaper offpeak tariff prices














how long does it take to install libbi on average












the average battery storage install is typically less than 1 day  if youre having a battery installed with a solar array this can take longer typically up to 2 days depending on the complexity of the work required  for example this timescale doesnt include erecting scaffolding for a new solar array














where can i have libbi installed












the libbi battery storage system and inverter can be installed both indoors and outdoors however the libbi controller must be installed indoors


when installing indoors there needs to be sufficient space around the system to allow for air flow and it cant usually be installed in loft spaces due to the weight or blocking an entry or exit route


our certified installation partners will walk you through the best location for your libbi during their initial survey














what is the largest system size i can purchase












the libbi system is modular by design with this you can create a battery storage system between 5kwh 1 battery up to 20kwh 4 batteries














how do i work out what system size i need to optimise my solar












the size of the libbi system best suited for your home will be worked out by one of our certified installation partners


this calculation is based on the size and electricity requirements of your home plus your existing solar panel system size a typical uk household uses between 8kwh and 10kwh of electricity per day on average


using these factors our installers can ensure you have enough capacity in your libbi to store excess solar electricity you have generated or your cheaper electricity grid energy














i have a wind power generation source will libbi still be compatible












yes libbi surplus electricity generation from independent wind turbines installed in the home when detecting surplus electricity libbi will ensure that this is either stored for future use or used to power your other devices such as zappi and eddi based on your charging preferences


 














im on a 3 phase supply can i still have a libbi












yes libbi can be installed on 1 phase of your 3 phase supply with the potential to install up to 3 1 on each phase alternatively we will be launching a 3 phase version in due course so watch this space














will i still be eligible for my existing feed in tariff fit tariff if i install a libbi












those who are receiving feedintariff payments for the electricity they generate with solar pv will need to inform their fit licensee in most cases the licensee is the electricity supplier who has been contracted to supply electricity to your home a qualified myenergi installer will provide guidance on how to do this


 


 














does libbi provide backup power in the event of a power cut












the libbi battery storage system can be installed with optional blackout backup


this means that in the event of a power outage libbi will provide the electricity its stored to a dedicated circuit or socket thats connected to the libbi backup output
