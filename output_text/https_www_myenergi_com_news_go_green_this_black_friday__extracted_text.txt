go green this black friday
 


 








 










we have a request


with estimates suggesting that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from black friday will this year exceed 429000 metric tonnes of co2e the equivalent of 435 return flights from london to new york we are asking consumers to consider the environment and go green this black friday instead


we are throwing our support behind the alternative green friday movement which has been gathering increasing momentum since its inception asking you to go green this black friday and think twice about the importance of your costcutting purchases and help to prevent unnecessary carbon emissions


rather than offering tempting deals via our website we rampingup plans to unveil a seasonal campaign to celebrate local shopping in addition final preparation is underway to announce the winners of our random zaps of kindness competition which will see ev chargers donated to local heroes and hugely deserving community groups across the uk


myenergis random zaps of kindness campaign


jordan brompton cofounder and cmo at myenergi said every year millions of shoppers head online to grab a black friday bargain according to research firm statista consumers will spend nearly ten billion pounds in just a few days


but while its an important promotional event for retailers consumers should consider the environmental impact of their purchases indeed with many shoppers simply looking to grab a bargain rather than purchasing what they really want or need black friday is quickly becoming the uks most environmentallydamaging online event


instead of adding to the problem we want to go against the grain break the cycle stand up for the planet and inspire change as such were throwing our support behind the green friday movement and encourage consumers to do the same and go green this black friday while noone can singlehandedly change the world its up to all of us to make small changes and ensure theres a planet left for our grandchildren to inherit
