how selfconsumption  renewable energy can help you in winter
 


 








 










feeling the chill this winter but conscious of the effect your electricity and gas usage is having on your carbon footprint and utility bills renewable energy can help you in winter and the selfconsumption of green energy is the perfect environmentally solution


as a planet our reliance on fossil fuels for power has come at a cost to our environment contributing to the evergrowing and increasingly apparent threat of 
global warming



however thanks to modern innovation and 
advanced green technology
 renewable energy consumption is on the rise and selfconsumption systems are becoming more and more popular


find out why 
renewable energy
 and devices such as 
eddi
 
harvi
 and 
zappi
 could be your perfect ally this winter in our goto guide


improve sustainability


selfconsumption
 systems such as our innovative 
eddi device
 let you utilise all the 
renewable energy
 you produce at home ensuring youre entirely selfsufficient and not relying on the national grid


diverting excess energy back into your home provides a more sustainable and affordable way of living


in winter any excess power generated from your 
solar panels
 and 
wind turbines
 can be reused to heat your home rather than left to get diverted back to the grid when youre not using it


reduce carbon footprint and global warming


thanks to 
global warmings impact on the weather
 winters will only get worse and more dangerous for ourselves and our planet


fossil fuels are contributing to increased greenhouse gases in our air which inturn accelerates 
global warming
 and is sending our planet to a dangerous point of no return this is why there is more focus than ever before on 
reducing your carbon footprint
 especially in winter when we rely heavily on heating systems in our homes


increasing the use of 
renewable energy
 allows us to do exactly that replacing carbonintensive energy sources that are contributing to a 
climate crisis
 with greener more sustainable alternatives


saving money on heating this winter


the likes of 
wind power
 and 
solar panels
 are an investment and utilising your own renewable energy will save you money in the long run meaning extra pennies for you throughout winter


selfconsumption
 systems divert excess energy from going back to the national grid sending it back into your home and therefore reducing your reliance on the national grid during times of darkness or poor weather


learn more about this on our blog 
will going green save you money



save the planet and reduce your costs this winter


diverting excess heat to your immersion heater storage heaters or directly into your underfloor heating system provides extra warmth and saves money on your energy bills


saving pennies staying warm and saving the planet really are the perfect 
new years resolutions
 for everything you need to know about 
selfconsumption
