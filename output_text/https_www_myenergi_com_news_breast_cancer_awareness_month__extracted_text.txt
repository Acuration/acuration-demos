breast cancer awareness month
 


 








 










october is breast cancer awareness month an annual campaign organised to increase and retain awareness of the disease how it affects families and to remind people to take care and look after of their own health


the year 2020 has been a year to remind us all that we are all in this together what we do and the choices we make have the power to protect the most vulnerable around us covid19 may have been at the forefront of discussion of recent times but breast cancer still needs the required attention in order to one day beat this disease once and for all


thanks to breast cancer awareness month october we are all far more aware of its symptoms and how to selfcheck though the sad truth is we are far more aware because we know somebody directly who has either lost their battle or is entering a battle


myenergi believes companies need to take wider responsibility for the health and wellbeing of their employees by generating awareness of such diseases is a part of that process therefore well be fully invested in the campaign and our staff will be wearing pink offices will be decorated in pink and well be fully engaging in the event we are also auctioning off a limited edition pink zappi
