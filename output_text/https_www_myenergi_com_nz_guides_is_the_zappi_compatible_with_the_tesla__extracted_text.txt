is the zappi compatible with the tesla
 


 












what are my options for a tesla home charger


so the big question is the zappi compatible with the tesla yes it is but to give you all the information you need to make your decision lets look at the facts


when it comes to charging your tesla there are numerous options available to you at home however depending on your requirements and usage some are better than others


 














 






can i use a normal outlet to charge my tesla at home


yes you can charge your tesla using a normal power outlet at your home but should you


one issue with this is unless you have a garage it will mean trailing wires from your indoor power source through windows or doors


another aspect which you might not have considered is that with a standard charging outlet which is provided with all teslas this has no connectivity no smartphone app no charge range control and isnt solar aware


for these reasons combined plus the time it will take to charge your tesla at home we would always recommend upgrading your tesla home charger
















 






how long will it take to charge my tesla from the outlet


simply plugging your tesla regardless of the model into the outlet could take upwards of 24 hours to reach full charge


this is due to the lower voltage of power which can be diverted into your tesla you also dont have any control over the functions of eco or rapid charging


this means youre subject to the capabilities of the grid to charge
















can zappi be my new tesla home charger


the zappi has three charging modes which are all perfect for charging your tesla eco eco and fast












eco charging












this mode is a mixture of both green energy and energy imported from the grid this is perfect for charging your tesla with solar panels but if you dont have them it will use energy from the grid when its at its cheapest ie overnight














eco plus charging












charge power is continuously adjusted in response to changes in generation or power consumption elsewhere in the home your ev charger will pause if there is too muchimported power continuing only when there is surplus free power available














fast charging












in this mode the vehicle will be charged at maximum power this power can come from a renewable energy source or simply from the grid in this mode your tesla can be fully charged in no time at all






























tesla model x charging at home


the tesla model x has an impressive 580 km range but whats the best charging method


having the right ev charging equipment to charge up your tesla model 3 at home is vital while there are a growing number of public and workplace charging points across new zealand it isnt always convenient to charge publicly to ensure your tesla model 3 is charged as ecoefficiently as possible we would always recommend the zappi


not only will the zappi charge your tesla model 3 using solar if you have your own panels the high performing home car charger is vital to a positive driving experience


when you buy a tesla model x it is supplied a type g 220  240 v adapter as standard this provides approximately two to four km of range per hour of charge depending on the car this means using this standard charging system it would take approximately 32 hours for your tesla model x to reach the full charging range while it is convenient as it will simply plug into any conventional plug socket it is not the realistic way of charging your electric car at home


 






























 




tesla model 3 home charger


having the right ev charging equipment to charge up your tesla model 3 at home is vital while there are a growing number of public and workplace charging points across new zealand we are still very far behind the likes of the uk in terms of public charging available to ensure your tesla model 3 is charged as ecoefficiently as possible we would always recommend the zappi


not only will the zappi charge your tesla model 3 using solar if you have your own panels the high performing home car charger is vital to a positive driving experience


when you buy a tesla model 3 it is supplied a type g 220  240 v adapter as standard this provides approximately two to four km of range per hour of charge depending on the car this means using this standard charging system it would take approximately 20 hours for your tesla model 3 to reach the full charging range while it is convenient as it will simply plug into any conventional plug socket it is not the realistic way of charging your electric car at home










 




how to charge the tesla model s at home


having the right ev charging equipment to charge up your tesla model s at home is vital while there are a growing number of public and workplace charging points across new zealand the ratio per household is still very low and often a home charger is the only option to ensure your tesla model s is charged as ecoefficiently as possible we would always recommend the zappi


so if youre asking is the zappi compatible with the tesla then yes not only will the zappi charge your tesla model s using solar if you have your own panels the high performing home car charger is vital to a positive driving experience
