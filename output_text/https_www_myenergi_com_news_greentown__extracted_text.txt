europes green town  myenergi and gtfc launch new environmental initiative
 


 








 










as the lead sponsor of grimsby town football club were committed to supporting the club in any way we can in addition to providing sponsorship were working together to launch green town  a celebration of grimsby as a hub for innovation and technology


the joint initiative kicked off on tuesday 25 april when the mariners took on crewe alexandra with holohan and orsi helping gtfc to a 20 win the team wore a special edition shirt for the game signifying its commitment to sustainability and announcing its ambition to become b corp certified


b corps are businesses that balance profit with people and the planet achieving certification signifies that youre hitting the very highest standards of environmental and social performance accountability and transparency


changes are already underway at blundell park to improve the clubs environmental impact alongside switching from led to halogen floodlights two new energy efficient boilers are set to be installed alongside a number of recycling stations and ev charging ports elsewhere the training ground will benefit from the installation of solar panels


the green town campaign was inspired by food town a group of local businesses that sponsored the club in the 1980s and 1990s with the aim of putting grimsby on the map as a leader in food processing


with grimsby now home to a whole host of progressive inspiring fastgrowth environmental businesses we thought it was the perfect mantra for the new campaign explained jordan brompton cofounder of myenergi


we founded myenergi with the simple goal of making sustainability accessible for the masses our ecosmart product range is helping households all around the world to reduce reliance on mains energy and embrace renewables its about all of us making better choices and being part of a global change


as lead sponsors of gtfc we are working with the club to help inspire more people relate green energy and grimsby closely together we hope the green town campaign will engage staff players and fans alike as well as people outside of the club


by promoting sustainability and ecofriendly practices among fans and staff as well as partnering with myenergi gtfc hopes to lead the way towards a greener future for the club and the town  and inspiring others to do the same
