how does climate change affect the weather
 


 








 










global warming and climate change are often cited as the forces behind drastic weather from rising temperatures and sea levels to cyclones hurricanes and volcanic eruptions concern for these increasingly alarming issues has never been stronger


while most people are aware of the impact that global warming is having on our planets behaviour there is some confusion surrounding 
how 
the likes of air pollution and emissions have been able to alter the weather in recent years


climate change  the weather the facts


the facts are becoming increasingly impossible to ignore when it comes to 
climate change
 and global warming 


everyone from the general public to key decision makers policymakers businesses and politicians are looking at ways in which to cut down emissions and save our planet heres why




over 
230 peerreviewed studies
 looking at weather events around the world found that 68 of all extreme weather was made more likely or severe by humancaused climate change


scientific research suggests that the earths climate is accelerating at its fastest ever rate


our planets average surface temperature has risen about 09 degrees celsius since the late 19th century with most of the warming taking place in the last 35 years


the 
five warmest years
 on record have taken place since 2010


greenland lost 
286 billion tonnes of ice
 per year between 1993 and 2016 while antarctica averages 127 billion tonnes per year in that same period


2018 set a new record for 
ocean heating



sea levels are rising
 at the fastest rate in 3000 years




how does global warming affect temperature


global warming is defined as the increased temperature in our atmosphere caused by the greenhouse effect


the greenhouse effect describes the process of the earth trapping the suns heat in its lower atmosphere as a result of the inescapable greenhouse gases caused by fossil fuels and emissions


plants help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air but deforestation and more treacherous conditions have caused a reduction in greenery 


this combined with human activity such as driving littering and increased reliance on fossil fuels means that the trapped heat has caused our planet to get hotter


how does climate change cause flooding


as temperatures rise so do sea levels global warmings melting of the ice caps and gradual heating of our waters has caused oceans to expand


90 of greenhouse gases
 are absorbed by the sea in the last 25 years half of the sea level rises can be attributed to climate change


how does this affect the weather you ask well rising sea levels can cause mass flooding of our land particularly in lowlying coastal places 


major floods in recent years have caused horrific destruction of peoples homes and this will only continue unless we make huge changes to our behaviour


how does global warming cause storms and hurricanes


warmer air and increased evaporation mean that there is now more water vapour in the air than when we had cooler temperatures this extra moisture and humidity is becoming increasingly apparent when looking at rainfall and storm figures in recent years


climate change is causing more unpredictable weather patterns across the planet one of which being that of hurricanes


increases in greenhouse gases and decreases in air pollution have contributed to increases in atlantic hurricane activity since 1970 according to the 
nca 2018 global change report



higher sea levels and warmer oceans correlate to the increased intensity of storms and hurricanes we are continuing to see across the globe


how does climate change cause volcanic eruptions


the hotter temperatures are causing the ice on volcanoes to melt which can cause landslides and the collapse of such natural structures


imagine the ice like some sort of protective layer  when the ice melts away the mountain is free to collapse says researcher 
giochani roberti



volcanoes are a pressurised system and if you remove pressure by ice melting and landslide you have a problem


volcano eruption can not only be caused by climate change but is in fact a cause of climate change in itself when a volcano erupts it spews smoke ash and a lot of hot air into the earths atmosphere presenting a major problem in terms of climate change


is there a difference between climate change and global warming


yes many confuse global warming and climate change as direct synonyms but they do in fact differ slightly in meaning


global warming relates only to the earths rising temperatures whereas climate change covers all weatherrelated side effects of global warming


what can we do to prevent climate change and global warming


global warming and climate change have accelerated due to human behaviour but there is plenty we can do to slow the process down and save our planet


from 
reducing your carbon footprint
 and expanding your knowledge of 
renewable energy
 to switching to 
green energy
 and using our 
sustainable green products
 the time for action is now
