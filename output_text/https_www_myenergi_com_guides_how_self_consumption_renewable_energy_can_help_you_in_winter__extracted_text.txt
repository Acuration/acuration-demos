how selfconsumption  renewable energy can help you in winter
 


 












renewable energy can help


feeling the chill this winter but conscious of the effect your electricity and gas usage is having on your carbon footprint and utility bills renewable energy can help you in winter and the selfconsumption of green energy is the perfect environmentally solution


as a planet our reliance on fossil fuels for power has come at a cost to our environment contributing to the evergrowing and increasingly apparent threat of global warming


however thanks to modern innovation and advanced green technology renewable energy consumption is on the rise and selfconsumption systems are becoming more and more popular














why renewable energy and devices such as eddi harvi and zappi could be your perfect ally this winter




 














 






improve sustainability


selfconsumption systems such as our innovative eddi device let you utilise all the renewable energy you produce at home ensuring youre entirely selfsufficient and not relying on the national grid


diverting excess energy back into your home provides a more sustainable and affordable way of living


in winter any excess power generated from your solar panels and wind turbines can be reused to heat your home rather than left to get diverted back to the grid when youre not using it
















 






reduce carbon footprint and global warming


thanks to global warmings impact on the weather winters will only get worse and more dangerous for ourselves and our planet


fossil fuels are contributing to increased greenhouse gases in our air which inturn accelerates global warming and is sending our planet to a dangerous point of no return this is why there is more focus than ever before on reducing your carbon footprint especially in winter when we rely heavily on heating systems in our homes


increasing the use of renewable energy allows us to do exactly that replacing carbonintensive energy sources that are contributing to a climate crisis with greener more sustainable alternatives
















 






saving money on heating this winter


the likes of wind power and solar panels are an investment and utilising your own renewable energy will save you money in the long run meaning extra pennies for you throughout winter


selfconsumption systems divert excess energy from going back to the national grid sending it back into your home and therefore reducing your reliance on the national grid during times of darkness or poor weather


learn more about this on our blog will going green save you money
















save the planet and reduce your costs this winter




diverting excess heat to your immersion heater storage heaters or directly into your underfloor heating system provides extra warmth and saves money on your energy bills


saving pennies staying warm and saving the planet really are the perfect new years resolutions for everything you need to know about selfconsumption be sure to read our blog and get in touch with our friendly experts
