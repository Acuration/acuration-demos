reducing plastic 4 highimpact tips
 


 








 










in the last 50 years plastic production has increased twentyfold if we do nothing and continue in this way by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans reducing plastic consumption is therefore of great importance for the prosperity of our planet but how do you do it we would like to inspire you with four small adjustments that do have a big impact


what is the effect of plastic on the environment


plastic can take up to 500 years to compost it has a major polluting effect on land water air and nature 
greenpeace
 claims that a truckload of plastic enters our oceans every minute damaging marine life and our ecosystems plastic waste not only harms organisms animals and fish but also our economy

the fishing industry and tourism all suffer from plastic pollution of the oceans and the impact goes even further than that our water sources are becoming polluted with plastic


what can we do to stop this


reducing your consumption of plastic is already a big step with these small adjustments you can already prevent a lot of plastic


recycle


most households do it already recycling throw away plastic that you no longer use in a plastic bin or waste bag for everything you throw away ask yourself if it can be recycled not sure what should or should not go in the plastic waste bag check with milieu centraals 
waste separation guide



reducing plastic consumption with reusable bottles


a very simple change that has a great effect is to use reusable water bottles how often do you drink a water bottle and then throw it away or how often do you use a coffee mug that you then throw away by using reusable water bottles and coffee mugs you save a lot of plastic waste




avoid plastic when shopping


disposable plastic is the most polluting type of plastic after you have used it once you throw it away immediately this is not only true for water bottles and coffee cups as we mentioned above but also for grocery packaging next time buy local vegetables without plastic packaging and use your own shopping bag do you regularly forget to bring a bag always leave one in your bag or in the boot of your car so its quickly at hand


go for plasticfree alternatives


look around your bathroom how many plastic containers do you see there you probably have a plastic shampoo bottle shower gel and toothbrush there are more sustainable plasticfree products for this a bamboo toothbrush a shampoo bar and a bar of soap can all help reduce plastic consumption


what else can we do


lowering your carbon footprint
 and reducing plastic consumption are a few steps but there is more to do learn how you can contribute to a sustainable future by reading about 
our mission
