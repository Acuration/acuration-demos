myenergi redesigns products in response to global chip shortage


myenergi has completed a major product redesign project in response to the challenges caused by the global microchip shortage


 


the world runs on microchips not just the elaborate ones at the heart of your phone or laptop but mostly a lot of ordinary ones that you arent even aware of they enable the power windows in your car and the timer in your coffee maker with lead times for some microprocessors now exceeding 52 weeks the silicon shortage is causing significant production issues for companies across the globe for large names such as tesla apple and samsung at the same time myenergi is experiencing growing demand for its energy control products as the world races towards net zero carbon electric vehicle ev adoption gains momentum and consumers become more conscious of their energy use at home


 


to futureproof the business and ensure that demand would not outstrip supply over the long term myenergis innovative team of engineers tackled the impending supply issue head on working round the clock to completely redesign its product range the updated designs operate on a new more powerful microprocessor which is not affected by the silicon shortage


alongside enabling the increased production of myenergis zappi eddi harvi and hub products the more powerful microprocessor will facilitate additional features over time giving customers greater control over their energy consumption at home


silicon shortage affecting not just the automotive industry


 


dr chris horne
 chief technology officer of myenergi commented


the global silicon shortage has caused difficulties for numerous sectors globally with ever growing lead times for critical microchips leading to car production being halted a shortage of consumer goods and massive price rises in computer components to name just a few


dr chris horne


 


as a key component for our products we had been building stock to offset the shortage and cover our plans to boost output but we knew this problem would persist for the foreseeable future in light of this we moved quickly to change our operating platform completing the project in just three months were now in a strong position to meet the increasing demand for our range of efficient energy control products which continues to grow as the global push towards net zero carbon gains momentum


 


jordan brompton
 cofounder and cmo of myenergi added


we have effectively innovated ourselves out of a challenging situation demonstrating the pace and flexibility needed to excel in todays rapidlydeveloping technology landscape thanks to the dedication of our rd division each product in our range has been redesigned to ensure compatibility with a new more powerful less utilised type of microchip making our products capable of even more than before while providing a whole host of additional features and customer benefits
