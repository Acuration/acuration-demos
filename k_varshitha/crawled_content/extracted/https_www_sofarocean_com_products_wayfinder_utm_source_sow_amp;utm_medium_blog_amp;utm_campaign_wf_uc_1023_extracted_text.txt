Minimize Voyage Costs with Daily Speed and Route Recommendations
Continuously optimize in changing conditions with route suggestions and daily RPM guidance
Wayfinder evaluates millions of routes each day and alerts Captains and Operators in-app and via email when there is a more optimal path to port that takes advantage of favorable forecasts and offers significant savings opportunities. Wayfinder also sends Captains a daily RPM recommendation; in changing conditions, variable guidance always outperforms constant power strategies.
Access dynamic guidance powered by real-time observations of weather along route
Wayfinderâs continuous route and RPM recommendations are informed by the real-time weather data collected by Sofarâs global network of Spotter buoys. Direct observations of weather along a vesselâs route help produce more accurate forecasts and more reliable guidance.
Confidently actualize savings with guidance built on high-accuracy vessel performance models
Voyage guidance informed by imprecise speed and fuel consumption predictions cannot be optimal. Wayfinderâs vessel performance model generates high-accuracy speed and fuel predictions for every optimized suggestion and monitors accuracy to ensure that the guidance issued delivers expected results.
Best-in-Class Forecasts
to Ensure Safe Passage
Wayfinderâs forecasts integrate the real-time observations made by Sofarâs Spotter sensor network, and are up to 50% more accurate than the traditional models used by other weather routing providers.

Save Time with Quick Access to the Fleet Insights You Need
Monitor Changes in Vessel Performance
View your vesselâs real-time performance across drafts and BF conditions and compare against post-maintenance performance. Our VPMs are also easily exportable to use in other applications or compare to internal models.
Seamlessly Track and Optimize for EUÂ ETS and CII
Wayfinderâs optimized guidance automatically factors in EU ETS allowance costs based on ports-of-call and current regulations. Add voyage-specific or annual target CII scores as optimization constraints.
Instantly Access Detailed End-of-Voyage Reports
After each voyage, Wayfinder produces an optimization report with a detailed overview of the weather, suggestions, and savings achieved on the platform. For vessels sailing with strict charter party terms, we produce charter party adherence end-of-voyage reports with good weather analysis to support claims.
Track voyage-to-date progress against charter party adherence terms
Wayfinder monitors real-time performance relative to charter party terms, enabling Operators to intervene if a voyage is expected to end in time loss or fuel overconsumption.
What Our Customers Are Saying
"Eagle Bulk has a track record for leveraging data to make the best decisions. Sofar Oceanâs real-time sensor-derived ocean data allows our onboard and shoreside teams to dynamically optimize speed and routing decisions with safety, cost, and emissions benefits."
Director of Fleet Performance, Eagle Bulk
Jonathan Dowsett
"Star Bulk has been focusing on voyage optimization for several years to minimize our costs and reduce emissions, and we are always on the look-out for new products that use advanced technologies. What we like about Sofarâs services is that they use a large network of ocean weather sensors to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, and we expect that this should allow us to further optimize our fleetâs routes and speeds."
Energy Efficiency Director, Star Bulk
George Mantalos
"Wayfinder allows us to increase vessel utilization and efficiency, ensuring that we balance profitability with emissions reduction objectives. By using Wayfinder's data and voyage optimization, we've seen efficiency gains in the range of 4.5% on dedicated voyages, which translates into as many as 14 additional sailing days per year per vessel.â
CEO, Berge Bulk
James Marshall
"With My Digital Fleetâ¢, we are building the most comprehensive platform for managing risk and achieving efficiency across four critical aspects of shipping: Environmental, Operational, Machinery, and Structural. Our partnership with Sofar Ocean and Wayfinder solves the voyage optimization challenge by combining unparalleled marine weather forecasts with accurate vessel performance models to give Operators control over safety, earnings, and CII."
