fuel time and emissions with daily voyage optimization as market weather and vessel conditions change the your sailing strategy must constantly adapt wayfinder makes this easy âour platform delivers daily voyage guidance and accounts for changing conditions we optimize for each vesselâs business safety and decarbonization targets saving time fuel and emissions schedule a demo download our voyage optimization white paper ï schedule a voyage optimization demo minimize voyage costs with daily speed and route recommendations continuously optimize in changing conditions with route suggestions and daily rpm guidance wayfinder evaluates millions of routes each day and alerts captains and operators inapp and via email when there is a more optimal path to port that takes advantage of favorable forecasts and offers significant savings opportunities wayfinder also sends captains a daily rpm recommendation in changing conditions variable guidance always outperforms constant power strategies access dynamic guidance powered by realtime observations of weather along route wayfinderâs continuous route and rpm recommendations are informed by the realtime weather data collected by sofarâs global network of spotter buoys direct observations of weather along a vesselâs route help produce more accurate forecasts and more reliable guidance confidently actualize savings with guidance built on highaccuracy vessel performance models voyage guidance informed by imprecise speed and fuel consumption predictions cannot be optimal wayfinderâs vessel performance model generates highaccuracy speed and fuel predictions for every optimized suggestion and monitors accuracy to ensure that the guidance issued delivers expected results bestinclass forecasts to ensure safe passage wayfinderâs forecasts integrate the realtime observations made by sofarâs spotter sensor network and are up to 50 more accurate than the traditional models used by other weather routing providers schedule a demo

achieved on the platform for vessels sailing with strict charter party terms we produce charter party adherence endofvoyage reports with good weather analysis to support claims track voyagetodate progress against charter party adherence terms wayfinder monitors realtime performance relative to charter party terms enabling operators to intervene if a voyage is expected to end in time loss or fuel overconsumption what our customers are saying eagle bulk has a track record for leveraging data to make the best decisions sofar oceanâs realtime sensorderived ocean data allows our onboard and shoreside teams to dynamically optimize speed and routing decisions with safety cost and emissions benefits director of fleet performance eagle bulk jonathan dowsett star bulk has been focusing on voyage optimization for several years to minimize our costs and reduce emissions and we are always on the lookout for new products that use advanced technologies what we like about sofarâs services is that they use a large network of ocean weather sensors to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and we expect that this should allow us to further optimize our fleetâs routes and speeds energy efficiency director star bulk george mantalos wayfinder allows us to increase vessel utilization and efficiency ensuring that we balance profitability with emissions reduction objectives by using wayfinders data and voyage optimization weve seen efficiency gains in the range of 45 on dedicated voyages which translates into as many as 14 additional sailing days per year per vesselâ ceo berge
