Announcing Spotter v2 with SST
Sofar Ocean
Since its launch in 2017, Spotter has been deployed by researchers, industries, governments, and ocean enthusiasts all over the world. And as a community of users weâve learned a ton. Spotters have racked up over a million ocean hours in climates ranging from the tropics, subtropics and arctic. And thatâs a pretty big deal. At least we think so.Â Â
Over time weâve learned from our deployments in the field to make gradual refinements in material choices and mechanical design to Spotter. With these changes and a newly incorporated sensor, we are proud to introduce: Spotter v2.Â
Spotter V2Â  incorporates all our learnings from extended deployments by users in every part of the world, and in every type of weather. The new release also includes an optional digital temperature sensor that provides an accuracy of +/-0.1C and a precision of 0.02C. We have mounted the sensor in an insulated stainless steel penetrator to provide excellent thermal contact with the water.Â
With Spotter v2, real-time sea surface temperature is directly available via your dashboard, through the API, and is stored on the SD card.
