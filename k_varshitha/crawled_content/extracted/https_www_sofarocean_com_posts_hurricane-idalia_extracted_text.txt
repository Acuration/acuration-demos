Airdropped Spotters make direct observations of Hurricane Idalia to improve existing forecasts
Sofar Ocean
On Monday, August 28th, 2023, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Scientific Development Squadron VXS-1 airdropped 10 Spotters in the path of rapidly intensifying Hurricane Idalia. The goal of the mission, which was coordinated by Sofar Ocean and its partners in the
National Oceanic Partnership Program (NOPP) Hurricane Coastal Impacts (NHCI)
project, was to make real-time observations of extreme conditions near Hurricane Idalia's eye wall as it moved through the Gulf of Mexico. Two days later, the fleet of freely drifting Spotters successfully collected this ground truth data just before Hurricane Idalia made landfall near Keaton Beach, Florida as a major Category 3 storm.
