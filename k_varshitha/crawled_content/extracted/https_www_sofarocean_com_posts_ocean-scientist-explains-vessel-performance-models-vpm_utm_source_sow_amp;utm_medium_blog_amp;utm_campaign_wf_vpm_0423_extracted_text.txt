An Ocean Scientist explains... Vessel Performance Models (VPM)
Sofar Ocean
A Vessel Performance Model (VPM) is a key component of an
effective voyage optimization platform
. A VPM calculates the relationship between a vesselâs propeller RPM, engine power, speed, and fuel consumption, and predicts how that relationship will change in different sea states. A VPMâs predictions, in turn, inform the route guidance that a voyage optimization platform sends to a Captain. In the video above, Sofar Ocean Data Scientist Galen Egan, PhD provides an in-depth explanation of VPMs, detailing:
Why it is essential that a VPM accurately predicts speed and fuel consumption in all weather conditions
Why a VPMâs predictions are valuable to Captains and Navigational Officers, as well as shoreside teams
How AdaptiveVPMâ¢ â the vessel performance model powering Sofarâs
Wayfinder
voyage optimization platform â predicts vessel speed within an average of 0.5 knots and fuel consumption within an average of 2% of metric tons consumed
