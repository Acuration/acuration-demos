Climate Commitment
At Sofar, we put the ocean first. We empower science, society, and industry to be stewards for the sea, and help make a more sustainable future possible for our planet.
VOYAGE OPTIMIZATION TO REDUCE EMISSIONS
Maritime shipping companies use our Wayfinder platform to make immediate term progress towards their decarbonization goals. Vessels following Wayfinderâs optimized guidance achieve average fuel and emissions savings of 4-6%
OCEAN DATA AT SCALE TO CLOSE KNOWLEDGE GAP
Researchers, operators, and innovators deploy the Spotter platform and use the Sofar API to unlock ocean data at scale and accelerate marine research and sustainable commercial solutions.
SUSTAINABLYÂ MANAGINGÂ THEÂ SPOTTERÂ NETWORK
Sofar owns and operates the worldâs largest privately-owned network of ocean sensors. We work with customers and partners to deploy free-drifting Spotters from vessels in targeted locations across the global ocean. We use GPS to track the position of every Spotter. If a Spotter washes ashore, we work with citizens, communities, and regional partners to assess the state of the Spotter and determine whether to redeploy, safely dispose of, or send the device to Sofar HQ for analysis. Found a Spotter? Please contact us at support@sofarocean.com.
