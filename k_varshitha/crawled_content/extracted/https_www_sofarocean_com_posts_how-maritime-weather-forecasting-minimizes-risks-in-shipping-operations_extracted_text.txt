but also save on costs arrive on time and work toward decarbonization goals emily heaslip july 19 2021 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis how maritime weather forecasting minimizes risks in shipping operations emily heaslip according to some analysts  the shipping industry regularly underestimates the impact that maritime weather forecasting can have on operational efficiency lack of understanding of marine weather can account for 80 of the impact on performance according to shipping insight specialists stratumfive  marine insight reports âthe resistance when navigating in unfavorable conditions generally increases by 50100 of the total ship resistance in calm weather indeed man energy solutionsâ analysis of trading conditions for a typical 140000 dwt bulk carrier shows that on some routes the increased resistance or sea margin can reach extreme values up to 220ââ maritime weather forecasting plays a significant if underappreciated role in shipping route optimization weather fronts both good and bad impact time fuel and money accurate maritime forecasting requires better data hereâs how and why improvements in maritime weather forecasting can help the shipping industry simultaneously reach decarbonization and financial targetsâ optimizing global shipping global shipping companies are constantly seeking to optimize performance in practice this means reducing costs avoiding delays and meeting regulatory mandates such as the imo ghg strategy â all while operating safely these complicated and sometimes conflicting priorities become even more difficult with the addition of unpredictable maritime weatherâ major weather events such as hurricanes harvey irma and maria present significant and unavoidable challenges for logistics companies for instance the damage caused by hurricane harvey closed port houston texas for six days  ports in georgia and florida closed for three days when hurricane irma hit global shipping is a highly choreographed operation when one major port closes it can impact shipping routes all over the worldâ itâs not just major weather events however that can cause issues for shipping companies fog wind and ice can all adversely affect global shipping routes âdespite modern electronic devices that assist navigation ships at sea usually reduce speed in fog this will delay a shipâs arrival at port or cause the ship to have to increase speed when in clear weather to make up time this results in higher fuel consumption and higher fuel costsâ explained maritime studies south africa â in the past marine forecasting has been complicated by lack of data limited access and reporting inconsistencies but todayâs weather routing capabilities informed by better data can help the shipping industry minimize risks hereâs howâ how maritime weather forecasting can help weather affects everything from shipping route maps to port operations to fleet management and navigation hereâs how the shipping industry can achieve performance targets with better marine forecastsâ reduce fuel usage fuel accounts for 5060 of operation costs  weather routing also known as optimum ship routing can help save on these costs âthe goal is not to avoid all adverse weather but to find the best balance to minimize the time of transit and fuel consumption without placing the vessel at risk of weather damage or crew injuryâ wrote safety4sea  sofar oceanâs wayfinder uses the worldâs largest fleet of openocean weather sensors to integrate realtime observational data collected along shipping routes yielding the best marine weather forecasts not only does this allow ships to avoid extreme weather but it also leads to significant fuel savingsâ â dynamic route guidance weather at sea can change quickly a dynamic weather routing product can adjust the shipâs route accordingly to minimize delays and maximize safety wayfinder evaluates over 100 million routing options based on the latest weather forecast and business needs delivering the safest and most profitable route directly to shipmasters and fleet operations staffâ avoid disasters like the ever given the grounding of the ever given in the suez canal was unique in how it captured public attention around the world however allianz reports that 41 large ships were lost in 2019 46 in 2018 over the last 10 years around 100 big shipping vessels have been destroyed â many of these losses occur when there is extreme weather at play casualty statistics indicate that â bad weathe râ is a contributing factor in one in five ship losses access to realtime maritime forecasting plays an important role in reducing casualties and avoiding disastersâ improve margins beyond the cost savings in using less fuel and delivering goods on time marine weather forecasting has other hidden cost savings shipping companies can improve their margins by reducing insurance costs  saving on crew overtime pay and avoiding additional fees from port operators overall this helps shipping companies build healthier profit margins that can be reinvested back into fleet optimization and reaching decarbonization targetsâ for more on optimizing shipping routes visit the sofar ocean blog
