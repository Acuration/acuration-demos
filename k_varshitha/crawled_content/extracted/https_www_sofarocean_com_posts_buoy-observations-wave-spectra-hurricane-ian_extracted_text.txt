ocean december 7 2022 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis how buoy observations of wave spectra deepen our understanding of hurricane ianâs dynamics sofar ocean thumbnail and header photo credit noaa â in late september 2022 hurricane ian made landfall in southwestern florida the category 4 storm which had maximum sustained winds of 155 mph was one of the strongest hurricanes to ever hit the united states it resulted in over 100 deaths  severe storm surge and flooding and prior to reaching us shores a nationwide power outage in cuba sofarâs expansive network of spotter smart buoys in the gulf of mexico collected realtime data about ianâs intensity and location as it approached florida the buoysâ observations of wave spectra are particularly valuable in a hurricane these observations convey the distribution of wave energy as a function of direction and frequency providing a more granular view of the wave dynamics generated by these powerful storms below we analyze the observations of wave spectra collected by spot010445  figure 1  along ianâs outer edge as it moved through the gulf of mexico figure 1 from left to right a map colored by significant wave height forecasts showing the paths of hurricane ian and spot010445 yellow pentagon a time series of the observations of significant wave height collected by spot010445 a polar plot of spot010445âs observations of wave spectra the animations are synchronized and cover the period from september 27th to september 29th in the leftmost animation a map colored by significant wave height shows the path of hurricane ian and the drift track of spot010445 yellow pentagon the middle animation is a time series of the observations of significant wave height made by spot010445 as ian rapidly intensifies over the gulf of mexico its eastern edge passes over spot010445 this moment is captured by the spike in wave height to around seven meters 23 feet observed by spot010445 on september 28th observations of significant wave height though useful are one dimensional in the rightmost animation spot010445âs observations of wave spectra expand our understanding of hurricane ianâs wave dynamics the polar plot shows direction  the polar coordinates indicate the direction that the waves are traveling to as ian makes its way around cuba the wave energy points northwest then as it enters the gulf and turns towards florida its direction shifts to the north and east frequency  the radius of the polar plot shows the wave frequency when the wave energy is closer to the center of the plot the frequency is lower when the wave energy is further from the center the frequency is higher spot010445 observed a dominant wave frequency of 01 hz or a wave period of 10 s energy  the colored areas in the polar plot convey wave energy with warmer colors representing more energetic waves the polar plot captures a simultaneous increase in wave energy and shift in direction of the largest waves on september 28th since hurricane ian traveled northeast after passing cuba and northern hemisphere hurricane winds circulate in a counterclockwise direction the largest and most energetic waves should be in the stormâs front right quadrant where the wind and storm direction align however in this case it appears that the right hand side of the hurricane was impacted by land as the polar plot initially shows the largest wave heights on the left hand side of the storm interested in learning more about wave spectra check out our recent blog post  which defines the components of a wave
