sofar ocean this is part one of our twopart data assimilation series part two is accessible here  for ships at sea and coastal communities having accurate weather and wave forecasts is critical at sofar we are using the realtime ocean observations recorded by our global network of spotter buoys to improve the traditional open source forecast models used by organizations like noaa traditional wave forecasts use information about what the waves are like today and some rules about how waves typically behave to predict what the waves will be like tomorrow this is an imperfect approach partially because we do not have a perfect understanding of the world and how waves will behave in fact our knowledge about todays waves is mostly based on a model informed by yesterdays wave conditions to improve upon traditional models we need more information about the current wave conditions across the globe with this added information we can then start to better predict what the wave conditions will be tomorrow and beyond luckily sofar collects over 13500 observations of significant wave height every day we gather this information using spotter buoys that measure a variety of ocean variables including wave height sea surface temperature and air pressure while drifting with the ocean currents the buoys communicate with the sofar team via satellite every hour sharing valuable information about the ocean sofarâs team of scientists then uses the data collected by spotter buoys to improve wave forecasts data assimilation using observations to improve forecasts using spotter wave observations to update the initial conditions of computer models is called data assimilation this methodology is what makes sofarâs forecasts stand out â sofar has been assimilating spotter measurements of significant wave height to initialize our operational wave forecasts since december 2019 an effort that has improved the accuracy of both our best guess of current wave conditions as well as forecasts several days into the future smit et al 2020 we can visualize the data assimilation process using the animation in figure 1 of buoys floating on the ocean surface sometimes the model and the buoy will measure the same wave height as is the case with the buoy on the left however other times the buoy will not agree with the model as is the case with the buoy on the right step 1 when there is a discrepancy we make an adjustment to our best guess of the current wave conditions in this example we increase the estimated wave height bringing it closer to the observed value step 2 this ultimately creates a new model initial state that we use as the best guess of current wave conditions in our operational wave forecast step 3 â â figure 1  a visualization of data assimilation in this example the model and the spotter buoy on the left measure the same wave height the model and the spotter buoy on the right however measure different wave heights step 1 to account for this discrepancy we adjust our best guess of the current wave conditions by increasing the estimated wave height in the model bringing it closer to the observed value step 2 this ultimately creates a new model initial state that we use as the best guess of current wave conditions in our operational wave forecast step 3 in figure 1  we use the sea surface height as an analog for how we assimilate spotter buoy data in practice we model the significant wave height which is not a single wave that you can see but the average of the largest third of the wave heights observed in the course of 30 minutes this gives us one representative value of how big the waves are in reality at an individual moment the sea surface could be bigger or smaller than the significant wave height as a rule of thumb the maximum wave height can be estimated as two times the significant wave height measured so if the buoy reports a 10 ft significant wave height then the maximum individual wave height out at sea could be as high as 20 ft tall the new approach to data assimilation significant wave height is a critical metric but it tells an incomplete story about a waveâs behavior with this in mind the sofar team has developed a new and unique approach to data assimilation for wave forecasts houghton et al 2022  because spotters also collect information about the period and direction of waves the sofar team can separate different types of waves  rather than just take a snapshot of all waves at a single location and time â letâs imagine two different sea states visualized below in figure 2  that have similar significant wave heights but very different wave periods on the left are waves generated by winds these high frequency waves have short periods and if you were out on a boat you would see white capping in a wind sea the sea would appear quite chaotic with waves moving generally in the direction of the wind on the right far from the wind sea swell waves are depicted swell waves are long period waves that are generated during storms and travel great distances we often visualize swell waves by picturing a surfer trying to ride them as they crash upon the shore even though the wave heights are similar on the left and the right the sea states are quite different â read more spotter data partitioning for âseaâ and âswellâ  â figure 2  a visualization of how vastly different sea states can have similar wave heights on the left we see high frequency waves with short periods conditions typical of a wind sea on the right we see swell waves with low frequencies and long periods conditions that are often created by storms and travel over great distances â in figure 2  the directions of the waves are also distinct in the wind sea on the left it would be hard to tell which direction the waves were traveling in the swell on the right the wave direction would be apparent measuring direction is critical because if thereâs a storm we want to know which way the waves are propagating like watching ripples in a pond we want to accurately predict how waves will travel outwards and impact nearby regions and coastlines ships at sea are particularly interested in predicting swell waves to understand vessel motion as the size and direction of a swell affects how a ship rocks â recently sofar updated its data assimilation method to incorporate this critical wave direction and period information we use a new approach where spectral wave information â the energy distribution at many different wave frequencies â is incorporated into the model at regular intervals to improve the forecast accuracy instead of just raising or lowering the significant wave height in the model to match that recorded by the spotter buoys see figure 1  we might also lengthen the waves in the model to become more representative of an ocean swell or adjust the wave direction to improve downstream impacts in the forecasts on the other hand spectral data assimilation may reduce wave periods making the model more representative of a wind sea in figure 3 below our spotter buoy network observes waves with greater wave heights and shorter periods than the model predicted step 1 as a result the spectral data assimilation approach decreases the wavelengths and increases the wave heights in the model bringing them closer to observed values step 2 this ultimately creates a new model initial state that we use as the best guess of current wave conditions in our operational wave forecast step 3 â figure 3  a visualization of our spectral data assimilation approach in this example our spotter buoy network observes waves with greater wave heights and shorter periods than the model predicted step 1 spectral data assimilation increases the wave heights and decreases the wave periods in the model bringing them closer to observed values step 2 this ultimately creates a new model initial state that we use as the best guess of current wave conditions in our operational wave forecast step 3 â now that weâve walked through the basics of data assimilation and detailed how sofar is incorporating spectral wave information to improve forecast
