Wayfinder Voyage Optimization Demo
Sofar Ocean
Sofarâs
Wayfinder
voyage optimization platform provides continuous, proactive, and holistic route guidance to vessels. It considers hundreds of millions of route options daily before sending waypoint and RPM recommendations based on:
A shipâs business and safety constraints
The latest weather forecasts â informed by our
global ocean sensor network
â along a vesselâs route
The shipâs unique Vessel Performance Model (VPM)
Changing market factors
In the following route demo, we use real voyage data to compare the effectiveness of Wayfinderâs continuously optimized route guidance and non-optimized route guidance that recommends preset waypoints and constant speed.
Demo
In
Figure 1
, we compare the two following routing scenarios for a bulk carrier traveling from Asia to the west coast of the United States:
Non-optimized route (orange line):
This route uses constant speed and fixed waypoints set prior to the start of the voyage. A mid-voyage diversion (i.e. adjusted waypoints) is included to simulate a Captain rapidly changing course due to inclement weather. While vessels often change speed in response to inclement weather, this non-optimized route guidance assumes that constant speed is maintained to meet a required time of arrival.
Wayfinder optimized route (green line):
This route is continuously optimized during the voyage. RPM and waypoint guidance is assessed daily by Sofarâs Wayfinder platform.
The colored background layer in
Figure 1
represents the significant wave height in the northern Pacific Ocean. Each yellow pentagon represents the position of a Sofar
Spotter buoy
. Weather data and the positions of the Spotters and vessels are valid for March 2, 2022, at 06:00Z. The red (parametric roll warning) and pink (synchronous roll warning) pill-shaped areas along each route represent parts of the journey identified by Wayfinder as particularly high-risk due to inclement weather.
Figure 1.
The Wayfinder optimized route (green line) and non-optimized route (orange line) for a bulk carrier traveling from Asia to the west coast of the United States. The colored background layer represents significant wave height in the northern Pacific Ocean; each yellow pentagon represents the position of a Spotter buoy; the red and pink pill-shaped areas along each route represent parametric roll warnings and synchronous roll warnings, respectively, issued by Wayfinder.
Figure 2
shows the significant wave heights encountered by the vessels in each routing scenario along their respective paths. The vessel on the Wayfinder optimized route â which we will call
Vessel A
â spends less time in high wave conditions compared to the vessel on the non-optimized route, which we call
Vessel B
. Notably,
Vessel A
encounters a maximum wave height of just over 5 meters, while
Vessel B
encounters waves larger than 7.5 meters.
Figure 2.
The significant wave heights encountered along the Wayfinder optimized route (green line) and the non-optimized route (orange line).
Figure 3
shows a time series of the vesselsâ average RPM over 12-hour intervals along each route.
Vessel A
follows the daily RPM guidance sent by the Wayfinder platform.
Vessel B
âs RPM is adjusted to maintain constant speed.
Figure 4
shows a time series of the vesselsâ speed along each route.
Vessel Aâs
speed fluctuates in response to the daily RPM adjustments recommended by Wayfinder, as well as to variations in the weather conditions that it encounters, such as ocean currents and wind speed.
Vessel Bâs
speed is held constant.

Figure 4 (right):
Time series of the vesselsâ velocity along the Wayfinder optimized route (green line) and non-optimized route (orange line).
Three time series of the vesselsâ cost of trip (
Figure 5
), total fuel consumed (
Figure 6
), and emissions (
Figure 7
) along each route are shown below. Cost of trip, total fuel consumed, and emissions are closely related: the more fuel a vessel burns, the greater its emissions output and voyage cost will be.

Time series of the vesselsâ cost of trip along the Wayfinder optimized route (green line) and non-optimized route (orange line).
Figure 6 (middle).
Time series of the vesselsâ total fuel consumed along the Wayfinder optimized route (green line) and non-optimized route (orange line).
Figure 7 (right).
Time series of the vesselsâ emissions along the Wayfinder optimized route (green line) and non-optimized route (orange line).
Collectively, these times series show that:
Vessel Aâs
cost of trip is less than
Vessel Bâs
cost of trip for the entire duration of the voyage. Cumulatively, following the Wayfinder optimized route saves $13,463.78. (
Figure 5
).
Vessel A
burns less fuel than
Vessel B
for the entire duration of the voyage. Cumulatively, following the Wayfinder optimized route saves 31.08 MT of fuel relative to the non-optimized route (
Figure 6
).
Vessel A
produces fewer emissions than
Vessel B
for the entire duration of the voyage. Cumulatively, following the Wayfinder optimized route saves 88.82 MT of CO
2
relative to the non-optimized route (
Figure 7
).
Analysis
Vessel A
has superior cost, fuel, and emissions outcomes relative to
Vessel B
. Why? The key differentiator is the voyage guidance underpinning the Wayfinder optimized route and the non-optimized route. Letâs break it down:
Early in the voyage,
Vessel A
and
Vessel B
follow nearly identical waypoints.
Vessel B
travels at a constant speed of 11 knots (~5.66 m/s), while
Vessel A
â which is receiving daily RPM guidance from Wayfinder â travels at variable speeds that are consistently slower than 11 knots. As a result,
Vessel B
covers more distance and consumes more fuel than
Vessel A
early in the voyage.
As the vessels enter the open ocean, their paths diverge dramatically.
Vessel A
follows a southerly course and reduces its RPM and speed to avoid a storm system that Wayfinder forecasts will develop in the northern Pacific later in the voyage.
Vessel B
, which is following fixed waypoints set prior to the voyage, takes a northerly course at constant speed. This exposes
Vessel B
to the storm system and, despite a late diversion to avoid the stormâs effects, it sails through dangerous waves larger than 7.5 meters.
Vessel A
and
Vessel B
âs distinct courses highlight the importance of daily, continuous route guidance, as well as highly accurate weather forecasts.

The key components of an effective voyage optimization platform
After avoiding the storm,
Vessel A
takes advantage of calm seas and increases its RPM and speed significantly, while
Vessel B
continues to travel at constant speed. On March 4th, for example,
Vessel A
travels nearly 4 knots (~2 m/s) faster than
Vessel B
; during stretches like these,
Vessel A
makes up some of the distance and time lost earlier in the voyage when it adjusted its RPM and course to avoid the storm.
Later in the voyage,
Vessel A
and
Vessel B
both sail through stretches of rough seas; in
Figure 1
, these high-risk areas are represented by the red (parametric roll warning) and pink (synchronous roll warning) pill-shaped areas along each route.
Vessel A
consistently decreases its RPM when sailing through these treacherous areas. For example, on March 5th,
Vessel A
receives a high-risk synchronous roll warning from Wayfinder; in response, it decreases its RPM from ~65 to ~56, which lowers its speed by nearly 6 knots (~3 m/s).
Vessel B
, which sails through roll risk areas for nearly three straight days starting on March 6th,
increases
its RPM to as high as ~76 during this period to maintain constant speed and meet its required time of arrival. As a result,
Vessel B
experiences elevated safety risk and burns more fuel, further widening the gap between its energy consumption and that of
Vessel A
.
Ultimately,
Vessel A
arrives at port just three hours after
Vessel B
, despite traveling an additional 134.86 nautical miles.
Vessel B
âs minimal time savings come at an extremely high cost: it spends $13,463.78 more dollars, burns 31.08 MT more fuel, and produces 88.82 MT more CO
2
emissions than
Vessel A
.
By following Wayfinderâs route guidance,
Vessel A
accesses continuously optimized RPM and waypoint recommendations, allowing it to sail as efficiently as possible given changing ocean weather and economic factors. By sailing at a constant speed with inflexible waypoints,
Vessel B
becomes more susceptible to inclement weather and suboptimal voyage outcomes. Whether maintaining constant speed, power, or route, sailing without continuous optimization will always produce inferior results.
