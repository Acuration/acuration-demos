wayfinder voyage optimization demo to demonstrate how wayfinders proactive and continuous guidance is superior to oneoff reactive guidance we built an indepth routing demo using real voyage data sofar ocean april 11 2023 ï back product product wayfinder wayfinder voyage optimization demo sofar ocean sofarâs wayfinder voyage optimization platform provides continuous proactive and holistic route guidance to vessels it considers hundreds of millions of route options daily before sending waypoint and rpm recommendations based on a shipâs business and safety constraints the latest weather forecasts â informed by our global ocean sensor network â along a vesselâs route the shipâs unique vessel performance model vpm changing market factors in the following route demo we use real voyage data to compare the effectiveness of wayfinderâs continuously optimized route guidance and nonoptimized route guidance that recommends preset waypoints and constant speed demo in figure 1  we compare the two following routing scenarios for a bulk carrier traveling from asia to the west coast of the united states nonoptimized route orange line this route uses constant speed and fixed waypoints set prior to the start of the voyage a midvoyage diversion ie adjusted waypoints is included to simulate a captain rapidly changing course due to inclement weather while vessels often change speed in response to inclement weather this nonoptimized route guidance assumes that constant speed is maintained to meet a required time of arrival wayfinder optimized route green line this route is continuously optimized during the voyage rpm and waypoint guidance is assessed daily by sofarâs wayfinder platform the colored background layer in figure 1 represents the significant wave height in the northern pacific ocean each yellow pentagon represents the position of a sofar spotter buoy  weather data and the positions of the spotters and vessels are valid for march 2 2022 at 0600z the red parametric roll warning and pink synchronous roll warning pillshaped areas along each route represent parts of the journey identified by wayfinder as particularly highrisk due to inclement weather figure 1 the wayfinder optimized route green line and nonoptimized route orange line for a bulk carrier traveling from asia to the west coast of the united states the colored background layer represents significant wave height in the northern pacific ocean each yellow pentagon represents the position of a spotter buoy the red and pink pillshaped areas along each route represent parametric roll warnings and synchronous roll warnings respectively issued by wayfinder figure 2 shows the significant wave heights encountered by the vessels in each routing scenario along their respective paths the vessel on the wayfinder optimized route â which we will call vessel a â spends less time in high wave conditions compared to the vessel on the nonoptimized route which we call vessel b  notably vessel a encounters a maximum wave height of just over 5 meters while vessel b encounters waves larger than 75 meters figure 2 the significant wave heights encountered along the wayfinder optimized route green line and the nonoptimized route orange line figure 3 shows a time series of the vesselsâ average rpm over 12hour intervals along each route vessel a follows the daily rpm guidance sent by the wayfinder platform vessel b âs rpm is adjusted to maintain constant speed figure 4 shows a time series of the vesselsâ speed along each route vessel aâs speed fluctuates in response to the daily rpm adjustments recommended by wayfinder as well as to variations in the weather conditions that it encounters such as ocean currents and wind speed vessel bâs speed is held constant figure 3 left time series of the vesselsâ average rpm over 12hour intervals along the wayfinder optimized route green line and nonoptimized route orange line figure 4 right time series of the vesselsâ velocity along the wayfinder optimized route green line and nonoptimized route orange line three time series of the vesselsâ cost of trip  figure 5  total fuel consumed  figure 6  and emissions  figure 7  along each route are shown below cost of trip total fuel consumed and emissions are closely related the more fuel a vessel burns the greater its emissions output and voyage cost will be figure 5 left time series of the vesselsâ cost of trip along the wayfinder optimized route green line and nonoptimized route orange line figure 6 middle time series of the vesselsâ total fuel consumed along the wayfinder optimized route green line and nonoptimized route orange line figure 7 right time series of the vesselsâ emissions along the wayfinder optimized route green line and nonoptimized route orange line collectively these times series show that vessel aâs cost of trip is less than vessel bâs cost of trip for the entire duration of the voyage cumulatively following the wayfinder optimized route saves 1346378  figure 5  vessel a burns less fuel than vessel b for the entire duration of the voyage cumulatively following the wayfinder optimized route saves 3108 mt of fuel relative to the nonoptimized route  figure 6  vessel a produces fewer emissions than vessel b for the entire duration of the voyage cumulatively following the wayfinder optimized route saves 8882 mt of co 2 relative to the nonoptimized route  figure 7  analysis vessel a has superior cost fuel and emissions outcomes relative to vessel b  why the key differentiator is the voyage guidance underpinning the wayfinder optimized route and the nonoptimized route letâs break it down early in the voyage vessel a and vessel b follow nearly identical waypoints vessel b travels at a constant speed of 11 knots 566 ms while vessel a â which is receiving daily rpm guidance from wayfinder â travels at variable speeds that are consistently slower than 11 knots as a result vessel b covers more distance and consumes more fuel than vessel a early in the voyage as the vessels enter the open ocean their paths diverge dramatically vessel a follows a southerly course and reduces its rpm and speed to avoid a storm system that wayfinder forecasts will develop in the northern pacific later in the voyage vessel b  which is following fixed waypoints set prior to the voyage takes a northerly course at constant speed this exposes vessel b to the storm system and despite a late diversion to avoid the stormâs effects it sails through dangerous waves larger than 75 meters vessel a and vessel b âs distinct courses highlight the importance of daily continuous route guidance as well as highly accurate weather forecasts white paper the key components of an effective voyage optimization platform after avoiding the storm vessel a takes advantage of calm seas and increases its rpm and speed significantly while vessel b continues to travel at constant speed on march 4th for example vessel a travels nearly 4 knots 2 ms faster than vessel b  during stretches like these vessel a makes up some of the distance and time lost earlier in the voyage when it adjusted its rpm and course to avoid the storm later in the voyage vessel a and vessel b both sail through stretches of rough seas in figure 1  these highrisk areas are represented by the red parametric roll warning and pink synchronous roll warning pillshaped areas along each route vessel a consistently decreases its rpm when sailing through these treacherous areas for example on march 5th vessel a receives a highrisk synchronous roll warning from wayfinder in response it decreases its rpm from 65 to 56 which lowers its speed by nearly 6 knots 3 ms vessel b  which sails through roll risk areas for nearly three straight days starting on march 6th increases its rpm to as high as 76 during this period to maintain constant speed and meet its required time of arrival as a result vessel b experiences elevated safety risk and burns more fuel further widening the gap between its energy consumption and that of vessel a  ultimately vessel a arrives at port just three hours after vessel b  despite traveling an additional 13486 nautical miles vessel b âs minimal time savings come at an extremely high cost it spends 1346378 more dollars burns 3108 mt more fuel and produces 8882 mt more co 2 emissions than vessel a  by following wayfinderâs route guidance vessel a accesses continuously optimized rpm and waypoint recommendations allowing it to sail as efficiently as possible given changing ocean weather and economic factors by sailing at a constant speed with inflexible waypoints vessel b becomes more susceptible to inclement weather and suboptimal voyage outcomes whether maintaining constant speed power or route sailing without continuous optimization will always produce inferior results to learn more about wayfinder check out its product page  to schedule a demo with the wayfinder team please fill out this
