2023 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis how accounting for instability in the lower atmosphere improves forecasts of extreme waves sofar ocean stakeholders across the blue economy â from shipping companies to nonprofits removing plastic from the ocean â trust sofarâs global ocean weather forecasts to help them operate efficiently and safely these forecasts which assimilate the ground truth ocean observations collected by our global network of spotter buoys each day outperform government models by up to 4050 and give sofar customers a critical accuracy advantage enabled by realtime data access to highly accurate forecasts is particularly critical when metocean conditions are at their most extreme operating in inclement weather hampers efficiency and jeopardizes the safety of crews cargo and infrastructure recent updates to sofarâs global ocean weather forecast improve the accuracy of its predictions of moderate 510m to extreme 10m wave activity specifically by accounting for instability in the lower atmosphere â namely air density variability and local wind gustiness â our forecasts of moderate waves improve by over 40 and our forecasts of extreme waves improve by over 20 these improvements impact two of sofarâs product offerings wayfinder voyage optimization  better forecasts and hindcasts of moderate to extreme waves improve the accuracy of adaptivevpmâ âs speed and fuel predictions as well as the reliability of wayfinderâs continuously optimized voyage guidance data services  any customer or researcher that uses the sofar api to access ocean weather insights will reap the benefits of improved forecasts of moderate to extreme waves forecasts traditionally do not account for air density variability and local wind gustiness air density and local wind gustiness both play a role in wave generation yet many forecasts do not account for either dynamic â air density  denser air exerts a stronger force on the ocean surface which contributes to wave growth air density however is historically treated as uniform over the global ocean and constant in time local wind gustiness  in unstable atmospheric conditions local wind gusts can be temporarily stronger than the averaged wind measurement that most wave models use these local wind gusts can generate sea waves that are substantially larger than the wave heights derived from this averaged wind measurement which doesnt vary rapidly over short time scales or small space scales local wind gustiness is not explicitly forecasted by numerical weather models because of limitations imposed by model spatial and temporal resolution visualizing air density variability and local wind gustiness in the north pacific ocean during the series of atmospheric rivers that battered the california coast in january 2023 strong storms traversed the north pacific ocean over relatively warm ocean waters below we visualize the instability in the lower atmosphere that was present as one of these storms passed through the pacific on january 21st figure 1 shows air density in the pacific warm colors represent areas with higher air density which exerts a stronger force on the ocean surface and contributes to wave growth figure 2 shows airsea temperature differences which are a proxy for atmospheric instability warm colors represent areas where sea surface temperatures are warmer than surface air temperatures in these regions wind gusts are likely large and important for wave growth most of the time wind gustiness has a larger effect on wave growth than air density figure 1 air density in the north pacific ocean on january 21st 2023 0000z warm colors represent areas with higher air density which exerts a stronger force on the ocean surface and contributes to wave growth the yellow pentagon indicates the position of spotter 010455 see figure 4  figure 2 airsea temperature differences in the north pacific ocean on january 21st 2023 0000z warm colors represent warmer sea surface temperatures relative to air temperatures in these areas wind gusts are likely large and important for wave growth black barbs represent the average 10 meter wind direction and magnitude increased length and number of pennants on the barbs represent higher values for wind speed average 10 meter wind speed is dominated by larger scale dynamics but local wind gusts can introduce variability around that average the yellow pentagon indicates the position of spotter 010455 see figure 4  accounting for air density variability and local wind gustiness improves forecasts of extreme waves figure 1 and figure 2 make clear that air density variability and gusty wind conditions were present as a storm traversed the north pacific ocean on january 21st in figure 3  we assess the effect of these lower atmosphere dynamics on wave generation from january 20th 2023 0000z to january 22nd 2023 1200z by measuring the differences between the wave heights forecasted by sofarâs global ocean weather forecast when accounting for air density variability and airsea temperature differences  updated forecast  the wave heights forecasted by sofarâs global ocean weather forecast when not accounting for air density variability and airsea temperature differences  original forecast  in multiple areas the updated forecast predicts wave heights that are more than 1m larger than those predicted by the original forecast  this is a direct result of the updated forecast accounting for air density variability and airsea temperature differences in particular there is spatial correlation between the areas where the updated forecast predicts larger wave heights  figure 3  bottom warm colors and the areas with positive airsea temperature differences  figure 3  top warm colors the wave height differences persist longer than the airsea temperature differences because waves propagate away from storms and this storm is weakening â figure 3 top to bottom for the period of january 20th 2023 0000z to january 22nd 2023 in the north pacific ocean air density airsea temperature differences differences in wave height forecasted by 1 sofarâs global ocean weather forecast when accounting for air density variability and airsea temperature differences  updated forecast  and 2 sofarâs global ocean weather forecast when not accounting for air density variability and airsea temperature differences  original forecast  by accounting for air density variability and airsea temperature differences â a proxy for local wind gustiness â the updated forecast predicts wave heights in certain areas that are more than 1m larger than those predicted by the original forecast  in particular there is spatial correlation between the areas where the updated forecast predicts larger wave heights and the areas with positive airsea temperature differences the yellow pentagon indicates the position of spotter 010455  see figure 4  â â in figure 4  we validate the accuracy of the updated forecast âs predictions of wave height by comparing them to the ground truth observations of wave height made by spotter buoy 010455 during the atmospheric rivers that traversed the north pacific ocean spotter buoy 010455âs position is represented by the yellow pentagon in figures 1  2  and 3  from january 1st to january 14th the updated forecast âs predictions of wave height were closely aligned with the ground truth observations of wave height made by spotter buoy 010455 forecasted and observed wave heights were frequently moderate 510m to extreme 10m overall by accounting for differences in stability and density in the lower atmosphere the updated forecast more accurately predicts moderate to extreme wave heights than the original forecast  figure 4 time series of observed  spotter 010455  and forecasted  updated forecast  significant wave height at spotter 010455âs position for the twoweek period between 112023 and 1142023 observed and forecasted significant wave height are closely aligned by accounting for air density variability and local wind gustiness sofarâs forecasts of moderate to extreme waves during strong winds improve dramatically these improvements help
