sofar ocean in february 2018 metocean solutions deployed five solarpowered wave buoys spotters in the southern ocean in partnership with spoondrift and the defence technology agency now one year later these buoys have traveled more than 6500 km and are currently crossing the stormy waters of the drake passage the body of water between south americaâs cape horn and the south shetland islands the southern ocean programme is helping understand waves in the region and their impact on the climate system the operation was led by metocean solutionsâ technical support liaison dr aitana forcãnvãzquez principal investigator for physical oceanography aboard the research vessel tangaroa on the science voyage to antarctica with niwa and the university of auckland drift track and significant wave heights measured over the last year âthe buoys were deployed in the southern ocean home to the strongest current on earth the antarctic circumpolar current the southern ocean is the circular ocean that flows uninterrupted around antarctica and occupies almost onequarter of all the worldâs oceans it plays an important role in the climate system cycling heat carbon and nutrients persistent storms and the lack of landmass in the southern ocean result in large fetches and strong winds  ideal conditions for generating large wavesâ states forcãnvãzquez metocean solutionsâ science development manager dr tom durrant says âthe waves generated in this region have farreaching effects contributing significantly to the wave climate in all the major ocean basins the new zealand west coast for example is periodically battered by large swell systems generated in southern ocean stormsâ this is the first time that this kind of wave buoy has been deployed in the southern ocean it is the perfect scenario to test the response of this new technology in an energetic open ocean if effective however they could revolutionize the way we monitor remote ocean basins through a constellation of drifting buoys dr aitana forcãnvãzquez principal investigator with metocean solutions aboard the research vessel tangaroa on the science voyage to antarctica with niwa and the university of auckland âthese buoys spotters are surprisingly easy to deploy very light and easy to handle and can be lowered in the water by hand using a line as a result you can deploy them in almost any kind of conditions which greatly facilitates southern ocean operationsâ complements forcãnvãzquez spoondrift developed the spotter buoy as a citizen sensor to drive distributed ocean sensing and democratized data access tim janssen ceo of spoondrift explains âthe spotter buoy is designed to be easy to use lowcost and solarpowered from the spotter dashboard the user can access data and change settings on the device the current generation spotters have a battery protection feature that triggers a hibernation mode during extreme temperatures and extended periods of darkness in the southern ocean winter spoondrift continuously innovates its technology to simplify deployments and provide highlatitude options to ensure continuous data acquisition in extreme conditionsâ in addition to the five drifting buoys metocean has the worldâs southernmost open ocean moored buoy which last year recorded the highest wave in the southern hemisphere in recognition of the importance of this programme of work this data is freely available to the scientific community metocean solutions is a sciencebased consultancy wholly owned by metservice metocean specializes in providing numerical modeling and analytical services
