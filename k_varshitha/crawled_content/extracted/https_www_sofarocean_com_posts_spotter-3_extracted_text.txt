including a barometer increased onboard compute power cellular telemetry efficiency enhancements and more â â new platform same core device while the spotter 3 platform unlocks a flurry of new features existing spotter users will be happy to know that the core competencies of spotter are unchanged you will get everything that came with the previous spotter generation including all of our previous ocean data outputs spotter dashboard and api features connectivity capabilities etc spotter 3 builds on this foundation strengthening the platform through a number of core upgrades and a plethora of gamechanging features the spotter 3 platform builds upon spotters robust existing capabilities and introduces a plethora of exciting new features â barometric pressure â one major upgrade is that the spotter 3 platform natively includes a barometer this is a significant milestone as it enables spotter to make direct atmospheric measurements for the first time and in turn increases situational awareness and adds a valuable data point for marine weather forecasting spotterâs barometer provides excellent accuracy    1 mbar 0âc to 50âc and has been rigorously tested at sea by our ocean science and engineering teams surface pressure variations are an important proxy for weather changes and as a result spotterâs barometer unlocks many new use cases for example the barometer helps us to more accurately measure water levels if for instance we connect a pressure sensor to the bottom of our smart mooring  we receive the pressure variations at that location which account for both atmospheric and water level changes in this scenario without a barometer we must make an assumption about changes in barometric pressure or set it to zero with a collocated barometer we can accurately correct for variations in barometric pressure at the surface in realtime this correction greatly improves the accuracy of water level measurements by up to 50cm in extreme cases the barometer also enhances some of the other new features included in the spotter 3 platform such as significant weather event detection which is enabled by a much more powerful processor more on this below a quartet of spotters en route to a deployment site to undergo atsea testing âspotter 3 provides a new foundation for continual development the combination of the powerful processor platform and cellular telemetry will support new features backed by nextgeneration embedded processing techniques and overtheair cellular firmware updates will allow deployed systems to soak up new capabilities as theyâre releasedâ  evan shapiro sofar ocean cto more onboard compute power less power consumption the spotter 3 platform offers 10x more onboard compute power while consuming 40 less energy this not only vastly improves spotterâs data processing capabilities but also dramatically increases its ability to operate continuously at extreme latitudes the massive jump in compute power increases the amount of data that can be processed onboard spotter itself and reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent to the cloud this preprocessing feature powers realtime alert systems eg significant weather event detection see barometer section the spotter 3 platformâs powersaving proficiency allows the buoy to continuously operate during extended periods of darkness which periodically occur in the extreme latitudes of the polar regions this upgrade will serve many use cases in these extreme environments including aquaculture solutions like those provided by mãrenot  and arctic research like that performed by teams from the university of tokyo  a spotter in the arctic ocean circa 2019 surrounded by grease ice and pancake ice efficiency enhancements unlocked by the spotter 3 platform will improve spotterâs reliability at higher latitudes we are really looking forward to what the new form of communication and lower power consumption will allow us to do with regards to more frequent data collection  mãrenot cellular connectivity delivering data from spotters in the ocean to dashboards and apis worldwide is no easy feat to date we have harnessed the power of iridium satellites to do so efficiently transmitting data from even the most remote patches of ocean metocean buoys past and present early sofar ocean customer fugro shared this sidebyside comparison of a legacy buoy and our basketballsized spotter for spotters deployed nearshore however we now also offer data delivery via a cellular connection cellularenabled devices are outfitted with an onboard broadband cellular modem with global coverage that allows for 100x more data to be transmitted at a fraction of the cost this capability increases sampling frequency and unlocks highbandwidth use cases that were previously impractical due to prohibitively high satellite data transfer costs one exciting use case powered by cellular is overtheair firmware upgrades which will allow users to remotely update deployed devices with new features as they become available spotterâs new cellular capability will add to â not replace â its existing iridium satellite connection spotterâs cellular connectivity was meticulously tested in a multicontinent effort from california to new zealand strong connections and seamless data delivery were the norm a quartet of spotters undergoing cellular testing devices were stresstested in areas with traditionally poor reception âwe are very excited about the ability to receive overtheair firmware updates the ability to access new features without replacing hardware is huge  ahec â increased usability and durability spotter is wellknown for its ease of use and its ability to withstand severe weather conditions in the open ocean with spotter 3 we raise the bar on both fronts from a usability standpoint numerous improvements were made to spotterâs ebox a new usbc connector streamlines the data transfer and power supply process a cleaner interface improves visibility during setup and deployment a shorter toggle switch guarantees issuefree activation and a pareddown desiccant storage system simplifies the pack replacement process the spotter 3 platform includes a wide range of usability and durability improvements durabilitywise spotter 3 is tougher than ever new water splash protection safeguards the usbc and sd card ports a heavyduty selfcontained flange provides 360 degree support for the ebox and a retention plate improves onboard cable management in fact spotter is now so rugged that we have started to deploy it from the air without a parachute these airdrops will help us accelerate deployments in very remote regions and unlock rapid deployments in front of extreme weather events check out this video to see what it looks like please note that these types of deployments require spotter to undergo special preparations to ensure inflight stabilization and should not be attempted with your own spotter that said we hope to support airdrop applications in the future âweâre grateful to the customers users and partners who collaborate with us and measure the worldâs oceans with sofar ocean technology after more than a year of development and worldwide testing our team is thrilled to launch spotter 3 and are even more excited about what this new platform will empower us to do nextâ  evan shapiro sofar ocean cto interested in learning
