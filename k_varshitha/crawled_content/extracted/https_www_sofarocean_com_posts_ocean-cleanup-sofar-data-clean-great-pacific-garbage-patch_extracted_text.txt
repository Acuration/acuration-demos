customer stories customer stories no items found how the ocean cleanup uses sofarâs metocean data to clean the great pacific garbage patch sofar ocean the gist the ocean cleanup develops technologies to help rid the worldâs oceans of plastic the majority of ocean plastic is found within five oceanic gyres with the largest one being the great pacific garbage patch gpgp lead computational modeler bruno saintrose combines sofarâs marine weather forecasts with spotter buoy data to better understand metocean conditions and plastic drift patterns near the gpgp this data increases the operational efficiency of the cleanup system the collaborators â the ocean cleanup is a nonprofit that develops and scales technologies to rid the ocean of plastic to date it has removed more than 178 million kg of trash from oceans and rivers around the world sofar ocean is a san franciscobased climate technology startup that is connecting the worldâs oceans to power a more sustainable future science society and industry use its spotter and smart mooring devices to collect realtime metocean data at and below the surface how the validation of forecasts and plastic drift tracks informs operational decisions the gpgp is one of the ocean cleanupâs primary areas of operation it is located halfway between california and hawaii and is the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world with an estimated surface area of 16 million square km to clean the gpgp two vessels operated by maersk drag an 800mlong ushaped barrier lovingly named âjennyâ through the debris field capturing large quantities of surface plastic in a retention zone periodically this plastic is extracted by boat and returned to shore for processing two maersk vessels dragging the ocean cleanups ushaped barrier photo courtesy of the ocean cleanup bruno and his team use sofarâs global wave forecast and historical and realtime spotter data accessed via the sofar api  to create a more comprehensive picture of ocean dynamics in the north pacific by increasing understanding of weather and currents in the region bruno is better equipped to recommend when where and how the cleanup system should be deployed using sofarâs marine weather and spotter api endpoints bruno integrates recent last 72 hours and realtime ocean surface and weather observations from the north pacific into his operational data science pipeline these observations are used to validate the ocean cleanupâs weather models as well as the performance of forecasts from ecmwf noaa and others if a forecast is consistent with the observations it is given priority prioritized forecasts inform key operational decisions including what route the cleanup system takes through the gpgp bruno also accesses the historical gps data for spotters in the north pacific the drift track of each device serves as a proxy for the drift track of plastic helping the ocean cleanup predict how and where plastic may accumulate in and around the gpgp the data also expands the ocean cleanupâs understanding of plastic transport during small and large scale convergences spotter drift tracks in the north pacific the ocean cleanup uses the tracks as proxies for the drift patterns of plastic making gonogo decisions using realtime ocean observations the ocean cleanup uses a two meter threshold for wave height â amongst other variables â to determine whether or not it is safe to extract the plastic collected by the cleanup system in the retention zone onto a vessel a transfer which requires careful coordination with crane and shortrange vessel operators can only occur during a calm weather window occasionally conflicting forecasts complicate the decision to greenlight a transfer some predict wave heights above two meters while others predict wave heights below two meters the opportunity cost of following the wrong forecast is large an extraction in inclement weather is dangerous while a day of inactivity leaves thousands of kgs of plastic uncollected inefficient operations like these increase the cost per kg of plastic collected a key performance indicator for the ocean cleanup to avoid these situations bruno uses the spottersâ insitu wave height observations to help identify the most accurate forecast and inform a gono go decision when operational forecasts conflict spotter observations are used to inform gonogo decisions to read more
