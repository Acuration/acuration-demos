ocean april 11 2023 ï back announcements announcements no items found star bulk and eagle bulk enhance voyage optimization capabilities with sofar oceanâs wayfinder platform sofar ocean star bulk nasdaq sblk and eagle bulk nyse egle two of the largest and best performing dry bulk carriers in the world will use sofars wayfinder platform to optimize voyages and reduce emissions across their fleets sofarâs wayfinder voyage optimization platform is easy to deploy and requires no hardware installation captains and operators around the world use wayfinderâs proactive and continuous route guidance to ensure that their vessels follow the most efficient path to port carriers trust wayfinder to accelerate decarbonization efforts amidst new regulations wayfinder customers and others across the maritime shipping industry are more eager than ever to operationalize strategies that drive decarbonization in the immediate term this sense of urgency is in part driven by new regulations issued by the international maritime organization â namely the carbon intensity indicator cii â that aim to decrease the shipping industryâs emissions by as much as 70 by 2050  star bulk and eagle bulk are longstanding proponents of voyage optimization as a strategy to reduce emissions today  this is characteristic of each carrierâs forwardthinking approach to operationalizing sustainability practices both companies are established leaders within the maritime shipping industry and have put emissions reductions at the core of their environmental social and governance esg roadmaps âstar bulk has been focusing on voyage optimization for several years to minimize our costs and reduce emissions and we are always on the lookout for new products that use advanced technologiesâ said george mantalos energy efficiency director at star bulk wayfinder will catalyze star bulk and eagle bulkâs efforts by continuously searching for the most efficient route for all of their vessels using the platform an optimized route can decrease a vesselâs exposure to inclement weather reduce its fuel consumption and lower its emissions output wayfinder customers see an average of 35 fuel and time savings per voyage and annual fleetwide emissions reductions of tens of thousands of metric tonnes of co 2  access to realtime data and highly accurate forecasts are key differentiators as climate change makes ocean weather more extreme a visualization comparing an optimized route suggested by sofarâs wayfinder platform pink line and the vesselâs active nonoptimized route black line wayfinderâs optimized recommendation proactively routes the vessel around a storm system along its active route saving the ship fuel time and money and lowering its emissions output wayfinderâs optimization advantage starts with its enhanced weather forecasts whereas most platforms simply use government models â produced by organizations like the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the european centre for mediumrange weather forecasts ecmwf â as the foundation for their forecasts sofar augments them by assimilating 200000 realtime ocean observations captured by our global spotter buoy network each day these forecasts outperform government models by 4050  the ability to collect realtime data along a vesselâs route is key in providing increased value for captains and operators for captains ground truth observations translate to more trustworthy route guidance and represent an opportunity to improve the safety of the crew and cargo safety is of particular concern given the increasing frequency and intensity of severe ocean weather caused by climate change for shoreside teams the realtime data improves their ability to predict the impact of individual routing decisions and to optimize the commercial outcomes of every voyage âwhat we like about sofarâs services is that they use a large network of ocean weather sensors to improve the accuracy of weather forecastingâ said mantalos âwe expect that this should allow us to further optimize our fleetâs routes and speedsâ wayfinderâs vessel performance models and optimization engine power superior daily voyage guidance sofarâs highly accurate weather forecasts enable wayfinder to predict the conditions along a vesselâs route to predict how a particular vessel will behave in those conditions wayfinder uses its vessel performance model adaptivevpmâ the hybrid physics and datadriven module which is customtuned for every vessel using wayfinder predicts ship speed and fuel consumption across all sea states with a high degree of accuracy on average wayfinder produces speed predictions within 05 knots and fuel consumption predictions within 2 of metric tons consumed these predictions coupled with highly accurate weather forecasts power wayfinderâs optimization engine repeatedly over the course of a voyage wayfinder considers hundreds of millions of route options before sending daily waypoint and rpm guidance these proactive and continuous recommendations take into account the latest weather forecasts market factors and safety constraints further distinguishing wayfinder from alternatives and ensuring that star bulk and eagle bulkâs vessels are always on the most efficient path to port âeagle bulk has a track record for leveraging data to make the best decisionsâ said jonathan dowsett director of fleet performance at eagle bulk âsofar oceanâs realtime sensorderived ocean data allows our onboard and shoreside teams to dynamically optimize speed and routing decisions with safety cost and emissions benefitsâ the dashboard of sofarâs wayfinder voyage optimization platform captains and operators use the dashboard to compare active and suggested routes view highly accurate ocean weather forecasts monitor safety alerts and track key vessel performance metrics like fuel consumption emissions output and voyage cost climate tech and maritime shipping build towards a sustainable future climate technology is helping many industries decarbonize and will play a key role in maritime shippingâs green transition sofar is actively working with star bulk eagle bulk and other wayfinder customers to add expanded emissions tracking capabilities to the platform including new cii optimization tools for sofar ocean cofounder and ceo tim janssen star bulk and eagle bulkâs commitments validate sofarâs sciencebased and datadriven approach to helping the shipping industry meet its sustainability goals âfor this massive sector of the world economy to decarbonize shipping companies will need access to reliable ocean informationâ said janssen âthis is our focus at sofar ocean we collect ocean data at a planetary scale and use it to produce the most accurate weather forecasts to catalyze maritime solutions that preserve ocean health our partnerships with star bulk and eagle bulk further this mission and we look forward to empowering them and the shipping industry atlarge to reduce emissions
