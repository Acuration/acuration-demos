Eco Wave Power installs Spotter Buoy
Sofar Ocean
Eco Wave Power is pioneering in its field by operating the ONLY grid connected wave energy array in the world, which is connected to the grid in accordance with a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). EWPâs smart and simple system is comprised of floaters which move up and down with the motion of the waves to create clean electricity.
More precisely, the movement of the floaters compresses and decompresses hydraulic pistons which transmit biodegradable hydraulic fluid into land located accumulators. Pressure is built inside the accumulators, rotating a hydraulic motor, which rotates a generator, transferring the electricity into the grid, via an inverter.
Eco Wave Power recently installed a Spotter buoy at their Gibraltar wave energy power station.Â
The installation process was simple and clear, and was conducted by their power station manager. The buoy provides important data such as wave height, wave period, wave direction and wind data.
âSpotter provides integral information as it allows to conduct accurate measurements of wave height, period and direction in the exact location of our wave energy power station, thereby providing us with the possibility to perform a high accuracy comparison between the wave characteristics and the energy produced,â said Marina Gurevich of Eco Wave Power.Â
Sofar worked closely with Eco Wave Power on the development of the mooring design for Spotter. Sofar also directed EWP on the best placement of Spotter to help them capture the best data possible for their project.Â
Currently Eco Wave Power holds a significant project pipeline of more than 190MW worldwide and is looking forward to installing the first grid connected commercial scale wave farm in the world.
