cost sofar ocean december 23 2022 ï back product product spotter system send more ocean data for less using high data rate hdr mode sofar ocean spotter 3âs high data rate hdr mode sends 1000x more data at a fraction of the cost accessing the data collected by marine sensing devices is traditionally an expensive process typically data transmission occurs via satellite a powerful solution that is limited by high costs to send 200 kb worth of data via iridium for example expenses can exceed 100 spotter 3  the third generation of sofarâs spotter buoy platform offers a new alternative each device is outfitted with an onboard cellular modem which makes it possible to transfer data using existing global cellular infrastructure these cellular transfers enable spotter 3 to send 1000x more data at a fraction of the cost via the new high data rate hdr mode in nearshore environments this unlocks highbandwidth use cases that were previously impractical due to high satellite data transfer costs hdr allows for flexible control of spectral processing and makes it possible to send full wave displacement timeseries data to the sofar backend reduces reliance on spotterâs onboard sd card with more data sent via hdr less effort and time needs to be spent physically recovering the sd card high costs constrain spotter data transfers via satelliteâ prior to the introduction of hdr spotter data could only be transmitted via satellite to keep costs reasonable the amount and type of data transmitted is regulatedâ to reduce the size of the satellite data transfer the data is first preprocessed and compressed to meet the constraints of the preset spotter data mode  waves standard waves partition waves spectrum or track in each data mode the full timeseries of the spotterâs movement displacement data is stored on the onboard sd card to analyze and process the stored data the sd card needs to be physically retrieved from the deployed device the fastest data update rate possible excluding track is 30 minutes in waves standard this approach to data transmission remains effective particularly in the open ocean where cellular infrastructure is nonexistent for nearshore applications however hdr is a more powerful and costeffective solution how hdr transmits more data at a faster rate spotter 3s cellularenabled high data rate hdr mode allows full timeseries data to be transmitted to the spotter dashboard and api cellular telemetry dramatically lowers transmission costs eliminating the need to preprocess and compress spotter data into preset data modes using hdr you can transmit full timeseries data directly to the spotter dashboard and api first hdr sends compressed and preprocessed time series data over cellular to sofarâs backend servers the dataâs absolute location history is then reconstructed and filtered to generate the wave displacement data that previously would have been stored on spotterâs sd card that data is propagated across the three wave data modes waves standard waves partition waves spectrum  giving you instant access to a more comprehensive dataset at no additional cost hdr samples at 25hz and processing rates can be configured to as short as 5 minutes by shifting the computational load from spotterâs onboard computer to unconstrained servers on land hdr increases your access to data and enables more flexible and powerful analysis techniques how to enable hdr if you have a spotter 3 that is using firmware version v230 or higher you can enable hdr mode to do so please email us at supportsofaroceancom once enabled the hdr processing rate can be configured on the spotter dashboard data sent using hdr can be accessed via the sofar api see documentation  or by downloading csv files from the spotter dashboard hdr is a significant step forward for spotterâs ocean data collection and transmission capabilities new analysis options such as spectral and time partitioning different tuning and filtering capabilities and the removal of spikes in low energy conditions are forthcoming if you have feedback about hdr ideas for future features or any questions please feel free to send us an email at supportsofaroceancom
