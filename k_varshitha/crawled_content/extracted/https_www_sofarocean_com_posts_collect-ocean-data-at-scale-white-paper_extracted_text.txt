White paper: Why deploying a network of marine sensing systems is the key to collecting ocean data at scale
Sofar Ocean
Marine sensing is in the midst of a strategic shift. To collect in situ ocean data at scale, government, industry, and the research community are increasingly using robust networks of rapidly deployable and cost-effective sensing systems in place of traditional solutions. These distributed fleets of devices seamlessly gather and transmit real-time observations at scale, helping power commercial ocean industries and climate research.
In this white paper, we dissect this strategic shift and present a trio of case studies featuring Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, Kyoto University, and Luode Consulting, all of which have successfully deployed networks of marine sensing systems.
