Backyard Buoys makes a splash! Our first buoy was deployed by the Quileute Tribe on May 3, 2023. This buoy will be out for a short deployment to test mooring design and data collection modes in the spring wave conditions off La Push, WA. Quileute Tribe fishers leaving La Push harbor must navigate wave conditions at the Quillayute River mouth and do not have a clear view of the wave conditions past James Island. Local implementation of the Backyard Buoys program will provide them with real-time wave data to support critical go/no-go decisions.

Our real-time wave data smartphone app is currently in production. For now, you can check out snapshots of the data from our prototype app. The app will allow users to see summary data, time series, and set thresholds on wave height, wave period, and wind based on their safety ranges. The app also provides a place to add messages, so other on-the-water context may be shared among users.
