science analysis spotter data spotlight gulf of mexico a deep dive on impactful spotter data collected in the gulf of mexico melanie feen march 30 2022 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis spotter data spotlight gulf of mexico melanie feen the gulf of mexico is a busy body of water it is a key international maritime corridor the drainage basin for the mighty mississippi river the center of the us petroleum industry and the coastal home of over 15 million people mckinney et al 2021 its economic and environmental importance both domestically and abroad cannot be overstated understanding the gulfâs weather and hydrology therefore is paramount and accurate realtime ocean data is the key to comprehension such actionable insights allow us to monitor complex currents hurricanes the spread of pollutants fisheries etc and better equip the gulf region to protect its marine ecosystem â sofar ocean is a key player in this data collection effort sofar had 24 spotter buoys deployed in the gulf of mexico from october 22nd 2021 to january 31st 2022 each of which gathered compelling wave and sea surface temperature insights as it drifted throughout the region below weâll discuss what these spotters revealed about the gulf of mexicoâs loop current and highlight their top notch wave monitoring performance particularly during severe weather the loop current when the warm salty waters of the gulf stream flow through the yucatãn channel and into the gulf of mexico the currentâs path can vary with time sometimes the warm water current flows into the florida strait and up along the east coast of the us other times the current forms a loop within the gulf itself a phenomenon known conveniently as the loop current  in the visualization below watch as three spotter buoys gradually drift through the florida strait and up the eastern seaboard while multiple buoys enter the loop current visible as a hollow orange loop in the eastern section of the gulf note each black dot represents a spotter and each colored marker represents an observation of sea surface temperature redder means warmer bluer means colder sometimes when the loop current migrates far enough west into the gulf of mexico eddies â ocean currents moving in circular patterns â will form and split off from the current in the visualization below watch as one of the spotters travels in both a loop current eddy and the loop current itself the subsequent screenshot identities the location of each spotter âspot010136â orange path starts in the loop current eddy before drifting into the loop current itself eventually the spotter travels through the florida strait and up the eastern seaboard â what is the significance of the loop current and its eddies the warm water of each feeds storms with heat giving them the energy they need to intensify during the devastating hurricane katrina for example the loop current and a loop current eddy increased the stormâs strength goni et al 2009 knowing this realtime monitoring of the behavior of the loop current and its eddies is critical a task that sofarâs spotter network as demonstrated above is equipped to take on wave forecasts accurate wave forecasts are critical for a variety of stakeholders including the maritime industry the government coastal communities and oceanographers amongst many others to improve wave forecasts in the gulf of mexico and across the globe sofar assimilates buoy spectral wave data into global operational wave forecasts by comparing predicted significant wave heights to buoy measured wave heights in the gulf during the october 22nd 2021 to january 31st 2022 spotter deployment period the performance of sofarâs operational model can be evaluated against noaaâs global forecast system gfs relative to noaa gfs forecasted significant wave height the sofar model showed improvements across all forecast hours meaning it predicted values closer to the true significant wave heights measured by the spotter buoys  the most significant improvement was observed in nowcast measurements which is logical because sofarâs data assimilation step improves upon the initial model using realtime observations in turn the improved initial model produced more accurate forecasts even just two days into the future the noaa forecasts yellow have larger error rmse for all forecasted hours compared to the sofar operational model blue lower error means that the sofar model predicts values closer to the true significant wave heights measured by our spotter buoys additionally the sofar model performed particularly well during severe weather during a storm on january 16 2022 for instance spotter buoys measured significant wave heights upward of 56 m 184 ft global forecasts underestimated the waves associated with this low pressure system producing a nowcast with waves 05 m 16 ft smaller than the waves predicted by the sofar model as the spotter buoy network continues to grow so too will sofarâs ability to track weather activity in the gulf of mexico by assimilating observations from spotter buoys and bringing modelsâ initial states closer to observed values the gulf region will be better prepared to monitor currents track hurricanes and safeguard coastal communities and economies for more insights check out the sofar blog  â references  goni gustavo mark demaria john knaff
