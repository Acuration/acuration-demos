incorporates spotters into their design process for floating solar systems on the sea sofar ocean this blog was written by sahir khan and verena wiesbauer of swimsol gmbh swimsol is an austrianmaldivian company that is specialized in developing floating solar systems for marine environments our journey can be traced back to 2009 when a visit to the maldives prompted the realization that while sunshine and space within its many lagoons is plentiful available land area for solar installations is in short supply to overcome this limitation the idea of environmentally friendly floating solar platforms for tropical islands was born image 1 fully operational system at lux resort south ari atoll maldives image 2 marine life growing on one of our early prototypes â image 3

usjapan at present our systems are designed to operate within the shallower waters of tropical islandreef lagoons our aim is to expand our area of operations to the deeper and less sheltered waters of maldivian intraatoll lagoons this will act as our next step towards designing systems for nearshore and ultimately offshore deployments worldwide in order to do so however we need to develop a better understanding of the environmental conditions in such locations this is where spotter comes in until recently we have relied mostly on pressurebased devices to conduct insitu wave and tide measurements these can be very accurate but come with some limitations including significant signal attenuation with depth an inability to resolve wave directions and challenging setups for streaming data from remote locations spotters are a natural solution to many of these challenges as they can be deployed in any depth provide a richer picture of wind as well as wave conditions via their directional measurement capabilities and are able to stream data in nearreal time to our design offices in vienna from virtually anywhere in the world as such we no longer need to wait for months at a time to revisit and collect data from our insitu devices before incorporating measurements into our design process â image 5 wave model test results for maldives image 4 spotter test deployment near our operational platforms at ozen by atmosphere resort  south male atoll maldives spotters can also be used to validate numerical wave models via the comparison of twodimensional wave spectra swimsol is currently investigating the suitability of wave modelling for the maldives and hopes that deployments of wellplaced spotters will play an important role in calibrating as well as validating such models in turn this will help to bridge the gap between shortduration insitu measurements and long duration predictions for generating improved design criteria for our floating systems since obtaining our first spotter approximately one year ago we have already gained valuable experience with conducting wave measurements in tropical lagoons this has included modifying the mooring to balance free movement of the spotter in shallow coralfilled waters with longterm reliability avoiding rope tangling under occasional calm conditions and learning to react quickly to spotter alerts and unexpected surprises a memorable incident included having our spotter âborrowedâ and taken on a multiday tour of several islands before we successfully located and recovered it thanks to its solarpowered gps tracking system â image 6 path taken by our spotter it was recovered undamaged several days later just north of hulhumale thanks to its gps âtrackmodeâ feature image 7 marine biologist and spotter deployment expert verena wiesbauer left and swimsol maldives office manager rifasa faiz right with the recovered measurement buoy â overcoming such challenges has been an excellent teambuilding exercise between swimsolâs rd team in vienna and the deployment team in the maldives the ability to request deployments or adjustments at short notice from the other side of the world and to see this reflected via the sofar dashboard in realtime is a uniquely special part of our spotter story we are confident that the future holds even more rewarding challenges for swimsol and our spotters â sofar
