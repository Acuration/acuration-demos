documentation cellular support documentation overview the third generation of our spotter platform includes an array of new features  including cellular connectivity an onboard broadband cellular modem with global coverage allows for 1000x more data to be transmitted at a fraction of the cost this increases sampling frequency unlocks overtheair firmware updates and enables higher bandwidth data modes spotterâs new cellular capability will add to â not replace â its existing iridium satellite connection view full spotter 3 documentation user interface explanation of user leds system go signal status all solid green â cellular data is available ready to deploy solid red signalâ led â cellular data is not available if deployed unit will still be able to use iridium connection your cellularequipped spotter will communicate over a present and consistent cellular network generally speaking if you are able to send and receive sms messages with a cellular phone from a location your spotter will also be able to communicate over cellular from that location the best way to confirm that your spotter has cellular connection is to ensure that the signal led is green at the point of deployment regional factors such as tower elevation network consistency and local weather will affect connection strength coverage simâ card your cellularequipped spotter is powered by a flexible platform created by blues wireless  blues wireless delivers connectivity over a wide range of networks and bandwidths using a preprovisioned global embedded sim card at this time third party and userinstalled sim cards are not compatible with spotter if this is a requirement for your use case please contact us at salessofaroceancom spotterâs cellular capability will generally be compatible with one or more major carriers in the following countriesregions north america ðºð usa ðð canada ð²ð½ mexico rest of the world ðªðº european union ððº australia ð³ð new zealand ððµ japan ðð south africa ðð chile cellular coverage is available in hundreds of other countriesregions but may be restricted to certain carriers or networks or may be subject to regulations or requirements around sending and receiving data if you donât see your country listed above or have a question about whether or not a specific cellular carrier is compatible with your spotter please fill out the form below cellular data plan pricing your cellularequipped spotter comes with 12 months of free cellular data with up to five minute updates and no bandwidth limitations for current applications after the first 12 months cellular data access costs 20 per month  â high data rate hdr your cellularequipped spotter is not subject to the data cost constraints typical of iridiumonly spotters using high data rate hdr you can send much more rich data and do so frequently with processing rates configurable to intervals as short as 15 minutes in the iridium data modes  wave displacement xyz movement is computed onboard and processed into bulk statistics partitioned statistics or full spectrum data which are sent over iridium to your spotter dashboard and api your cellularequipped spotter is able to send the wave displacement time series directly to the cloud allowing for far greater flexibility in analysis to learn more about hdr check our our blog post  if you have questions about your operationâs cellular data needs please reach out to salessofaroceancom  tip using the spotter dashboard you can adjust your spotters cellular data processing rate to intervals of 15 20 30 and 60 minutes your devices cellular connection is constantly monitored under device status overtheair updates your spotters cellular connection enables overtheair firmware updates allowing you to remotely update your deployed device with new features as they become available to initiate an overtheair firmware update please email us at supportsofaroceancom  iridium fallback behavior if cellular transmission fails for three consecutive hours default on your spotter it will revert to using iridium in this satellite fallback mode there will be an indication in the dashboard that a unit canât connect to cellular spotter will periodically attempt to reconnect to a cellular connection satellite fallback mode will continue to evolve with the release of future versions of spotterâs firmware sd card insertion notes when inserting or checking the sd card please make sure the card is properly seated the system led will turn red if the card is not seated correctly for more information about sd card use please
