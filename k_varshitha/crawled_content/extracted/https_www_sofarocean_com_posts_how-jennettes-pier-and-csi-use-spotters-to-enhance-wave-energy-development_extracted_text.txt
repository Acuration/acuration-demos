studies institute summer interns image aboveâ dr mike muglia during a test article deployment for the waves to water prize competition at jennetteâs pier the spotter buoy in the background is deployed at one of two mhk test sites at the pier the coastal studies institute csi is a multiinstitutional research and education facility of the university of north carolina system located on the ecu outer banks campus on roanoke island csiâs research focuses on a variety of coastal disciplines including coastal dynamics biology ecology environmental geography engineering social and behavioral studies and economics the multidisciplinary approach provides thorough solutions to complex problems while embracing the unique history culture and environment of coastal communities in northeastern north carolinaâ in addition to institutional partnerships csi has an ongoing relationship with nc aquariumsâ jennetteâs pier the pier is located in nags head nc approximately five miles from csi and has an annual public visitation of about 250000 people per year in partnership with jennetteâs pier csi operates a renewable ocean energy testing site at the pier there are currently two sofar spotter buoys deployed on either side of jennettes pier at the offshore corners of two permitted marine hydrokinetic energy mhk device test areas the spotter buoys provide measurements of directional wave spectra and water temperature crucial for the development and testing of mhk devices csi is also one of four recently appointed institutional members of the newly founded atlantic marine energy center amec other partners include lehigh university stony brook and the university of new hampshire amec plans to make jennetteâs pier an accredited testing facility available to international researchers and private industry partners interested in testing in the unique marine environment of the outer banksâ currently the buoys provide competitors in the department of energyâs waves to water prize w2w with crucial data on the local wave environment the w2w competition challenges innovators to create wavepowered desalination systems with the intention of accelerating the development of small modular wavepowered desalination systems that can provide potable drinking water to coastal communities in disaster relief settings in partnership with the doe and the national renewable energy lab nrel csi will host the drink stage of the competition in april 2022 at jennetteâs pier the data collected from the spotter buoys will help competitors prepare their devices for the conditions they will be facing in the testing phase of the competition next aprilâ â the two buoys are also serving as an experimental site for characterizing the biofouling community of the area and evaluating clearsignalâs biofouling protection coatingâ biofouling is the accumulation of marine organisms on underwater surfaces it is one of the biggest factors affecting the cost operation maintenance and data quality of oceanographic instrumentation and can also be detrimental to the operation performance and maintenance of mhk devices clearsignalâs coating is a siliconebased nonstick nontoxic material used to prevent the buildup of biofouling with the two sofar buoys deployed off of jennetteâs pier setting up an experiment was simple one buoy is clearsignal coated while the other is not researchers in the dubbs lab at csi and peralta lab at east carolina university will collect samples from the buoys for dna analysis to better understand the variety of biofouling organisms local to north carolinaâs coast and how the communities on the two buoys differ csi will also compare the performance and operational maintenance time of the two buoys csi aims to undertake research offer educational opportunities and provide community outreach and great strides are being made to accomplish these goals with the addition of the sofar spotter buoys to its research infrastructure the spotter buoys not only encourage researchers to innovate but also allow visitors and residents of the local community to see learn from and engage in csiâs researchâ sofar in the news in the news october 23 2023
