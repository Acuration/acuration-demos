ocean science analysis what is biofouling and how can we stop it biofouling impacts everything from ocean buoys to massive cargo ships hereâs what marine biofouling is and how we can prevent it nick raymond february 3 2021 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis what is biofouling and how can we stop it nick raymond photo creditâ nick raymond biofouling has plagued the marine shipping industry for decades if not centuries but the implications of biofouling have a farreaching effect beyond disrupting oceanic logistics and transportationâ marine biofouling presents an extensive challenge for industries in developing technologies particularly in the marine renewable energy sector  these companies rely on submerged equipment to capture offshore wind wave and tidal energy but biofouling can make it difficult to keep equipment clean and operational biofouling requires constant maintenance of infrastructure and the use of special materials to protect these important investments in our futureâ letâs explore specifically what biofouling is and ways to combat biofouling to support the future of marine renewable energyâ what is biofouling biofouling or biological fouling is the accumulation of microorganisms plants algae or small animals on wet surfaces that have a mechanical function causing structural or other functional deficiencies there are two phases or types of biofouling microfouling and macrofouling microfouling refers to the formation of biofilm that adheres to the surface macrofouling refers to the attachment of organisms such as barnacles soft corals and seaweed to produce a fouling community whether a surface is threatened by microfouling or macrofouling â and the degree to which it is âinfectedâ â is influenced by a few different factors temperature plays a significant role in the settlement of microorganisms as temperature plays a role in the growth rate and breeding periods of marine animals geographical location also plays a role so does species diversity and the amount of solar radiation which directly affects photosynthesis pollution can reduce solar radiation thereby reducing the number of plants nutrients and species in the environment or pollution can increase the number of nonnative species in marine hardsubstrate communities speeding up biofoulingâ there are four key phases to biofouling that are determined by these factors first the structure or surface gets submerged in the process organic carbon is absorbed onto the wetted submerged surfaceâ image credit nick raymond image creditâ nick raymond next the primary colonizers arrive diatoms and bacteria that settle onto this organic carbonenriched surfaceâ image creditâ nick raymond image creditâ nick raymond image creditâ nick raymond these primary colonizers are followed by protozoa and macroalgae spore secondary colonizers who bring on the process of microfouling formation image creditâ nick raymond image creditâ nick raymond image creditâ nick raymond image creditâ nick raymond this step increases the roughness of the surface creating the perfect condition for macrofouling when tertiary colonizers and particles adhere to the surfaceâ image creditâ nick raymond image creditâ nick raymond this entire process can take as little as three weeks it seems innocuous â just some organisms making their home on a new structure â but it can actually cause big problems for emerging marine technologiesâ what are the dangers of biofouling biofouling has presented problems to ocean buoys and buoy moorings for quite a few years for buoys like sofar oceanâs spotter  microfouling leads to a buildup of âslimeâ and other organisms on the solar panels impeding the buoyâs power production the biggest risk is that the spotter can run out of power and stop workingâ photo creditâ nick raymond macrofouling leads to bigger issues for ocean buoys  in this phase organisms increase in size and weight changing the hydrodynamic volume of the spotter buoy and dragging it under the surface if the unit is submerged below the surface of the water it will not function properlyâ â leaving scientists with incomplete dataâ biofouling on buoys is a small annoyance compared to this phenomenonâs impact on the marine renewable energy sector not only is it expensive to routinely clean surfaces but longterm repair and maintenance may require significant investment macrofouling can lead to corrosion from organisms that use endogenous compounds to adhere to surfaces worse still corrosion is often accelerated when protective coating on the surface is removed in the process of removing the attached organismâ â â maritime shipping and logistics companies face challenges in vessel marine performance related to macrofouling too â challenges that can have longterm environmental consequences âincreased roughness presented by a heavily fouled ship hull can result in powering penalties of up to 86 at cruising speed even relatively light fouling by diatom slimes can generate a 10â16 penaltyâ reported nature communications  âwithout effective antifouling af measures in order to maintain speed fuel consumption and therefore greenhouse gas emissions increase significantlyââ finally macrofouling leads to the spread of nonnative species to new environments when organisms attach themselves to the hull of a ship they are able to traverse the ocean and reproduce in new ecosystems these new areas are vulnerable to alien species which can disrupt delicate food chains and destroy the natural habitat of atrisk organisms how can we prevent this from happening ways to combat biofouling clearly biofouling is a problem â one that many researchers and scientists are working to addressâ â microfouling can be quickly resolved by scrubbing the affected surface of the ocean buoy because microfouling is an early stage of biofouling itâs easily resolved with regular care for laterstage macrofouling thatâs reducing the marine performance of vessels more comprehensive hull cleaning is requiredâ photo creditâ nick raymond but for the shipping and marine renewable energy industries regular hull cleaning isnât economically feasible companies are instead investigating whether new materials can be used to repel the invasion of small organisms ârecent years have seen a resurgence of interest in the fundamental science behind the processes involved in biofouling and in the design of novel coatings and other noncoating technologiesâ reported nature communications â in the past ships relied on antifouling materials such as tributyltin oxide to prevent biofouling these materials have since been shown to be toxic and to harm marine environments and as a result have been banned or restricted instead the shipping industry has been exploring hydrophobic foulrelease coatings copperfree antifouling paints and nano antifouling coatings that create a slippery surface preventing organisms from sticking â biofouling is not a new problem but it is one that needs to be overcome for the marine renewable energy industry to thrive â not to mention the various research efforts that rely on marine buoys to provide good data with the maritime shipping industry investing time and energy to develop antifouling materials the fight against macro and microfouling seems promising sofar in the news in the news october 23 2023 wayfinder
