White Paper: The unexpected cost (and benefit) of weather for maritime shipping companies
Sofar Ocean
It is no secret that weather affects a vessel's performance at sea, and in this white paper we quantify it. We highlight the outsized impact of wave resistance and use real voyage data to calculate annual weather-related fuel cost and emissions output for a typical bulk carrier and container ship. We also detail how voyage optimization solutions that use highly accurate weather forecasts â like Sofar's Wayfinder platform â minimize weather resistance and maximize time spent in favorable weather throughout an entire voyage.
