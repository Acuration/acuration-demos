pttep â introduction ptt exploration and production public company limited pttep is a flagship thai oil and gas company with a mission to ensure a reliable source of energy supply and deliver sustainable values to all stakeholders due to the nature of the business the majority of pttep operations are located offshore adding to pttepâs duty to be a conscientious steward of the ocean as part of its responsibility pttep works to find new solutions to help protect the environment in which many of its employees spend their lives working challenge as part of its commitment to improving sustainable development pttep decided to create an âocean for lifeâ program with the goal of improving thailandâs marine biodiversity and restoring marine resources of course in order to develop effective policies and achieve its goals the team needed to start with a solid understanding of the longterm oceanographic trends in the areas of interestwhich is where sofar ocean came into the picture solution through dialogue with various stakeholders and local authorities the project team developed an approach they called the âgreen buoy for blue oceanâ project the goal was two fold 1 to help generate clean energy from ocean waves and sunlight that would 2 power a series of oceanographic sensors cameras and communications systems that would start to provide baseline observations for the âocean for lifeâ programâ for their initial deployment the team focused on monitoring coral reef bleaching at koh man nai rayong province in thailand the team also wanted to ensure that the data was displayed in realtime so that any interested party would have access to contribute to the study as the team was designing this âgreen buoy for blue oceanâ system with local partners and academic institutions they started to run into integration challenges due to the varying needs of the complex systems they were bringing online while the team continued working on integrating their various devices they also found that the sofar spotter with smart mooring capabilities served as the ideal platform for their baseline needs as it met most of their initial requirementswith the added benefit of providing realtime wave data benefits pttepâs custom solution and the sofar spotter  smart mooring platform were deployed in march 2021 with support from the sofar team the team at pttep was able to ensure that hardware and software was configured as needed for the missionâ since its deployment the pttep team has been impressed with the spotter  smart mooring platformâs performance the team uses the sofar devices to measure all aspects of wave data including significant wave height and period which have become vital for their site characterization studies in understanding and assessing wave energy potential in combination with their existing wave energy converters the team has been able to more clearly understand the real energy conversion efficiency of their power generation devices by comparing power outputs with actual live data recorded by the spotter  smart mooring platform from the same location pttep is using this data and learnings from the deployment to develop an improved version of their âgreen buoys for blue oceanâ prototype to deploy later this year although initially thought of as a backup device the spotter  smart mooring platform have also been an integral part of helping advance their understanding of wave energy potential at this specific site and will be once again deployed in parallel with the next version of the green buoys hardware â koh
