touch ocean science ocean science analysis the importance of buoy observations to marine weather forecasts marine weather is slightly different than onshore weather and monitoring it effectively is a challenge emily heaslip august 15 2021 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis the importance of buoy observations to marine weather forecasts emily heaslip expert marine modellers are engineering increasingly efficient tools and technologies to ensure smooth sailing on the high seas and innovate oceanographic research around the world drifting and moored buoys developed for durability and longevity are widely favored for their easy deployments marine weather forecasts that assimilate data from networks of lowcost insitu sensors are uniquely predictive pioneering the democratization of ocean data what is marine weather marine weather refers to the atmospheric and wave conditions at sea like onshore weather forecasts marine weather will cover wind unlike onshore weather marine weather isnt limited to predicting if it will be rainy or sunny instead marine weather accounts for swell fronts  and wind for instance the nws marine forecast for off the coast of massachusetts and rhode island on august 11 readsâ âa few surface troughs move through today through friday bringing isolated to scattered showers and storms a cold front sweeps across the waters late on friday or saturday before high pressure builds in late in on sunday and into early next weekâ seas are reported as significant wave height which is the average of the highest third of the waves individual wave heights may be more than twice the significant wave heightââ a marine weather forecast predicts a few thingsâ 1 wind speed and direction 2 wave heights and periods 3 roughness of nearshore waters 4 significant weather such as storms and hurricanes marine forecasts are slightly more difficult to make than onshore weather forecasts this is because marine forecasts cover large areas of the ocean as a result forecasted elements are often expressed as a range rather than a specific metricâ âthe ranges represent average conditions over a period of time usually 12 hours and the actual conditions may be lower or higher than the forecast range boaters should plan for conditions above and below the predicted rangesâ explained the national weather service  monitoring offshore weather is important for the shipping industry and recreational boaters alike offshore weather can change rapidly for big vessels getting marine weather wrong can impact 80 of the ships performance â â how can we monitor marine weather marine weather conditions can be monitored by a few different methods and technologies there are various organizations located around the world such as the national weather service nws branch of the noaa in the us and the maritime  coastguard agency mca branch of the met office in the ukâ these organizations use a combination of satellites moored buoys drifting buoys ships aircraft and landbased observation stations to monitor marine weather conditions and the weather models in use by noaa ecmwf and others are remarkably accurateâ where marine weather forecasting struggles is in the range of data collection methods the combination of buoys aircraft satellites and other collection methods makes it difficult to forecast marine weather with a high degree of accuracy marine weather forecasting is still limited by lack of data reporting inconsistencies and the persistent difficulty of collecting information from remote areasâ read more why marine weather forecasts are so inaccurate  and how to improve them â â â sofar ocean provides open and accessible marine data services to provide observation forecast and hindcast weather data from sofars global spotter network realtime observation data from sofars network makes their marine weather forecasts up to 50 more accurate than noaa and ecmwf with sights set on quadrupling their global network of buoys in the next 12 months sofar oceans marine weather forecasts help ship captains make smarter decisions to save on fuel optimize routing and deliver on timeâ to learn more about maritime weather forecasting visit the sofar ocean blog marine weather is hardly as straightforward as it sounds what we see on the surface is a sliver of the story marine weather is a dynamic mosaic of waves winds and temperature that requires specialized technology and expert knowledge to measure and predict fluctuating winds and shifting swells puts lives and assets at risk the precision and accuracy of marine weather forecasts
