science analysis tracking changes in surface currents climate change is causing a weakening of ocean surface currents â heres what that means and why tracking surface currents is so important emily heaslip january 1 2021 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis tracking changes in surface currents emily heaslip many studies have shown how climate change is wreaking havoc on our oceans and world warming sea temperatures more powerful storms rising sea levels are all quickly becoming a realityâ this year ocean currents have been the focus of numerous studies and unfortunately research is showing that key ocean current systems like the gulf stream are weakening â the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc released a report this fall that projects the socalled âconveyor beltâ of currents around the planet will weaken by as much as a third by 2100 if emissions continue at their current rate this would trigger a domino effect of changes from floods to higher sea levels and more extreme weatherâ tracking changes in surface currents has never been more important ocean currents impact far more than just marine travel â hereâs why researchers are increasingly concerned about surface currents based on new dataâ why are ocean currents important there are two types of ocean currents  surface currents and deep water currents deepwater currents make up 90 of the ocean and refer to water that is driven around the oceans by density temperature and salinity and gravity surface currents make up the other 10 of water in the ocean these currents move throughout the upper 400 meters of the ocean surface currents are typically winddriven which means water moves both vertically and horizontally horizontal surface currents are those which we experience regularly things like rip currents longshore currents and tidal currents vertical movements are known as upwelling and downwelling â where cold water rises toward the surface and pushes warmer less dense water downwardâ these currents are a crucial part of our meteorological system as national geographic describes âfram strait and the waters to the south in the greenland norwegian and irminger seas make up the control room of a global âconveyor beltâ of currents that stretches the length of the planet only in this region and one other in the antarctic does water at the sea surface become heavy enoughâdense with cold and saltâto sink all the way to the seafloor and race downhill along the deepening ocean bottom that sinking powers the conveyor known as the atlantic meridional overturning circulation or amocâwhich in turn regulates temperatures and weather around the worldââ a slowing of currents has farreaching impact on the amoc and two new studies shed further light on how ocean currents are changing the agulhas current is used by cargo ships to optimize routing around the cape of good hope in south africa the yellow hexagonal dots in this diagram are drifting spotter buoys that enable more accurate measurement of the current how are surface currents changing there are two new studies that reveal the ways in which surface currents are changingâ in august the woods hole oceanographic institute published research on the florida current a part of the gulf stream system along the florida coast their findingâ âthe florida current has weakened significantly since 1909 and in the last twenty years has probably been as weak as never before piecuchâs calculations also show that the resulting reduction of heat transport is sufficient to explain the âcold blobâ in the northern atlanticââ this socalled âcold blobâ is a region in the northern atlantic ocean that has escaped global warming and even gotten colder since the 1800sâ in addition to the news out of woods hole another study from peking university and ohio state university was released this fall âfor the first time their paper provides evidence for an amoc slowdown based on data from outside the north atlantic model simulations show that a weakening of the amoc leads to an accumulation of salt in the subtropical south atlanticââ this study is significant in that it uses new sources of data to calibrate and quantify just how much ocean currents are changing with the use of drifter buoy arrays researchers are able to augment current data â which historically has been significantly undersampled drifter buoy arrays promise to have a massive impact on collecting more data by deploying networks of sensors that cost less to deploy climate researchers can take better more diverse samples and aggregate more data to get an even more accurate picture of how surface currents are changingâ what happens if ocean currents weaken weaker ocean currents are projected to have catastrophic effects on our planetâ first the makeup of the ocean will change the cause of weakened currents is twofold  our oceans are getting both warmer and less dense water at the poles is less cold due to climate change and it therefore does not circulate as well in deep ocean currents likewise the melting of the greenland continental ice sheet means that freshwater is reducing the salinity â and therefore the density â of the oceanâs water further contributing to weakening currentsâ marine life is severely impacted by weaker circulation and warmer waters  âif circulation slows due to warming waters the churning of the carbon dioxide will slow which will keep more carbon dioxide in our surface waters and atmosphere this can lead to increasing ocean acidification which is very harmful to marine lifeâ reports the thompson earth systems institute â weaker currents impact humans too modeling shows that a weaker gulf stream would lead to higher sea levels for floridaâs east coast  and an increased risk of flooding it will also lead to colder winters in europe  as much of the heat that would have circulated will stay along the us east coastâ marine transportation and shipping will become more perilous experts predict that changes in the north atlantic could intensify streams of icebergs into shipping lanes and create coastal ice jams that hinder navigation and weaker surface currents would devastate the aquaculture industry âin 2015 scientists traced the imminent collapse of the commercially important cod fishery in the region to rapidly warming water in the gulf of maine which fits the pattern of slowing atlantic circulationâ reported inside climate news â the weakening of surface currents is what underpins many of the dangers of climate change therefore better data and measurement systems are critical to getting an accurate picture of the immediate and longterm danger that we stand to face if currents continue to decline at this pace drifting buoys can help with better data not only can they access remote parts of the ocean but a dense network of drifters provides granularity and better resolution to capture both the details of small scale events and signs of larger patterns in currents change â sofar in the news in the news october 23 2023 wayfinder delivers 8 total equivalent fuel savings on brazilchina bdi c14 voyages
