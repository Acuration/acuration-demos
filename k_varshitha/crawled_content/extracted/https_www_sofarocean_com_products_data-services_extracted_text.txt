are saying âwe decided to use the spotter wave buoys as part of the masri project for multiple reasons the buoys are very affordable small lightweight and easy to maintain the mooring is also convenient to deploy and affordable the spotter buoy measures the most important parameters such as spectra wave conditions sea surface temperature and local wind which no other buoys can the realtime access and included dashboard and api are very useful to keep an eye on the data these advantages allowed us to deploy multiple buoys instead of one more expensive traditional buoy branch director national institute of meteorology and hydrology ivan ivanov âwith its proven reliability accuracy and wellestablished scientific credentials the spotter buoy from sofar ocean provides the brazilian navy with the ability to operate at highlatitude regions that receive very little sunlight while providing 2way communication via its builtin satellite modemâ captain brazilian navy capt tobias ramalho âthe purchase and operating cost of the spotter is much lower than the large buoy so we are now using it as our primary offshore wave data source we have purchased a second spotter to allow them to be regularly swapped over while moorings are checked and biofouling removedâ engineering adviser lyttelton port company neil mclennan âmost moored buoys in the great lakes require significant time and financial investment a highly qualified team of technicians scientists and engineers as well as midsize vessels for deployments and retrievals for this reason several labs turned to small
