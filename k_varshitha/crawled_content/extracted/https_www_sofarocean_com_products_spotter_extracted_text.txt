What Our Customers Are Saying
âThe purchase and operating cost of the Spotter is much lower than the large buoy so we are now using it as our primary offshore wave data source. We have purchased a second Spotter to allow them to be regularly swapped over while moorings are checked and biofouling removed.â
Engineering Adviser, Lyttelton Port Company
Neil McLennan
âWe decided to use the Spotter wave buoys as part of the MASRI project for multiple reasons. The buoys are very affordable, small, lightweight and easy to maintain. The mooring is also convenient to deploy and affordable. The Spotter buoy measures the most important parameters such as spectra wave conditions, sea surface temperature and local wind, which no other buoys can. The real-time access and included dashboard and API are very useful to keep an eye on the data. These advantages allowed us to deploy multiple buoys instead of one more expensive traditional buoy."
Branch Director, National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology
Ivan Ivanov
âWith its proven reliability, accuracy and well-established scientific credentials the Spotter buoy from Sofar Ocean provides the Brazilian Navy with the ability to operate at high-latitude regions that receive very little sunlight, while providing 2-way communication via its built-in satellite modem.â
Captain, Brazilian Navy
Capt. Tobias Ramalho
âMost moored buoys in the Great Lakes require significant time and financial investment, a highly qualified team of technicians, scientists, and engineers, as well as mid-size vessels for deployments and retrievals. For this reason, several labs turned to small, lightweight, and relatively easy-to-deploy options, like Sofar Oceanâs Spotter buoy.â
