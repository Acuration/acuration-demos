Â If Customer fails to make any payment when due, late charges will accrue at the rate of 1.5% per month or, if lower, the highest rate permitted by applicable law and Company may suspend Subscription Services until all payments are made in full. Â Customer will reimburse Company for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneysâ fees) in collecting any late payments or interest.

(c) Â  Â  Â  Â  Waiver. Â Either Partyâs failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.

(d) Â  Â  Â  Â Severability. Â If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, given the fundamental intentions of the Parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
(e) Â  Â  Â  Â Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(g) Â  Â  Â  Â Equitable Relief. Â Each Party agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 3 or, in the case of Customer, Section 1(b), would cause the other Party irreparable harm and significant damages for which there may be no adequate remedy under law and that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will have the right to seek immediate equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Â Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.
(h) Â  Â  Â  Â Force Majeure.

Subcontractors
â) in connection with the performance of its own obligations hereunder as it deems appropriate;
provided
that Company remains responsible for the performance of each such Subcontractor. Â Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any third-party vendors including any hosting (e.g. AWS) or payment vendors (e.g. PayPal), Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to guard against any damages or issues arising in connection with such vendors, but will not be liable for the acts or omissions of such third-party vendors except to the extent that it has been finally adjudicated that such damages or issues are caused directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Company.
(j) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Export Regulation. Â Customer will comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations and rules that prohibit or restrict the export or re-export of the Subscription Services or software, or any Customer Materials, outside the United States (â
Export Rules
