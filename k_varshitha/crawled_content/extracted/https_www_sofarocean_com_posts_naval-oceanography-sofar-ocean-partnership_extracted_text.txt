forecasting data collection sofar ocean stennis space center miss  â naval meteorology and oceanography command naval oceanography and technology startup sofar ocean announced the signing of a fiveyear cooperative research and development agreement crada to advance the us navyâs ocean weather forecasting and data collection capabilities the organizations launched their strategic partnership at a joint knowledge sharing event on july 1718 at naval oceanographyâs headquarters at nasaâs stennis space center representatives from naval oceanography its subordinate commands and partners and sofar ocean at the inaugural joint knowledge sharing event cradas with partners like sofar ocean allow us to capitalize on the expertise between our organizations sofarâs technology contributes to the core capabilities of collecting accurate data and delivering at the speed and scale required to make the difference in operational warfighting advantage increased battlespace awareness and ensure safety of flight and navigationâ said rear adm ronald j piret oceanographer of the navy and commander us naval meteorology and oceanography command âour industry partners play a vital role in the naval research enterprise and cradas ensure naval meteorology and oceanography can harness technological innovation to enable informed decision making by operational commandersâ naval oceanographyâs mission is to define and apply the physical environment to ensure that the navy has freedom of action in any battlespace to accomplish this mission naval oceanography seeks to advance the stateoftheart for ocean data collection and prediction an objective that it shares with sofar the san franciscobased company has deployed a global network of marine weather sensors known as spotter buoys that collects thousands of ground truth observations each day sofar assimilates these observations of wave spectra wind sea surface temperature and barometric pressure into its operational ocean weather forecasts to increase their accuracy sofarâs forecasts are the foundation of its maritime solutions which include voyage optimization extreme weather monitoring and more âstrategic partnerships are essential to unlocking ocean data at scale and increasing marine weather forecast accuracyâ said dr tim janssen ceo and cofounder of sofar ocean âour crada with naval oceanography will expand our ability to collect and assimilate realtime ocean data and ultimately lead to support for marine operations using more accurate information and forecastsâ at the inaugural knowledge sharing event representatives from naval oceanography and sofar gave presentations facilitated discussion and identified potential areas of collaboration around three primary topics hardware for ocean data collection data assimilation dataasaservice daas and data management at the event sofar highlighted its spotter and smart mooring marine sensing devices the development of the bristlemouth open ocean connectivity standard its approach to ensemblebased data assimilation and coupled modeling and its daas products representatives from naval oceanographyâs subordinate commands and partners â the naval oceanographic office navoceano the fleet numerical meteorology and oceanography center fnmoc and the naval research laboratory nrl â â also attended the event the groups provided critical insights about hardware deployment capabilities data needs and the verification and validation vv process navoceano fnmoc and nrl will each play a central role in the identification of use cases for sofarâs marine sensing devices data assimilation approach and daas products that advance the navyâs operations âour working relationship with sofar ocean leadership has been cultivated for over a decade starting with the naval postgraduate school and the office of naval researchâ said dr joseph calantoni technical director us naval meteorology and oceanography command âthe formal relationship between cnmoc and sofar ocean is a success story that demonstrates the effectiveness of the naval research enterprise to foster innovative technology and eventually move that capability to the warfighterâ naval oceanography and sofarâs crada follows the successful limited partnershipcrada lpcrada between the us national ice center usnic and sofar last summer usnic which is subordinate to naval oceanography and operated by the navy the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the us coast guard deployed five of sofarâs spotter buoys in the arctic during the uscgc healyâs patrol to the north pole the buoys collected valuable metocean observations in a historically datasparse region us national ice center operations officer cwo2 mike latin deploys a spotter system during the uscgc healyâs patrol to the north pole in summer 2022 in the coming months naval oceanography and sofar will host an additional knowledge sharing event and solidify collaboration objectives that further the navyâs forecasting and data collection capabilities  the cooperative research and development agreement crada does not constitute endorsement of sofar ocean or its products
