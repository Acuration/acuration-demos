cyclone season in the southern pacific ocean sofar ocean april 18 2021 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis improving hurricane observations with data from scalable sensor networks sofar ocean over the past year weâve nearly tripled our coverage of buoys with coverage across the pacific atlantic indian and southern oceans access data here  this extremely dense network of spotter buoys enables us to obtainin realtimehigh fidelity observations of extreme ocean weather with unprecedented frequencyâ current limitations with existing data collection platforms historically observations of extreme events like tropical cyclones hurricanes or typhoons have been achieved with satellites or large moored buoy platforms eg those from the ndbc while satellite overpasses provide invaluable data they are of limited value in extreme conditions due to poor reliability under heavy rain conditions like those found in the most intense regions of a storm system moored buoy platforms while providing unparalleled in situ observations over a wide range of relevant variables face extreme costs of deployment and maintenance which limits how many can be deployedleading to fewer opportunities for extreme weather observation in the past 37 years there have been fewer than 100 observations made by moored ndbc buoys with winds  25 ms see tamizi and young 2020 â â figure 1 area of interest southern pacificâ ocean sourceâ google earth figure 2â sofar spotter buoy locations yellow and named tropical cyclone tracks from dec 20  mar 21 by comparison during the most recent summer season in the southern hemisphere dec 2020  mar 2021 our spotter buoy network in the south pacific observed six cyclones producing unique datasets on each one as we continue to scale spotter coverage globally we expect to observe a growing number of extreme weather events across other basins eg northwest pacific the observational databoth historical and real timeof these events will go beyond anecdotal and become statistically relevant to understanding and predicting these physical phenomena with multiple spotters observing a single storm track from different locations an unprecedented dataset on the temporal evolution and spatial organization of each storm will begin to emerge insights gained from a high density spotter platform spotter buoys transmit several relevant marine weather variables describing the waves wind currents and surface temperature even better not only does spotter report in real time the bulk wave statistics such as significant wave height and peak period but also the full twodimensional 2d wave spectrum with all of this data in hand in realtime we can monitor and update our understanding of extreme weather letâs take a look at how the spotter platform performed during a recent cyclone case study tropical cyclone niran and spotter0627 on february 27 2021 tropical cyclone niran formed in the coral sea and ultimately grew to be a category 5 severe tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds of 260 kmh due to our high spotter network density in the region several spotters were within a few radii of the cyclone eye here we present data from one such buoy spotter0627 â figure 3â area of interest tropical cyclone niran sourceâ google earth â figure 4â spotter0627 in the path of tropical cyclone niran march 4th  5th 2021 significant wave height with winds over 200 kmhr tc niran was expected to generate some impressive waves  and it did just that spotter reported significant wave heights up to 7 meters as the cyclone eye wall passed within 50 km approximately one eyeradius energy spectrum even more interestingly spotters are all reporting the full wave energy spectrum every hour while this turns into a massive amount of data transmitted it provides unprecedented realtime observations of the wave field as the cyclone approaches why might this matter significant wave height while useful is a single statistical property of the wave field experienced by the buoy  specifically representing the mean height of the top third highest waves but for a wave field generated by such a violent and rapidly evolving weather event a great deal of variability will exist in the finer details  how large are the local wind waves versus the swell more on sea vs swell here  what direction are those very different components coming from how is the energy in the wave field and hence the destructive power of the waves evolving in time to answer these questions we turn to the wave spectrum and to start well consider the hourly onedimensional 1d wave spectrum which measures the total energy at each wave frequency integrated over all directions â figure 5 wave height energy and frequency over time recordedâ by spotter0627 the coloring of each line on the energy spectrum plot corresponds to the same color data pointdot in the significant wave height figure therefore at every point in time we have an estimate of the significant wave height left plot but also a full spectrum describing the energy at each frequency right plot time progressing goes from dark red warm to dark blue cold so early on red we can see that the peak energy corresponds to waves with a period of just over 10 seconds or under 01 hz as time goes on moving to green colors we see two things happen â the height of the peak ef increases nearly an order of magnitude now we can see why the bulk parameter of significant wave height increased during this period  the more energy the higher the waves â â the location of the peak on the frequencyaxis moves left to lower frequencies ultimately at the most intense time of the storm encounter the peak is located at a frequency of approximately 006 hz  corresponding to a wave period of 16 seconds  some long waves as the storm passes we see the reversal of its approach  peak frequencies shift higher and the overall energy decreases important things to consider here because the wave field is ultimately a reflection of the wind forcing  there exist theoretical concepts to predict the wave field produced by a wind field modeled as a vortex a key point of consideration is the sector of the hurricane from which the observation is occurring that is in the reference frame of the hurricane are you to the front left or the back right the reason for the consistent asymmetry in the wave field owes to 1 coriolis causes all cyclones to rotate in the same direction clockwise in this southern hemisphere case 2 the cyclone is also propagating forward in space adding or subtracting to the wind strength depending on relative location 3 waves require strong winds time and space fetch to developâ for this last point an incredibly powerful wind will only produce large waves if it blows over a long enough distance of water for enough time the combination of these factors manifests in a consistent structure of wave fields in cyclones for the southern hemisphere the strongest winds will be to the left of the eye of the storm as viewed relative to its direction of travel as the local winds add to the wind due to the forward motion of the cyclone in terms of waves each quadrant around the eye will also be uniquely structured to the left waves are expected to be more fully developed and aligned with the winds because due to the alignment of the cyclone winds and direction of propagation of the storm the waves will propagate forward with the storm and thus remain in the high wind regions for extended periods of time extending the fetch see young 2006  conversely on the righthandside of the eye the wave field is expected to be highly disorganized  with contributions from the immediate local winds as well as waves propagating from the most energetic regions of the storm ie storm swell ahead of the cyclone figure 6â spotter0627 2d wave data measurements with cyclone niran approaching â in advance of the cyclone the wave spectra with directional convention as going to  are wellaligned with waves propagating directly outward from the cyclone to the southeast and then skewed to align with the direction of the wind at higher frequencies to the southsoutheast in the cyclone figure 7â spotter0627 2d wave data measurements with cyclone niran overhead within the strong winds of the cyclone and closer to the storm eye there is a clear directional split in the wave field observed despite the onedimensional spectra being consistently unimodal the low frequency swell energy is largely directed to the southeast and the high frequency locallygenerated wind seas are predominantly directed to the northnorthwest this quadrant of the cyclone in which the spotter is located is limitedfetch versus the extendedfetch region on the other side of the eye therefore one would expect rather complicated seas  and we can see this in the distribution of energy across a variety of directions and frequencies interestingly we see the direction changes rather significantly over the frequencies this is likely because swells at different frequencies travel at different speeds  therefore we are observing a collection of swells that originated when the cyclone was in different locations after the cyclone figure 8â spotter0627 2d wave data measurements after cyclone niran passed following the close pass with the cyclone eye observations in the rearright sector of the cyclone show a very broad spread in energy across directions  with the lower frequency energy spanning south to southwest and the higher energy spanning nearly 90 degrees from the northwest to the northeast these complex seas are likely due to the observations occurring on the fetchlimited sector of the cyclone  where a single coherent wave field is unable to develop due to a number of factors including rapidly changing wind direction and the passage of the cyclonic wind field resulting in a complex mix of wave ages and directions looking ahead the spotter platform was designed to gather airsea interaction data from the open ocean as the network continues to scale we are excited to continue sharing observations from some of these extremely high energy events with fullspectra data now being transmitted to help us better understand these weather phenomena with the learnings from observing these summer storms in the southern pacific we are looking forward to seeing how spotters perform during summer in the northwest pacific where these weather systems typhoons are both the most numerous and the strongest figure 9â full 2d data over cyclone nirans progression from spotter0627
