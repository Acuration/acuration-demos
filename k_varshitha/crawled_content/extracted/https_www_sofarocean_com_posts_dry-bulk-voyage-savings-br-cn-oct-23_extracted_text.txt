Dry bulk snapshot: Wayfinder delivers 8% total equivalent fuel savings on Brazil-China (BDI C14) voyages arriving in early October
Leading dry bulk carriers use Sofar Oceanâs
Wayfinder
platform to keep their vessels safe and access daily optimized voyage guidance that saves fuel, time, and emissions.
In the first half of October 2023 arrival window, a sampling of Capesize vessels following Wayfinderâs variable RPM and waypoint recommendations
saved an average of $62,000+ per voyage
across dozens of ballast and laden legs between Brazil and China (Baltic Dry Index C14). Average
total equivalent fuel savings exceeded 8%
and average
emissions output fell by 270 MT of CO2
per leg driven by weather upside capture. Â
The third week of October also saw sustained momentum following the increase in Capesize rates for the Brazil to China iron ore routes â with freight rates at around $24/tonne, a 28% increase over September. The higher rates further enhanced the profitability for any Capes optimizing with Wayfinder over this period. These multiplier outcomes are possible because of Wayfinderâs dynamic approach to voyage optimization with superior weather forecasts. Wayfinder sends
continuous
commercially optimized guidance to vessels throughout a voyage. Just as Google Maps analyzes the latest traffic and gas price information before it recommends a new route, Wayfinder considers the latest weather forecasts and market factors before it sends a daily RPM recommendation or issues new waypoints from amongst hundreds of millions of options. This dynamic approach outperforms the âset it and forget itâ sailing strategies, like constant power, that other platforms recommend.
At the core of Wayfinderâs optimization engine are Sofarâs best-in-class weather forecasts. These forecasts assimilate the real-time data collected by
Sofarâs global network of ocean sensors
, and are up to 70% more accurate than the traditional, satellite-based models used by other platforms. By employing superior forecasts that incorporate real-time weather observations made along a vesselâs route, Wayfinder advises vessels to speed up, slow down, or change course to minimize voyage costs and emissions.
