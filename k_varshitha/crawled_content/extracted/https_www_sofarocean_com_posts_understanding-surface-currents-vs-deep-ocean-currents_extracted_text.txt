heaslip april 12 2021 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis understanding surface currents vs deep ocean currents emily heaslip ocean currents play an important role in regulating the climate around the world there are two main types of ocean currents surface currents and deep ocean currentsâ surface currents are driven by global wind systems that are fueled by energy from the sun these currents bring heat from the tropics to the polar regions the gulf stream for instance brings warm water along the eastern coast of the us up to northern europeâ deep currents also known as thermohaline circulation result from differences in water density these currents occur when cold dense water at the poles sinks surface water flows to replace sinking water causing a conveyor beltlike effect of water circulating around the globe on a 1000year journey â understanding how these different ocean currents work what impacts ocean currents and tracking changes in these systems can help us better plan for climate change map shipping routes and optimize the placement of offshore renewable energy and aquaculture operationsâ what causes surface currentsâ there are many factors that cause ocean currents deep currents are driven by temperature and water densitysalinity of course deep currents impact surface currents which carry warm water to the poles surface currents are also driven by global wind systems fueled by energy from the sun factors like wind direction and the coriolis effect play a roleâ the coriolis effect refers to the way objects are deflected when they travel long distances around the earth our planetâs rotation causes currents to bend to appear to bend to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphereâ image source in addition to these regular influences natural disasters also cause surface currents huge storms and underwater earthquakes can trigger ocean currents earthquakes that change the landscape of the seafloor can also cause changes in deep sea currents as the position of underwater landforms changes the positioning of a currentâ while surface currents and deep water currents are related both are difficult to track âit is difficult to map an ocean current as the ocean water is clear and the reflection of light on the water surface does not depend on the velocity or temperature of the floating water one way to map the ocean currents is by using sea surface temperatures derived from satellite imageryâ wrote esri  âsome surface currents carry water with temperature that may significantly vary from nearby waterââ the difficulty in accurately mapping ocean currents makes it a little more complicated to track how ocean currents are changing with climate changeâ how do ocean currents affect the climate the ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the temperature and weather of the planet oceans cover 71 of the globe  storing and transferring heat energy around the world as water currents move this heat they affect climate patterns local weather the cycling of gases and the delivery of key nutrients to marine ecosystemsâ unfortunately the âconveyor beltâ of deep ocean and surface currents is slowing  a 2020 ipcc report projected that ocean currents would weaken by as much as a third by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate â leading to floodsâ higher sea levels and more extreme weather eventsâ read more tracking changes in surface currents  why are currents getting weaker put simply warmer water is less dense therefore warm water circulating to the poles doesnât sink as well and since this is the engine driving the entire conveyor belt the whole system slows plus the melting of fresh water ice sheets alters the density of water at the poles further slowing the sinking effectâ we know that weakened currents and warmer seas mean more stratification acidification and lower ability to store carbon dioxide thatâs why itâs critical to keep track of changes in ocean currents to better prepare for largescale climate changeâ tracking ocean currents beyond measuring temperature what are some ways that scientists and researchers are currently tracking ocean currents since the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill thereâs been increased interest in accurately mapping and tracking ocean currents technology like drifter buoys with gps and acoustic doppler current profilers adcps are used at sea level while planes and drones tackle the task from the skyâ taking things to the next level a team of nasa scientists is using data collected from nasas gravity recovery and climate experiment  grace  mission to track changes in atlantic ocean currentsâ ânasas grace satellites measured atlantic ocean bottom pressure as an indicator of deep ocean current speed this image shows bottom pressure anomaly mean of november 2009 through march 2010 relative to 2005â2012 mean over the north atlantic basin this pattern of aboveaverage blue and belowaverage red seafloor pressure revealed a temporary slowing of the deep currentsâ said nasa  measuring ocean currents from space may not be the most cost or timeeffective approach but whatâs clear is more data is better no matter which tool or method is used to track ocean currents the task of mapping ocean currents is best served by sharing as much data as possibleâ â aggregating data from the shipping industry marine researchers climate scientists and the fishing industry will give us the best chance at understanding and pinpointing changes in ocean currents understanding these surface and deep currents will take a coordinated effort from all stakeholders â and sofar oceanâs spotter buoys and ocean data api are tools that can helpâ sofar in the news in the news october 23 2023 wayfinder
