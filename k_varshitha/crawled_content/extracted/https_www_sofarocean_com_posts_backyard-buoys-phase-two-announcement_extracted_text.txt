national science foundation to improve ocean data access for indigenous communities sofar ocean backyard buoys  a communityled ocean observing project that empowers indigenous partners to collect and utilize ocean data using sofar oceanâs spotter buoys and smart moorings  has been awarded a 498 million cooperative agreement with the national science foundationâs nsf convergence accelerator program which will advance the effort into its second phase the project which was launched in september 2021 is one of six track e networked blue economy projects chosen to advance to phase ii and is a collaboration between sofar and the following organizations alaska alaska ocean observing system aoos alaska eskimo whaling commission aewc university of alaska fairbanks uaf alaska department of natural resources adnr and alaska native science  engineering program ansep pacific northwest northwest association of networked ocean observing systems nanoos quileute tribe quinault indian nation

conservation international hawaii phase ii of the backyard buoys program will build on the extensive project planning relationshipbuilding and indigenous knowledge sharing that defined phase i  its foci will be the collaborative development of community research and implementation plans crisps by all project partners the deployment and stewardship of sofarâs marine sensing devices by indigenous communities using regionspecific crisps the launch of buoy data access tools codesigned with indigenous communities for use in local contexts such as low data bandwidth âthis award will allow us to continue our efforts in codesigning technologies and techniques with indigenous community members in ways that complement their knowledgeâ said principal investigator jan newton nanoos âthe wave buoy systems will collect critical real time wave information that can serve to increase awareness and understanding of changes in the ocean and climateâ map showing the coverage area of pacioos aoos and

ioosâ is also shown blue indigenous communities at the forefront backyard buoys consciously adopts an ocean research model that unfortunately is atypical instead of telling a community how devices will be deployed and data will be collected and used backyard buoys puts indigenous partners at the forefront empowering them to take responsibility for all stages of the ocean data collection process this establishes a critical precedent and ensures that the indigenous communities on the front lines of climate change can effectively use the buoy data that they gather to bolster maritime activities food security and coastal hazard protection âthis project has the ability to bridge local indigenous knowledge and scientific data collection making the information needed for ocean safety decisions more accessible and relevant to our local communityâ said fuiava bert fuiava samoan village chief american samoa ânearshore wave data will help prepare for and mitigate impacts from a changing environment that threatens the livelihood and homes of quinault tribal membersâ said joe schumacker quinault indian nation throughout the project and guided by the care data principles  team members from the regional ocean observing systems discuss data collection archiving and sharing with the indigenous partners each community may have unique concerns and desires about how their data is used to respect indigenous data sovereignty the backyard buoys team will work with each community to create data agreements that explicitly define data sharing limits and protocols âwhat appealed to us about the project at the aewc alaska eskimo whaling commission is that it has a collaborative approach and it is communityled and communitydrivenâ said lesley hopson executive director of aewc âour whaling communities are located along the arctic coast of alaska and rely on the resources from the sea to feed our communities the sea can be very unforgiving and dangerous and it changes all the time this technology will allow us to improve safety for our hunters and better understand environmental changesâ a sofar spotter buoy at the iãupiat heritage center in utqiagvik alaska project partners recently travelled to utqiagvik to participate in a coproduction workshop with indigenous community members local hunters aoos government officials and academics should they choose to backyard buoysâ indigenous partners have the opportunity to further democratize the ocean data they collect by sharing it with the scientific community researchers focused on the impacts of climate change in particular will find the information gathered in these traditionally datasparse ocean regions extremely valuable the climate assessments that they produce will serve the very indigenous communities that provided them with the data and will help these communities seek funding and resources to support climate adaptation projects in the future âindigenous communities involved will be the ultimate stewards of the wave buoys within their own waters throughout the project and beyondâ said the backyard buoys team âthey will identify where the buoys should be deployed when why and how they should be operated in a way that meets their needs and goalsâ backyard buoys data also has applications in the classroom project partner nanoos for example has partnered with western washington university wwu to develop modules for undergraduates that will utilize the buoy data in turn wwu will partner with the quinault indian nation to adapt the modules for high school students helping empower the next generation of indigenous ocean advocates âthe longerterm goal is for these observing assets to remain operational within each of the communities beyond the scope of the phase ii project effort and to expand the realized observing capacity to other indigenous communities in other regions across the usâ said the backyard buoys team âthe phase i coproduction collaborators have been highly engaged and are very motivated and excited to participate in the phase ii implementation of the backyard buoys project they codevelopedâ a sofar spotter buoy spotters collect and transmit wave wind sea surface temperature and barometric pressure data in realtime proven marine sensing technology at the technological center of the backyard buoys project is the sofar ocean spotter a metocean buoy that collects and transmits wave wind sea surface temperature and barometric pressure data in realtime basketballsized solarpowered and ultra durable spotters are simple to deploy and designed for harsh ocean conditions to date thousands have been deployed in all global oceans phase ii of backyard buoys will see nearly 60 spotters and smart moorings â spotterâs subsurface extension â deployed across each of the projectâs focus regions the chance to partner directly with many indigenous communities and for the first time to deploy at scale with a federallyfunded organization ioos is an invaluable opportunity for the sofar team âwith accessible data tools these data will serve community needs for decisions on scales from daily eg related to assessing safety for maritime operations and coastal hazards to longer planning horizons eg related to assessing resilience for climate change and ecosystem functionâ said the backyard buoys team by piloting the program in three environmentally and culturally diverse regions backyard buoys creates a comprehensive playbook that can be used to launch parallel programs in other locations globally collectively these efforts help build a foundation for underserved communities to more easily access the ocean data that they need â stay tuned for more backyard buoys updates as phase ii commences and the first units are deployed
