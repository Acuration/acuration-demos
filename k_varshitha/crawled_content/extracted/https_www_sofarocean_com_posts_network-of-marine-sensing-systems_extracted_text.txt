Webinar: Collecting ocean data at scale using a regional monitoring network of marine sensing systems
â
Traditional ocean sensors are typically too complex or rudimentary to comprise a reliable observational network. In lieu of these legacy devices, researchers, local communities, government, and industry are deploying fleets of modern marine sensing systems to collect ocean data at scale in real-time. The direct observations made by these spatially dense networks power a wide range of initiatives, from coastal resilience to maritime safety.
In this webinar, Senior Sales Manager Nevin DiParlo will hosted customers from the Autoridad Nacional de Asuntos Maritimos (ANAMAR), NOAA Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), and the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW), to discuss how each uses a fleet of Sofarâs rapidly deployable, connected, extensible, and cost-effective Spotter systems. Each customer details how they built their regional monitoring network and highlight how it accelerates ocean data collection at scale to drive sustainable solutions.
A questions and answers session followed the conversation.
