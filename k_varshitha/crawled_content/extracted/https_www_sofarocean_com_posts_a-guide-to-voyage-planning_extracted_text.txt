average of 35 hours per vessel according to maritime executive  there are many factors to consider during voyage planning as well as steps required by imo regulations to ensure each voyage is as safe as possibleâ steps in ship voyage planning regulations require shipping companies to complete ship voyage planning in four stages  these are appraisal first ship voyage planners â usually the master of the ship and the chief navigating officer â discuss how they plan to get from point a to point b this includes gathering all information relevant to the passage evaluating different routes and pinpointing areas in the voyage where there might be bad weather or other risks the appraisal stage will consider things such asâ charts ocean passages around the worldâ routing charts admiralty sailing directions list of lights and fog signals and list of radio signals tide tables notices to mariners navigational warnings owners and other sources personal experience with input from the master of the ship company guidelines cargo data and weather information the navigating officer will come up with an initial route for the ship to followâ planning next the officer of the watch oow prepares a more detailed plan based on the initial route mapped out in the appraisal process this detailed plan is laid out from port to port with areas like wrecks reefs shallow water and emergency stopping points included this phase will also take into account among other thingsâ nogo areas margins of safety charted tracks course alterations and wheel over points tides and current change in engine status use of echo sounder natural transit contingency planning and aborts â positions in which there is no possible option but to proceed â are especially important to note in this phase contingency planning will include alternative routes  safe anchorages waiting areas emergency berths execution the voyage begins and navigating officers use the plan prepared by the oow with sofar

checking the position of the ship to ensure it remains a safe distance from danger areas if the shipâs navigating officer decides that itâs necessary to deviate from the planned route he or she must inform the master and take precautions to ensure ship and crewmember safety good communication is needed during this phase as well as experience the right data and personal judgmentâ challenges of ship voyage planning voyage planning is a complex laborintensive process that requires intense attention to detail repetitive manual input can lead to human error âmultiplied across vessels companies and fleets voyage planning can show inefficiency for an industry where optimal resource use and cost savings are now more important than everâ noted one expert â ship voyage planning also needs to account for a number of factors from shipping deadlines to weather forecasts to cargo and crew safety to fuel costs and route optimization some of these priorities can directly conflict as the safest route may not be the fastest vessel parameters such as ship size draft beam and length also play a role in voyage planningâ manually planning a ship route introduces weather and climate uncertainties many captains at sea are unwilling to accept with the impacts of climate change compounding into increasingly extreme conditions keeping operations on the high seas efficient requires real time ocean
