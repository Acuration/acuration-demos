sites with the spotter platform sofar ocean missed our webinar with luode director antti lindfors access the recording here  the gist luode is a finnish consultancy that collects ocean data to generate insights for its clients across the marine industry one of luodeâs focus verticals is offshore wind and in finland the company is a leading provider of ocean datadriven solutions for site developers luode deploys fleets of sofar spotter platforms at wind farms throughout the baltic sea to gather ocean data at scale luode and its clients use spotter observations to support technical site assessment and design and to ensure that maintenance visits are conducted as safely and efficiently as possible access to realtime ocean data is critical for finlandâs fastgrowing offshore wind industry finland is aggressively pursuing offshore wind development opportunities the scandinavian nation has started the tendering process for sites along its west coast and aims to have two largescale offshore wind farms operational by 2028 1 2 presently however just one project has been permitted with over twentyfive others in the planning or environmental impact assessment eia phase to move these earlystage projects forward developers need access to accurate information about the ocean dynamics at each proposed site this is no easy feat finlandâs proposed wind farm sites are often tens of kilometers long and located up to 100 kilometers offshore where metocean data is sparse relative to the data available in nearshore environments in situ observations in particular are historically limited in the open ocean lowering the spatial resolution of the wave models available to developers these sites are also located outside the range of reliable cellular service complicating data accessibility luode helps finnish developers overcome these challenges using an integrated approach to ocean data collection they use numerical models satellite observations vesselbased surveys manual sampling and install an array of marine sensing devices to collect data at and below the surface to make critical wave observations at each site luode relies on sofarâs spotter system bolstering shortterm operations and longterm assessments at offshore wind sites with spotter wave observations luode deploys 35 spotter buoys at each finnish offshore wind site spotters are durable costeffective selfpowered and rapidly deployable enabling luode to efficiently moor them at different locations based on the layout of the wind farm and its cable corridors this distributed approach is strategic by mooring numerous spotters across a vast site luode increases the spatial density of observations made capturing the sometimes stark differences in wave conditions between locations each spotter transmits the wave information it collects â along with wind sea surface temperature and barometric pressure data â in realtime via satellite luode and its clients access the data remotely using sofarâs modern dashboard and api âluode chose to use the spotter system at offshore wind sites because it is practical to deploy has flexible data transmission options and is selfpoweredâ  antti lindfors luode director luode and its partners use spotter observations to improve the longterm assessment and design of offshore wind sites for example if government data collected by a satellite or a distant monitoring station suggests that the wave heights at a proposed site may consistently exceed a dangerous threshold luode and a developer would validate this data using the direct observations made by the spotter systems if confirmed luode and its client may reassess what infrastructure is installed where developers are also legally required to consider the environmental impact that an offshore wind farm could have on the hydrology at a site 3 4 spotter data can play a role in these assessments by establishing a baseline for future comparison of wave energy distribution across different directions and frequencies spotter data also informs shortterm gonogo decision making for construction and maintenance at offshore wind farms luode and a developer can remotely determine if wave conditions are calm enough to greenlight a service visit increasing the safety and efficiency of highrisk work the presence of spotters at multiple locations throughout a site increases the accuracy of these assessments as data from the device closest to a work site can be prioritized on longer time scales spotter wave observations can inform predictions of how many nogo dates are expected for a given year overall luode and its partners use the wave observations made by fleets of spotter systems to assess design and maintain offshore wind sites more effectively luode deploys a sofar spotter system at an offshore wind farm in the baltic sea accelerating ocean data collection at offshore wind sites with smart mooring and bristlemouth luode and other offshore wind service providers have the opportunity to expand the spotter system to further scale ocean data collection at offshore wind sites smart mooring  which extends the spotter system underwater unlocks measurements within the water column such as subsurface temperature and pressure bristlemouth  an open ocean connectivity standard developed by sofar and its strategic partners enables plugandplay hardware capability between the spotter system and offtheshelf sensorsâ âwe are looking for realtime data transmission systems for water quality and other environmental monitoring the idea is to use bristlemouth as a standard protocol for accessing data from remote locationsâ  antti lindfors luode director by integrating more devices â all of which use the spotter buoy as a hub for power and connectivity â offshore wind service providers and developers can quickly increase the size and scope of a sitespecific dataset to learn more about how the spotter system can collect ocean
