How MÃ¸renot uses Spotter buoys to promote safe aquaculture operations
Brendan Crowley
MÃ¸renot
is an international provider of solutions for the fishing, aquaculture, and seismic industries, committed to sustainably harvesting food from the sea.

Sofar Ocean
is a San Francisco-based climate technology startup whose mission is to connect the worldâs oceans to power a more sustainable future.

The Challenge
MÃ¸renot collaborates with its aquaculture partners on a daily basis, helping them work safely and efficiently while at sea. One of the most unpredictable variables affecting operations is weather; in fact, real-time metocean conditions, such as waves, currents, and wind, often dictate which tasks can and cannot be completed on a given day.
â
Traditionally, onsite personnel decide whether or not, given present weather conditions, an operation can be completed. This leads to vastly different interpretations of what constitutes âsafeâ conditions across the hundreds of sites that MÃ¸renot oversees. A subjective decision-making process like this creates uncertainty for company leaders, who cannot effectively factor weather into their operational strategy. These concerns extend to prospective partnerships, as well; how can MÃ¸renot be sure that a new aquaculture site wonât present the same weather-related challenges as existing sites?
A Spotter buoy in Norway. MÃ¸renot uses the data collected by Spotter to promote safer and more efficient operations at aquaculture sites.
The Solution
MÃ¸renot partnered with Sofar Ocean to deploy a Spotter buoy at one of its customerâs aquaculture sites. Initially, the Spotter â which constantly collects wave, wind, sea surface temperature, and barometric pressure data â will allow MÃ¸renot to cross reference objective in-situ observations with onsite personnelâs subjective assessments of metocean conditions.
â
Over time, these comparisons will be used to identify patterns, backed by data, that reveal what conditions should be considered safe and unsafe. This will allow MÃ¸renot to standardize the decision-making process; if wave heights are above a specific benchmark, for example, certain operations may cease while others proceed.
â
Ultimately, Spotter data will be integrated with the operations calendar that aquaculture site personnel access via MÃ¸renotâs Aquacom platform. Users will be able to instantly see, given present metocean conditions and established standards, which tasks are safe to complete on a given day. This will make operations more efficient by improving planning and reducing weather-related downtime.
Why Sofar?
Yngve Askeland, CEO of MÃ¸renot Digital, chose Sofarâs Spotter buoy because it is affordable, easy to deploy, simple to maintain, and easily connectable to MÃ¸renotâs digital platform. Additionally, Yngve values the cellular connectivity and reduced power consumption made available by the
Spotter Â platform
. Both features increase Spotterâs reliability during winter in Norway, a central location of MÃ¸renotâs operations.
