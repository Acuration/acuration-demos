now getting an answer is easy fast and accurate what about 5 miles offshore at a depth of 12 meters thatâs harder to answer weâre making it easier with a smart mooring system that can be added to the spotter buoy â this new smart mooring provides modularity to fit a wide variety of roles with a single universal interface the spotter buoy provides power and connectivity for seamless realtime access to data the spotter  smart mooring system will give researchers coastal engineers and anybody whoâs wanted to know whatâs going on down there hyperlocalized or regional awareness of any parameter traditionally monitored by set and forget loggers this means that practically any data logger can be converted to realtime sofar ocean technologies has built and deployed hundreds of spotter buoys creating the largest privatelyowned marine weather sensor network in the world this network of buoys is filling in the gaps in collected realtime ocean and weather data now weâre bringing that new level of insight underwater realtime data from below the surface thereâs a critical missing layer of ocean data realtime information from below the surface satellite data has created large amounts of data to be collected from the sea surface â in realtime but lacking depth new and evercheaper data loggers are giving us insight into subsurface environments but itâs months or sometimes years before their retrieval the smart mooring provides the best of both worldsâ one advantage of realtime monitoring over traditional data logging is that there is no missing data due to failure or loss of the device a common complaint of using loggers is that thereâs no way to tell after installation if the logger is still collecting data if itâs lost its calibration or if it is functioning correctly with a smart mooring system the data quality and assurance is immediate and constant another big advantage of realtime monitoring is that there are no limitations to the deployment time due to power or data storage limitations while many modern loggers have large battery and storage capacity some situations require sensors that have higher power needs that canât be met easily with battery power alone lastly realtime monitoring provides peace of mind since each unit is equipped with gps mounted on a surface buoy itâs far easier to locate or recover if lost or misplaced easy to deploy the smart mooring system operates with power data and mechanical fastening handled by a single simplified cableâ combining power and data on a single thin cable overcomes several challenges with moored systems first there is less weight and less mass for deployment less drag means that less weight and flotation are needed to secure the mooring in place the smart mooring system is small and lightweight enough that it can be deployed by a small boat less weight and size also means that the smart mooring can be shipped economically via air freight or standard ground transportation it can be easily handcarried and loaded into commercial or freight ups fedex dhl flights the cable is kevlar reinforced and capable of three kilonewtons of force plenty to haul up sizable anchor weights in addition to being functional itâs incredibly strong and abrasionresistant for tough maritime applications customizable the revolutionary concept of the smart mooring is that each part of the system is configurable and customizable each cable length available in various sizes from 5m to 50m can be connected to a sensor node a mooring termination or another length of cable with only simple hand tools in the field each sensor node is itself configurable and swappableallowing for the use of a different sensor at each nodeâ â the entire smart mooring system was designed with oems and integrators in mindâboth for new devices and sensors as well as the integration of existing hardware the data flow to and from these devices and sensors will be accessible via the api and supported with developer tools and examples creating a platform the future of the smart mooring itâs not enough to have a specialized piece of equipment itâs necessary to approach coastal and ocean challenges from a systematic approach tim janssen ceo at sofar says âone of the biggest barriers to ocean sensing and monitoring is the lack of a universal connector and communication protocol weâre out to change that the smart mooring is built on top of sofarâs open standardwe want you to be able to use any sensor you want and place them where you want them the variation is limitless all connectors are identical and everything is interchangeable we like the ease and flexibility of usb so we decided to build it for ocean sensing plug it in and the data shows up on your dashboard and api it is that simpleâ the customizable nature is due in part to oneplug our connectivity protocol that makes connecting sensor easy the smart mooring is a platform for our partners to build with for industryspecific applications we currently have two configurations for you to purchase or reach out to sales to customize your own configuration  sofar in the news in the news october 23 2023 wayfinder delivers 8
