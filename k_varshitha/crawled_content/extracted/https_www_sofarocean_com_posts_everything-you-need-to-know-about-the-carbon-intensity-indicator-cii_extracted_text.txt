industry decarbonize in this piece we detail its key components june 6 2022 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis everything you need to know about the carbon intensity indicator cii starting in january 2023 the international maritime organization imo will be instituting two new regulatory measures that will alter the daytoday dynamics of the maritime shipping industry these measures are the energy efficiency index for existing ships eexi and the carbon intensity indicator cii rating both of which will play a critical part in the imoâs push to reduce the maritime shipping industryâs greenhouse gas ghg emissions by as much as 70 by 2050 â in this piece we will focus on cii which measures how efficiently a ship operates expressed in terms of âgrams of co2 emitted per cargocarrying capacity and nautical mileâ letâs dive into the details what is carbon intensity in the shipping industry carbon intensity is the measure of a shipâs ghg emissions relative to the amount of cargo carried over a certain distance this metric is preferable to total carbon emissions as a measure of a vesselâs environmental impact because it controls for periods of inactivity during the covid19 pandemic for example total vessel ghg emissions briefly declined as more ships remained docked this of course was due to a dip in supply chain productivity not because of more efficient shipping carbon intensity on the other hand takes economic activity into account providing a more realistic measure of the shipping industryâs progress toward a more sustainable future calculating carbon intensity using cii cii will be used by the imo to assess how efficiently a ship is operating and is calculated using the following carbon intensity formula â annual efficiency ratio aer  annual fuel consumption x co2 emission factor  annual distance sailed x design deadweight of the vessel â â cii  aer adjusted for corrections  exclusions a shipâs co2 emission factor is calculated based on the type of fuel used to power it a shipâs design deadweight is the maximum amount of cargo plus crew fuel etc that it can carry each ship will get a cii rating of a b c d or e with a being the best possible mark a ship that is rated d for three consecutive years or e in one year eg those with the highest carbon intensity will be required to submit a â corrective action plan â that outlines how the vessel will be brought to a minimum c rating how will imo enforce cii cii regulations apply to all ships above 5000 gt  this includes bulk carriers gas carriers tankers container ships general cargo ships refrigerated cargo carriers cruise ships combination carriers lng carriers vehicle carriers and more in january 2023 all ships will be required to submit an enhanced ship energy efficiency management plan seemp to the imo the latest seemp requirements include mandatory content related to cii that is each seemp will be required to detail the actions that a shipping company will take to improve the energy efficiency of a vessel in a costeffective manner as our partners at abs detail  the seemp of every vessel must include the following key informationâ the required annual operational cii for the next three yearsâ an implementation plan describing how the required annual operational cii target will be achieved over the next three years how the shipping company calculates and reports the vesselâs attained annual operational cii this metric is compared to the required annual operational cii each year to track progress a plan for the shipâs continued selfevaluation and improvement additionally for vessels that consistently earn d and e ratings the seemp is where a shipping company would include the aforementioned corrective action plan to bring the vessel to a minimum c rating the imo also plans to make its cii ratings more difficult to achieve each year in order to motivate ship operators to continuously optimize critically the imo is encouraging key maritime shipping stakeholders such as port authoritiesâ to award incentives to companies that use ships with high cii ratings looking forward according to one esg assessment  over onethird of the worldâs fleet could fall short of the c ciiâ rating required by the imo 12 of container vessels could fall into the lowest âeâ category when the cii regulation comes in next year and up to a quarter of the container ship fleet could be rated âeâ by 2026 wrote lloyds register  vessels that fail to meet target cii ratings will damage the environment and potentially bottom lines as underperforming ships are devalued by charterers insurance companies and ports â shipping companies can take immediate steps to improve their vessels cii ratings by utilizing shipping route optimization  this approach strives to decrease the âannual fuel consumptionâ component of the carbon intensity formula by helping ships consistently skirt bad weather the imo estimates that thisâ weather routing approach can reduce a vessels fuel consumption by up to 3 decreasing its emissions output and increasing the likelihood that it meets its cii targets decreased fuel consumption is also a financial boon as fuel costs make up an estimated 5060 of a shipâs total operating costs  voyage optimization is an affordable and proven way to make meeting cii targets a reality sofar oceanâs wayfinder platform optimizes a vesselâs entire voyage using a combination of weather forecasts and business metrics such as market impact contract terms and strategic initiatives eg time charter index demurrage bunker prices etc wayfinder also provides data that helps operators understand their carbon intensity and prioritize emission reductions to meet new and existing regulations to learn more about
