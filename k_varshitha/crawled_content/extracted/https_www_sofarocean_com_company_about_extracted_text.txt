What We Do
Sofar connect the world's oceans to power a more sustainable future.
Sofar unlocks ocean data at scale. We deployed hundreds of Spotters globally to create the worldâs largest privately-owned network of ocean sensors that collects 1.5 million real-time observations daily. Our team of ocean scientists assimilates this real-time data into our marine weather forecasts, which are up to 50% more accurate than traditional models.
In maritime shipping, we use these high-accuracy forecasts and vessel performance models to provide optimized guidance and save ships time, fuel, and emissions. We also equip researchers, operators, and innovators with our devices and data to power marine research and sustainable commercial solutions. Customers access data from our global sensor network and deploy our extensible Spotter platform to collect real-time surface and subsurface observations.
Sofarâs team of engineers, ocean scientists, and business professionals is based in San Francisco, California.
