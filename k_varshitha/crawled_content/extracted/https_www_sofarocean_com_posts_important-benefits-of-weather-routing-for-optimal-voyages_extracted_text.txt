each and every voyage emily heaslip november 8 2021 ï back ocean science ocean science wayfinder analysis important benefits of weather routing for optimal voyages emily heaslip weather routing â using realtime weather data to find the optimal route for a ship voyage â is becoming more and more advanced thanks to tools like sofar oceanâs wayfinder product and with better weather routing shipping companies are able to save fuel improve safety minimize delays and capture other benefits that allow them to operate more efficiently with fewer risksâ weather routing sounds straightforward but in reality itâs a complex calculation weather routing seeks to find the âbest routeâ based on the weather forecast ship characteristics and cargo requirements notably this doesnât always mean finding the shortest travel time weather routing seeks to optimize voyages by avoiding the risk of adverse weather protecting the crew and optimizing fuel consumption simultaneouslyâ here are some of the important benefits of weather routing and to start realizing those benefitsâ reduce operating costs shipping companies often run tight margins â every dollar counts weather routing allows vessels to use less fuel and deliver goods on time leading to significant cost savings likewise shipping companies that use weather routing to optimize their voyage can improve their margins by reducing insurance costs  saving on crew overtime pay  and avoiding additional fees from port operatorsâ improve safety weather is one of the biggest risks to ships at sea and any tools that can help shipping companies avoid disaster are vital over the last decade around 100 big shipping vessels have been destroyed usually due to extreme weather casualty statistics indicate that â bad weather â is a contributing factor in one in five ship losses realtime weather routing allows ship navigation teams to reroute vessels as needed avoiding hurricanes cyclones and storms to improve safety of crew and cargoâ likewise the imo is putting a spotlight on crew member safety after the pandemic caused more than 300000 seafarers to be stranded at sea for months if anything the pandemic put renewed focus on ensuring that crew member safety is of paramount importance weather routing can play a role in preventing accidents well beyond the pandemicâ meet decarbonization targets weather routing plays a key role in meeting decarbonization goals the marine environment protection committee committed to trying to help cut shipping carbon emissions by 40 â as compared to 2008 levels â by 2030 thereâs no easy way to achieve this important goal but weather routing can helpâ âthe practice of voyage optimization is very costeffective as it allows shipping companies to reduce both their costs and their carbon footprint simply by passing routes in which the ship may not run as efficiently due to bad weather conditionsâ said researchers â the imo calculated that vessels released 112 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide the year before in 2007 by that estimate emissions would need to be reduced by 560 million metric tons â equivalent to the emissions from 102 million carsâ save fuelâ as the shipping industry strives to meet decarbonization goals  reducing fuel usage is not only more sustainable but also more costefficient the imo estimates weather routing saves at least 3 in fuel consumption for container ships that number increases to up to 10 since fuel costs make up an estimated 5060 of total ship operating costs  these savings can be massiveâ the wayfinder platform optimizes a vesselâs entire voyage by evaluating not only weather forecasts but also business metrics such as market impact contract terms and strategic initiatives eg time charter index demurrage bunker prices coâ targets innovations like the wayfinder both protect an ocean logistics companyâs business interests and help meet the goals of the imo ghg strategyâ minimize delays supply chain delays have captured headlines in recent weeks as shipping companies struggle to recover from pandemicrelated shutdowns bottlenecks at ports around the world have prevented ships from offloading goods in a timely manner the last thing ships need is weatherrelated delays that can be common during hurricane season  lack of understanding of marine weather can account for 80 of the impact on performance according to shipping insight specialists stratumfive  when route planning includes weather data shipping companies can avoid the worst weather and prepare for that which canât be avoided this allows ships to minimize delays as much as possible during these difficult timesâ â to learn more about ship routing check out our wayfinder product  which uses data collected from the worldâs largest fleet of
