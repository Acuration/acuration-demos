If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual making this purchase on your behalf represents and warrants that they have the authority to bind you to these terms, and you agree to be bound by this Agreement.
3. Â PRODUCTS.
Â Sofar reserves the right to modify or change at any time, and, at its discretion, to inform you of any modifications or changes to Products ordered under this Agreement that affect form, fit, function, or performance prior to shipment.

4. REMOTE ACCESS PACKAGES.
Sofar may include with your purchase of Product or Products (including, but not necessarily limited to the Sofar Spotter ocean weather platform), the packaged option to communicate with, and receive alerts and observations from, the Product(s) through a remote access satellite telemetry service (âRemote Access Packageâ). Â Remote Access Package offerings are based on data transmission sizes and transmission frequencies which are determined by Sofar in its sole discretion. Sofar reserves the right to modify or change a Remote Access Package at any time, including by reducing the amount of data being transmitted or the frequency of data transmissions, or limiting the length of the subscription, with or without notice to you. Your Remote Access Package shall begin on the day you register the product(s) to your online user account, or three months following Sofarâs shipment of the product(s) to you, whichever is sooner. The Remote Access Package shall terminate one year after it begins, or earlier depending on your use.

6. ORDER ACCEPTANCE; ALLOCATION.
Â Orders are subject to acceptance by Sofar. Orders are accepted only when shipped by Sofar to you.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN HEREIN, ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE ON AN âAS ISâ BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, AND SOFAR AND ITS SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AND STATUTORY INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
