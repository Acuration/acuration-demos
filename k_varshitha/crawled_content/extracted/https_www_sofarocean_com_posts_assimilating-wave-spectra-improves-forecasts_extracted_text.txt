observations of wave spectra produce marine weather forecast improvements sofar ocean december 7 2022 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis how assimilating wave spectra improves ocean weather forecasts sofar ocean what are wave spectra wave spectra convey the distribution of wave energy over different directions and frequencies they add a new element to ocean weather forecasts not captured by integrated wave statistics such as significant wave height observations of wave spectra can tell us what direction the wave energy is traveling to how energetic the waves are and what the dominant wave period is observations of significant wave height on the other hand can only tell us information about wave magnitude sofarâs operational ocean weather forecasts assimilate observations of wave spectra made by the global network of spotter smart buoys in fact the âdistributed spotter sensor network opens up the opportunity to develop the first operational spectral waveda data assimilationâ forecast by assimilating buoy observations of wave spectra along with satellite and widelyavailable in situ data sofar increases the accuracy of its marine weather forecasts which outperform existing models by 4050  source  letâs visualize the components of the wave spectrum and demonstrate how assimilating wave spectra improves forecast accuracy how to visualize the wave spectrum in figure 1  a deconstructed polar plot shows the wave spectrum figure 1 a deconstructed polar plot showing the wave spectrum direction left frequency middle energy right direction  the polar coordinates in the leftmost graphic show the direction that the waves are traveling to like a needle on a compass the position of the wave energy colored area on the polar plot indicates what the wave direction is frequency  the radius of the polar plot in the middle graphic shows the wave frequency when the wave energy is closer to the center of the polar plot the wave frequency is lower ie ocean swell when the wave energy is further from the center of the polar plot the wave frequency is higher ie wind wavesâ energy  the colored areas in the rightmost polar plot convey wave energy with warmer colors representing more energetic waves when the waves are at their most energetic a deep red zone is visible spotter observations of wave spectra provide a granular view of the wave dynamics that the buoy is sampling the wave spectrum in figure 1 describes wave energy traveling to the northwest with a dominant wave frequency of 01 hz or a wave period of 10 s now letâs explore how these observations are assimilated into sofarâs forecast and used to improve forecast accuracyâ using wave spectra to improve forecast accuracyâ the top row of figure 2 below shows three polar plots the top left plot spotter shows the observations of the wave spectrum recorded by a spotter buoy as hurricane ian passed to its west see map in bottom left these observations of wave direction frequency and energy serve as a benchmark or ground truth to assess forecast accuracy the top middle plot spectral analysis shows a sofar forecast that assimilates the observations of wave spectra recorded by the spotter the top right plot significant wave height analysis shows a sofar forecast that assimilates only the observations of significant wave height recorded by the spotter to determine which forecast is more similar to the ground truth spotter observations we compare the difference between the wave spectrum forecasted by the spectral analysis and the observations of the wave spectrum made by the spotter spectral analysis  spotter the difference between the wave spectrum forecasted by the significant wave height analysis and the observations of the wave spectrum made by the spotter both are plotted in the bottom row of figure 2  figure 2 top row left to right a polar plot of the spotter buoyâs observations of the wave spectrum a sofar forecast of the wave spectrum that assimilates observations of the wave spectrum made by the spotter a sofar forecast of the wave spectrum that assimilates the observations of significant wave height made by the spotter bottom row left to right a map showing the position of the spotter yellow pentagon with a color gradient of significant wave heights generated by hurricane ian to its west a polar plot showing the difference between the wave spectrum forecasted by the spectral analysis and the wave spectrum recorded by the spotter  a polar plot showing the difference between the wave spectrum forecasted by the significant wave height analysis and the wave spectrum recorded by the spotter the spectral analysis is more aligned with the spotter observations than the significant wave height analysis assimilating the observations of wave spectra corrects information about the wave frequency direction and magnitude when a forecast assimilates just significant wave height it only corrects information about the wave magnitude as a result the significant wave height analysis incorrectly predicts too much northward wave propagation and distributes the hurricaneâs wave energy over too wide of a range of directions the assimilation of spotter
