ocean science ocean science analysis the science behind sofar ocean marine weather forecasts we deployed an array of 200 weather sensors in the pacific and assimilate the data in our global models we have reduced forecast rms errors by over 20 providing the highest fidelity wave forecasts in the world tim janssen february 26 2020 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis the science behind sofar ocean marine weather forecasts tim janssen to improve ocean insights and forecasts sofar operates the largest privately owned ocean weather sensor network in the world see figure 1 currently consisting of nearly 200 realtime weather sensors in the pacific each sensor measures wave conditions surface winds and drift currents and transmits the data to the sofar cloud in realtime we assimilate the data in our wave forecast models to create the highest fidelity wave forecasts in the world compared to noaa models the sofar data network reduces model rms errors by more than 20 across the board see figure 3 and more than 50 in highenergy swell forecasts see figure 2 the best part all our realtime sensor data and enhanced model forecasts are publicly available at weathersofaroceancomâ â on december 27th 2019 an energetic storm system developed in the western pacific about 1000km east of the japanese coast figure 1 the extreme surface winds generated 30m waves taller than a 7story building these energetic waves radiate across the northern pacific basin first approaching hawaii and then making their way to the west coast of the united statesâ figure 1 the map shows part of the sofar sensor network with a wave height overlay for december 27th sofar model a large storm event is driving extreme waves in the northwest pacific the pentagonshaped icons indicate locations of live spotter weather buoys currently deployed in the pacific the yellow spotter icons indicate sensors that are used in the data assimilation the red circled spotter icons represent spotters that were not included in the assimilation see figure 3 we compare wave height time series at spotter 0323 and ndbc station 51000 figure 2 which are indicated on the map predicting the size and arrival times of these waves at sites around the pacific is important for coastal protection eg inundation of islands safety at sea and offshore operations the forecast centers of the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa use statistical wave models wavewatchiii to do this for these types of energetic events predictions are often inaccurate predicting arrival times that are many hours too early or late and wave heights that can be off by 100 or more to improve this sofar ingests all available data from its network in its own version of a global wave forecast model see figure 1 this datadriven model generally performs much better than noaa and for this specific event rms error reductions of more than 50 were achieved see figure 2 to be clear the sofar global wave model is the exact same model as used by noaa in every detail the difference is entirely due to the data figure 2 comparison of 1day forecasts to wave height observations at two stations for the arrival of waves radiated by the december 27th storm event see figure 1 left panel spotter0323 right panel ndbc station 51000 these two sites show about 50 reduction in rms error for both sites this implies that the data assimilation adds considerable skill to the 24hr wave forecasts refinements in the assimilation strategy will further improve this and hereâs why this is importantâ with over 70 of our planet covered in water the surface of the ocean is one of the most important regions of our world nearly all economic activity on our oceans takes place near the surface eg maritime shipping fisheries aquaculture marine renewable energy recreation and the interface between ocean and atmosphere is critical in prediction of global weather and climate in short ocean weather matters yet weirdly enough we also know almost nothing about it buoy networks that provide accurate data are invariably anchored near the coast in water depths typically less than a few hundred meters away from the coast in deeper water extensive buoy networks are not economically feasible for weather information in open ocean we rely on a combination of visual observations made by ship crew and satellitebased proxy measurements these sources have limited accuracy and are available at irregular space and time intervals in most places and most of the time we have absolutely no information about realtime ocean weather conditions this complete lack of information affects safety at sea and severely limits our ability to predict and forecast weather events developing and traveling across the ocean stateoftheart weather models developed and used by worldleading operational forecast centers such as noaa in the united states and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf in europe are numerical computer models that use the laws of newtonian mechanics and thermodynamics to propagate weather information forward in space and timeâ these models have gotten progressively better since the 1960s with the rapid development of the modern computer and computational techniques in fact our numerical weather models are now so good that the skill of our forecasts is entirely â limited by the lack of ocean weather data after all even if a weather model were perfect and by definition models are never perfect representations of reality its predictions can only ever be as good as our knowledge of the current conditions any error in the ocean weather nowstate will be propagated forward in our forecast models the old adage âgarbage in is garbage outâ holds trueâ although all of this speaks to how much progress we have made in numerical weather models it also illustrates the next barrier the oceanic data gap and that is not necessarily an easier problem to solve the ocean is a harsh environment most of it is too remote for wideband communications and it is filled with stuff that modern electronics do not get along with salt water violent motions storms breaking waves and then there is the size with a surface area approaching 140 million sq miles we need to get away from single âexquisiteâ sensor systems that can provide extreme accuracy at a single point instead we should focus on developing massively distributed networks with lowcost nodes to provide unprecedented sensor density in this distributed sensing paradigm a single sensor is a disposable node and the complete array is the instrument to develop this paradigm and test it our team has recently deployed 200 spotter sensors in the pacific basin that collect realtime data on waves wind surface drift and water temperature sst it is the first distributed sensor network of its kind and represents the largest and most advanced privately owned ocean data network in the world and of course we are rapidly expanding this network to provide the first directaccessible global ocean weather sensor network figure 3 scatter plots of modeled vs observed wave height at randomly selected sites in the northern pacific for the period october 1 2019 through december 31 2019 the randomly selected validation sites were not included in the assimilation see figure 1 redcircled spotters left panel sofar assimilation model right panel noaa model the assimilation of the data network into the sofar model produces a 25 reduction in rms error across the board and 50 reduction in model biasâ to improve weather forecasts the sofar team runs its own global numerical weather models we start with ocean waves since they are an important part of ocean weather and affect both open ocean activities and coastal dynamics to do that we run the same model as noaa wavewatchiii  st4 physics but we feed our realtime sensor data to the model this process of adding data to models is called data assimilation if we would have only a few data points in the pacific assimilation would be ineffective however with the data density we have now even simple assimilation strategies work much better than they shouldâ to keep things simple we started by deploying a widely used technique called optimized interpolation oi basically every time we start a forecast loop we adjust the initial condition the nowstate to better match the observations in the regions where we have sensors in this way we ânudgeâ the model to follow the measurements as much as possible and this information is then propagated forward in time forecast by the physics numerical model itâs a very simple but efficient method to integrate observations in model forecastsâ even with a simple assimilation strategy the sheer density of our network provides immediate and meaningful improvements to global wave predictions to quantify our performance over a longer period of time we compare our model and noaaâs model to the observations the data at the sites where we make the comparison are of course not included in the assimilation and the results are impressive see figure 3 compared to the noaa model the sofar assimilation model has a 25 reduction in rms errors across the board and more than 50 reduction in model bias notably during highenergy events when it matters most the differences are typically considerably larger than that again there is nothing special about our model itâs the data the sofar team is committed to providing the world with access to unprecedented ocean data density the sofar global ocean weather sensor network is a first step toward that goal our contribution to reducing the oceanic data gap to disseminate the data globally we built a modern api for seamless integration into modeling systems and realtime worldwide access moreover we continue to work with academic research groups worldwide provide better ocean insights and improve weather and
