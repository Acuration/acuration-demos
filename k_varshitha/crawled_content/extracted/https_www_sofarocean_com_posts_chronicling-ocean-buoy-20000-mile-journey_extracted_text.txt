ocean science analysis chronicling an ocean buoyâs 20000 mile journey the story of grandpa spotter an ocean buoy that traveled nearly 20000 miles in the pacific ocean over the course of three plus years sofar ocean december 22 2022 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis chronicling an ocean buoyâs 20000 mile journey sofar ocean figure 1 the drift track of grandpa spotter from december 2018 to july 2022 after nearly four years at sea spotter smart buoy spot0164 â lovingly referred to as âgrandpa spotterâ by the sofar ocean team â has finally gone off the grid the device which was one of the oldest freedrifting spotters in operation sent its final transmission in early july grandpa spotterâs remarkable drift track is shown in figure 1 above  charting grandpa spotterâs course spot0164 or grandpa spotter at the port of long beach the buoy was loaded onto a container ship and deployed in the pacific ocean on december 4 2018 grandpa spotterâs pacific ocean journey started on december 4 2018 when it was deployed by a container ship traveling between long beach california and honolulu hawaiâi many freedrifting spotters are deployed by âships of opportunityâ like this one during a voyage the crew tosses the durable buoys overboard at predetermined coordinates along the shipâs route freedrifting spotter buoys are often deployed by âships of opportunity photo credit ocean exploration trust for the next three plus years grandpa spotter meandered its way across the worldâs largest ocean basin making it as far west as japanâs outlying islands in may 2022 the 5487 miles separating grandpa spotterâs easternmost and westernmost points shown in figure 2  is longer than the distance covered by a flight from hawaii to japan figure 2 the magenta line shows the shortest path â 5487 miles â between grandpa spotterâs easternmost and westernmost points the yellow line shows grandpa spotterâs actual drift track which covers nearly 20000 miles grandpa spotter of course did not take the most efficient route across the pacific when every twist and turn caused by ocean currents and winds is added up grandpa spotterâs total distance traveled is 19563 miles as shown in figure 3  if grandpa spotterâs full drift track was stretched around the equator it would cover over 78 of earthâs 25000 mile circumference figure 3 during its three plus years at sea grandpa spotter traveled 19563 miles that is more than 78 of the earthâs 25000 mile circumference around the equator what data did grandpa spotter collect during its journey grandpa spotter kept busy counting only the observations it made of significant wave height grandpa spotter collected and transmitted more than 34500 data points these observations along with tens of thousands of other ocean data points were assimilated into sofarâs operational marine weather forecast to improve its accuracy grandpa spotterâs most extreme day at sea came on april 14 2022 while drifting off of the coast of japan the buoy passed by the outer edge of typhoon malakas a powerful storm that had registered maximum sustained winds of 109 mph just two days prior in figure 4  watch as grandpa spotter â the largest yellow pentagon â drifts into malakasâ path the largest significant wave height that grandpa spotter recorded was about 33 feet which means that the largest individual wave height it observed was likely greater than 65 feet thatâs the size of a sixstory building figure 4  typhoon malakas which is colored by significant wave height passed the japanese coast in midapril 2022 grandpa spotter largest yellow pentagon drifted into malakasâ path on april 14th recording 33foot significant wave heights additional spotter buoys smaller yellow pentagons in the region are also shown malakas swell continued to propagate across the pacific ocean and eventually caused a lineupclearing set at mavericks northern californiaâs legendary big wave location we tracked this unusual occurrence in a deepdive blog post  whatâs next for grandpa spotter although grandpa spotter is no longer transmitting data its story may have another chapter from time to time freedrifting spotter buoys wash ashore and are discovered by citizens scientists surfers mariners etc each buoy is clearly marked as a scientific instrument includes a unique spotid and lists contact information for the sofar team so if you happen to stumble across spot0164 please give us a call â we would love to get grandpa spotter back to san francisco for further analysis and a few belated birthday parties to receive the latest
