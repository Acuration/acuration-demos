ï back product product wayfinder dynamic route optimization finding the shortest path with wayfinder sofar ocean imagine a world with no bad weather no rain no fog no storms all sunshine all the time the wind is never blowing so there are no waves for the sake of argument imagine that there are no ocean currents either in this beaufort zero world navigating across the ocean is easy the cheapest path between two points is simply the shortest path the great circle distance unfortunately for all oceangoing vessels this weatherless world is imaginary wind waves and currents must all be contended with and accounted for when navigating the globe these natural complications ensure that the great circle path is almost never the cheapest way to get from point a to point b for example slight detours from the great circle might allow a vessel to trade adverse currents for favorable currents headwinds for tailwinds or heavy swell for calm seas resulting in a safer voyage that uses less fuel despite traveling a greater distance of course the billion dollar question remains if the great circle is not the cheapest path then what is  that is precisely the question that sofar oceans wayfinder helps to answer and this is the story of how we do it we start by collecting vast amounts of ocean data using our global network of freedrifting spotter buoys each spotter collects wave wind current sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure data and transmits it via satellite to our dashboard providing a realtime snapshot of meteorological conditions and sea state across the most heavily trafficked shipping routes in the world we then assimilate that data into our proprietary wave model and combine our forecast with global ocean current simulations so that we can predict all relevant metocean variables up to two weeks into the future with this information the vessel captain and sofarâs operations team can spot potential storms before they pose a threat and plan a route that minimizes danger to the vessel and her crew safe routing is the most important service that wayfinder offers but knowing the ocean wave and weather conditions is only one part of the equation in order to plan a route that is both safe and costeffective we also need to know how vessels respond to environmental conditions that response is captured by our vessel performance model a highfidelity and datadriven model that we build for each vessel that we route drawing on individual vessel characteristics and historical performance data the vessel performance model describes how fast a vessel will travel and how much fuel it will burn for a given rpm setting in any combination of wind wave and current conditions this can be visualized using the rpm curves shown in figures 13 these rpm curves provide helpful intuition into the physics that dictate how vessels respond to environmental conditions and thus how we make our routing recommendations for example as the current changes from favorable to adverse from the blue to the red line in figure 1 the vessel will travel more slowly figure 1a and burn more fuel figure 1b for a given rpm setting this is akin to paddling upstream in a river you might expend twice the effort and only go half as fast stronger winds and larger waves increase resistance too as shown in figure 2 as the beaufort force â an estimate of wind speed â increases from a modest bf 2 up to a potentially lifethreatening bf 8 however the extent to which wind and waves impact vessel performance depends strongly on the direction they are coming from as expected we see in figure 3 that head waves and head wind cause the largest decreases in vessel speed and the largest increases in fuel consumption figure 1 a vessel speed and b daily fuel consumption as a function of rpm for relative ocean currents ranging from 2 kts favorable blue to 2 kts adverse red figure 2 a vessel speed and b daily fuel consumption as a function of rpm for varying beaufort force levels as bf increases blue to red vessel speed decreases and fuel consumption increases figure 3 a vessel speed and b daily fuel consumption as a function of rpm for varying wavecurrent directions impacts are minimal for beam and following windswaves while bow and head waves can result in significant performance decreases now that we know how much fuel is used and how fast the vessel can travel for a given set of environmental conditions the final step in the wayfinder optimization process is to find the cheapest route through safe waters safety is ensured by restricting possible paths to regions where forecasted wave heights and wind speed remain below captainspecified thresholds but measuring economic cost is more complicated as discussed above the cheapest route will not necessarily be the route that travels the shortest distance rather the cheapest route will be the one that finds the best combination of fuel savings and time savings  how do we calculate fuel savings and time savings we use the vessel performance model the total fuel cost is quantified as the predicted amount of fuel burned during the voyage multiplied by the current fuel price whereas the time cost is quantified as the amount of time the voyage takes route distance divided by predicted vessel speed multiplied by the opportunity cost of time for that vessel therefore these costs will be lower if the vessel travels faster and burns less fuel both of which can be accomplished by routing through favorable currents and avoiding strong headwinds or head waves see figures 13 and while these rules of thumb have been used by captains for millennia wayfinderâs stateoftheart vessel performance model combined with our highly accurate ocean weather forecasts ensures that the chosen path is as safe and efficient as possible during a voyage wayfinder also takes into account additional voyage constraints such as barred rpmâ ranges required time of arrival and maximum daily fuel allowance these additional inputs increase the effectiveness of the optimization engine as the safest cheapest route can be delivered in the context of a vessels specific business and safety needs thus far this discussion has been purely theoretical so letâs look at a specific example to clarify how the system works figure 4 shows a recent routing scenario where a vessel was steaming from south africa to brazil through the south atlantic the vesselâs initial route shown in black went further south resulting in a total voyage distance of 3236 nautical miles  that southern route however had a significant drawback it brought the vessel closer to a major storm system as shown in figure 4 the vessel would have encountered 45 m bow waves along its initial route which would not only pose a potential safety hazard but would reduce the vessel speed and increase fuel consumption as depicted by the rpm curves in figure 3 figure 4 the planned initial route black and revised optimal route pink proposed to a vessel steaming through the south atlantic colors on the map denote significant wave height m while the arrows show the wave direction spotter buoys collecting ocean data are marked as yellow pentagons luckily this was precisely the type of situation that wayfinder was created to address instead of taking the vessel through the unfavorable weather wayfinder found a safer and cheaper route  shown in orange  further to the north though this optimized route was 53 nautical miles longer avoiding the stormâs waves resulted in an arrival time only 26 minutes later than the original eta this resulted in a slight reduction in opportunity savings denoted by the time charter cost  but those losses were vastly offset by the reduced fuel consumption along the optimal route  by avoiding the storm the vessel was predicted to burn 48 mt less fuel  resulting in a total savings of 13234 over the course of the voyageâ in an industry like transoceanic shipping with high risk and thin margins carriers need to capitalize on any opportunity to shave costs but when harsh weather strikes the shortestdistance route may not present that opportunity either because of safety considerations or suboptimal vessel performance now there is a better way through bestinclass forecast accuracy tailormade vessel performance models and precision guidance wayfinder will always find an alternative route that minimizes costs while keeping the vessel her crew and cargo safe sofar in the news in the news october 23 2023 wayfinder delivers 8 total equivalent fuel savings on
