Our mission is to connect the world's oceans to power a more sustainable future.
Why oceans?
The oceans cover over 70% of the Earthâs surface. They drive our weather, power global trade, and are the backbone of coastal communities worldwide. By connecting the worldâs oceans, we empower science, society, and industry to be stewards for the sea, and help make a more sustainable future possible for our planet.
