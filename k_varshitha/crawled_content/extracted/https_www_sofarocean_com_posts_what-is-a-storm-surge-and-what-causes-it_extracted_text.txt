science analysis what is a storm surge and what causes it lack of education in coastal communities around the world makes storm surges particularly dangerous learn more about storm surges in this guide emily heaslip september 26 2021 ï back ocean science ocean science analysis what is a storm surge and what causes it emily heaslip flooding from hurricanes and tropical cyclones accounts for nearly 90 of hurricane deaths â â and about half of those are caused by the storm surge storm surges are dangerous not only for the abnormally powerful high tides that they produce but also for the lack of public awareness about how they workâ take for instance typhoon haiyan in 2013 when the tropical storm hit the philippines it brought a 75 meter storm surge to shore causing the deaths of more than 7000 people sadly there were plenty of coastal flood warnings that the storm surge was imminent however few people understood the threat storm surges posed and didnât evacuate in timeâ lack of understanding about the risk of storm surge impacts communities all over the world for this reason letâs break down what exactly a storm surge is what causes it and how to avoid becoming the victim of a storm surgeâ what is a storm surge a storm surge is defined by noaa as âan abnormal rise of water generated by a storm over and above the predicted astronomical tidesâ storm surges are not the same as storm tides storm tides are the rise in water level that occurs due to a storm surge and the astronomical tideâ â essentially a storm surge occurs when ocean water is forced toward the coast by a combination of powerful hurricane winds and low pressure hereâs how a storm surge forms and creates coastal floodingâ what causes a storm surge the primary cause of a storm surge is strong winds a storm surge starts to form as winds swirl around pushing seawater into a â mound â at the center of the storm the faster the wind speed the more water piles up in addition low air pressure at the center of the hurricane or tropical storm adds to the mound roughly 5 of the size of the mound is attributable to low air pressureâ â storm surges are complex and can be impacted by a variety of factors  including intensity  higher wind speeds lead to bigger storm surges central pressure  low pressure can account for 5 of the size forward speed  slower storms can lead to a higher broader storm surge inland while faster storms can create more storm surge along the open coast size  typically a storm with a large wind field leads to more storm surge storms with smaller wind fields account for less storm surgeâ angle of approach  those storms that are perpendicular to the coastline cause more storm surge whereas those that are parallel will cause lessâ width and slope of continental shelf  wide gentle slopes lead to more storm surge while sharp slopes cause less storm surgeâ local features  geography such as the concavity of coastlines bays rivers headlands islands etc can cause greater storm surge impactâ these factors all interplay to create different coastal flooding outcomes for instance a category 4 storm that hits louisiana could produce a 20foot storm surge due to the coastlineâs wide shallow continental shelf however that same storm surge in miami might only lead to an 8  9 foot surge given miami beachâs steep continental shelfâ to understand what a storm surge looks like researchers at the national center for atmospheric research ncar created an animation to show how quickly 9 feet of storm surge can flood a coastal city using data from hurricane matthew which made landfall in the southeast united states in october 2016 the team used 3d gis modeling software to show how the storm surge progressedâ â luckily researchers arenât limited to retroactively modeling a storm surge noaaâs sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh model is used to predict coastal inundation risk and forecast the potential range of a storm surgeâ how are storm surges forecasted slosh is a computerized numerical model developed by the national weather service nws it is used to estimate storm surge heights by taking into account the atmospheric pressure size forward speed and track data these parameters allow slosh to create a model of the wind field that drives the storm surge in addition the model can use the coastlineâs unique geography including bay and river configurations water depths and other physical features like levees bridges and roads to determine â maximum potential impact due to storm surgeââ there are three approaches that slosh can use to estimate surge deterministic approach  using physics equations this approach creates a single simulation based on a âperfectâ forecast it is heavily dependent on accurate meteorological inputs as weâve covered however the complex factors that play a role in the formation and landfall of a storm surge make the single simulation likely to be inaccurateâ probabilistic approach  the psurge approach incorporates statistics from past forecast performances to create a number of slosh runs it models the astronomical tide to create a distribution of surge impactâ composite approach  this model predicts surge by running slosh several thousand times with different storm conditions this creates the maximum envelopes of water meows and maximum of meows moms outcomes considered to be the most accurate forecast of storm surge vulnerabilityâ âthe meows and moms play an integral role in emergency management as they form the basis for the development of the nations evacuation zonesâ said noaa  slosh models are considered to be the highest standard providing forecasts for hurricane surge elevations with an accuracy of  20 percent  with data from sources like sofar oceanâs global grid of spotter buoys  these models can only become more accurate over time â thereby allowing teams to evacuate coastal communities with maximum advance warningâ if youâre
