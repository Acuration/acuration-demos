spotter system data validation statistics at mavericks to compare the spotter data with traditional scientific instrumentation we deploy a spotter alongside a datawell waverider near mavericks the california bigwave surf spot detailed comparison of spectra and directional moments confirms outstanding spotter data quality tim janssen march 24 2017 Ã¯ back product product spotter system data validation statistics at mavericks tim janssen the spoondrift offices are located in half moon bay about 1 mile east of the legendary mavericks surf break in this area the coastline is fully exposed to energetic swell wave fields radiating in from both the north pacific and the southern ocean on top of that local storms produce strong winds driving energetic and steep wind seas a rough place to be on the water but ideal testing grounds for spotter experimental setup to validate the statistical estimates from spotter measurements we deploy a spotter alongside a datawell waverider dwrg4 in about 40m of water depth at our test site just north of the mavericks surf break see figure on top during the experiment the instruments are geographically about 200m apart to keep the systems in place we use identical inverse catenary mooring setups with 12 scope for both instruments to eliminate differences in mooring response the lightweight mooring setup did result in mooring effects clipping during heavy winds these effects were most pronounced in the datawell observations and likely due to its larger inertia since this has nothing to do with the sensing capabilities and is entirely due to the mooring system we have excluded such data from quantitative comparisons extensive mooring testing is ongoing and will be discussed in a separate blog purely as a measuring device the two instruments are similar in that they both are surfacetracking wave followers moving with the waves on the surface of the ocean and they are somewhat similar size spotter is slightly smaller the differences include weight 38lbs for the waverider vs 12lbs for the spotter and sampling rate 128hz vs 25hz as a result spotter can in theory measure higherfrequency waves nyquist frequency is 125hz and due to its lower weight is expected to be more responsive to shorter waves in the wave field to be consistent for this comparison we only consider the frequency range 003hz06hz which both instruments can resolve to be clear the datawell waverider is an established instrument and by many considered the industry standard the comparisons shown here are not to suggest otherwise but merely to validate that spotter produces similar data quality during the period considered time series of statistics we consider the period from april 18 2017 through april 30 2017 during which both instruments were on site and operational most of the time over this period conditions varied from lowenergy pure swell mixed swellsea strongly windforced conditions and even a brief spell of fetchlimited wave growth when the wind blew from the east figure 1 shows a time series of bulk statistics including from top to bottom significant wave height defined here as hm0  peak period mean direction and peak direction the bulk statistics for wave height and mean direction are calculated through integration over the frequency range 003hz  06hz for definitions of these parameters see eg pearman et al 2014 from the peak direction and peak period we can deduce that during the first few days of this period there is a mixed seeswell field followed by lowenergy swell and after april 24 conditions are mostly dominated by locally generated wind seas the data gaps in in figure 2 are due to either the instruments being out of the water temporarily or data that was rejected due to mooring effects during highwind conditions in general the agreement between the two instruments is excellent throughout the period figure 2 shows a time series of the distribution of wave variance in frequency space the spectrum here the white bars bars in the color plots indicate times when the instruments were out of the water or otherwise not collecting data the highwind conditions that resulted in mooring effects are retained here since in frequency space those effects can be visually somewhat separated visible as high energy levels at low frequencies overall both instruments provide the very similar spectral structure in the energy carrying wave range see figure 2 the variance density plot see figure 2 considers the variance of the surface elevation what we typically associate with the wave motion however to estimate directional properties of the wave field a surfacefollowing instrument should measure the threedimensional displacement vector accurately displacements in east north and vertical direction to establish that we compare the lowestorder directional moments from both instruments see figure 3 these moments involve crosscorrelations between the three displacement time series easting northing and vertical and thus provide a more complete albeit normalized check on the complete representation of the wave motion the evolution of these moments over time see figure 3 characterize variations in the directional make up of the wave field due to changes in swell and wind directions notable the directional moments are sensitive and highly variable the agreement between the two instruments is clearly very good snapshots of wave statistics for a more quantitative comparison between the two instruments we further consider statistical estimates of spectral variables from observations collected on three times during the experiment namely case 1 april 19 1500 utc remnants of swell from west and fetchlimited wave growth driving wind waves from east from shore case 2 april 23 0400 utc lowenergy swell from south and west light winds case 3 april 28 1430 utc energetic locallygenerated sea state in figure 4 we show spectral variables as a function of frequency for case 1 in what follows we will have more of these types of figures with the same variables so we will step through them here in more detail to help interpretation for case 1 figure 4 we see a double swell peak in the variance spectrum top left panel one peak below and one just above 01hz the variance density spectrum provides a measure of wave energy at each frequency it is derived from the measured surface elevation alone although it can equally well be derived from horizontal displacements or velocities if the water depth is known the mean directions top right panel figure 4 show that the lowerfrequency swell peak comes from slightly south of west slight less than 270o whereas the higherfrequency swell peak comes from west 270o the mean direction top right abruptly transitions from west 270o to east 90o at around 035 hz this is due to the wind blowing from the east from land which results in a fetchlimited condition and causes the higherfrequency windforced waves to come from the east from land this is also reflected in the directional spreading function figure 4 bottom left panel the swell peaks have relatively low directional spreading with increasing spreading in the higherfrequency parts of the spectrum consistent with a transition to fetchlimited conditions in that range finally the crosscoherence gxz  see bottom right measures the crosscoherence of the easting and vertical displacements this value is close to unity if the waves are narrowband in directional space and traveling along a eastwest line this is consistent with the large coherence values we see both below 035hz swell peaks from west and above 035hz wind sea from east is consistent in summary this is a fairly complex wave field consisting of at least three distinct wave fields that are readily identified by measurements of both instruments both instruments are also in excellent agreement for all these parameters the only systematic difference is that in the highfrequency tail of the spectrum spotter measures slightly more energy this is most likely due to the fact that spotter is lighter and slightly smaller making it a bit more responsive to very short and steep waves note that the vertical scale is logarithmic and these highfrequency differences are extremely small the directional moments for case 1 are shown in figure 5 the agreement is excellent throughout the frequency range from the directional moments and the variance spectrum we can estimate the twodimensional frequencydirection distribution which is shown in figure 6 note that the twodimensional spectrum as shown in figure 6 is insightful but technically cannot be fully resolved by a single wave buoy it can be resolved with an array the spectra here are estimated using the maximum entropy method proposed lygre  krogstad 1986 which introduces additional constraints to provide a reasonable and smooth spectral estimate that being said both estimates are very similar which is of course also implied by the excellent agreement seen in the variance spectrum figure 4 top left and the directional moments figure 5 the same figures are shown for case 2 42317 0400 utc and case 3 42817 1400 utc below to shows the excellent agreement between spotter and waverider for these different conditions case 2 below figure 7 8 and 9 is characterized by a longperiod 17s swell field from southwest and a locally generated wind peak around 025hz driven by 20 mph winds from the northwest this is fairly wideband wave field with wind waves from the northwest at large angles with the south swell case 3 below figures 10 11 and 12 is characterized by strong wind forcing resulting in shortperiod swell with a peak period of about 85 s and significant wave height of 22m for these windforced conditions the wave spectrum takes on a jonswaplike shape with an f 5 energy rolloff in the tail of the spectrum see figure 10 top left panel again the statistics obtained from both instruments are in excellent agreement everywhere Ã¢ references lygre a and he krogstad 1986 maximum entropy estimation of the directional distribution in ocean wave spectra j of phys ocean 16
