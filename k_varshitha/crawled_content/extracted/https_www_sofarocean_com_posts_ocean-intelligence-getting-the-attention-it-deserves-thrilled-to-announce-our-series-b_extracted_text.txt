our blind spot we are on a mission to fix that tim janssen november 1 2021 ï back product product no items found ocean intelligence getting the attention it deserves  thrilled to announce our series b tim janssen at sofar our mission is to build a more sustainable future powered by ocean intelligence we deliver largescale ocean data to accelerate climate insights and want to scale this and bring ocean data to the massesâ we believe in âoceans firstâ if we have to choose between more profit or a better ocean we will choose the ocean always we only have one planet we are all in this together and thatâs reflected in the way we work we respect and help each other wholeheartedly if we have to challenge ourselves we do it with heart  weâre vocal keep an open mind listen to one another have healthy discussions and commit to a common goal we are mission driven and focus on innovation for our customers and the planet at all timesâ iâm thrilled to announce weâve closed our series b fundraise with a syndicate round with union square ventures usv and the foundry group  our team is at the heart of everything we do and the funding will be used to scale our teams across the board from engineering to gotomarket iâm excited to bring oceans to the forefront of climate action by educating the world on the impact of oceans and enabling them to take action to mitigate and adapt to climate change through ocean intelligenceâ the worlds oceans cover over 70 of the planet govern our climate and support trillions in economic activity despite this they remain mostly unexplored and poorly understood oceans are a critical component of our climate system driving global weather although we experience climate and weather changes primarily as atmospheric processes a lot of what we see like the intensification of tropical storms and hurricanes is powered by ocean processes ocean data and insights are increasingly critical for successful climate mitigation and adaptationâ over the last few decades with advances in iot technology and distributed sensing weâve become great at collecting data at scale on land and in space oceans representâ the last big data frontier thousands of our iot sensors scattered across our oceans have racked up over 5 million ocean hours and collect over 100000 unique ocean data points every day to deliver insights for our customers and share data with researchers ocean intelligence powered by global sensor networks is essential to reduce weather and climate uncertainty help industries operate more efficiently lower operational risk and reduce emissions with rising sea levels and intensification of storms accurate and abundant ocean data is needed to keep vulnerable coastal communities safe and protect valuable infrastructure and industrial plants hear what some of our investors have to sayâ âuncertainty in any form translates to risk the lack of accurate ocean data increases operational uncertainty and inefficiencies for major global industries like maritime shippingâ said rebecca kaden managing partner at union square ventures âthe financial and environmental costs of uncertainty are massive for instance today 3 of global ghg emissions come from the shipping industry sofarâs ocean intelligence platform powered by its global ocean sensor network will provide insights needed to help major ocean industries like shipping improve inefficiencies reduce risk and most importantly mitigate their climate impactâ âsofar has built the first ocean intelligence platform to provide valuable insights to existing and emerging ocean industries and to drive critical progress in addressing the climate crisisâ said lindel eakman partner at foundry group âchanges in climate and extreme weather are increasing uncertainty and risk and impacting every major industry in the world as an endtoend platform with a global ocean sensor network data insights and applications sofarâs platform is well positioned for success with the best integrated customer experience as a start data and insights from the platform immediately help industries like maritime shipping reduce emissions and increase efficiency we believe that largescale ocean sensing and intelligence will play an increasingly important role across multiple industries in reducing climate risks and weather uncertaintyâ âto create effective solutions to the big problems affecting our oceans like species decline acidification and climate change it is imperative that we have a much more complete understanding of our oceans better understanding starts with more pervasive data collection  aggregationâ said kate danaher managing director of s2g ventures  âsofar ocean has the most cost effective durable and scaled solution for increasing ocean data that i
