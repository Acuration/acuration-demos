biofouling impacts vessel efficiency â and how to fix it the maritime shipping industry has set ambitious decarbonization targets over the next decade shrinking the shipping industryâs carbon footprint is going to take a range of innovative solutions and technologies â from simple solutions like more efficient route planning to more advanced options such as hull designâ biofouling presents a major threat to the industryâs progress toward decarbonization targets biofouling is the accumulation of microorganisms plants algae or small animals on wet surfaces that have a mechanical function causing structural or other functional deficiencies maritime shipping and logistics companies face challenges in vessel marine performance related to macrofouling â the attachment of larger organisms such as barnacles soft corals and seaweedâ read more what is biofouling and how can we stop it â â hereâs how biofouling is affecting the shipping industry and what marine logistics companies can do to prevent and combat biofoulingâ how biofouling impacts vessel efficiency â biofouling happens in two stages microfouling and macrofouling in macrofouling heavier organisms such as barnacles and small coral colonies adhere to the submerged hull of a ship these organisms can weigh up to 10 tons significantly increasing the vesselâs dragâ âthe costs of these hullfouling stowaways are substantial according to one study the us shipping industry spends more than 36 billion each year in added fuel costs to overcome the drag induced by clinging marine life or for antifouling paint that prevents that life from hitching a ride in the first placeâ reported science magazine  âand that figure doesnât include the cost to regularly scrape a hull smooth which costs approximately 450 for every square foot of hull surfaceââ even minor microfouling can decrease vessel efficiency by 10  16  macrofouling and result in loss of 86 of a vesselâs cruising speed contributing to delays across the marine shipping industryâ these losses are only expected to increase due to climate change a recent study found that warmer water creates the conditions for even more intense macrofouling the medianprojected scenario of a 35 â c increase in water temperature causes marine organisms to grow twice as fast as they do at todayâs surface temperatures not only did organisms grow more quickly â but they also formed a thicker layerâ biofouling is expensive no matter how you measure it in terms of time energy eg fuel and actual dollars plus cleaning and other antifouling measures are regular expenses that add up over timeâ what is antifouling the imo defines antifouling as âa coating paint surface treatment surface or device that is used on a ship to control or prevent attachment of unwanted organismsâ basically antifouling is a measure that reduces the impact of biofouling on vessel efficiencyâ historically ships used compounds like arsenic and lime to protect the hull of a ship against biofouling over time however those compounds leach into the water and can destroy marine ecosystems the imo now regulates the types of antifouling paint compounds and methods that the shipping industry can use to prevent biofouling safelyâ itâs also worth noting that antifouling differs from âfoulingreleaseâ tactics âfoulingrelease describes the force required to remove an organism that is already attached to a surface these two terms have been used interchangeably in the literature however they are truly different phenomenaâ explained science direct â as the demand for antifouling and foulingrelease strategies grows here are some of the most effective measures currently in use todayâ â 6 ways to combat biofouling to improve vessel efficiency there are a number of preventative measures and foulingrelease tactics that can help combat biofoulingâ preventative measures include using an electrolytic system  this system passes a current between two anodes usually made of copper and aluminum the current produces copper ions that prevent marine organisms from settling on the hull as well as prevents the surface from corroding as rough surfaces are more susceptible to biofoulingâ chemical dosing  this measure is used specifically for a shipâs piping method it involves using an antifouling chemical such as ferrous chloride to coat the pipework with a protective layer that prevents corrosionâ using an ultrasonic system  one of the most effective antifouling measures this method uses highfrequency electrical impulses to prevent marine growth from attaching to piping systems electrochlorination  a mechanism on the ship uses chlorine to produce sodium hypochlorite which is then used to prevent fouling this method is slightly more risky than others and must be tested as chlorine can damage marine ecosystemsâ these tactics often require machinery on board for smaller vessels these preventative measures may not be costeffective or efficient as a result some ships use antifouling paint to try to prevent biofouling these coatings work in a few different ways some repel organisms from the hull others make the surface slippery so that organisms have trouble sticking hydrophobic foulrelease coatings make it easier to clean organisms from the hull of a shipâ there are a number of boat hull cleaning practices to remove marine organisms off the hull of the boat while the boat is still in the water âconventional hull cleaning is conducted by divers using rotatingbrush carts or using rovs equipped with rotating brushes or waterjetsâ explained one expert  âalternatively preventive maintenance approaches have also been suggested such as hull grooming on us navy vessels consisting of frequent and gentle wiping of the hull and continuous prevention methods such as aeration or ultrasound transducersââ ancillary technology like sofar oceanâs wayfinder platform provides data that can help schedule antifouling maintenance to improve vessel efficiency before macrofouling becomes a big problemâ by combining the most accurate weather data from the sofar network with custom vessel performance curves wayfinder is able to predict when a vessel might be underperforming due to fouling of the prop or hull marine logistics companies can use this information to schedule the appropriate cleaning â optimizing operational efficiency improving vessel maintenance and limiting unnecessary delays caused by biofoulingâ combatting the impact of biofouling on vessel efficiency takes a multipronged approach that starts with data vesselspecific performance models can provide the feedback shipping companies need to understand the causes and effects of decreasing vessel performance from there the appropriate combination of antifouling and foulingrelease tactics can be used to remove marine organisms safelyâ sofar in the news in the news october 23 2023 wayfinder delivers 8 total equivalent fuel savings on brazilchina
