 There are two main types of ocean currents: surface currents and deep ocean currents . Deep currents are driven by temperature and water density/salinity . Surface currents are also driven by global wind systems fueled by energy from the sun . Both are difficult to track, as the reflection of light on the water surface does not depend on the velocity or temperature of the floating water .
