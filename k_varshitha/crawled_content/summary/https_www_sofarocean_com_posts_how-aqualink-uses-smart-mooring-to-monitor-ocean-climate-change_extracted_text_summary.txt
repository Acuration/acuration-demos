 Aqualink is using buoy data to learn how rising ocean water temperatures are contributing to the decline of coral reefs . Scientists estimate that, at the current rate of climate change, by 2100 there will be nearly no suitable coral habitats remaining on Earth . Ocean acidification and climate change are decimating coral reefs and scientists are working to find ways to stop this decline .
