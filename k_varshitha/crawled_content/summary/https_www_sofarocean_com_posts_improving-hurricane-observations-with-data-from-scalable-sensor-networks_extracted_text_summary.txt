 In the past year, weve nearly tripled our coverage of buoys, with coverage across the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans . This extremely dense network of Spotter buoys enables us to obtain--in real-time--high fidelity observations of extreme ocean weather with unprecedented frequency . As we continue to scale Spotter coverage globally, we expect to observe a growing number of extreme weather events across other basins .
