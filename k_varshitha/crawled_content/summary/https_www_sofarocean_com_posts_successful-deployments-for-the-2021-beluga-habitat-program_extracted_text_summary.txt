 The long-term program uses coastal observatories (i.e., seabed moorings with acoustic recorders and oceanographic sensors and weather stations) to investigate the influence of changing environmental parameters (waves, weather, ice and coastal erosion) on beluga habitat use, water column biogeochemistry, assess underwater noise/vessel impacts .
