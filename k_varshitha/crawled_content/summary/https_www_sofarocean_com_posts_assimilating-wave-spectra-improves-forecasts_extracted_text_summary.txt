 How assimilating wave spectra improves ocean weather forecasts? How the assimilation of real-time . observations of wave . spectra convey the distribution of wave energy over different directions and frequencies . Observations can tell us what direction the wave energy is traveling to, how energetic the waves are, and what the dominant wave period is .
