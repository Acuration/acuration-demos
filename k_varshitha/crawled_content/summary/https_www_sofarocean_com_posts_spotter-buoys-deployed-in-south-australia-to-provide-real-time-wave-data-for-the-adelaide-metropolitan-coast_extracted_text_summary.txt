 Spotter buoys deployed in South Australia to provide real time wave data for the Adelaide Metropolitan Coast . Two buoys were launched off Semaphore Beach and Brighton Beach in August, with a third buoy deployed in Investigator Strait in September to capture the largest waves that enter the gulf from the Southern Ocean . Measurements collected by the Spotters will help build a better coastal community by improving understanding of hydrodynamic processes that shape SA coastlines .
