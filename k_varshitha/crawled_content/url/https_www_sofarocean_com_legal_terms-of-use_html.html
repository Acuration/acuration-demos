YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND SOFARâS PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY SOFAR AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>1. Sofar Service Overview</strong>. The Sofar Service provides a platform through which you may interact with your Sofar hardware product(s) (which are collectively referred to as â<strong>Product</strong>â). For the Sofar Trident and related accessories (â<strong>Trident</strong>â), this may include Services which control Tridentâs propulsion and navigation systems, monitor system health and functionality, and allow for viewing of video and other media recorded by Trident. For Sofar Spotter (â<strong>Spotter</strong>â), this may include Services which allow you to change the settings around how the Spotter operates, or to view and download data from the Spotter, such as oceanographic observations, GPS location, conditions related alerts and updates, and other related data (all Spotter data is collectively, â<strong>Spotter Data</strong>â).</p><p><strong>2. Eligibility</strong>. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p><p><strong>3. Accounts and Registration</strong>. To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, billing information or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at support@sofarocean.com.</p><p><strong>4. General Payment Terms.</strong> Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees, in addition to and separate from your purchase(s) of Product. Additional terms or policies will apply to your purchase(s) of Product (â<strong>Terms of Sale</strong>â) and these Terms of Sale are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p><p><strong>4.1 Price.</strong> Before you pay any fees related to the Service, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as provided in Section 11.4. Sofar reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Sofar will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Sofar may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Sofar gives you advance notice of changes before they apply (with the exception of Remote Access Packages as described in the Terms of Sale, in which case advance notice may or may not be provided). Sofar, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Sofar customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p><p><strong>4.2 Authorization.</strong> You authorize Sofar or its third-party payment provider to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Sofar, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Sofar or its third-party payment provider may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.<br/><br/></p><p><strong>4.3 Subscription Service. </strong>The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (â<strong>Subscription Service</strong>â) based on the Services that you select in your account.<strong> </strong>If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Sofar to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The â<strong>Subscription Billing Date</strong>â is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For information on the â<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>â, please see the Service page in your user account. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you change or cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may change or cancel the Subscription Service by changing or eliminating the Service in your account.<br/><br/></p><p><strong>4.4 Delinquent Accounts.</strong> Sofar may suspend or terminate access to the paid portions of the Service for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid.
