By accepting the terms of service, you agree that we may collect and store your personal information as long as you avail these services subject to limitations as have been set out in this privacy policy. Unless otherwise stated, the contents of this website including, but not limited to, the text and images contained herein and their arrangement are the property of Suzlon Energy Ltd. Therefore, we retain the copyright on all textual entries, graphics and trademarks displayed on this website. All trademarks used or referred to in this website are the property of their respective owners.
         

            Nothing contained in this website shall be construed as conferring by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to any copyright, patent, trademark or other proprietary interest of Suzlon Energy Ltd. or any third party. This website and the content provided in this website, including, but not limited to, graphic images, audio, video, html code, buttons, and text, may not be copied, reproduced, modified, reused, republished, uploaded, posted, transmitted, or distributed in any way, without the prior written consent of Suzlon Energy Ltd., except that you may download, display, and print one copy of the materials on any single computer solely for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that you do not modify the material in any way and you keep intact all copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices.
         

            No reproduction of any part of this website may be sold or distributed for commercial gain, nor shall it be modified or incorporated in any other work, publication or website, whether in hard copy or electronic format, including postings to any other website. We reserve all the other rights.
         

            The information provided on this website is free of charge and for informational purposes only and does not create a business or professional services relationship between you and Suzlon Energy Ltd. Please be advised that we cannot guarantee and Suzlon Energy Ltd. has no control over public or third party network. Links on this website may lead to services or websites not operated by Suzlon Energy Ltd. No judgment or warranty is made with respect to such other services or websites and we expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability for any material communication by third parties through our website. A link to another website or service is not an endorsement of that website or service. Any use you make of the information provided on this website, or any website or service linked to by this website, is at your own risk. In no event shall Suzlon Energy Ltd., its employees or agents be responsible for any direct, indirect or consequential damages of any nature whatsoever resulting from the use of this website.
         

            You are responsible for complying with the laws of the jurisdiction including privacy laws from which you are accessing this website and you agree that you will not access or use the information on this website in violation of such laws. You acknowledge that Suzlon Energy Ltd. may terminate your access to the website and remove content put up by you on the website in accordance with the terms of this policy. Unless expressly stated otherwise herein, any information submitted by you through this website shall be deemed non-confidential and non-proprietary. You represent that you have the lawful right to submit such information and agree that you will not submit any information unless you are legally entitled to do so. Because of the open nature of the Internet, and because of the reason that all postings by you and other users are instantaneous and not pre-viewed by Suzlon, we recommend that you not submit information you consider confidential.
         

            Suzlon does not accept unauthorized idea submissions outside of established business relationships. To protect the interests of our current clients and ourselves, we must treat the issue of such submissions with great care. Importantly, without a clear business relationship, Suzlon cannot and does not treat any such submissions in confidence. Accordingly, please do not communicate unauthorized idea submissions to Suzlon through this website. Any ideas disclosed to Suzlon outside a pre-existing and documented confidential business relationship are not confidential and Suzlon may therefore develop, use and freely disclose or publish similar ideas without compensating you or accounting to you. Suzlon will make every reasonable effort to return or destroy any unauthorized idea submissions without detailed review of them. However, if a review is necessary in Suzlon's sole discretion, it will be with the understanding that Suzlon assumes no obligation to protect the confidentiality of your idea or compensate you for its disclosure or use. By submitting an idea or other detailed submission to Suzlon through this website, you agree to be bound by the terms of this stated policy.
