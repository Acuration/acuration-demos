Research and Development










                     Research and development is the cornerstone of Suzlon’s success in its pursuit of harnessing energy through renewable sources.
                  


                    Research and development continue to play a pivotal role in making Suzlon a renewable energy powerhouse. Suzlon’s focus on creating innovative products and services has helped in making renewable energy attractive and profitable for investors. Especially in wind energy, its focused research and development, coupled with cutting-edge technology, has made Suzlon a market leader.
                 

                     Suzlon spends a significant amount of its revenues on R & D to incubate innovation and implement the outcomes in its product development, processes, operations, and maintenance services. The net result has been a significant reduction in the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE).
                  

                    The company has four main research centres in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and in India. It has hired the best minds in the field of aviation and wind energy to assimilate and formulate its R & D strategy. Suzlon is pushing the aerodynamic limits with each new turbine model. It is also introducing advanced materials such as carbon-fibre in its next-generation turbines which will make the blades stronger and lighter.
                 

                     Suzlon’s thrust on technological and process innovation is a reflection of its deep commitment to customers. The aim is to give them the best value for their investment. Efforts are constantly on to reduce the time taken for the wind farm or solar facility to start yielding results while increasing their productive life.
