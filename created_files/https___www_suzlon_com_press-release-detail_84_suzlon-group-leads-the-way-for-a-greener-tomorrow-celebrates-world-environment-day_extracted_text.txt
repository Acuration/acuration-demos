Over 44 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions reduced every year owing to Suzlons global wind energy installations1.21 million trees planted; urges over 6900 employees to pledge a sapling on World Environment dayMyriad of activities undertaken such as plastic & bio medical waste collection, PUC check, environment awareness session with experts, tree plantation and cloth bag salePune, India: On the occasion of World Environment Day (WED), Suzlon Group, Indias leading wind turbine manufacturer, marked the day with several environment protection initiatives aligned to UNEPs WED 2015 theme of "Seven Billion Dreams. One Planet. Consume with Care." Environment Sustainability is at the core of Suzlon groups philosophy and vision to Power a greener tomorrow. Suzlon is contributing towards mitigating risks of climate change with its clean technologies and wind energy installations worldwide. On WED, Suzlon organized myriad of activities across all its office locations to enhance awareness on environment protection.

And yet, evidence is building that people are consuming far more natural resources than what the planet can sustainably provide. We all need to preserve our today for a brighter tomorrow. Choosing to make a sustainable tomorrow and environment conservation forms the core of our business model. World Environment day is not merely an event for us at Suzlon, but a continuous endeavor to ensure the importance of sustainable development. I firmly believe that responsible usage of our natural resources is the only way to achieve sustainability.Suzlons CSR approach is focused on five capitals of development- Natural Capital, Human Capital, Social Capital, Physical Capital and Financial Capital.
