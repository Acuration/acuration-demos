 Suzlon announces robust Q1 FY23 Results

Healthier balance sheet with strong performance indicators
Revenue of INR 1,378 crores in Q1 FY23 (Y-o-Y growth of ~21%)
EBITDA of INR 214 crores in Q1 FY23 and EBITDA margin of 15.6%, Y-o-Y EBITDA growth of ~39%
PBT (before exceptional items) of INR 7 crores in Q1 FY23Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced its first quarter results for the financial year 2022-23 (Q1 FY23).
Ashwani Kumar, Chief Executive Officer, Suzlon Group, said, "India has reached 160GW of renewable energy in June, 2022 despite two years of a global pandemic and a disrupted supply chain. I am extremely proud of this milestone and Suzlon's contribution to it as the largest original equipment manufacturer across the renewable energy sector in the country."
"At Suzlon, we continue to show significant improvement in our performance. The ramping
  up of our operations has been successfully achieved and stabilized. We are beginning to
  show growth and are well positioned to leverage the tremendous opportunity that the
  renewables market has to offer in coming years. We launched our larger turbines in the
  3MW to 3.15MW series with a rotor diameter of 144mts with an increased generation of
  ~45% over the S120 in low wind sites and are working on commercializing the same. While our order-book remains healthy, execution of orders to meet customer expectations is our  priority for this FY." 
"Recent months have seen several positive policy initiatives by the GOI for the wind energy
  sector. In July 2022, MNRE took an in principle decision to relook at the e-reverse auction of
  wind energy projects with a view to remove it. This could be a game-changer and give
  tremendous boost to the sector. The recent order of the Ministry of Power now has a
  separate class for wind RPO (Renewable Purchase Obligation) with a clear increase in the
  wind RPO trajectory. This increased trajectory in combination with other policies will result in
  a much larger Indian Wind Energy market between now and 2030. As an industry leader, we
  welcome these initiatives."
Himanshu Mody, Chief Financial Officer, Suzlon Group, said, "Q1 of FY23 takes forward our
  consistent improvement over the last few quarters. We have seen a healthy YoY increase on
  all our key parameters of revenues, RR, EBITDA and PAT in Q1 FY23 which is a direct
  reflection of our operational strengths. It is even more heartening to see these results
  despite continuing disruptions in the supply chain across the industry. Currently, we are in
  the process of further optimizing our organizational structure including our international
  operations to unlock more synergies and operational efficiencies. SE Forge our forging and
  foundry business as well as Suzlon Services continue to show good performance as well."
"Our balance sheet looks much healthier, however, since our refinancing exercise was
completed towards the end of May, 2022, the full impact of the same on the finance cost will
be seen from the Q2 of FY23."Suzlon Group Q1 FY23 at a glance (consolidated):Revenue :Q1 FY23 at INR 1378 crores Operating PerformanceEBITDA: INR 214 crores in Q1 FY23; EBITDA margin at 15.6% EBIT: INR 156 crores in Q1 FY23   PBT (before exceptional items) of  INR 7 crores in Q1 FY23  Industry updateMinistry of Power (MoP) notified the Scheme for Flexibility in Generation and Scheduling of Thermal and Hydro Power Stations through bundling with Renewable Energy and Storage Power.
