However, despite a drastically changedbusiness landscape the past year, the wind sector installed over 27,000 MW worldwidein CY2008 and the long term outlook for wind remains strong with renewedgovernment mandate and regulatory supports. Suzlon and REpower havecomplementary strengths that will allow us to reach new on-shore and off-shore windmarkets around the world and build on this resurgence.Speaking on the companys performance, Mr. Sumant Sinha, COO  SuzlonEnergy Limited, said: Despite a challenging year, we have registered good growthat a consolidated level with sales growing to INR 26,082 cr. With the changingenvironment we have focused on consolidating the business after a period of very highgrowth. We have undertaken several strategic initiatives to make our business moreefficient, competitive and financially healthy in the long term  and have starteddelivering results. While there is an industry wide slowdown in the immediate term, wesee a rebound in CY2010 with long-term drivers gaining momentum."The current environment is changing the shape of the industry with more focus onnew markets, flexible supply chains, more near-horizon orders. With our highlyintegrated supply chain, and concept to commissioning capabilities we are wellpositioned to meet the changing needs of investors in wind.Strategic PrioritiesWith the challenging business environment, the company undertook several keyinitiatives focusing on consolidation of the business. Key among them S88 ProgramThe planned retrofit program to strengthen all V2 blades is underway with 80%of the project completed as on date. The program, previously scheduled forcompletion in June, 2009, faced some overruns and is now scheduled forcompletion in mid-August, 2009.The S88 V2 retrofit program and other continuous improvement upgrades haveresulted in a steady improvement of availability and performance levels. TheS88 V3, introduced in early 2008, is consistently delivering targetedperformance at a fleet level. This reflects an overall stabilization of Suzlons S88 2.1 MW turbine platform, and becoming the base-platform for future productdevelopment.Financial Management/Liability ManagementThe company recently undertook a liability management exercise for ForeignCurrency Convertible Bonds (FCCB) of USD 500 mn issued in 2007. Thecompany successfully renegotiated the liability, reducing the debt by USD 111mn through buy-back and exchange mechanisms. The exercise simultaneouslyachieved a successful relaxation and modification of financial covenants for itsacquisition loan facility and FCCB  resulting in an improved financial flexibility.Going into FY2009-10, the company has adopted very stringent policies on debtmanagement, working capital reduction, increasing operating efficiencies:freeze on fresh capex, continuous performance monitoring and operating costrationalization. As a result of this, we have seen a gradual improvement inworking capital intensity, rationalized debt levels and increase operatingefficiency.Order OutlookWith funding uncertainties and change in short and medium-term marketdynamics slowing down the order uptake in the wind sector, the companyachieved an orderbook of 1,463 MW.Group UpdatesSuzlon achieved the completion of the acquisition of 91% stake in REpower, markingin a major step in harnessing group-wide synergies. Hansen Transmissions newfacilities in India and China commenced commercial manufacture.SE Forge achieved commercial production, supplying components to Suzlon and SKFBearings.All group companies demonstrated strong performance, with REpower reporting EUR1,209 mn in revenues, EUR 76.9 mn EBIT, PAT of EUR 51.9 mn; and HansenTransmissions reporting EUR 609 mn in revenues, EUR 93.7 mn EBITDA, PAT of EUR45 mn for FY2008-09.Market LandscapeChanged market dynamics are projected to reshape wind sector growth in the mediumterm, with a rebound expected in the second half of FY2009-10. Industry forecastsproject a de-growth in the sector in CY2009, followed by a rebound in CY2010 as moregovernment mandates and stimulus spending measures take ground. The long termforecast for the industry is on track with government mandates, targets and regulatorysupport, alongside stimulus spending commitments to the renewable energy industry.Investment interest in the sector remains strong, despite the current financial climate.Looking ahead - the changing market landscape also presents exciting opportunitiesas we are one of the few wind power companies with resources across development,manufacturing and deployment  allowing us to be more responsive and flexible to themarket, and continue being exceptionally customer centric in all areas of ouroperations, added Mr. Sumant Sinha:
