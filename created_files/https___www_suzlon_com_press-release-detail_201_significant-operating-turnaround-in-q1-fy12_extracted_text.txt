We have maintained our focus on consistentlyimproving operational efficiency, managing our debt profile, and securing orders.Key UpdatesMarket Outlook: Despite the challenges in developed markets, the windindustry continues to grow with strong momentum in emerging markets andthe offshore segment. Recent policy developments on energy security andsafety concerns, such as the planned phase out of nuclear in Germany andcarbon pricing being introduced in Australia, have placed an increasedemphasis on renewables, particularly wind, translating to a positive outlookeven in developed markets over the mid-to long-term.Offshore: REpower has established a current installed offshore base of over171 MW, with over 91 MW added in the first quarter of the fiscal. Worldwideoffshore installations grew by 96 per cent in 2010 and, as per MAKEconsulting, the market is projected to grow by over 37 per cent annually andto reach eight per cent of all new global wind power installations by 2015.Orders: The Suzlon Group order book stood at 4,739 MW (~Rs. 29,291 crore/ ~US$ 6.63 billion) in value as on 29th July, 2011; with an order intake of580 MW since the last announcement.New products: There has been strong interest in the new Suzlon S9X-2.1MW suite, specially designed for medium-to-low wind regimes, with over 450MW in new orders for projects in Australia, Europe, India, and North andSouth America. Prototypes of the S9X class turbines are now running inAustralia and India, with more due to be commissioned later this fiscal.REpowers new 3XM turbine  designed for low wind speed sites  has alsoseen a strong market response, with over 300 MW in new orders alreadybooked.Availability: Suzlon Groups global fleet of over 17,000 MW is consistentlydelivering availability (uptime) levels of over 97 per cent.REpower: Under the squeeze-out proceedings, with reference to REpowersminority shareholders, the compensation value was set at EUR 142.77 per noparvalue share, putting the total value at approximately EUR 63 million /~Rs. 398 crore / US$ 90 million. A resolution on the squeeze-out is to betabled at REpowers annual general meeting, scheduled for 21st September2011.Hansen stake sale: An irrevocable undertaking was signed to accept theoffer from ZF Friedrichshafen AG for Suzlons current holding of 26.06 percent equity interest in Hansen Transmissions, for a value of approximatelyGBP 115 million / ~Rs. 828 crore / US$ 187 million.
