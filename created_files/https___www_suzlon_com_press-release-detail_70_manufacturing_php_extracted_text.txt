 Suzlons S97 2.1MW Prototype Turbine in Gujarat achieves 35 % Plant Load Factor
Suzlons S97 2.1MW is the worlds tallest All-Steel Hybrid Tower Wind Turbine with a hubheightof 120m above ground level (a.g.l)S97 2.1 MW prototype Wind Turbine with Hybrid Tower achieves 35 % plant load factor (PLF) in the last 12 monthsSuccessfully generated 6.42 million kWh over the last 12 months (Nov 2014 onwards) at controller basis in Kutch, Gujarat~350 MW of orders already receivedPune, India: Suzlon Group, one of the leading wind turbine manufacturers, announced that itsevolutionary S97-HT DFIG 2.1MW Wind Turbine with an All-Steel Hybrid Tower has achieved 35%PLF over the last 12 months i.e. since the launch in November 2014. The prototype wascommissioned on June 9, 2014 at Nani Ber District of Kutch, Gujarat. The evolutionary product hasreceived encouraging response from customers across segments and reflects in the ~350 MW oforders received.The S97-HT DFIG is the Worlds tallest All-Steel Hybrid tower (120 metre height) design whichcombines both lattice and tubular structures, designed indigenously to harness the enhancedavailability of wind resources at higher altitudes making low wind sites viable. It increases energyoutput by ~ 12% to 15 % over other turbines of same capacity at 90m height. The combination oflattice and tubular gives enhanced tower strength at lower cost. The three-dimensional lattice structurecan support heavier weights due to the broad base and reduces the steel requirement apart from beinglogistic friendly.Picture: Suzlon S97-HT DFIG 2.1MW All-Steel Hybrid TowerMr. Tulsi Tanti, Chairman, Suzlon Group, said, The S97-HT DFIG 2.1MW with All-Steel Hybrid Toweris a game changer and is the result of our continued focus on investing in next generationtechnologies. Suzlon endeavors to lower the cost of energy and provide clean and affordable energyfor all.By offering a product that can optimize and harness wind resources at higher altitudes, Suzlon hasproved that even low-wind sites can be made attractive. Consistently achieving and maintaining 35%PLF will help in reducing the levelized cost of energy. This achievement makes me proud and I amhappy to see how soon our S97 all steel hybrid tower prototype belonging to our reliable and proven2.1 MW product has successfully established itself in the market.
