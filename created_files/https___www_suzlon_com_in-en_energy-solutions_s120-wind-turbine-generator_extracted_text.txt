The S120 Advantage

The S120 2.1 MW is available in three variants with towers up to 140m hub height that helps in unlocking the potential of previously unviable sites. With varied hub-height options, wind park owners can optimize the configuration based on the site's wind shear for optimal energy output.
Grid-friendly DFIG electrical systems continue to smoothly integrate wind turbines into the ever demanding utility network, meeting the latest grid requirements. Next generation controls and state-of-the-art-software maximises the energy yield further and helps to reduce the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE). The superior performance of the S120 will improve return of investment (ROI)  for customers and has set a new benchmark in the Indian wind industry.The S120 - 140m (140 meter hub height) serial fleet turbines demonstrate high performance standards and is operating with above 98% availability.
