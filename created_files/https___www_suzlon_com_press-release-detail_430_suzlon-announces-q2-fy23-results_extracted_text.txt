 Suzlon announces Q2 FY23 Results


Healthier balance sheet with strong performance indicators
Revenue of Rs. 1,430 crores in Q2 FY23 (Y-o-Y growth of ~6.2%)
EBITDA (pre-Fx) of Rs. 208 crores in Q2 FY23 and EBITDA margin (pre-Fx) of
            14.5%, Y-o-Y EBITDA (pre-Fx) growth of ~8.3%
PAT of Rs. 56 crores in Q2 FY23


Pune, India: Suzlon Group, India's largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced
        its second quarter results for the financial year 2022-23 (Q2 FY23).
Girish Tanti, Vice Chairman, Suzlon Group,  said, "India has recorded an installation of
        164.9GW* of renewable energy as on 30th September 2022, reflecting a healthy recovery of
        the sector despite the disruptions of the pandemic and the disastrous impact of the global
        geo-political situations on the supply chain and commodity prices. The environment of
        positive policy initiatives continues, and we believe that given the commitment and will of
        the Indian government, the country could very well achieve 500GW of renewable energy
        installations by 2030. As industry leaders we are fully equipped to leverage the tailwinds of
        the sector from a position of strength as demonstrated by our successful rights issue,
        consistently improving performance, a strong order book and our relentless debt reduction endeavours."
        
Ashwani Kumar, Chief Executive Officer, Suzlon Group,   said, "We have closed a very
            satisfying Q2 despite various challenges. While we continue to show improvement in our
            performance, the highlight for us has been the order intake in recent months. The confidence
            that our customers have reposed in us has always been our driving force. In line with our
            commercialization plans, we recently dispatched the first set of blades of our newly launched
            larger turbines in the 3MW to 3.15MW series customised for Indian wind conditions with a
            rotor diameter of 144mts and an increased generation of ~45% over the S120. While our
            order-book stood at 759MW as on 30th September 2022 we have subsequently added new orders of nearly 193MW. Our service business continues to do well,
             and our focus for the rest
            of the FY remains on executing our orderbook."
            
Himanshu Mody, Chief Financial Officer, Suzlon Group, said, "At the outset I would like to
        thank all our shareholders for showing tremendous faith in Suzlon as demonstrated through
        our recently closed rights issue which was oversubscribed by 1.8x. This show of confidence
        has reinforced our commitment towards creating more value for our stakeholders."
"The Q2 of FY23 has seen us register consistent improvement resulting in a PAT positive
quarter. We have seen a healthy YoY increase on all our key parameters of revenues, RR,
EBITDA and PAT. We can also see the full impact of our consistent efforts to reduce debt on
our decreasing finance costs further strengthening our balance sheet. In addition to our net
debt position as on 30th September 2022 which stood at Rs. 2,722 crores, we have
subsequently reduced our debt by Rs. 583.50 crores through the rights issue proceeds."
