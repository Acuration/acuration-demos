significant threat to industrial facilities new honeywell cybersecurity research reveals that usb devices pose a significant threat to industrial facilities november 1 2018 houston nov 1 2018 prnewswire new firstofitskind research released today by honeywell nyse hon shows that removable usb media devices such as flash drives pose a significant endash and intentional endash cybersecurity threat to a wide array of industrial process control networks data derived from honeywell technology used to scan and control usb devices at 50 customer locations showed that nearly half 44 percent detected and blocked at least one file with a security issue it also revealed that 26 percent of the detected threats were capable of significant disruption by causing operators to lose visibility or control of their operations the threats targeted a wide variety of industrial sites including refineries chemical plants and pulpandpaper manufacturers around the world and the threats themselves ranged in severity about 1 in 6 targeted industrial control systems or internet of things iot devices the data showed much more serious threats than we expected and taken together the results indicate that a number of these threats were targeted and intentional said eric knapp director of strategic innovation honeywell industrial cyber security this research confirms what we have suspected for years endash usb threats are real for industrial operators what is surprising is the scope and severity of the threats many of which can lead to serious and dangerous situations at sites that handle industrial processes the research marks the first commercial report to focus exclusively on usb security in industrial control environments it examined data collected from honeywells secure media exchange smx technology which is specifically designed to scan and control removable media including usb drives among the threats detected were highprofile wellknown issues such as triton and mirai as well as variants of stuxnet an attack type previously leveraged by nationstates to disrupt industrial operations in comparative tests up to 11 percent of the threats discovered were not reliably detected by more traditional antimalware technology customers already know these threats exist but many believe they arent the targets of these highprofile attacks knapp said this data shows otherwise and underscores the need for advanced systems to detect these threats the research which is presented in the honeywell industrial usb threat report recommends that operators combine people training process changes and technical solutions to reduce the risk of usb threats across industrial facilities for more information visit honeywell industrial cyber security solutions and services honeywell
