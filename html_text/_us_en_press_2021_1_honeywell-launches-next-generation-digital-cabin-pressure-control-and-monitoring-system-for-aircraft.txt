both commercial and military aircraft this new version of the system is allelectric lighterweight and available now for business and regional aviation as well as tactical or military trainersized aircraft the cabin pressure control and monitoring system cpcms helps maintain and monitor the air pressure inside an aircraft it can be found onboard any aircraft that flies high enough to require air pressurization including commercial and business jets as well as military aircraft it regulates the air that is pumped into the cabin of an aircraft to maintain a safe and comfortable environment while flying at high altitudes it also manages the rate of pressure change to avoid passenger discomfort during climb and descent after listening to our customers it was clear the industry required an update because most systems being used today rely on decadesold technology said tom hart vice president and general manager air thermal systems honeywell aerospace we acted quickly and developed a new digital system that is significantly lighter more reliable and less costly to certify than products on the market today this new fourthgeneration version of the system is allelectric and has builtin test capability to detect and report any failures or issues including for the backup manual portion of the system along with the improved system reliability there is also less system maintenance for the airplane operator this system further improves sensor accuracy and response rate performance resulting in more comfortable pressure control the system can serve a wide variety of aircraft offering customers the ability to customize the control software to best fit their needs the entire system weighs less than six pounds is 30 lighter than its predecessor and has a new and smaller digital controller that allows it to be fit for future upgrades honeywell has won a contract with piaggio aerospace to provide the new cpcms for its integration into the new p180 avanti evo aircraft configuration currently under development the products will start delivery in the third quarter of 2021 and the first planes with the new system are expected to enter service in the first half of 2022
