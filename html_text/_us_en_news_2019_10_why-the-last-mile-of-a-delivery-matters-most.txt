important and the most challenging october 21 2019 your package has been delivered those exciting words mean you can check the front porch or parcel locker to get your new shoes rug charger or other item you ordered online just before you got that notification your package went on one of the most challenging parts of its shipping journey the last mile that final mile is complex and resourceintense said our logistics expert justine clark who has worked in supply chain for more than a decade heres why its important and what makes it so challenging delivery reflects customer service the final delivery is one of the last points where the company interacts with the customer at that moment the company needs to deliver literally on its promise if the delivery is bad the item is broken or delivered to the wrong place that can result in an angry tweet and a lost customer companies are looking for ways to add value in that critical delivery moment retailers and ecommerce businesses are looking to add services like the delivery person waiting for a customer to try on shoes and taking them back if the shoes do not fit or the item isnt perfect the person who delivers can process a return and refund on the doorstep and take the faulty item away the last mile is expensive the infrastructure to deliver to the last mile is costly shipping companies must pay for depots vehicle fleets it backend systems and wages for delivery drivers if the delivery fails the first time for any reason the customer is not home or the driver could not find the address the cost doubles as the company must pay for delivery again doubling the cost justine said more manpower is needed especially during peak holiday season when package volume increases this year ups said it plans to hire about 100000 seasonal workers to handle the surge in packages from november through january people want more delivery options customers want more possibilities to where they can pick up their package parcel lockers the trunk of the car just inside their door or maybe in a shed people also want the option to reschedule the delivery if they wont be home we expect everything to be delivered when and where its convenient for us justine said but those options add another layer of complexity to delivering the last mile the future of the last mile delivering packages the first time every time means not only happier customers but also reduced costs for businesses justine said she predicts the future of lastmile delivery will focus even more on the customer expectation and companies
