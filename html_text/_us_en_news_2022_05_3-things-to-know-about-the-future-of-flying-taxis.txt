make transportation more accessible and sustainable electricity isnt only powering some vehicles on the road soon it could fuel the flying taxi you hail for your morning commute technology is being developed today specifically for aircraft designed to do just that transport humans over urban environments typically without pilots known as urban air mobility uam this emerging aviation unit is focused on innovating within aerospace to bring to life ondemand automated passenger transportation heres the latest progress being made 1 a unique motor will power the first allelectric vertical takeoff and landing evtol jet a small electric jet requires a small but mighty motor thats why engineers in our aerospace business are partnering with leading mobility supplier denso to codevelop a zeroemissions electric motor emotor for liliums evtol jet pictured above the emotor which weighs less than 10 pounds approximately 4 kilograms contains a singlestage rotor and stator that are designed to match the small size and low weight of the jet needed so it can take off land and transport humans and goods 2 the future of flight is electric innovations are in the works to make the aviation industry more sustainable from technology enabling the conversion of renewable feedstocks into fuel for planes to allelectric aircraft like the lilium jet which does not emit the harmful greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in addition to partnering on the development and installation of emotors for the lilium evtol jet honeywell will work with denso to create and manufacture electric propulsion systems for aircraft with an emphasis on solutions tailored to uam vehicles read this article for a look at how our propulsion and power generation solutions can be used in electric and hybridelectric aircraft 3 our engineers have developed solutions to take uam to the next level were bringing technology to market that will enable a new more efficient and sustainable way to move people and cargo that will revolutionize travel for decades to come said taylor alberstadt senior director of business development for honeywell electric and hybridelectric propulsion this isnt a pipe dream but rather already a workinprogress engineers at honeywell are specializing in creating aviation technologies tailored for the specific needs of uam aircraft including the flybywire system a control computer condensed into one system thats about the size of a paperback book tailored for the size and stability needs of uam aircraft the lilium jet and vertical aerospaces evtol aircraft the vax4 will both use honeywell anthem our cloudconnected avionics system that can fit any aircraft other technologies like satellite solutions designed to fit uam vehicles will enable aircraft to stay connected in the sky lightweight radar can also be used to help uam vehicles in the sky by detecting and avoiding traffic obstacles and weather up to 3 kilometers away learn more about the technologies powering the
