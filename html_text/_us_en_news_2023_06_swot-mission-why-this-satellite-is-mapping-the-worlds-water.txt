water the first global study of earths bodies of water is underway learn why its important and about the satellite making it possible from wildfires to recordsetting unseasonable temperatures extreme weather events are becoming more severe and frequent globally the intensity of extreme droughts and rainfall increased sharply over the past 20 years according to a study published in nature water journal in march using data from grace and gracefo satellites in the western us warmer and drier conditions a byproduct of climate change have led to longerlasting fire seasons causing fires to burn over larger areas in recent decades according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the 2021 winter storm in texas that at its height left nearly 10 million people without power the 2022 summer heatwaves in europe leading to more than 20000 heatrelated deaths and the recent canadian wildfires are just a few of many examples of the increasing intensity of extreme weather events getting a deeper look into earths oceanography the study of the oceans and their properties can help scientists researchers and policymakers better understand climate change and the water cycle and better predict and respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts thats why the surface water ocean topography swot mission is underway a joint mission developed by nasa and the french space agency with contributions from the canadian space agency and the united kingdom space agency swot launched into space in 2022 and is orbiting earth over the next few years the satellite will obtain the most comprehensive view of the worlds surface water swot mission fast facts what the swot mission is providing the first global complete look at the earths oceans the land and freshwater resources and the water supplydemand chain it will survey at least 90 of the worlds surface water and take measurements 10 times more accurately than any previous earthobservation satellite when the swot satellite was launched in december 2022 the satellite will orbit the earth for at least three years to get all of its measurements nasa shared its first findings publicly in march the impact the findings from swot will benefit any decisionmaking that involves water management according to nasas jet propulsion laboratory from wildlife area monitoring and coastal protection to hydropower the mission will help improve our ability to predict and respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts as well as reveal previously unseen details about earths water due to the highdefinition quality of the swot satellite images the heart of the satellite one of the features of swot that sets it apart from other satellites is one of its instruments the kaband radar interferometer karin karin is designed to measure detailed changes in water surface height from space it does this by transmitting radar pulses similar to how your phone uses radar to get wifi and receiving signals with its two antennas measuring the phase and time of those returned signals part of the karin instrument is a technology known as the kaband radiofrequency duplexer which was built by honeywell engineers for nasa the duplexer built by honeywell teams is part of the radio frequency subsystem produced by thales alena space the karin instrument shows a resolution thats 10 times higher in other words significantly more detailed than instruments on seven other satellites according to nasa the nasa jet propulsion laboratory which is leading the swot mission calls the instrument the scientific heart of the satellite swots findings so far nasa released some of the first findings from the swot satellite in march revealing views of the gulf stream the current that brings warm water into the atlantic ocean from the gulf of mexico in previously unseen detail it also revealed a map of long island new york showing clearerthanever water elevation features of the area curious about space exploration
