exploration isnt only about studying whats out there in our universe it can help us better understand our planet and climate change in june nasa and partner researchers found themselves in boats on alaskas yukon river as they used gps to track the slope of the river sensors aboard a plane flying overhead served as a second source of data collection this approach to measuring the yukon river was a test run the combined findings were being used as confirmation for the findings of the surface water ocean topography swot satellite the swot mission launched in december 2022 with a goal to obtain the most comprehensive view and measurements of the worlds surface water conducted in partnership between nasa and the canadian uk and french space agencies its findings are critical in times of unprecedented weather events and rising seas levels that result from ongoing climate change swot is able to take measurements that are 10 times more accurate than any previous earth observation satellite such precision will allow swot to help researchers better understand how climate change affects water storage in lakes rivers and reservoirs and how communities can better manage water resources and prepare for floods and other disasters according to nasa swots first findings included a thorough mapping of the waterways on long island and exact height measurements of the gulf stream off north carolina and virginia the nature of weather events since the first swot data sets became available in march demonstrates the need for clear data on the global impact of climate change swots detection abilities go beyond simply tracking rising sea levels it will provide as explained by nasa an unprecedented tracking of small ocean features related to heat and carbon capture in the oceans that can lead to more accurate prediction of weather events and patterns more refined draught and rising sea level assessments can be applied to emergency planning as well as remediation strategies clearer insights can also inform disaster readiness through more robust predictive models as well as financial concerns such as flood insurance quantifying the impact of climate change recent events around the world highlight the impacts of climate change on the environment a few examples from july 10 to 11 rainfall amounts of 3 to 9 inches were observed across the state of vermont over 48 hours according to the national weather service in addition to roads and bridges being inundated or washed away thousands lost their homes or businesses two people died from the flooding in vermont per the new york times extraordinarily high rainfall in a short time span in libya has claimed thousands of lives while displacing many more and scientists with world weather attribution have found that climate change made such heavy rainfall in a short time span 50 times more likely according to reuters nasa reported that july 2023 was hotter than any other month in the global temperature record prolonged wildfires in canada impacted air quality for an entire continent as well as sudden deadly wildfires that devastated the hawaiian islands of maui and the big island across five days greece faced 350 firesjoining a long list of countries facing a sobering reality that greenhouse gas emissions have greatly increased the chances of hot dry weather that makes severe fires more likely according to the associated press in early september hong kong greece and turkey saw catastrophic rainfall and flooding as extreme weather events hit ten countries and territories in twelve days according to cnn in late september heavy rains led to flash flooding in the new york city metro area the national weather service reported that on friday september 29 more rain fell in a single day at new yorks john f kennedy international airport than any day since 1948 in light of extreme weather events detailed predictive models and visuals are becoming more important to help people prepare and acclimate that is where the swot satellite can help the satellite includes technology from honeywell space systems that can measure water surface height within 2 centimeters this accuracy is possible through an instrument known as the kaband radar interferometer which uses radar pulses sent from roughly 530 miles above the earths surface because sea rise affects regions differently swot can provide measurements on a casebycase basis that can lead to more detailed findings more recently swot has visualized higher than normal ocean water heights off the california coast that scientists attribute to warming ocean currents as reported by nasa thanks to this lowearth orbit satellite researchers now have more detailed ways to visualize oceans lakes and smaller waterways on earth
