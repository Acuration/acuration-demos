honeywell technology oriental energy company ltd starts propylene production at two facilities using honeywell technology may 31 2017 des plaines ill may 31 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon announced today that ningbo fortune petrochemical co ltd and zhangjiagang yangzi river petrochemical co ltd yrpc both subsidiaries of oriental energy co ltd each are producing 600000 metric tons annually mta of onpurpose propylene from propane with honeywell uops c 3 oleflex process technology yrpc located in zhangjiagang in chinas jiangsu province and ningbo fortune in ningbo city in zhejiang province are the fourth and fifth chinese companies to commercialize honeywell uops c 3 oleflex process to make propylene for plastics packaging and synthetic fibers global production capacity of propylene from oleflex technology now stands at approximately 68 million mta the demand for domestically produced onpurpose propylene continues to be very strong in china due to the increasing demand for polypropylene and other downstream chemical and plastic products said john gugel vice president and general manager of honeywell uops process technology and equipment business through its integrated supply chain position oriental energy derives exceptional value from oleflex technology until recently 70 percent of the worlds propylene was produced as a byproduct of making ethylene from petroleum however the increased use of ethane as a source of ethylene produces almost no propylene the resulting propylene supply gap has necessitated the production of onpurpose propylene from propane dehydrogenation technologies such as the oleflex process demand for propylene in china which consumes more than 15 percent of the worlds propylene is growing more than 4 percent per year according to the us energy information administration honeywell uops c 3 oleflex technology uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert propane to propylene and is proven to have the lowest cash cost of production and the highest return on investment among competing technologies its low energy consumption low emissions and fully recyclable platinumaluminabased catalyst system minimizes its impact on the environment the independent reaction and regeneration systems allow continuous use of catalysts for steadystate operations which improves operating flexibility onstream factor and reliability in addition to licensing technology from honeywell uop yrpc and ningbo fortune are using catalysts and adsorbents for their oleflex units that are made at honeywells manufacturing site located in zhangjiagang city honeywell uop also provided the engineering design equipment staff training and technical service for both projects honeywell uop also licenses c 4 oleflex technology
