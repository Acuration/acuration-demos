contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news 3 ways enterprises can accelerate the future during covid19 3 ways enterprises have transformed during covid19 businesses are learning from each other amidst changes during the pandemic as everyone is adjusting to life amidst the pandemic the same is true for enterprises they are working together to find inspiration tools and best practices in surprising places by being open minded and sharing notes leaders are using data and new tools to rapidly adapt more than just a trend this new normal will have longstanding dramatic effects on the future of business and the world here are three lessons learned during the pandemic 1 industrials go remote remote operations are challenging for industrial enterprises frontline employees dont have access to the same tools that desk workers have creating a divide between the office and the shop floor industrials are now exploring how they can apply lessons learned from the knowledge space accelerated by overcoming covid19 disruptions software tools like honeywell forge enable companies to operate factories remotely first data is collected on equipment and hardware then that operational data is merged with business data and stored on the cloud next leaders can run aibacked analytics tools to help them make better informed decisions on how to streamline and automate critical processes in the end the goal is to make remote operations as seamless as they are at a facility 2 knowledge workers harness safety culture one thing industrial enterprises know best is safety these environments are simply more dangerous than offices requiring a culture of communications policies and training programs that keep workers safe and productive it occurred to me safety has always been an area of the industrial world que dallara ceo of honeywell connected enterprise said in a news interview we cant open a factory without that but now it is happening in the office arena where the pressing issue had been ergonomics offices are staffed primarily by knowledge workers such as accountants and programmers those workers have jobs that require thinking skills compared to manual labor between new covid19 health regulations and increased employee concerns offices need to rapidly instill a safety culture in their returntowork efforts social distancing guidelines make it a requirement for businesses to deeply understand how their buildings are being used how people move through the space and how building systems keep them comfortable and healthy this requires tools that can aggregate business building and security data to drive decision making and communications 3 businesses make better decisions faster one thing that all enterprises can do better is quickly make decisions and act on them from ramping up new operations to introducing products enterprises tend to move slowly and methodically while this ensures good processes it is increasingly too slow for the speed of business the pandemic forced businesses to think quickly act fast and fear less and thats a good thing we built n95 mask factories in five weeks normally that takes nine months dallara said this new sense of urgency is even changing the way we build products honeywell spent just two weeks building an analytics tool to track its own returntowork progress then it was a simple task to turn it into a commercially viable product vastly outpacing a traditional product development life cycle enterprises are taking giant leaps towards the nimble ethos of startup culture or in dallaras words were seeing the acceleration of the future covid19 coronavirus industrial honeywell forge saferworld related content inside the covid19 care centers in india how digital innovation will shape the
