used in this release are as follows segment profit on an overall honeywell basis a measure by which we assess operating performance which we define as operating income adjusted to exclude the impact of stock compensation expense repositioning and other charges and pension and other postretirement service costs segment margin on an overall honeywell basis which we define as segment profit divided by sales organic sales growth which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following transaction date free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures management believes that when considered together with reported amounts these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends these metrics should be considered in addition to and not as replacements for the most comparable gaap measure a quantitative reconciliation of segment profit on an overall honeywell basis to operating income has not been provided for forwardlooking measures of segment margin as management cannot reliably predict or estimate without unreasonable effort the impact and timing on future operating results arising from items adjusted from segment profit the information that is unavailable to provide a quantitative reconciliation could have a significant impact on our reported financial results nina krauss media relations email mark macaluso investor relations 1973 4552222 phone email
