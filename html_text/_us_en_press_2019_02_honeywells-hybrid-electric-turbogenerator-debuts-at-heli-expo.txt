companys growing role in the urban air mobility segment highlighted by honeywell advancements in electric and hybridelectric propulsion systems honeywells prototype system combines the rugged flightproven hts900 engine with two compact highpower density generators each generator provides 200 kilowatts which combined is enough to power 40 average american homes running air conditioning at full blast the system burns conventional or bioderived jet fuel and can feed motors or highcapacity batteries this redefines powered flight by providing electricity to spare in a safe light package built for aviation said bryan wood senior director of honeywells hybridelectric and electric propulsion programs as the urban air mobility segment grows honeywell is providing safe reliable propulsion solutions as well as a host of other aviation technologies that are ready to install today on nextgeneration vehicles conventional aircraft use fuelburning engines to mechanically turn rotors propellers or fans but many new aircraft designs incorporate multiple electric motors which can be tilted or turned off for vertical takeoff and horizontal flight aircraft designers believe this could usher in a new era of quiet efficient pointtopoint aviation a single honeywell turbogenerator could power multiple electric motors located anywhere on an aircraft honeywell has rapidly expanded its
