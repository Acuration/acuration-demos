top innovations of 2021 top innovations of 2021 these breakthrough technologies are gamechangers in sustainability health travel and beyond advancements in science and technology shaped life in 2021 as we continue to imagine what the future could look like in a changing world take a look at the top innovations of the year a recycling process to tackle plastics plastic waste is filling up our landfills waterways and rivers or its being incinerated but not all plastics can be recycled with the current process mechanical recycling upcycle developed by honeywell uop is a new recycling process technology that can reduce the carbon footprint of plastic waste handling typically by more than 50 compared to conventional incineration and landfilling why its innovative the new advanced or chemical recycling process takes plastic waste that cant be recycled by current technology and breaks it down to a recycled polymer feedstock rpf the feedstock can then be used to manufacture new highquality plastics that can be used in food packaging pharmaceutical products and medical devices with the goal of enabling a circular plastics economy a cockpit thats connected a major upgrade for aircraft cockpits is on the horizon for pilots and crew preparing for a flight can take up ample time before takeoff and a dashboard full of traditional radar and analog displays only give pilots so many ways to look at and out of their aircraft our new avionics system honeywell anthem gives pilots and crews access to the data they need for more efficient takeoffs and smarter flights with digital displays that mimic the quality of smartphone screens why its innovative the traditional cockpit is built for commercial aircraft business jets and rotorcraft like helicopters honeywell anthem is the first cloudconnected cockpit system designed for those aircraft as well as lowflying urban air mobility uam aircraft its already set to be used in vertical aerospaces piloted zeroemissions electric batterypowered aircraft and in the sixpassenger lilium jet which takes off and lands vertically ai to detect methane leaks methane is about 80 times more powerful at warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20year period according to the un environment programme and leaks from natural gas systems are among the top source of methane emissions caused by human activity according to the us environmental protection agency this year our gas cloud imaging gci system was launched in europe to help power plants across the continent achieve automated and continuous monitoring for methane and other natural gas leaks why its innovative historically manual methods are used to detect gas leaks including sending people to detect natural gas leaks when they occur and using handheld equipment to conduct inspections now the use of infrared hyperspectral capabilities technology that detects invisible gasses like methane and artificial intelligence ai more efficiently detects when and where leaks occur and which leaks are most dangerous technologies helping drones soar when powered by batteries and existing technology like lineofsight radio links small drones can only fly so long enter our beyondvisuallineofsight bvlos solutions a set of systems including our hydrogen fuel cells which operate silently last up to three times longer than batteries electronically powered multipurpose radar inertial measurement units imu an array of electronics that informs an aircrafts system with precise navigation information and the uav satcom the worlds smallest and lightest satellite communications system that lets pilots view their drones cameras and download data why its innovative bvlos technologies let small drones fly up to three times longer than with existing technologies and with less human intervention this can allow small aerial vehicles to carry more travel farther and fly faster a cuttingedge face mask xupermask created by william in partnership with honeywell offers a new take on the face mask by marrying form and function created with a silicone face seal and an adjustable ergonomic design why its innovative the firstofitskind face mask doubles as a piece of wearable technology equipped with bluetooth capabilities built with dual 3speed fans and designed to fit hepa filters the mask also was designed with noisecancelling audio and microphone features and led lights theres even a place for wearers to dock their earbuds using quantum computing to protect from cybersecurity threats this year the honeywell system model h1 became the first quantum computer to pass the quantum volume 1024 benchmark a metric ibm introduced to determine quantum computing capacity now the trappedion quantum computing technology has a new application called quantum origin which can generate strong encryption keys a string of characters used to secure data created by quantinuum the company formed when our quantum computing business formerly known as honeywell quantum solutions merged with cambridge quantum why its innovative as our world becomes more connected cybercriminals are outsmarting current technology meant to protect our devices quantum origin uses quantum mechanics to create random unpredictable data for encryption keys that are more advanced than what todays classical computers could produce quantum origin is also a cloudbased platform so it can be integrated into existing systems used to generate encryption keys first passenger flight powered by 100 saf takes off on december 1 united airlines operated the first passenger flight powered by 100 sustainable aviation fuel saf why its innovative sustainable aviation fuel saf an alternative to conventional petroleumbased jet fuel is helping the aviation industry reduce its carbon footprint saf is made by converting already available materials including mustard seeds soybeans nonedible oils and sustainable biomass into a dropin replacement crude oil saf can be combined with conventional jet fuel to power aircraft but united airlines flight in december from chicago to washington dc which operated using 100 saf produced by honeywell uops ecofining tm technology in the right engine marked a milestone soon more flights will be powered by saf a mass vaccination clinic powered by software in january about 5000 people a day got their first covid19 vaccines by attending a mass vaccination clinic held at the charlotte motor speedway the effort which was supported by honeywell atrium health tepper sports entertainment and the state of north carolina and backed by north carolina gov roy cooper enabled patients to get inoculated from their parked cars existing technologies were put to new use to help manage the flow of thousands of patients each day heading into the venue to get vaccinated why its innovative barcode technology and qr codes helped both onsite leaders and clinical staff screen patients and document patient information before and during the mass vaccination clinic honeywells artificial intelligence prowatch software was also used to help leaders monitor queues for the charlotte motor speedway mass vaccination clinic and other mass vaccination events in charlotte worlds most powerful telescope set to make history source ball aerospace via nasa source ball aerospace via nasa the james webb telescope named after the administrator who led nasa in its apollo era is the most advanced space telescope built in the history of space and its been in development for more than 30 years a partnership between nasa the canadian space agency and the european space agency the james webb space telescope is planned to launch into space to look further into the universes past than any telescope has ever measured honeywells aerospace engineers contributed the fine guidance sensor and near infrared imager and slitless spectrograph fgsniriss technologies to the telescope which are designed to help webb point precisely and capture highquality images in space why its innovative the webb telescopes predecessor the hubble space telescope which launched in 1990 could peer 500 million years into the universes history with the webb telescope which is about 100 times stronger than hubble scientists can obtain a more detailed look at the cosmos than ever before visibility to air quality risk the importance of maintaining safe air quality indoors isnt going away anytime soon with transmission risk air monitor small to mediumsized indoor spaces like classrooms restaurants and offices can be monitored for co2 levels in realtime this makes it easier to detect conditions that may increase the risk of exposure to airborne viral transmission why its innovative powered by co2 temperature and humidity sensors the risk alert system illuminates in green yellow and red to alert potential changes in air quality in a mobile app and online dashboard this means that you dont have to be present to check in on a rooms air quality
