catalyst to increase production of aromatics july 30 2018 des plaines ill july 30 2018 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced that fuji oil co ltd has begun using honeywell uops new r364 platforming catalyst to produce more aromatics for chemical production at its sodegaura refinery on tokyo bay in chiba prefecture japan the r364 catalyst converts naphtha feedstock into aromatics which are used to make petrochemical compounds or blended into gasoline to improve its octane rating the highactivity catalyst features an innovative design that can increase production of a ccr platforming unit by up to 10 percent we count on uop to develop new catalysts that improve our economics said daiki imai general manager of operation management department for fuji oil the r364 catalyst is a dropin replacement catalyst that effectively increases our capacity and flexibility fuji oil selected the r364 catalyst because it can increase the refinerys production of aromatics by boosting throughput of the existing ccr platforming unit said mike cleveland senior business director for honeywell uops refining catalysts product line the catalyst meets fuji oils requirements for performance product quality and economics without modifications or investment in new equipment demand for gasoline in japan has been declining since reaching a peak in 2004 japanese refiners such as fuji oil have turned to manufacturing highervalue aromatics such as chemical grade benzene and mixed xylenes instead of gasoline these aromatics have a greater value than motor fuels honeywell uop introduced the r364 catalyst in 2017 it retains all the properties of the previous r264 catalyst but with better activity and lower coke production which improves the efficiency of catalytic reactions as a result the r364 catalyst is a dropin replacement for the r264 catalyst that increases yields of gasoline aromatics and hydrogen while producing less coke the ccr platforming process is a continuous catalytic reforming process used throughout the petroleum industry to convert lowquality naphtha into blending stocks for gasoline aromatics for plastics production and highpurity hydrogen the ccr platforming process is in operation at more than 250 customer sites fuji oil company ltd imports crude oil and engages in refining production processing storage export and sale of petroleum
