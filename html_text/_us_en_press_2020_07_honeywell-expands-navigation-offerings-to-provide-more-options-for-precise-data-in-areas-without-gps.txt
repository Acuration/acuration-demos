honeywell expands navigation offerings to provide more options for precise data in areas without gps latest inertial navigation system serves new customer requirements in autonomous vehicles mobile mapping surveying and more july 13 2020 phoenix july 14 2020 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon is introducing the hguide n380 a new inertial navigation system that communicates position orientation and velocity of an object such as an autonomous vehicle or unmanned aerial vehicle uav even when global navigation satellite signals are unavailable smaller lighter and lowerpriced than previous honeywell inertial navigation systems the hguide n380 is built using honeywells rigorous design standards to withstand harsh environments in the air on land or at sea we recognized a need for a small highperformance inertial navigation system in areas like 3d mapping surveying and other applications where space is at a premium and performance cannot be compromised said chris lund offering management senior director navigation and sensors honeywell aerospace we responded by developing the hguide n380 inertial navigation system which provides our customers with proven cost effective inertial sensor technology created for aerospace applications but that can be integrated into almost any architecture this new inertial navigation system is composed of honeywells hguide i300 inertial measurement unit imu a global navigation satellite system gnss receiver and honeywells proprietary sensor fusion software which is based on the algorithms used for navigation on millions of aircraft every day inputs from these components are fused together to determine position orientation and velocity to deliver critical navigation information even in areas where a satellite signal is degraded or altogether unavailable such as canyons bridges tunnels mountains parking garages or dense forests as the industry evolves honeywells hguide suite of imus and navigators will be a key enabler of emerging segments like autonomous vehicles mobile mapping precision agriculture robotics and surveying lund added during its development the new product was placed in extreme environments to test ruggedness and was exposed to extensive factory calibration and compensation procedures that help ensure measurement accuracy and performance honeywell has extensive experience in designing and building highend inertial sensor and navigation systems and has used that expertise to develop a lowercost portfolio of hguide offerings to serve new markets and customer requirements to date honeywell has delivered more than 500000 highperformance inertial sensors to serve as navigation aids on an extensive list of manned and unmanned vehicles which include many air and spacecraft in use
