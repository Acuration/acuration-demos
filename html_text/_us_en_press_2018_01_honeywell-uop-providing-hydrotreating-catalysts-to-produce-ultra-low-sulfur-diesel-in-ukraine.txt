providing hydrotreating catalysts to produce ultralow sulfur diesel in ukraine january 30 2018 des plaines ill jan 30 2018 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced that ukrgasvydobuvannya ugv has begun using honeywell uops hyt4118 unity hydrotreating catalyst to produce ultralow sulfur diesel fuel at the shebelinsky refinery in andreyevka kharkov region in eastern ukraine the hyt4118 catalyst removes sulfur from petroleum feeds that are used to make distillate the raw material for making cleanerburning diesel fuel the catalyst is designed for use in low to mediumpressure ultralow sulfur diesel hydrotreating units providing high activity and stability for longer cycle lengths with low hydrogen consumption it works with a range of feedstocks including straight run diesel light cycle oils light coker gas oils and other cracked feedstocks ugv chose the hyt4118 catalyst because of its ability to produce diesel fuel that meets the euro v emissions standard while conserving hydrogen said mike cleveland senior business director for honeywell uops refining catalysts product line the catalyst meets ugvs requirements for performance product quality and economics hydrotreating is a critical step in the refining process where hydrogen and a proprietary catalyst are used to remove sulfur and other contaminants before conversion into transportation fuels the process produces a cleanerburning diesel fuel product that meets stricter fuel regulations such as the euro v standard which specifies sulfur content of less than 10 parts per million in transportation fuels honeywell uops line of unity catalysts includes more than two dozen hydrotreating catalysts for hydrocracking and fluid catalytic cracking fcc pretreat and diesel kerosene and coker naphtha hydrotreating honeywell uop also offers catalysts for naphtha hydrotreating and fcc gasoline desulfurization honeywell uop inaugurated the use of catalysts in the refining industry in 1931 beginning with solid phosphoric acid this and subsequent processes significantly raised the yield of highoctane transportation fuels today honeywell uop is recognized as a leading developer of advanced catalysts for the refining industry according to the international energy association eia global demand growth for transportation fuels is shifting toward emerging economies with a diesel bias while quality specifications for international marine fuels will drive a shift from residual fuel oil to marine diesel trucks which are a key enabler of commercial activity in emerging economies will lead to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions of nearly 900 million tonnes through 2050 heightening the need for cleanerburning diesel fuels ukrgasvydobuvannya is the largest natural gas producer in central and eastern europe accounting for 75 of natural gas production in ukraine ukrgasvydobuvannya is a vertically integrated company with closedcycle operations from exploration of gas and crude
