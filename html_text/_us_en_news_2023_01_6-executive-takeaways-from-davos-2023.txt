determining solutions that can help solve the climate crisis while at the same time fostering fairer and more inclusive societies failure to adapt to and mitigate climate change was highlighted as one of the biggest challenges facing the world in the next decade according to the forums 2023 global risks report the honeywell delegation attended dozens of customer and partner meetings and met with government leaders over the course of the week we asked our executives in attendance to reflect on their key insights from this years wef and why they matter regardless of economic trends sustainability remains a priority i have not heard any customers say they are cutting their budgets for renewables spend or alternative fuels i dont think there is a correlation between a tougher economy and a divestiture of a path to sustainability because everyone has to get there whether its 2030 2040 or 2050 everyone has a pledge to be carbon neutral and you have to start now and keep investing every year to get there darius adamczyk chairman and ceo organizations need to start improving scope 1 and scope 2 emissions the biggest shift i noticed at wef this year was an increased urgency around sustainability action including a focus on the adoption of new technologies capable of driving the energy transition organizations know they need to act now whether that is public or private companies governments or any other type of organization there is a clear focus on reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions getting the economics of the solutions to this challenge in place is a priority and it is why we are so wellpositioned to help customers in this area we have the right portfolio of readynow solutions from building technologies to flow batteries from our solstice line of lowglobal warmingpotential refrigerants to digital technologies for more efficient operations that can help everyone get there vimal kapur president and chief operating officer progress is dependent on innovation and cooperation we cannot advance sustainability pledges at a national level without innovation from the private sector organizations are already working across a vast portfolio of sustainabilityfocused technologies from innovative systems to make urban infrastructure smarter and less energy intensive to decarbonization offerings and solutions for harnessing alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and renewables but the public sector must also innovate advances in regulatory and policy frameworks and financial structures are key to creating the market conditions for sustainable technology to flourish and to ensure continued private sector investment in the most emerging areas anne madden svp and general counsel the world needs honeywell and the innovation were

make the world a better place to live and help ensure the earth survives us john waldron svp and chief commercial officer technologies like hydrogen saf will enable a carbonneutral economy in speaking with customers during wef the message we heard was consistent and clear advancing sustainable aviation fuel saf is a critical route to advancing the sustainability credentials of the aviation industry however scaling up saf production to meet the industrys climate ambitions depends on multistakeholder collaboration and incentives similarly there is a lot of excitement around the value that hydrogen offers as fuel of the future but there is also work to do here if we broadly leverage the huge potential hydrogen represents honeywell is at the forefront of these exciting technologies and we are going to continue on a path of innovation alongside industry and the public sector to ensure the value of these technologies can be realized as quickly efficiently and equitably as possible lucian boldea president and ceo performance materials and technologies routes to sustainability arent the same for every country or company the world is looking for readynow and workable sustainability
