honeywell continues transition to nextgeneration refrigerant in collaboration with trane technologies honeywells solstice n41 r466a is the industrys first reduced global warming nonflammable alternative refrigerant to r410a which is commonly used in home airconditioning units commercial and residential locations are participating in nationwide field trials without significant disruption to their existing infrastructures june 29 2021 morris plains nj june 29 2021 prnewswire honeywell nasdaq hon today announced it will partner with trane technologies nyse tt to accelerate the transition to a nextgeneration environmentally preferable refrigerant by field testing honeywells solstice n41 r466a the industrys first nonflammable alternative to r410a trane will deploy and test solstice n41 at three customer locations in different parts of the united states as part of a oneyear field trial trane is currently testing solstice n41 at the western cooling efficiency center wcec at the university of california davis to evaluate its performance with a trane rooftop hvac unit used in light commercial applications the trials will test compatibility with new equipment installations and retrofit conversions trane will closely monitor power and energy consumption and analyze the refrigerant characteristics to further assess solstice n41 as a replacement for r410a as a global climate innovator who is leading the industry transition to nextgeneration refrigerants we have invested more than 500 million to identify safe sustainable options said randy newton vice president of engineering at trane technologies our continuous testing research and development supports new technologies that improve the carbon footprint in support of our customers needs and contribute to our gigaton challenge as we evaluate refrigerants to replace r410a we seek to balance environmental impact safety efficiency and affordability we look forward to working with honeywell to assess the feasibility of solstice n41 as a safe option for the industry that could enable ease of transition to meet regulatory deadlines and help our customers meet their overall sustainability goals solstice n41 provides the same level of safety to contractors and customers as the market standard refrigerant r410a and reduces global warming impact by 65 percent other alternatives proposed as r410a replacements such as r32 and r454b are higher risk due to their 2l low flammability rating which could increase risk to businesses and homeowners and require changes to safety standards and building codes and oem equipment production lines honeywell scientists devoted years of research and development to develop a nonflammable product that can replace r410a in homes and small business as a near dropin replacement within existing infrastructures while providing reduced global warming potential coupled with similar energy efficiency said ken west vice president and general manager honeywell fluorine products solstice n41 is a great option for both commercial and residential end users this next step with trane solidifies our confidence in moving toward industry adoption of r466a our work is increasingly focused on recognizing the farreaching implications of greenhouse gas emissions on our environment and changing climate said curtis harrington senior engineer at uc davis wcec our research with trane allows us to provide an objective technology evaluation of honeywells solstice n41 field performance and provide valuable input on the development of nextgeneration refrigerants to date solstice n41 has undergone extensive analysis by over 15 original equipment manufacturers oems and leading compressor manufacturers the product has accumulated more than 100000 reliable hours in different applications like commercial air conditioning variable refrigerant flow rooftops and residential air conditioning unitary ducted equipment in the us honeywell is a world leader in the development manufacture and supply of refrigerants that are sold worldwide under the solstice and genetron brand names for a range of applications including refrigeration and building and automobile air conditioning honeywell and its suppliers have completed a billion dollar investment program in research and development and new capacity based on honeywells hydrofluorolefin
