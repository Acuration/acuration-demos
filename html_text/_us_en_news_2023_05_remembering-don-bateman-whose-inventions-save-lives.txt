contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news remembering don bateman whose inventions save lives remembering don bateman whose inventions save lives the late engineer invented a system used today on planes that warns flight crews of potential collisions with terrain or structures the next time you fly on a commercial plane know that the inventions of the late honeywell engineer don bateman helped get you to your destination safely bateman who retired from honeywell in 2016 died at 91 in bellevue washington on may 21 throughout his decadeslong career bateman saved lives by introducing groundbreaking technologies to help flight crews avoid preventable aviation accidents he received numerous patents for aviation safety technologies and was awarded the national medal of technology and innovation bateman created the enhanced ground proximity warning system egpws which provides flight crews with timely accurate information about terrain and obstacles in the area reducing the risk of colliding with terrain especially when pilots fly in lowvisibility conditions the egpws uses various aircraft inputs and an internal database to predict and warn flight crews of potential conflicts honeywell has produced about 65000 egpws boxes that are installed on planes around the world today the egpws is the successor of batemans original invention the ground proximity warning system gpws which gave pilots an audible warning to avoid fatal collisions with terrain such as trees a mountain or the ground a legacy of innovation when batemans younger daughter katherine mccaslin was growing up boarding a plane with her dad meant learning about all the ways engineers had made improvements to planes to make flying safer he always credited the people who came before him mccaslin said hed look back and say that aviation is built on the shoulders of so many great innovators he really felt like his work at honeywell was standing on the shoulders of giants to make an impact batemans dedication to saving lives by making aviation safer is what led him to form a team of mavericks a group of engineers with a unique passion for what they were building and a strong sense of purpose thea feyereisen now an advanced tech senior fellow was one of batemans team members she joined honeywell in 1995 feyereisen a pilot with a background in human factors the study of how people can interact with aviation technology and enhance aviation safety knew of batemans legacy before joining his team in the early 2000s feyereisen first met bateman while she worked on a research project that used the egpws terrain database to improve synthetic vision which gives pilots a 3d view to help them navigate she remembers her former boss as someone who wasnt afraid to speak up but also as someone with a clever sense of humor and who was humble and welcoming he really valued diverse backgrounds and viewpoints she said he carried those values to his team she said i think the word mavericks itself speaks volumes and serves as a reminder that its ok to challenge and have intellectual debates feyereisen said ishihara and bateman hold an egpws box circa batemans retirement from honeywell in 2016 yasuo ishihara was also a part of batemans team they worked together for more than 20 years i was a graduate student at the time getting ready to graduate when my professor handed me don batemans business card ishihara said bateman hired ishihara after his graduation im really honored to have gotten to know and work for don at the beginning of my career i learned the importance of believing in what you do and also the importance of working as a team player chasing a common goal ishihara said he helped me grow and gave me challenging tasks regardless of my years of experience thats all because of his leadership and vision and trust in people in his group ishihara remembers bateman as a leader who encouraged his team to do what could be done at any given moment to make flying safer then improve the products as time progressed ishihara carries this philosophy to his work now as an aerospace fellow focusing on the honeywell anthem flight deck if we have something that we can do today that can save lives when its installed on airplanes we should do it ishihara said of batemans approach to innovation ishihara added that bateman was not only an engineer who was respected admired and trusted by all who knew him which he experienced firsthand while accompanying bateman at industry events around the world but he also served as a father figure in our travels i got to know about his family and share about my family when my parents came to visit the us from japan bateman invited them to his home for lunch even though they dont speak english ishihara said he really listened to people and he was very gentle thats why i really admire him i tell people that when i grow up i want to be the next don bateman reflecting on her dads career mccaslin said she remembers how proud he was of his team members at honeywell my dad was so appreciative of the way he had the space to innovate at honeywell mccaslin said he felt that he worked with bestinclass people and that included everyone who supported him over the years from his team of engineers to human resources teams and administrators she added my dad saw aviation as magic and raised us to love flying and travel as well as the sense that theres always the opportunity to innovate and make something better aerospace related content tracking recent extreme weather with the swot satellite mission to
