reveals 68 of surveyed workers do not feel completely safe in their buildings nearly a quarter of remote workers would quit before returning to a risky worksite january 13 2021 atlanta jan 13 2021 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today released the results of a comprehensive study on workers perceptions and feelings on the health and safety of their workplace conducted by wakefield research the study surveyed 2000 workers that typically work in buildings with 500 or more employees across the united states united kingdom germany and the middle east the findings show that a staggering majority of the global workforce 68 does not feel completely safe working in their employers buildings this number is even higher for those working remotely 75 who are especially skeptical about the safety of work sites in fact nearly 1 in 4 remote workers 23 would look for a new job rather than return to a site that did not implement necessary safety measures workers are keenly attuned to the steps employers are taking to make their workspaces safer and healthier especially when it comes to air quality and adherence to safety guidelines which wasnt previously a concern for some people said vimal kapur president and chief executive officer of honeywell building technologies air quality for example is not something that will be dismissed once were on the other side of this pandemic it will be essential to the occupant experience and good air quality will help make workers feel more comfortable as they return back to their offices the surveyed workers concerns echo the latest scientific research on the spread of covid19 12 with 56 of workers being more concerned about transmission through the air than through contact with a surface in terms of what poses a bigger threat to their safety more than 2 in 5 41 of those surveyed believe that buildings with outdated ventilation systems are more dangerous than coworkers not following safety guidelines more than half of surveyed workers 54 agree that their building management has not taken the steps necessary to keep them safer on the job and 60 believe their building is more likely to make shortterm changes in response to the pandemic versus longterm investments in building systems surveyed workers are most worried that building management wont consistently enforce health and safety guidelines 42 followed by worry that they wont consistently invest in new technology to make working inperson safer 30 many facilities have made changes to their procedures but have not invested in the building itself and their occupants have noticed kapur said workers are going to demand more from buildings in the future and were even seeing with these survey results that creating a healthier and safer environment will be a differentiator for staff retention and recruiting and it may also impact longterm real estate value to return to work and feel safer nearly 1 in 3 surveyed workers 31 say updates to the air quality systems are critical but only 25 of those onsite have seen such updates happen other top health and safety measures that surveyed workers want include protocols such as social distancing or mandatory masks 49 followed by health screening protocols such as temperature checks 41 enhanced cleaning procedures 40 touchless door entries 31 and technology for contact tracing 20 honeywells healthy
