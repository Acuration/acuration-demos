hon uop today announced that the diamond green diesel facility in norco la will expand its annual production capacity of renewable diesel from 10000 barrels per day to 18000 bpd using honeywell uops

plans to complete the expansion in the second quarter of 2018 the expansion of the diamond green diesel facility is a testament to the viability and growth potential of renewable fuels said dave cepla senior director of honeywell uops renewable energy and chemicals business the technology and commercial potential of the ecofining process have been proven and the best evidence is the companys decision to invest in expanded production capacity the diamond green diesel facility converts inedible oils and other waste feedstocks to produce honeywell green diesel a highquality renewable fuel unlike biodiesel renewable diesel produced using the ecofining process is chemically identical to petroleumbased diesel and can be used as a dropin replacement in vehicles with no modifications it also features up to an 80percent lifecycle reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with diesel from petroleum fuel produced at the facility is qualified as biomassbased diesel an advanced biofuel under the us environmental protection agencys renewable fuel standard which requires a minimum volume of transportation fuels sold in the us to contain renewable fuel as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions honeywell uop jointly developed the ecofining process with eni spa it converts nonedible natural oils and animal fats to honeywell green diesel which offers improved performance over biodiesel and petroleumbased diesel it features a cetane value of 80 compared with a cetane range of 40 to 60 found in diesel at the pump today cetane values indicate how quickly and completely diesel fuel will burn highercetane diesel fuel provides better engine performance with fewer emissions highcetane diesel can be blended with cheaper lowcetane diesel to meet transportation standards honeywell green diesel also offers excellent performance at cold or warm temperatures in addition to ecofining technology honeywell has commercialized the uop renewable jet fuel process which originally was developed under a contract with the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa to produce renewable jet fuel for the us military honeywell green jet fuel produced by this
