first quarter said darius adamczyk chairman and chief executive officer of honeywell as the covid19 pandemic rapidly escalated and the global economy deteriorated we faced headwinds across our businesses including rapid changes in our supply chain constraints at customer sites and significant impacts on the commercial aerospace and oil and gas end markets these challenges drove an organic

conditions particularly in the aerospace and oil and gas sectors firstquarter performance honeywell sales for the first quarter were down 5 on a reported basis and down 4 on an organic basis the
