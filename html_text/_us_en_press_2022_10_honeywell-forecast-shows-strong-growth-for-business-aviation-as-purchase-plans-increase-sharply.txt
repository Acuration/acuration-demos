new jet purchase plans on par with 2019 levels with fleet addition rates doubling from last years reported intentions respondents feedback in this years survey aligns with industry reports of soldout business jet production lines for the next several years the business aviation industry is greatly benefitting from a wave of firsttime users and buyers due in part to changing habits brought on by the covid19 pandemic said honeywell aerospace president americas aftermarket heath patrick the business aviation sector is expected to recover to 2019 delivery and expenditure levels by 2023 which is much sooner than previously anticipated demand for new business jets is as high as weve seen it since 2015 and we expect high levels of demand and expenditures for new aircraft for several more years key findings in the 2022 honeywell global business aviation outlook include new business jet deliveries in 2023 are expected to be 17 higher than in 2022 expenditures are expected to be 20 higher

expected worldwide longterm economic growth onethird of those surveyed expect to fly more in 2023 versus 2022 64 expect to fly at least the same amount and just 4 expect to fly less large longrange aircraft classes are expected to account for more than 70 of all expenditures of new business jets in the next five years just 2 of surveyed operators plan to dispose of an aircraft without replacement which is half the rate gleaned in 2021 fiveyear purchase plans for used jets remain high totaling 28 of the current fleet and on par with last years results high demand for used jets will keep pressuring the already low inventory of jets available for sale new users of business and private aviation the business aviation industry is benefitting from waves of firsttime private aviation users and buyers which is likely attributed to covid19 at times in 2022 flight activity met levels not seen since 2007 which was the busiest year ever for business aviation concerns about exposure to pathogens and the reduction of premium class airline services helped drive recent growth in business and private aviation the 2022 honeywell survey sampled firsttime business aircraft owners who have made their purchases since 2020 and operators who are capturing firsttime private aviation users nearly 74 of surveyed new users of private aviation expect to keep the same level of flying in 2023 as they did in 2022 which is 10 percentage points above the whole fleet average only 4 expect to fly less in 2023 nearly 85 of firsttime users operate in the americas within the americas 80 of firsttime
