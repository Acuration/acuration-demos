honeywell launches first integrated aspirating smoke detection and indoor air quality monitoring system integrates early warning smoke detection and advanced iaq parameter monitoring into single system to help identify environmental concerns before they become problems september 20 2022 atlanta sept 20 2022 prnewswire honeywell nasdaq hon today launched a firstofitskind solution that combines early warning smoke detection with advanced indoor air quality iaq monitoring furthering its efforts to create safer and healthier buildings built on the flagship vesdae line of aspirating smoke detectors the vesda air solution has a unique fiveinone iaq sensor within a single box which can help improve building safety by identifying life safety asset protection or iaq issues before they escalate into problems vesda air complements honeywells ready now healthy buildings solutions that can help improve occupant wellbeing meet energy efficiency goals and importantly change the way occupants experience a building honeywells vesda technology actively samples air rather than passively waiting for smoke to reach traditional spot sensors to identify trace amounts of smoke and enable early intervention before it disrupts operations honeywell engineers have integrated into the same vesda system a highly sensitive iaq sensor that measures critical iaq parameters including volatile organic compounds i total vocs listed by ashrae as contaminants of concern ii fine particulate matter of 10 micron pm10 and pm25 or larger with unprecedented accuracy co and co2 concentration temperature and humidity ideal for premium commercial buildings healthcare facilities hospitality manufacturing and schools the new sensor provides instrumentgrade iaq sensing for data uniformity and accuracy the emphasis on indoor air quality isnt going away and thats a good thing as more organizations work to create safer healthier environments that help boost occupant wellbeing and productivity said udaya shrivastava vice president and chief technology officer honeywell building technologies we challenged our engineering teams to find a way to complement the capabilities of our aspirating smoke detection systems with highly sensitive iaq monitoring the system identifies not only the minute presence of smoke but also the presence of air quality contaminants of concern allowing building operators to react and respond to outofbounds parameters quickly before they escalate into unsafe situations the plugandplay cartridgebased iaq sensor works much the same as replacing a printers inkjet cartridge thus avoiding costly calibration and other maintenance this convenience helps to reduce total cost minimize waste and provide accurate iaq data the scalable solution can be used in both new construction and existing buildings in new construction installation of an integrated vesda air solution can reduce the total cost of installation tci and total cost of maintenance tcm as compared to installing and maintaining standalone smoke detection and iaq monitoring systems in buildings with a fully functional smoke detection system a smokeless iaqonly system can be installed to provide accurate actionable data to adjust ventilation parameters about honeywell building technologies honeywell building technologies hbt is transforming the way every building operates to help
