could have stood it i felt personally involved in everything he did jim and neil met when neil became one of the first nasa pilots to fly honeywells adaptive system installed on the f101 they became close during testing at woldchamberlain field in minneapolis later they tested it on the x15 aircraft that groundbreaking program was the precursor for breaking free of earths orbit and really launched the dawn of the space age those test flights were planned in meticulous detail you tried to not have any surprises you tried to do everything and it was carefully planned and thought out in addition to working the x15 program jim contributed to project mercury by evaluating the space capsules flight controls that testing was strenuous he was in a spacesuit in centrifuge spinning quickly he had the simulated feeling his eyeballs were popping out of their sockets the tests went up to six or seven times gforce he recalled adding it was miserable miserable when jim and neil met they had similar military backgrounds jim was a fighter pilot in the marine corps during world war ii and in the korean war and neil was a fighter pilot in the navy and flew 78 combat missions over korea

11 mission launched july 16 1969 with three crew members neil buzz aldrin and michael collins on july 20 1969 the world tuned in to watch neil walk on the moon at the time jims family was on vacation in europe and there was only one tv in the lobby of where they stayed recalled jims daughter deborah we gathered around the tv and we wondered where dad was and i think someone may have run to get him but jim told them he would not watch he knew everything that could go wrong i mean there were so many things and some did go wrong and neil worked it out but yeah dad didnt even watch it deborah said the dangers of the mission were too personal i knew neil so well that everything he did that has a high risk i felt part of that risk jim said but neil successfully took a small step completed the mission and made history when he was successful i just collapsed jim said the first time they reunited after the mission jim congratulated his friend you did it you made it he remembered telling neil then neil told jim that the apollo 11 mission was just like their testing except neil flew in a new area the moon learn more about apollo 11 aerospace related content tracking recent extreme weather
