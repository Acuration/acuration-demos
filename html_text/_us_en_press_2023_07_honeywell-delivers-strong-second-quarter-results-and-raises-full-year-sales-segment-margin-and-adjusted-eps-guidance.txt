found in tables 2 and 3 aerospace sales for the second quarter were up 16 year over year on an organic 1 basis the fourth consecutive quarter of doubledigit organic growth led by sustained strength in commercial aviation commercial aftermarket demand remained strong as flight hours continued to recover in air transport enabling commercial aviation aftermarket sales growth of over 25 commercial original equipment sales grew approximately 15 year over year in the quarter defense and space sales grew for a second consecutive quarter as we worked through our robust backlog segment margin expanded 120 basis points to 277 driven by commercial excellence and higher volume leverage partially offset by cost inflation honeywell building technologies sales for the second quarter were flat on an organic 1 basis year over year building solutions grew 2 organically as a result of continued growth in services building products sales declined 1 organically as growth in our fire offerings was offset by softer volumes in security and building management systems segment margin expanded 200 basis points to 255 due to commercial excellence and productivity actions partially offset by cost inflation performance materials and technologies sales for the second quarter were up 7 on an organic 1 basis year over year hps sales grew 11 organically with strength in projects and in lifecycle solutions and services uop grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter up 11 organically as a result of continued strength in gas processing solutions and refining catalyst shipments in advanced materials growth in fluorine products was offset by expected softness in electronic materials leading to flat organic growth in the quarter segment margin contracted 60 basis points to 217 as favorable price cost was more than offset by challenges in advanced materials including lower volumes and the previously communicated disruption in one of our plants safety and productivity solutions sales for the second quarter decreased 21 on an organic 1 basis year over year sales declines were led by lower volumes in productivity solutions and services and warehouse and workflow solutions which continues to be impacted by softness in the warehouse automation market despite doubledigit growth in the aftermarket services business segment margin expanded 410 basis points year over year to 167 driven by productivity actions and commercial excellence partially offset by lower volume leverage and cost inflation conference call details honeywell will discuss its secondquarter results and
