latest misrepresentations june 13 2020 garretts latest announcements represent an unfortunate attempt to malign honeywell to try to better position themselves in their meritless lawsuit garrett continues to misrepresent their obligations under their agreements the facts are garretts initial proposal to amend its credit agreement was launched without notice to honeywell and directly and materially violated honeywells rights under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement ira honeywell subsequently issued a notice of default to protect our rights and our shareowners interests over the past few weeks honeywell has worked constructively with garrett to ensure honeywells rights are protected while achieving the common goal of giving garrett relief it sought under its financial covenants due to the challenging covid19 environment we ultimately reached an agreement and withdrew the notice of default the garrett spinoff and honeywells ongoing reimbursement agreements with garrett were structured and sized for the specific purposes of enabling garrett to generate sufficient free cash flow to make the required payments and enabling garrett to succeed in the marketplace as a standalone company even in the event of a significant industry downturn to date garretts leadership has spent more than 12 million of their shareowners money in pursuing expensive litigation against honeywell that lacks any merit to discourage this level of spending while garrett sought covenant relief and both companies were facing covid economic challenges honeywell proposed and garrett agreed that both companies will make good faith efforts to limit our nearterm litigation spend on the ongoing dispute without limiting either companys rights we believe garretts leadership would better serve their stakeholders by focusing on delivering value and supporting customers rather than pursuing expensive and meritless litigation and issuing public misrepresentations nina krauss
