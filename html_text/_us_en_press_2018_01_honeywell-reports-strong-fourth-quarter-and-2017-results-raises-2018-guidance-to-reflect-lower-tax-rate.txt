important to our employees over the long term adamczyk concluded the company recorded a provisional charge of 38billion in the fourth quarter to reflect the estimated impacts of the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 including the us tax on deemed repatriated earnings of nonus subsidiaries the write down of net us deferred tax liabilities at lower enacted corporate tax rates and the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system the impacts of the legislation may differ from this estimate possibly materially and the amount of the provisional charge may accordingly be adjusted over the course of 2018 due to changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made guidance that may be issued and actions the company may take as a result of the tax legislation honeywell has been a strong supporter of this legislation and is encouraged by the significantly enhanced capital mobility lower us corporate income tax rates and more appealing investment environment in the us
