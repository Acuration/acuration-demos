gas on worlds first floating lng vessel november 8 2017 des plaines ill nov 7 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon announced today that petronas floating liquefied natural gas flng facility the first of its kind in the world is using honeywell uops amine guard fs technology specially adapted for marine applications the custombuilt vessel called pflng satu liquefies stores and offloads liquefied natural gas lng the amine guard fs unit is used to remove carbon dioxide from natural gas to prevent freezing as the gas is cooled to a liquid this is the first application of the amine guard fs technology on an flng facility honeywell uop adapted the technology to compensate for vessel motion thereby ensuring that the system can efficiently remove carbon dioxide from natural gas during all anticipated ocean conditions natural gas must contain fewer than 50 parts per million of carbon dioxide to be liquefied and that has been very difficult to achieve in a floating lng installation until now said rachelle goebel vice president and general manager of honeywell uops gas processing and hydrogen business this amine guard fs design modified for sea operations lowers production risks in flng applications ensuring a more reliable way to produce marine lng this amine guard fs solution provides higher uptime and throughput compared to amine systems that are not designed to operate in rough seas honeywell uops solution also lowers operating costs and covers a smaller footprint with lower weight honeywell uop provided a process guarantee onsite commissioning and ongoing service for the marine amine guard fs system the pflng satu facility will play a significant role in petronas efforts to unlock gas reserves in remote and stranded fields which was once deemed uneconomical to develop and produce with a crew of 145 people pflng satu is the first such facility to start operations in the world it operates in shallow water depths of between 70 meters and 200 meters with a processing capacity of 12 million tons per annum mpta in august petronas reported that its flng has been delivering cargoes since it was commissioned in april including deliveries to buyers in the far east this demonstrates uops ability to adapt a conventional landbased installation to a floating lng facility amine gas treating also called sweetening uses aqueous solutions of various amines to remove corrosive acid gases such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from natural gas without this treatment natural gas can destroy pipelines storage containers and equipment honeywell uop
