correct quantum errors in real time researchers at honeywell quantum solutions applied multiple rounds of quantum error correction to a single logical qubit an industry first researchers at honeywell quantum solutions have taken a significant step toward demonstrating the viability of largescale quantum computing on its trappedion quantum computing technology the honeywell team can now perform quantum error correction qec which are protocols necessary to detect and correct errors in real time on a quantum computer they demonstrated the ability to protect quantum information prevent a quantum computation from being quickly corrupted by imperfections and noise on the system model h1 this is an important first in the quantum computing industry currently most demonstrations of quantum error correction involve correcting errors or noise after the procedure has finished running a technique known as postprocessing in a paper published this week on arxiv researchers detailed how they created a single logical qubit a series of entangled physical qubits and applied multiple rounds of quantum error correction this logical qubit is protected from two main types of errors that occur in a quantum computer bit flips and phase flips previously groups have looked at codes that only are capable of correcting a single type of error bit or phase but not both google ibmraytheon ibmbasel others have looked at quantum error detecting codes which can detect both types of errors but not correct them eth google delft further still groups have demonstrated pieces of the quantum error correcting process blatt monroe all of todays quantum technologies are at an early stage where they must combat errors that accumulate during computations said tony uttley president of honeywell quantum solutions what the honeywell team accomplished is groundbreaking it proves what was once only theoretical that quantum computers will be able to correct errors in real time paving the way for precise quantum computations though the achievement represents progress toward largescale quantum computing honeywell researchers are still working to cross the breakeven point at which the logical error rate is less than the physical error rate the need for logical qubits to appreciate this achievement it is important to understand how difficult it is to detect and then correct a quantum error quantum bits or qubits are fragile and finicky they pick up interference or noise from their environment this noise causes errors to accumulate and corrupts information stored in and between physical qubits scientists call this decoherence attempts to directly detect and correct errors on a physical qubit also corrupts its quantumness and cloning this data a method used in classical computing that involves making multiple exact copies of the information does not work in quantum as prohibited by the no cloning theorem to overcome these concerns several scientists most notably peter shor robert calberbank and andrew steane found a way around this at least in theory after studying how quickly qubits experience decoherence they demonstrated that by storing information in a collection of entangled qubits it was possible to detect and correct errors without disrupting quantum information they called this assortment of entangled qubits a logical qubit scientists have spent years developing codes and methods that could be applied to logical qubits to protect quantum information from errors whats next the next step is to break even crossing the point at which the logical qubit error rate is lower than the error rate for physical qubits creating logical qubits and applying quantum error correction codes also can inject noise into a system the honeywell team is closing in on that mark to definitively demonstrate passing the breakeven point the error rate per qec cycle needs to be lower than the largest physical error rate associated with the qec protocol in the technical paper we point to key improvements we need to make to reach the breakeven point said dr ciaran ryananderson an advanced physicist and lead author of the paper we believe these improvements are feasible and are pushing to accomplish this next step from there the goal is to create multiple logical qubits which depending on the quantum technology requires better fidelities more physical qubits better connectivity between qubits and other factors an increase in logical qubits will usher in a new era of faulttolerant quantum computers that can continue to function even when some operations fail fault tolerance is a design principle that prevents errors from cascading throughout a system and corrupting circuits the big enterpriselevel problems we want to solve with quantum computers require precision and we need errorcorrected logical qubits to scale successfully uttley said quantum quantum news related content how quantum can help computers comprehend words conversations like
