contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news how bmw can maximize its supply chain efficiency how bmw can maximize its supply chain efficiency with quantum the luxury car company is getting the ultimate operational upgrade powered by honeywells quantum computer few car shoppers think about how materials goods and services move from suppliers to manufacturers wholesalers distributors retailers and then to their homes but for global companies managing the logistics and keeping supply chains flowing and customers satisfied it is critical even small disruptions or minor inefficiencies cost time and money quantum computers such as honeywells system model h1 could help entropica labs a singaporebased quantum software startup and the bmw group are teaming up with honeywell quantum solutions they plan to examine supply chains and logistics for the global luxury automobile manufacturer the bmw group is always exploring new technologies to further enhance our operations said julius marcea head of it region asiapacific eastern europe middle east africa bmw group we are excited to investigate the transformative potential of quantum computing on the automotive industry and are committed to extending the limits of engineering performance benchmarking performance bmw entropica labs will develop and run a benchmark for nearterm quantum optimization on our h1 hardware specifically they used the recursive quantum approximate optimization algorithm rqaoa to tackle number partitioning a classic combinatorial problem that is an entry point to many logistics and supply chain problems of industrial interest the work leveraged three key features of the honeywell h1 hardware full qubit connectivity high fidelity operations and high angular resolution of the quantum gates the results see figure below showed the performance of the h1 to be competitive with a simulator incorporating only shot noise resulting from the finite number of measurements on the algorithmic side for the small problem instances studied the depth1 rqaoa has a performance that is comparable to the classical karmarkarkarp kk heuristic future work will explore whether higherdepth versions of rqaoa are able to outperform the kk algorithm figure 1 experimental data taken on the honeywell system model h1 demonstrating the performance of the rqaoa vs the classical kk heuristic and the brute force answer smaller set difference is better for both h1 blue and the simulator red 200 shots were taken quantum computers work much differently than classical computers the ones we use today for accessing the internet and creating spreadsheets thus algorithm development for quantum computers requires special skills it takes a team with a blend of talents spanning between physics and mathematics to write quantum programs which is why the bmw group is working with the experts at entropica labs for this activity the results of this simple benchmark project are very informative and will be helpful to entropica as we continue to investigate realworld use cases for quantum optimization said ewan munro entropicas chief technology officer and cofounder number partitioning fits well with todays quantum computers and with larger systems we will be able to explore more industrially relevant problems whats next for entropica and bmw the next step is to explore whether more complex versions of rqaoa can outperform the leading classical algorithms we have enjoyed working with honeywell and the bmw group on this project munro said entropica has worked with both of honeywells hardware offerings and the increase in performance over the last year has been impressive we look forward to continuing to leverage the unique features of the h1 system honeywell quantum solutions president tony uttley said the project is an important step toward scaling up quantum technologies we are quickly moving from benchmarking and doublechecking data generated on quantum systems and algorithms to being able to tackle realworld enterpriselevel problems such as global supply chains he said quantum supply chain how quantum can help computers
