areas like reliability quality and sustainability said mitchell johnson president and ceo ozarks electric cooperative our collaboration with honeywell helps us improve in these areas and connects us with the data analytics we need to work smarter advance operations and add value to our members the united states department of labor lists utility line work as one of the top 10 most dangerous jobs in the country transmission lines are often located in rugged or remote areas making onfoot or helicopter inspections difficult timeconsuming and often dangerous ozarks electric cooperatives utility grid spans mountains rivers and valleys in the ozarks mountains which make it challenging to access transmission lines with honeywells uav inspection service customers save time and crews can work from a safer location to identify problematic areas along power lines such as cracks vegetation encroachment or frayed electrical wires honeywells uav service utilizes a threestep process to conduct inspections and deliver data analytics for customers like ozarks electric cooperative during the first phase honeywell works with the customer to plan the inspection and finalize the uavs flight plan ensuring it complies with federal aviation administration regulations next honeywells uav pilots perform the inspection using autonomous flight management software capturing thousands of images and raw data along the way finally the imagery is run through honeywells proprietary data analytics software which is specially designed to sort organize and tag the inspection data this software then uses machine learning algorithms to identify potential hazards such as vegetation encroachment or hardware defects and prioritizes them based on how urgently they need attention once this process is
