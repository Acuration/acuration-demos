precision navigation capabilities to commercial markets july 11 2018 phoenix july 10 2018 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon has produced a new inertial navigation unit that provides accurate navigation for customers across a broad range of industries including agriculture robotics and autonomous vehicles without compromising on size cost or performance called the hguide n580 this is the first honeywellproduced industrialfocused navigation solution that uses both precision inertial measurement unit technology and global navigation satellite systems to improve location accuracy even when facing natural and manmade obstacles the blend of inertial and satellite navigation capabilities provided by the hguide n580 is especially important where precision is required in demanding environments for example autonomous cars traveling in cities where our technology can extend the accuracy and performance of navigational systems while keeping passengers safe said chris lund senior director navigation and sensors honeywell aerospace honeywells history and expertise in navigation technology enables customers to implement this new wave of advanced technology into their own applications and operations roughly the size of a deck of cards the hguide n580 gives honeywells industrial customers the capabilities needed to navigate accurately in areas with limited satellite coverage such as densely populated cities where tall buildings underground tunnels and multilayer freeway stacks or bridges often create challenges to traditional global positioning system gps navigation for a gps unit to function properly it requires a strong signal connection between the unit on the ground and multiple satellites in the sky to accurately orient its position city infrastructure such as buildings and tunnels can temporarily block the signal between gps unit receivers and satellites creating areas often referred to as urban canyons with the hguide n580 integrated system honeywells inertial measurement unit technology combines with gps to act as a backup solution which means the loss of gps signal caused by an urban canyon does not result in a complete loss of navigation to learn more about the new hguide n580 solution and honeywells other commercially available navigation technologies please visit the honeywell aerospace product page below
