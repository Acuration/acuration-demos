pivotal to stability predictability to warehouse operations honeywell report shows warehouse automation futureproofing the global economy report identifies three key considerations to help businesses identify and utilize the right automation solutions as they mature along their automation journey july 12 2022 charlotte nc july 12 2022 prnewswire relentless ecommerce trends continue to put tremendous strain on distribution and fulfillment operations worldwide a new honeywell nasdaq hon report reveals oncepredictable consumer demand cycles centered around holidays and peak seasons have given way to a model where any month week or day can be a holiday warehouse automation futureproofing the global economy authored by futurum research examines the importance of automation as an increasingly critical component in helping warehouse and distribution center dc operators meet new escalation points in consumer demand one of the biggest predictors of how a business will thrive in the hypercompetitive ecommerce and omnichannel marketplace is how well it improves its decision making in real time to make deliveries faster and more accurate said keith fisher president of honeywell intelligrated with rising service level agreements dictating order fulfillment process improvements automation can help bring stability predictability and potentially unlock greater efficiency to their operations the analysts at futurum research developed the report after sitting down with a group of industry leaders with deep global experience in warehouse operations automation technologies and systems implementation to hear firsthand of their experiences and thoughts on the future of warehouse automation three recommendations emerged from the interviews as businesses navigate challenges both present and future along their automation journey focus on augmenting and securing not replacing the worker while the concept of a dark warehouse exists on the horizon the reality today is that

while also asking what new tasks or processes might be possible tomorrow invest with a longterm focus for both technologies and partners in a static or slow growth market the application of automation technologies to address specific shortterm needs may make sense however the rapidly growing and evolving market of today requires a much longer focus and a more rigorous framework while warehouses
