the brains of an airliners flight controls into one system and is the next step towards autonomous and urban air mobility vehicles the flight control computer from honeywell adds stability to these revolutionary aircraft designs by driving electric actuators and dynamically adjusting flight surfaces and motors for smoothly following flight paths it reduces turbulence and allows designers to push the limits of aerodynamics eliminating the need for heavy hydraulics control cables or pushrods honeywells technology truly enables these innovative aircraft to fly more safely accelerating a whole new era in what is quickly emerging as a new transportation economy said carl esposito president electronic solutions honeywell aerospace the flight control computer has architectural features derived from honeywells proven and certified existing compact flybywire systems for airplanes and is built to aviation industry certification standards providing the highest levels of availability and integrity honeywells offering features a triplex flight control computer architecture providing multiple backup options and eliminating the risk of relying on one system failure in addition each computer uses lockstep processing meaning it has two processing channels that constantly check each others work these features provide the safest and most reliable operation that will meet the future requirements of transporting passengers in highly populated urban areas dubbed compact flybywire system because the controls are augmented by electronics versus purely manual controls this new compact computer can be held in one hand compared with similar technologies installed on larger aircraft that are roughly the size and weight of a fully loaded suitcase honeywells solution will draw less power cost a fraction of current systems and can be used on multiple aircraft types including more traditional aircraft vehicle designs aircraft designers can use the compact flight control computer
