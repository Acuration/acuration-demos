for contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news honeywell sets new record for quantum computing performance honeywell sets new record for quantum computing performance system model h1 becomes first commercial system to achieve a quantum volume of 512 benchmark honeywell quantum solutions streak of setting new records for quantum volume continues through performance upgrades system model h1 achieved a quantum volume of 512 the highest measured on a commercial quantum computer to date it is the third time in nine months honeywell has set a record for quantum volume on one of its systems the milestone represents a fourfold increase in performance for the system model h1 which set a record when it was released in september 2020 with a quantum volume of 128 this high performance combined with low error midcircuit measurement provides unique capabilities with which quantum algorithm developers can innovate how we did it the system model h1 operations have continued to improve since it was first released the average singlequbit gate fidelity for this milestone was 999918 the average twoqubit gate fidelity was 99763 with fullyconnected qubits and measurement fidelity was 99753 we ran 300 circuits with 20 shots each using standard qv optimization techniques to yield an average of 7682 twoqubit gates per circuit the system model h1 successfully passed the quantum volume 512 benchmark outputting heavy outcomes 7332 of the time which is above the 23 threshold with 9954 confidence the plot above shows the heavy outcomes for honeywell quantum solutions tests of quantum volume and the dates when each test passed all tests are above the 23 threshold to pass the respective quantum volume circles indicate heavy outcome averages and the violin plots show the histogram distributions data colored in blue show system performance results and red show modeled noiseincluded simulation data white markers are the lower 2sigma error bounds the plot above shows the individual heavy outcomes for each quantum volume 512 run the blue line is an average of heavy outcomes and the red line is the lower 2sigma error bar which crosses the 23 threshold after 151 circuits honeywells quantum systems are accessible directly and through ecosystem partner platforms including microsofts azure quantum cambridge quantum computings tket zapata computings orquestra and the strangeworks qc platform in addition to offering highfidelity fully connected qubits our system features a unique combination of midcircuit measurement qubit reuse and conditional logic which enables users to explore new classes of algorithms and to greatly reduce the number of qubits needed for certain algorithms for more information about getting started accessing our system please contact
