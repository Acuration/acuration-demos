portfolio of proven highactivity isomerization and benzene saturation catalysts the unicracking process uses highly effective catalysts unit design and reactor internals to produce higher yields of cleanerburning fuels from a wider range of feedstocks the units fractionation section includes an innovative configuration to more efficiently separate the products reducing capital costs and significantly lowering utilities and operating expense in addition the units heavy polynuclear aromatics management allows the unit to achieve nearly 100percent conversion throughout the entire cycle length together the two processes will significantly enhance hpcls ability to supply gasoline and diesel that meets the indian governments new bharat stagevi clean fuels standard and meets growing
