think youd end up in a job like youre in now cybersecurity did not exist as a focused division when i joined honeywell back in 1998 a network security team was created close to the millennium and has grown exponentially since i joined the team in 2010 when you were a child what did you want to be when you grew up i knew one thing for sure where i work needs to be full of people the more people the better the technology passion was indoctrinated by my father who always wanted an engineer in the family what do you do i help prevent your electricity from stopping or getting interrupted i ensure you can still drink clean water turn the gas on and cook and fill up your cars tank to go see friends and family i make sure bad guys do not harm computer systems at our customers sites who deliver

technology people cultures invites you to be creative and innovative how has honeywell changed since you began working here i have seen the company become more global with more dynamics builtin and

your industry when i think of cybersecurity and the future i see many services and daily routine in our lives becoming easier more decisions will be automated and our lives will be full of virtual assistants the data we use for this will have risks we will be more exposed and the information could be misused more wars will be fought in the cloud without knowing your enemy rather than on the physical battlefield what advice do you have for someone who wants to follow in your footsteps do as many different projects as you can be focused on possibilities and not impossibilities talk to
