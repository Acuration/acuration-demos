according to engineers innovators behind our plastic recycling technology share what they do at home to be conscious consumers and recyclers chris anderle a principal research and development engineer is one of the innovators helping to shape the future of plastics recycling hes a part of the team behind our upcycle process technology relative to conventional incineration and landfilling upcycle technology could result in 90 of waste plastics being recycled when combined with mechanical and other chemical recycling approaches and improved collection and sorting with the technology plastic waste unsuitable for mechanical recycling is broken down into a recycled polymer feedstock which can then be used to manufacture new highquality plastics this differs from mechanical recycling which simply melts down and reshapes plastic in light of innovations like upcycle that have potential to expand packaging and waste plastic circularity anderle said he believes recycling is something that all consumers can be a part of and should take an interest in heres how to improve your recycling habits on a personal level learn your local recycling guidelines start with your local household waste collectors since guidelines can vary based on city and country anderle said that most waste collection companies have lists online that detail what types of plastics or other materials can go in your

stacking items in one another and try to remove lids if you can he added packing containers into other containers before putting them in your recycling bin can make things tricky for people at a recycling plant it can hold up the process anderle said try reducing your plastic usage ruben barajas a research and development engineer and scientist also involved in our upcycle process technology said that on a personal level he tries to limit the singleuse plastics he obtains in the first place barajas said he does this by often avoiding using plastic eating utensils or straws he also takes steps to limit his plastic usage at grocery stores i bring along a large reusable backpack to carry all of my groceries which means that i can cut down on the number of singleuse plastic bags that i have to use he said i still use some plastic bags when i get a bunch of apples i usually use one of the clear plastic bags from the grocery store to hold them but i am thinking of a way to eliminate
