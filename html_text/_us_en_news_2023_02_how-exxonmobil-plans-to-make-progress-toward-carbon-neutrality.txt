neutrality an exxonmobil facility deploying the largest lowcarbon hydrogen project in the world will incorporate honeywell technology to enable the capture and storage of carbon dioxide exxonmobil plans to deploy one of honeywells technologies enabling carbon capture the co 2 fractionation system at its facility in baytown texas the secondlargest refinery in the us based on production the technology is expected to enable exxonmobil to capture about 7 million tons of co 2 per year at the facility the equivalent of the emissions of 15 million cars for one year 1 take a closer look at the details of the project what developed by honeywell uop the co 2 fractionation system will be integrated into the design of exxonmobils new hydrogen production assets the projects potential impact the technologies that make up the co 2 fractionation system could allow exxonmobils baytown facility to capture more than 98 percent of associated carbon dioxide emitted from the hydrogen plant and deliver a lowcarbonintensity hydrogen 2 the carbon dioxide captured in this process will then be sequestered in underground storage by exxonmobil according to exxonmobil the lowcarbon hydrogen ammonia and carbon capture facility is expected to be the largest lowcarbon hydrogen project in the world with a planned startup in 20272028 what else to know about carbon capture carbon capture utilization and storage ccus technologies are designed to capture co 2 from the atmosphere or a source such as an industrial facility running on fossil fuels then stored deep underground or transported to be used in a variety of applications as we move toward a decarbonized world the demand for hydrogen is expected to increase significantly to generate power help buildings operate efficiently and power aircraft that means carbon capture and storage technologies will become even more critical as ccus is one of the two main ways to produce lowcarbon hydrogen how readynow technologies are helping today projects worldwide that use carbon capture technology developed by honeywell have the capacity to capture 40 million tons of co 2 per year 3 learn more read about green hydrogen what is it exactly and how it can advance the global energy transition and explore more about breakthrough technologies developed by honeywell uop engineers contact us 1 based on the epas greenhouse gas equivalency calculator compares nearly 7 million tons of co 2 per year with gasolinepowered passenger vehicles on the road 2 co 2 equivalent emissions is a calculated value based on the combined carbon compounds emitted from the hydrogen production and carbon capture equipment plus the combined carbon compounds in the h2 product 3 includes capacity of deployed honeywell technology membranes and chemical physical solvents in installed projects enabling co 2 capture from gas streams of which 15 million tonnes of the captured co 2 is being utilized for enhanced oil recovery annually energy
