to meet rising demand for sustainable aviation fuel honeywell revolutionizes ethanoltojet fuel technology to meet rising demand for sustainable aviation fuel honeywells new solution represents critical development in the drive to meet 2030 sustainable aviation fuel saf mandates and indias 2070 emission reduction targets developed by engineers at honeywell india technology center the technology provides a costeffective path for producing lower greenhouse gas emission ghg jet fuel from ethanol modular design speeds time to first production 11 october 2022 gurugram october 11 2022 honeywell nasdaq hon today announced a new innovative ethanoltojet fuel etj processing technology that allows producers to convert cornbased cellulosic or sugarbased ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel saf depending on the type of ethanol feedstock used jet fuel produced from honeywells ethanoltojet fuel process can reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 80 on a total lifecycle basis compared to petroleumbased jet fuel 1 development for this technology was undertaken at the honeywell india technology center in gurugram demand for saf continues to grow yet the aviation industry is challenged by limited supplies of traditional saf feedstocks such as vegetable oils animal fats and waste oils ethanol offers producers a widely available economically viable feedstock honeywells ready now technology uses highperformance catalysts and heat management capabilities to maximize production efficiency resulting in a costeffective lower carbon intensity aviation fuel a 2021 lifecycle analysis by the us department of energys doe argonne national laboratory concluded that ethanoltojet fuel conversion combined with other technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration ccus and smart farming practices can result in negative ghg emissions compared to petroleumbased jet fuel 2 honeywell pioneered saf production with its ecofining technology and our new ethanoltojet fuel process builds on that original innovation to support the global aviation sectors efforts to reduce ghg emissions and meet saf production targets with an abundant feedstock like ethanol said barry glickman vice president and general manager honeywell sustainable technology solutions honeywells ethanol tojet process when used as a standalone or when coupled with honeywell carbon capture technology is ready now to provide a pathway to lower carbonintensity saf at cop26 india committed to getting 50 of its energy requirements from renewable sources said ashish gaikwad vice president and general manager honeywell uop india india has already identified biofuels one of the ways to achieve energy security and could look at etj as an enabler to indias 2070 emission reduction targets developed by engineers at honeywell india technology center in gurugram this technology provides the country with an alternative to help reduce reliance on fossil fuels for indias growing aviation sector saf plants using honeywells technology can be modularized off site enabling faster less laborintensive installation compared to job site construction by utilizing honeywells etj technology and an integrated modular construction approach producers can build new saf capacity more than a year faster than is possible with traditional construction approaches petroleum refiners and transportation fuel producers can also benefit from honeywells etj design that is purposebuilt to enable conversion of current or idle facilities into saf production plants potentially maximizing use of exiting sites for saf production to meet the growing market demand in 2021 the biden administration announced its sustainable aviation fuel saf grand challenge for the us aviation fuel supply sector to produce at least three billion gallons of saf per year by 2030 and reduce emissions from aviation by 20 with an eventual goal of meeting 100 of us aviation fuel demand with saf by 2050 also in 2021 the european council released its fit for 55 package which aims to increase the share of sustainable fuels at eu airports from a minimum of 2 in 2025 to at least 63 by 2050 these and other incentives including the inflation reduction act accelerate the need for alternative saf feedstocks to meet demand click here to learn more about honeywells ethanol to jet technology honeywell is committed to
