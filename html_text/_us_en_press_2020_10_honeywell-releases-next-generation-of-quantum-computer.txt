for contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle press media honeywell releases next generation of quantum computer honeywell releases next generation of quantum computer commercial users include merck and dhl accenture launches ongoing collaboration with honeywell on cuttingedge quantum applications october 29 2020 broomfield colo oct 29 2020 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced a breakthrough in the early era of quantum computing with the introduction of its nextgeneration quantum computer the system model h1 the h1 generation of computer features honeywells differentiated quantum chargecoupled device 1 qccd trappedion technology and is strategically designed to be rapidly upgraded throughout its lifetime the newest generation quantum computer from honeywell initially offers 10 fully connected qubits a proven quantum volume of 128 the highest measured in the industry and unique features such as midcircuit measurement and qubit reuse which were made possible through honeywells heritage of precision controls expertise this announcement further affirms the companys commitment to rapidly increase quantum volume by at least an order of magnitude annually for the next five years system model h1 is directly accessible to enterprises via a cloud application programming interface api as well as through microsoft azure quantum and alongside channel partners including zapata computing and cambridge quantum computing access to system model h1 is through a subscription that provides customers access to honeywells most technologically advanced quantum computer on the market honeywells aggressive quantum computing roadmap reflects our commitment to achieving commercial scale for our quantum business our subscriptionbased model provides enterprise customers with access to honeywells most advanced system available said tony uttley president of honeywell quantum solutions honeywells unique methodology enables us to systematically and continuously upgrade the h1 generation of systems through increased qubit count even higher fidelities and unique feature modifications uttley offered an analogy imagine if the streaming service to which you subscribed became twice as good in a few weeks 10 times as good in a few months and thousands of times better in a few quarters he said in addition to the announced h1 computer honeywell confirmed it has already begun integration activities for its future system model h2 generation as well as development activities in support of its h3 generation and beyond honeywells novel trappedion qubits can be uniformly generated with errors better understood compared with alternative qubit technologies that do not use individual atoms these highperformance operations require deep experience across multiple disciplines including atomic physics optics cryogenics lasers magnetics ultrahigh vacuum and precision control systems areas where honeywell has a long heritage of experience and expertise the introduction of the system model h1 is a significant milestone in shaping and accelerating the development of quantum computing and bringing its power to enterprises added uttley weve seen demand skyrocket in 2020 and are thrilled to partner with customers seeking to solve real business problems via quantum computing honeywell is also disclosing the latest enterprise companies with access to its quantum computer that list includes dhl and merck as well as a collaboration with accenture these companies demonstrate the wide range of quantum computing use cases which include pharmaceuticals and logistics as well as honeywells own internal applications in its aerospace and performance materials and technologies businesses honeywells differentiated technology exemplified by the highfidelity quantum operations and fully connected qubits with midcircuit measurement and qubit reuse enables customers to push the frontier of quantum computing applications we believe that addressing tomorrows global logistics challenges requires an unwavering commitment to advancing some of todays most promising technologies and that includes quantum computing by attempting to solve computationally complex problems with honeywell we have taken another step towards exploring improving operational efficiencies and leveraging quantum computings potential to innovate within the logistics industry said justin baird head of innovation asia pacific for dhl customer solutions innovation kam chana director computational platforms at merck said it was illuminating to experience the properties of real quantum hardware firsthand through zapatas orquestra platform seeing one of orquestras native qml algorithms run on honeywells h1 system was an exciting moment for merck in our journey to quantum readiness the combination of orquestras programming environment with quantum hardware opens up quantum computing widely to our data scientists and brings new approaches for development of aiml based models honeywell is also collaborating with accenture on new use cases for honeywells quantum technology at accenture were excited to be working with quantum industry leaders as well as our clients to unlock new value through quantum computing said marc carrelbilliard senior managing director and technology innovation lead at accenture working with honeywell in this rapidlydeveloping space has already yielded new insights and we look forward to exploring ways that the system model h1 can be applied to business challenges across industries in addition jpmorgan chase has continued its collaboration with the honeywell team jpmorgan chase is pleased to continue innovating alongside honeywell and its new system model h1 quantum computer says dr marco pistoia head of research and engineering jpmorgan chase honeywell currently has a crossdisciplinary team of more than 150 scientists engineers software developers and functional professionals dedicated to
