patrick president americas aftermarket honeywell aerospace the information we gleaned from operators shows a less than 1 decline in fiveyear purchase plans so despite the shortterm effects of the

purchase plans for new business jets are down less than one percentage point compared with last years survey among those purchase plans of new business jets over the next five years 30 are expected to occur in the next two years this is 5 percentage points lower than last years survey due mainly to nearterm uncertainty business jet deliveries in 2021 are expected to be up 13 from a covidimpacted

the next five years the longerrange forecast through 2030 projects a 4 to 5 average annual growth rate of deliveries in line with expected worldwide economic recovery this figure is higher than in
