nextgeneration t55 engine for chinook helicopters allnew t55 engine variant provides increased power and reduced fuel consumption june 3 2020 phoenix june 4 2020 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon has entered into an agreement with the us army to demonstrate and fly its upgraded t55 engine on the heavylift twinengine chinook helicopter the new 6000horespower engine is 25 more powerful and consumes 10 less fuel than the current t55 new modifications also make the nextgeneration t55 easier to maintain with lower operating costs and increased readiness for the warfighter the new t55ga714c engine is specifically designed for nextgeneration military operators and will improve the chinook helicopters ability to lift troops and heavy cargo for the us army and national guard because the engine is based closely on the t55 version currently in use almost no airframe changes are required the same intake exhaust and engine airframe mounts are used this provides the army and national guard with a major engine improvement without the need to retrain their maintenance and operational staff the design improvement will be demonstrated as part of the cooperation research and development agreement process with the us army the engine upgrade can be incorporated either by modifying existing engines at overhaul in the us fleet or with new production engines honeywell has spent years designing and developing the t55ga714c engine as part of our commitment to push the t55s power beyond the needs of the chinook helicopter said dave marinick president engines and power systems honeywell aerospace for 60 years weve powered the worlds most premier heavylift helicopter and this latest improvement increases performance while saving important program dollars and maintenance hours as well as increasing mission readiness we are proud of our legacy on the chinook helicopter and we are committed to continuously improve the t55 engine the installation and demonstration of the advanced t55 engine will take place on a ch47f chinook at fort eustis in newport news virginia under the supervision of the us army combat capabilities development command aviation missile center the demonstration
