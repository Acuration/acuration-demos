with fast track automation honeywell expedites development and production of vital vaccines and medical therapies with fast track automation a combination of proprietary technology innovations can significantly reduce developmenttoproduction timescales enabling life sciences companies to deliver critical products faster may 27 2020 houston may 28 2020 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced fast track automation a combination of proprietary technology innovations for the life sciences industry that enables vital vaccines treatments and therapies to move from regulatory approval to full production in as little as two months depending on process requirements the solution incorporates process automation elements that can be configured in a virtual environment then implemented rapidly once a therapy is approved and ready to be produced for public distribution fast track automation is a response to the global covid19 outbreak which has highlighted the need to accelerate delivery of medical solutions and devices to patients by focusing on ensuring more efficient production and testing capabilities along with facilitating strengthened supply chain life sciences manufacturers are leading the race against time to overcome the pandemic through innovative science at the point in time when clinical trials are nearing completion the ability to rapidly pivot and scale up to meet production demand will severely test existing technology infrastructures the most efficient way to ramp up the production of potential therapies is to facilitate development of commercialscale manufacturing earlier while treatments and prevention therapies are still in clinical trials fast track automation has been designed to be used in development applications in as little as two months and then to help manufacturers scale up to full production immediately after the appropriate regulatory approvals are granted honeywell has provided the life sciences industry with consistently innovative advancements in automation technologies systems and services for over 30 years and fast track automation offering is one of our most valuable offerings to date said cynthia pussinen vice president and general manager life sciences honeywell process solutions our solution allows for endtoend manufacturing process and data visualization providing realtime visibility and
