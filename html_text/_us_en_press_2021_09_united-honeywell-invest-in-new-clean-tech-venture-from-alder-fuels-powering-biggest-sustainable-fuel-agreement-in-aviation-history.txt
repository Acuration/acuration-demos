powering biggest sustainable fuel agreement in aviation history united honeywell invest in new clean tech venture from alder fuels powering biggest sustainable fuel agreement in aviation history united agrees to purchase 15 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel saf over 20 years which is one and a half times the size of the rest of the worlds airlines publicly announced saf commitments combined honeywell first pioneered saf production technology and will use its proven development process to partner with alder to commercialize its technology alder to develop firstofitskind lowcarbon crude technology to accelerate largescale saf production september 9 2021 chicago and des plaines ill sept 9 2021 prnewswire united and honeywell today announced a joint multimilliondollar investment in alder fuels a cleantech company that is pioneering firstofitskind technologies for producing sustainable aviation fuel saf at scale by converting abundant biomass such as forest and crop waste into sustainable lowcarbon dropin replacement crude oil that can be used to produce aviation fuel when used together across the fuel lifecycle the alder technologies coupled with honeywells ecofining process could have the ability to produce a carbonnegative fuel at spec with todays jet fuel the goal of the technologies is to produce fuel that is a 100 dropin replacement for petroleum jet fuel as part of the agreement united is committing to purchase 15 billion gallons of saf from alder when produced to uniteds requirements uniteds purchase agreement which is one and a half times the size of the known purchase commitments of all global airlines combined makes this easily the largest publicly announced saf agreement in aviation history uniteds purchase agreement with alder also surpasses the previous record set by the airline in 2015 through its investment in fulcrum bioenergy with its option to purchase up to 900 million gallons of saf since announcing our 100 green commitment in 2020 united has stayed focused on decarbonizing without relying on the use of traditional carbon offsets part of that commitment means increasing saf usage and availability since its the fastest way to reduce emissions across our fleet however to scale saf as quickly as necessary we need to look beyond existing solutions and invest in research and development for new pathways like the one alder is developing said united ceo scott kirby united has come further than any other airline making sustainable travel a reality by using saf to power flights our leadership gives customers confidence that they are flying with an airline that recognizes the responsibility we have to help solve climate change as a pioneer of the saf market with uop ecofining technology our work with united and alder on this new technology will help transform the industry and support the growth of a zerocarbon economy said darius adamczyk honeywell chairman and chief executive officer this solution will not only advance uniteds saf commitment but can help the aviation industry meet its commitments to decouple increases in carbon emissions from growth in passengers according to the us department of energy doe us forestry residues and agricultural residues alone could provide enough biomass energy to generate more than 17 billion gallons of jet fuel and displace 75 of us aviation fuel consumption if the us were to broadly adopt regenerative agricultural practices which capture more carbon in healthier soil compared to traditional methods the us could generate an additional seven billion gallons of saf which would completely replace the uss current fossil jet fuel consumption alders technology and demand for its fuel from the aviation industry create a large new market for biomass from regenerative practices use of this biomass further enables alders production process to be carbon negative over the fuels lifecycle aviation poses one of the greatest technology challenges for addressing climate change and saf has demonstrated the greatest potential however there is insufficient raw material to meet demand said bryan sherbacow ceo of alder fuels and senior advisor to world energy the company that owns and operates the worlds first saf refinery alders technology revolutionizes saf production by enabling use of widely available lowcost and lowcarbon feedstock the industry is now a major step closer to using 100 saf with our dropin fuel that accelerates the global transition to a zerocarbon economy prior to founding alder sherbacow built the worlds first saf refinery utilizing honeywells technology and subsequently contracted with united enabling the airline to become the first globally to use saf in regular operations on a continuous basis since then united has purchased more saf than any other airline and with this agreement now has more than 70 of the airline industrys publicly announced saf commitments alders research is supported by the us defense logistics agency the doe and a partnership with does national renewable energy laboratory nrel focused on developing technology to process organic waste and sustainable nonfood plant material into carbonnegative transportation fuels honeywell innovation established the saf market with its uop ecofining process which is the first technology used to maximize saf production for commercial aviation building on honeywells focus to create sustainable technology honeywell will utilize its expertise and proven process of developing sustainable fuels alongside alder applying proprietary hydroprocessing design to the process to jointly commercialize the technology commercialization is expected by 2025 this announcement is a clear example of how honeywells sustainable technology solutions business can partner with earlystage companies and help them scale faster access customers and advance research and development to help drive sustainability at the global level uniteds joint investment in alder is the latest by united airlines ventures a venture fund launched earlier this year that focuses on startups upcoming technologies and sustainability concepts that will complement uniteds goal of net zero
