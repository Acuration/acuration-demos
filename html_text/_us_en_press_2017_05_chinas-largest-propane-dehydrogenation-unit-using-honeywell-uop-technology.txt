dehydrogenation unit using honeywell uop technology may 3 2017 des plaines ill may 3 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon announced today the successful commissioning and operation of the largest operating singletrain propane dehydrogenation unit in china yantai wanhua polyurethanes group co ltd is using honeywell uops c 3 oleflex process technology to convert propane into 750000 metric tons annually mta of propylene the primary component used for making plastics packaging and synthetic fibers with this unit the global production capacity of oleflex technology is now approximately 68 million mta as chinas largest oleflex unit this represents a significant expansion in the countrys propylene capacity and a big step toward meeting local demand for propylene said mike millard vice president and general manager of honeywell uops process technology and equipment business no other technology works as efficiently and produces as much highquality propylene as the oleflex process historically 70 percent of the worlds propylene was produced from petroleum as a byproduct of making ethylene another component of plastics in recent years ethylene producers increasingly have made ethylene from ethane in natural gas which produces a negligible amount of propylene this shift in ethylene production has caused a propylene supply gap leading to investments in facilities that produce onpurpose propylene using honeywell uop technology china consumes more than 15 percent of the worlds propylene and its demand is growing more than 4 percent per year according to the us energy information administration since 2011 honeywell uops oleflex technology has been chosen for 40 of the worlds 47 new propane and isobutane dehydrogenation projects licensed worldwide honeywell uops c 3 oleflex technology uses catalytic dehydrogenation to reliably convert propane to propylene and is proven to have the lowest cash cost of production and the highest return on investment compared with competing technologies in addition to technology licensing honeywell uop provided the engineering design equipment staff training technical service and catalyst for the project the oleflex unit is part of a large complex that also includes honeywell uop lpg hydrotreating technology a butamer c 4 isomerization unit and psa or pressure swing adsorption units to produce highpurity hydrogen
