with 18000 engineers worldwide and more than 35500 granted or pending patents we celebrate inventions and inventors every day in honor of engineers week meet the people who are making the future possible thea feyereisen senior fellow based minneapolis minn what do you do i help design the displays that pilots use when they fly airplanes i help make flying easier safer and use less fuel us patents 50 which is your favorite patent my favorite patent is my first one interfaces for planning vehicle routes it helps operators plan routes that make it easier to avoid hazardous or other nondesirable areas along their path its my favorite because it is not only my first and officially fulfilled a childhood dream of becoming an inventor but it also helped earn honeywell licensing revenue in the automobile and marine industry hugh wang fellow based buffalo ny what do you do i am responsible for the development of manufacturing technology for new low global warming potential molecules and the improvement of the productivity of processes to make existing molecules i also troubleshoot issues for honeywells fluorine products manufacturing facilities us patents 90 which is your favorite patent its hard to pick just one i am proud of the portfolio of hydrofluoroolefin products manufacturing patents on which i am an inventor these patents include some of the most cost effective and reliable methods of making honeywells 4 th generation low global warming molecules useful in heat transfer foam propellant solvent and other applications mark morris engineer fellow based phoenix az what do you do i support turbine technology planning research development and process improvements to keep honeywell competitive in the gas turbine business pictured above in 1998 when first patent was issued us patents 65 which is your favorite patent gas turbine cooled shroud assembly with hot gas ingestion suppression the invention utilizes a combination of advanced fluid

opportunity to use technology advances to make our products better arun mahasenan principal engineer based golden valley minn what do you do my group works on developing new technologies that provide greater comfort safety security and energy efficiency to building occupants i do research and development of wireless communication technologies for sensing and control applications us patents 35 which is your favorite patent in 2006 we figured out how to enable robust reliable and realtime wireless communication of sensors that use batteries this sensor network can enable monitoring and control of missioncritical applications we came up with a novel approach to timesynchronize nodes in multiple wireless network clusters we were one of the first ones in the industry to commercially deploy such a system in process plants which today is deployed in many process plants across the world paul wacker senior engineering fellow based golden valley minn what do you do i help design products that control a buildings environment keeping occupants comfortable while conserving energy us patents 40 which is your favorite low cost programmable hvac controller having limited memory resources this is a design for an efficient method of implementing a deterministic control engine in the embedded software of a lowcost microcontroller a control engine allows for application developers to create custom control sequences using a graphical user interface no computer programming required culture related content 6 engineers on how community fuels their careers how this
