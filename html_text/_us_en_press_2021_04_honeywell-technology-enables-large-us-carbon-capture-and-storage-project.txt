carbon capture and storage project honeywell uop to support reduction in co2 emissions and production of clean hydrogen energy at wabash valley plant april 12 2021 des plaines iii april 12 2021 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced wabash valley resources llc has selected a range of honeywell uop technologies to capture and sequester up to 165 million tons of carbon dioxide co2 annually and to produce clean hydrogen energy from a repurposed gasification plant in west terre haute ind the project is expected to be one of the largest carbon sequestration initiatives in the united states to date by implementing honeywell uops proven technologies for the capture of co2 and hydrogen purification we will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions said dan williams managing director of wabash valley resources this project will allow for market access to clean hydrogen as well as support the domestic growth of the hydrogen economy adding carbon capture and storage to hydrogen production is an economical solution for many companies looking to make significant progress on their sustainability goals said laura leonard vice president and general manager uop process technologies hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that can provide a lowcarbon solution across almost every industrypetrochemical and refining buildings commercial transportation and power generation customers like wabash trust honeywell uop to provide optimized technology solutions to meet project requirements uop will provide technology licenses basic engineering and specialty equipment including a modular molsiv molecular sieve dehydration unit modular ortloff co2 fractionation unit and polybed pressure swing adsorption psa unit to sequester carbon dioxide and process synthesis gas from the gasification unit the ortloff co2 fractionation technology will produce a highpurity liquid co2 stream while separating a hydrogenrich stream that will be purified by the psa unit the co2 stream will be sent for permanent geological storage while the hydrogen stream can fuel a hydrogen turbine to generate electrical power the hydrogen stream can also be used in chemical synthesis or marketed as a clean transportation fuel as noted in a recent us department of energy hydrogen plan a study by the fuel cell and hydrogen energy association estimates the hydrogen economy can generate as much as 140 billion per year in revenue and create 700000 us jobs by 2030 at projected growth rates this could grow to 750 billion per year in revenue and 34 million jobs by 2050 uops range of solutions for hydrogen purification honeywell h 2 solutions and co2 separation honeywell co 2 solutions can be optimized for any use application the technologies include uop molecular sieve molsiv technology which is used in a wide range of operating conditions in more than 2400 units worldwide molsiv which has been around for more than 60 years can be used for acid gas removal dehydration hydrocarbon removal and desulfurization of various gas and liquid gas streams including syngas natural gas and gas liquids such as propane and butane the ortloff co2 fractionation process which can efficiently remove 80 of the co2 content contained in the syngas stream the remaining co2 is subsequently removed by the psa unit the recovered co2 is produced as a liquid for easy pressurization transportation and sequestration the psa process which uses proprietary uop adsorbents to remove impurities at high pressure from hydrogencontaining process streams producing high purity hydrogen the polybed psa system can also recover and purify hydrogen from ethylene offgas methanol offgas and partialoxidation synthesis gas uop modular systems are skidmounted units including hardware adsorbents control systems and embedded process technology this allows quick and efficient installation to reduce cost and downtime when compared to stickbuilt construction wabash valley resources llc wvr an affiliate of phibro llc acquired a world scale gasification plant in 2016 with plans to convert it to a hydrogen production plant and carbon capture and sequestration project the project was recently selected to receive funding from the department of energy doe as part of the carbon storage program the programs objective is the advancement development and validation of technologies that enable safe costeffective and permanent geologic storage of carbon dioxide honeywell uop wwwuopcom is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology catalysts
