contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news the journey of a return the journey of a return when shoppers take back purchases the items can have a new life march 24 2019 unsure if those shoes run small or whether that sweater looks better in beige or taupe if youre like many online shoppers you might order multiple sizes colors or styles and plan to return what does not fit or work best but the process of returning an item can be a hassle for consumers and retailers retailers are losing millions of dollars by having stranded inventory sit there behind the customer service counter said karen bomber our director of retail strategy technology company optoro gives retailers ways to optimize returned goods they say that most consumers 87 percent prefer to return items in store the optoro software compatible with honeywells mobility edge mobile computers like the ct40 or ct60 prompts an employee processing the return to answer a few questions most notably is the item new based on that information optoros algorithm decides where to route the return to the reverse supply chain to recover optimal value for that item the employee then sends a return on a new journey return to shelf an undamaged new product can be put on the shelf for resale allowing a retailer to profit from a product that may have otherwise sat behind a counter in limbo from the consumer standpoint it helps insure that returned items are there and available for sale karen said return to vendor the return could be broken missing an essential piece or have another issue that the manufacturer of the product needs to address in those cases the retailer may need to send the item back to a vendor or manufacturer remarket another option is remarketing the item on a secondary marketplace optoro has its own remarketing channels blinqcom and bulqcom and can also plug into other secondary marketplaces including amazon ebay and jetcom donate or recycle if the retailer cannot profit from the return then donating the item to charity could be the best option in other situations the product materials could be recycled to create new goods both options help prevent retailers from immediately throwing away returned goods which helps reduce waste in landfills retail related content embracing ais impact on shopping retail in 2023 key considerations for the future of shopping how tractor supply
