nextgeneration respiratory inhalers that use nearzero global warming potential propellant honeywell teams with astrazeneca to develop nextgeneration respiratory inhalers that use nearzero global warming potential propellant nextgeneration inhaler will use honeywells solstice air to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of propellant by up to 999 percent vs current inhaler propellant further demonstrates honeywells commitment to greenhouse gas reduction and support of customers sustainability goals through innovative new products february 22 2022 charlotte nc feb 22 2022 prnewswire honeywell nasdaq hon today announced a commercial partnership with astrazeneca lon azn to develop and bring to market nextgeneration respiratory inhalers that use nearzero global warming potential gwp propellants to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd as many as 384 million people suffer from copd a progressive respiratory disease and 339 million children and adults suffer from asthma 12 many of these patients are currently treated using pressurized metered dose inhalers pmdis that can contribute to the global carbon footprint of respiratory care astrazeneca a global leader in treatment of respiratory diseases is working to incorporate honeywells solstice air hfo1234ze cgmp technology as a medical propellant reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of the pmdis by up to 999 percent when compared to current inhaler propellants solstice air is the only nonflammable near zero gwp propellant available and in clinical development today for pmdis a recently completed phase i clinical trial of the propellant hfo1234ze in a pmdi containing budesonide glycopyrronium formoterol fumarate in healthy adults was positive demonstrating similar safety and tolerability profile and systemic exposure of the active ingredients when compared to breztri aerosphere budesonide glycopyrronium formoterol fumarate astrazeneca expects breztri aerosphere to be the first medicine to transition to the next generation pmdi platform subject to regulatory approval following these positive results from the phase i trial astrazeneca will advance a commercial partnership with honeywell to develop their triplecombination therapy breztri aerosphere using honeywells nearzero gwp propellant technology pascal soriot chief executive officer astrazeneca said we are making great progress on our ambition to be zero carbon across our global operations by the end of 2025 and carbon negative across our entire value chain by 2030 our collaboration with honeywell demonstrates

ultralow gwp close to 1 its the only nextgeneration hfobased propellant not currently subject to quotabased allocation under the recent american innovation and manufacturing aim of 2020 honeywell has invested a billion dollars in research development and new capacity for its solstice technology having anticipated the need for lowergwp solutions to combat climate change more than a decade ago the product line which helps customers lower their greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency without sacrificing endproduct performance includes refrigerants for supermarkets air conditioning for cars and trucks blowing agents for insulation propellants for personal and household care and solvents for cleaning solutions customers utilizing solstice technology have avoided potential release
