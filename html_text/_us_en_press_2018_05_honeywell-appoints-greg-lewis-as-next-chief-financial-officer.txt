with respect to any changes in or abandonment of the proposed separations we identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission this release contains financial measures presented on a nongaap basis honeywells nongaap financial measures used in this release are as follows segment profit on an overall honeywell basis a measure by which we assess operating performance which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in the attached appendix segment margin on an overall honeywell basis which we define as segment profit divided by sales organic sales growth which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following transaction date and impacts from adoption of the new accounting guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that arise solely due to noncomparable accounting treatment of contracts existing in the prior period free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and which we adjust to exclude impact of separation cost and adjustments to the provisional charge related to tax legislation and earnings per share which we adjust to exclude pension marktomarket expenses as well as for other components such as separation costs the provisional charge related to tax legislation and adjustments to such provisional charge if and as noted in the release other than references to reported earnings per share all references to earnings per share in this release are so adjusted the respective tax rates applied when adjusting earnings per share for these items are identified in the reconciliations presented in the attached appendix management believes that when considered together with reported amounts these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends these metrics should be considered in addition to and not as replacements for the most comparable gaap measure refer to the appendix attached to this release for reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures a quantitative reconciliation of reported sales percent change to organic sales percent change has not been provided for forwardlooking measures of organic sales percent change because management cannot reliably predict or estimate without unreasonable effort the fluctuations in global currency markets that impact foreign currency translation nor is it reasonable for management to predict the timing occurrence and impact of acquisition and divestiture transactions all of which could significantly impact our reported sales percent change 1 2 nd quarter eps eps v exclude separation costs and adjustments to the provisional charge related to tax legislation 2 fullyear eps eps v exclude pension

adjustment 4 included in cost of products and services sold selling general and administrative expenses and other incomeexpense certain amounts in the prior year reconciliation have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation including changes made due to the adoption of the accounting standard related to classification of pension and other postretirement benefit costs we define segment profit as operating income excluding stock compensation expense pension and other postretirement service costs and repositioning and other charges we believe these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends a quantitative reconciliation of segment profit on an overall honeywell basis to operating income has not been provided for all forwardlooking measures of segment profit and segment margin included here within management cannot reliably predict or estimate without unreasonable effort the impact and timing on future operating results arising from items excluded from segment profit particularly pension marktomarket expense as it is dependent on macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the return generated on invested pension plan assets the information that is unavailable to provide a quantitative reconciliation could have a significant impact on our reported financial results to the extent quantitative information becomes available without unreasonable effort in the future and closer to the period to which the forwardlooking measures pertain a reconciliation of segment profit to operating income will be included within future filings honeywell international inc reconciliation of eps to eps excluding pension marktomarket expense separation costs and impacts

that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends for forward looking information management cannot reliably predict or estimate without unreasonable effort the pension marktomarket expense as it is dependent on macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the return generated on invested pension plan assets the separation costs given the preliminary nature of the estimates and any adjustments to charges from tax legislation as the charges are provisional we therefore do not include an estimate for the

obligations prior to their maturities this metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity for
