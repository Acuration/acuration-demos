upgrade empowers connected aircraft capabilities in cockpit and cabin october 12 2017 las vegas oct 11 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon has released an upgrade to its popular cnx900 router that allows business aviation operators to reap the benefits of wireless database loading connected aircraft equipped with honeywells primus epic avionics system can now remotely stage their flight navigation databases onto aircraft from honeywells secure server this simple software upgrade alleviates the manual hassle and logistics of getting the database to the aircraft thus enhancing the dataloading experience for operators and maintainers while also giving passengers more flexibility in their connectivity options traditionally operators had to bring equipment onboard or strategically plan missions to be home every time they needed to load a database now with honeywells cnx900 router the database can be stored on the cnx900 over wifi or cellular remotely anywhere in the world and customers can easily initiate loading of database said john peterson senior director godirect connectivity and flight support services these types of aircraft upgrades demonstrate our commitment to deliver advanced services in the cabin and cockpit that help business aviation operators enjoy significant time and cost savings today aircraft in a hangar need to physically connect a laptop to a data loader to transfer their databases that transfer also involves logistics such as preparing databases onto media that need to be carried to the aircraft prior to commencing loading activities now operators can save the time normally spent setting up equipment and scheduling flights around database loading in addition they can save the thousands of dollars needed to fly a maintenance crew to a site if dataloading equipment is unexpectedly required offering one of the most advanced routing software application suites available today honeywells cnx900 cabin network router provides a reliable consistent and secure inflight wireless connection while also enabling business aviation operators and passengers to control their costs with this new feature honeywell is the only hardware provider
