turbogenerator will power hybridelectric aircraft run on biofuel new system to combine flightproven auxiliary power unit with highefficiency generator march 8 2021 phoenix march 8 2021 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon announced it is developing a power source for hybridelectric aircraft planned for demonstration later this year at 280 pounds the honeywell 1megawatt generator weighs about the same as a motor scooter but delivers enough energy to power an entire neighborhood block this generator will be combined with the honeywell hgt1700 auxiliary power unit currently flown on every airbus a350 xwb to form a turbogenerator 25 times more powerful than the version the company unveiled in 2019 the new turbogenerator from honeywell will be able to run on aviation biofuel including honeywell green jet fuel which is chemically similar to fossil fuel but made from more sustainable alternatives as well as conventional jet fuel and diesel honeywells turbogenerator can be used to operate highpower electric motors or charge batteries and can satisfy missions from heavylift cargo drones to air taxis or commuter aircraft the first demonstration of this turbogenerator system will occur in the third quarter of 2021 with ongoing development and qualification to follow there is an inherent need for electric and hybridelectric power as the urban air mobility segment takes shape and unmanned aerial vehicles enter service said stephane fymat vice president and general manager for unmanned aerial systems and urban air mobility at honeywell aerospace our turbogenerators provide a safe lightweight package to serve these burgeoning segments and were designing our solutions to meet the unique needs of customers developing aerial vehicles of the future traditionally aircraft use fuelburning engines to mechanically turn rotors propellers or fans many new designs however use a distributed electric propulsion architecture in which many electric motors can be tilted or turned off for vertical takeoff and horizontal flight a honeywell turbogenerator can provide electric power for multiple electric motors anywhere on an aircraft honeywells unrivaled legacy in the manufacturing of auxiliary power units and larger gas turbine engines gives us the ability to create unique power systems for future vehicles said taylor alberstadt senior director of power systems business development at honeywell aerospace we think the future of aviation will include many new types of propulsion and power systems and honeywell is prepared to lead the way in their development in december honeywell signed a memorandum of understanding with british startup faradair aerospace to collaborate on systems and a turbogeneration unit that will run on sustainable aviation fuel to power faradairs bio electric hybrid aircraft beha faradair intends to deliver 300 hybridelectric behas into service by 2030 of which 150 will be in a firefighting configuration honeywell is in advanced discussions with several other potential turbogenerator customers working to help define power requirements based on mission profiles required by various manufacturers honeywell unveiled its first turbogenerator for urban air mobility uam at the 2019 hai heliexpo in atlanta it combined honeywells hts900 turboshaft engine with two 200kilowatt generators since then the company continues to grow its role in the uam segment highlighted by advancements in electric and hybridelectric propulsion systems honeywell is a major player in the emerging uam segment offering a full line of avionics propulsion and operational systemsall tailored for piloted and autonomous vertical takeoff and landing uam and cargo vehicles honeywell also offers aerospace integration and certification expertise for enabling the commercialization of these vehicles honeywell pioneered the sustainable aviation fuel market with its uop ecofining process honeywell green jet fuel produced by this process is
