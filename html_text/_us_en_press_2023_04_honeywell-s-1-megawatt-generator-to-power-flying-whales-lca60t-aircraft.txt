flying whales lca60t aircraft the most powerful generator for aviation will provide compact and efficient power aboard the new hybridelectric airship april 5 2023 phoenix april 5 2023 prnewswire honeywells nasdaq hon 1megawatt generator has been selected by flying whales quebec to supply power for its new hybridelectric airship the lca60t both companies signed a contract for the integration and supply of honeywells 1megawatt generator based in france and canada flying whales is developing the 200meterlong vertical takeoff and landing vtol aircraft for the heavy load transport market the proven highpower density and efficiency of honeywells 1megawatt generator system allows it to integrate smoothly with propulsion and operational systems for piloted or autonomous aircraft it can also be used as a 1megawatt motor without modifications for electric propulsion engines aboard the lca60t the 1megawatt generator will create a hybrid propulsion system by being integrated with a gearbox and a turbine that uses jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel saf the honeywell generator will supply electrical power to the electric engines thereby creating a more efficient and sustainable form of travel similar to the way hybridelectric automobiles function honeywells 1megwatt generator is a perfect fit for a transformational aircraft like the lca60t said dave marinick president engines power systems honeywell aerospace our generator is four times as powerful as any other generator flying today and at unmatched power density we believe in creating a more sustainable future for aviation and our work with flying whales is helping bring that future to life the lca60t is a heavyduty rigid airship with a 60tonne payload capacity it is 200 meters m long with a 96m by 8m by 7m high cargo bay supported by 10 nonpressurized helium cells it is powered by a 4megawatt hybrid electric propulsion chain like all aircraft the lca60t will be certified to ensure maximum operating safety originally designed to transport renewable wood resources from hardtoaccess areas lca60ts unique stationary hovering design for loading and unloading is ideal for overcoming numerous logistical and technical problems in remote areas and it has a remarkably low environmental footprint this solution overcomes all ground constraints to transport large and heavy loads at a low cost flying whales intends to fly the first lca60t in 2025 and plans to manufacture 150 aircraft in the next 10 years we are pleased and proud to welcome honeywell which joins us in developing the next generation of propulsion systems this important collaboration completes and strengthens our canadian consortium to develop and manufacture our highpower turbogenerator today we are building in canada the expertise and technological advancements for tomorrows aeronautics said arnaud thioulouse chief executive officer of flying whales quebec the signing of this contract with honeywell one of the worlds leading aerospace engineering companies signals great technological advances in highpower electrical systems and demonstrates the key role of flying whales product to trigger innovation honeywells 1megawatt generator will be integrated within the turbogenerator of the hybrid electric propulsion system with this collaboration not only are we equipping the lca60t with the best technical solution for highpower onboard requirements we are paving the way for a revolution in air transport said vincent guibout vice chief executive officer of flying whales in may 2022 honeywell announced that the 1megawatt generator had successfully completed its first round of testing since then subsequent tests have shown even more powerful results during the latest round of testing late in 2022 the megawatt generator operated at 106 mva 1mw power levels the test demonstration ran continuously at 1000 kilowatts highlighting the megawatt generators highpower density 8kwkg and efficiency 97 which are key enablers in hybridelectric propulsion for both aerospace and ground applications about honeywell honeywell aerospace products and services are found on virtually every commercial defense and space
