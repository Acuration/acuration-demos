partner to advance lower carbon hydrogen solutions december 15 2022 london and des plaines ill dec 15 2022 prnewswire honeywell and johnson matthey jm today announced they will work together to deploy low carbon 1 hydrogen solutions the companies will offer jms innovative lch technology coupled with honeywells leading carbon capture technology to produce lower carbon intensity hydrogen blue hydrogen at scale ready to be deployed today this offering will provide project developers a new option for producing clean hydrogen the demand for hydrogen solutions is on the rise with public policies and funding mechanisms being put in place to encourage investment an example is the us inflation reduction act ira which commits billions in production tax incentives for clean hydrogen producers with the evolving legislative environment an integrated solution was identified with low process carbon intensity as a key target according to jm honeywell uop calculations the result is a solution which will enable direct process emissions to be less than 01 kgco 2 kgh 2 by capturing carbon rates above 99 2 this provides eligibility for production tax credits within the ira meaning projects can access the support they need to be deployed rapidly this relationship also builds on the collaboration recently announced at the european refining technology conference in berlin where jm is integrating differentiated honeywell uop technologies into its cleanpace offering for decarbonising existing synthesis syngas gas plants honeywells advanced solvent carbon dioxide co 2 capture and hydrogen solutions allow for co 2 to be captured transported and stored at a lower cost through greater efficiency while allowing for smaller equipment and lower capital operational expenses needed to run the plant compared to existing technologies 3 alberto giovanzana chief commerical officer of catalyst technologies at johnson matthey said by joining complementary technology elements we will provide customers with a costeffective approach that will enable meaningful reductions in emissions compared to conventional technology as we mentioned in our strategy review earlier in the year catalyst technologies aim to expand our offering through new strategic partnerships integrating them with adjacent technologies this is an exciting first step and we look forward to working with honeywell on expanding our offering to include other sustainable technologies in the fuel and chemical spaces industries need to quicken their pace to reduce their emissions in order to meet their carbon reduction targets said barry glickman vice president and general manager honeywell sustainable technology solutions this is accelerating the demand for clean hydrogen which is expected to grow up to sevenfold by 2050 collaborations like the one between honeywell and johnson matthey across the clean hydrogen value chain are essential to accelerating the energy transition and helping to meet
