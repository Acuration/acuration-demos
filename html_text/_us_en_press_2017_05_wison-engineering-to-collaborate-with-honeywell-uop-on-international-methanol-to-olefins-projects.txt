chinas wison engineering ltd to jointly provide methanoltoolefin mto technologies and engineering procurement and construction epc services to customers outside of china honeywell uops advanced mto technology converts methanol from coal or natural gas into the olefins that form the basis for many types of plastic resins films and fibers it is a rapidly growing technology in regions rich in coal or natural gas but poor in crude oil and that have high demand for plastics as one of the leading chemical epc service providers in china wison engineering is developing opportunities for the mto technology particularly in countries included in chinas belt and road initiative covering the historic trading route that stretches from china through central asia to western europe the agreement combines honeywell uops advanced process technologies with wisons strong epc service capability allowing them to help customers further improve olefin production capacity while reducing energy consumption and production costs the belt and road initiative promises to raise the level of connectivity cooperation and trade between dozens of nations that have traded with china for thousands of years said rebecca liebert president and ceo of honeywell uop honeywell is working with chinas leading enterprises to bring economic development to these countries through its broad clean energy and chemicals technologies we are excited to work with honeywell uop to bring the advanced mto technology to customers in countries that traditionally have traded with china for centuries said li yansheng

chemicals mto technology allows countries and regions that are rich in coal or natural gas to costeffectively and efficiently convert these resources into valuable petrochemicals with high yield at the lowest cost of production and lowest catalyst consumption since 2011 honeywell uop has announced nine licenses for mto technology in china wison was the first manufacturer that licensed honeywell uop advanced mto technology and it has been the epc for seven of the uop advanced mto units in china and the licensor for the olefins recovery section of these mto units honeywell uops advanced mto process converts methanol from coal and natural gas into ethylene and propylene at the heart of the technology are uops proprietary catalysts which make it possible to efficiently adjust the ratio of propylene and ethylene produced so operators can most effectively meet demand for those products in addition the advanced mto process offers the lowest operating cost quick and efficient startup and
