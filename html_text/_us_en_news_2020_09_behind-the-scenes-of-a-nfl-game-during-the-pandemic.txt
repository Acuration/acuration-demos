with changes in place to protect them touchdown on sunday october 4 the carolina panthers will host a home game with fans in the stands it will be the first inperson game played at bank of america stadium in charlotte since the coronavirus pandemic grinded sporting events to a halt last spring the excitement of the game will be the same but its going to look a little different said eddie levins director of security and infection control officer for the panthers for example the stadium has a capacity of about 74000 on sunday only 7 5200 will attend but the panthers plan to give those fans the experience they expect when we win people feel better eddie said on the football side were doing everything we can possibly do to make sure were putting the best team on the field weve taken the same approach to our health and safety plan to ensure that the game day experience is enjoyable and as safe as possible were excited and prepared to welcome fans back to the stadium heres a behindthescenes look at what changes to expect at the game pregame the moment fans get their tickets they must acknowledge the safety protocols in place and their responsibilities as fans eddie said entrance lines to the stadium will start in the street to help space people out fans will also have their temperature checked before they can enter and be given personal protective equipment if they need it that includes the honeywell safety pack that contains a mask sanitizer and wipes there also will be sanitizer throughout the building meanwhile eddie describes changes to the concourse as a miniature highway once fans are screened they immediately head to the right and stay in that lane as they head to their seats that could mean they pass their section initially but there will be a turning point to go back to it during the game fans will be spaced out in pods that will include groups of up to five people who can sit together but distanced from other pods in the stands once fans find their seats if they are not comfortable with the spacing then there can be opportunities to relocate them even concessions will be different not as many concession areas will be open and there will be lines with markers to help encourage distancing there will also be a lot more grabandgo offerings eddie said meanwhile inside restrooms some facilities will be closed off to ensure distancing and all high touchpoints throughout the entire stadium will be cleaned multiple times during the game the team must be protected as well the locker room will be sanitized three times throughout the game to make sure the players are safe eddie said any opportunity we can to make sure their environment is as clean as possible throughout the event is being done postgame when the score is final and fans are ready to head home the highway direction will reverse announcements of that change will begin in the third quarter to inform fans of how they will exit the stadium people will leave from the closest gate to them that will ensure people avoid being facetoface while inside the building all images courtesy of the carolina panthers covid19 building technologies safety related content the future is
