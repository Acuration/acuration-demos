usedaircraft market environment coupled with the entry into service of many new business jet platforms will lead to higher deliveries in 2019 after a virtually flat year in 2018 said bill kircos vice president global marketing honeywell aerospace we are excited about the used market and about new and innovative aircraft models that will not only drive solid growth in 2019 and 2020 but also have a significant impact on new business jet purchases in the midterm and long term key findings in the 2018 honeywell global outlook include operators plan to make new jet purchases equivalent to about 20 percent of their fleets over the next five years as replacements or additions to their current fleet an increase of 1 percentage point compared with the 2017 survey results of the total purchase plans for new business jets 14 percent are expected to occur by the end of 2019 while 16 percent and 24 percent are scheduled for 2020 and 2021 respectively operators continue to focus on largercabin aircraft classes ranging from the super midsize through ultralong range which are expected to account for more than 87 percent of all expenditures of new business jets in the next five years the longerrange forecast through 2028 projects a 3 to 4 percent average annual growth rate as new models improved economic performance and anticipated favorable exchange rates for international customers

results based on the best survey results in the past five years europes share of estimated global fiveyear demand has increased to 16 percent in the 2018 survey a comparison of the planned timing for european purchases indicates a cautious approach to timing the replacement or expansion of the fleets with new acquisitions only 26 percent of new jet purchases are expected in the first two years of the survey while more than 45 percent are scheduled for 2022 and beyond latin america purchase plans are down 7 percentage points when compared with last year higher purchase plans in brazil are
