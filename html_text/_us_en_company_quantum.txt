computing company contact us quantum computing will revolutionize the way we work thats why weve spent more than a decade focused on ways to not only help architect this massive expansion of computational power and problem solving but accelerate it too as a leading technology company we will shape the adoption and integration of quantum information systems into the industries we serve pharmaceuticals improve the efficiency of earlyphase drug design and discovery chemicals accelerate development of new chemicals finance reduce risk through improved portfolio insight aerospace defense develop new aircraft materials and military technology oil gas optimize production and expedite exploration data center accelerate machine learning and analysis of large data sets manufacturing gain visibility into design and production limitations telecommunication optimize antenna efficiency and bandwidth utilization view more our quantum technology enables highquality qubits defined in nature by their atomic structure our trappedion qubits can be uniformly manufactured and controlled more easily and quickly compared to alternative qubit technologies that do not directly use atoms this is why we use the term natures qubit for our systems our qubits are all identical and defectfree previous next capability high fidelity and high qubit count with error rates at the leadingedge of industry capability reconfigurability dynamic qubits that can be rearranged and interacted to improve algorithm opportunities robustness a century of control systems excellence for precise and stable operation why honeywell our approach stems from our heritage after more than 130 years of innovation our strengths in science engineering and research along with our domain and software expertise allow us to offer our partners and customers a competitive edge trappedion quantum computers use numerous individual charged atoms ions to hold quantum information our systems use electromagnetic fields to hold trap each ion so it can be manipulated and encoded using microwave signals and lasers the complexity of these control systems is aligned to our expertise because weve been building them for decades as a leader in hardware software and intuitive user interfaces we have the endtoend capabilities necessary to design build and integrate critical subsystems and components to facilitate trappedion technology quantum solutions honeywell sets another record for quantum computing performance quantum solutions quantum milestone we can now detect and correct quantum errors in real time quantum solutions how quantum computing can help nippon steel improve scheduling at plants previous next see all quantum stories scientific papers our research
