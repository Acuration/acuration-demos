uop efining technology for new class of sustainable aviation fuel honeywell uop efining can reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 88 compared to conventional jet fuel 1 hif global to deploy honeywell technology at its second us efuels facility with potential capacity to decarbonize over 12 billion air passenger miles per year 2 may 10 2023 charlotte nc may 10 2023 prnewswire honeywell nasdaq hon today announced its innovative new uop efining technology a readynow solution for producing lowcarbon sustainable aviation fuel saf hif global the worlds leading efuels company intends to deploy the new technology to produce esaf at its second us efuels facility efuels also known as electrofuels are a class of synthetic fuels that can replace conventionally produced fossil fuels efuels combine green hydrogen ie hydrogen produced in electrolyzers from renewable energy and water and carbon dioxide co 2 to produce emethanol which can then be converted to a wide range of sustainable fuels including esaf egasoline and ediesel honeywells uop efining is a methanol to jet fuel mtj processing technology that can convert emethanol to esaf reliably and at scale the technology is efficient resulting in highyield esaf production at a lower cost relative to comparable technologies honeywell uop efining can reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 88 compared to conventional jet fuel 1 when blended with conventional jet fuel esaf is a dropin replacement fuel that requires no changes to aircraft technology or fuel infrastructure as a leader in renewable fuel technology honeywell recognizes that creating technologies that use new feedstocks is vital to longterm decarbonization of the aviation sector said lucian boldea president and ceo of honeywell performance materials and technologies the ability to use readily abundant co 2 to produce saf is a transformational opportunity for this market adding uop efining to our existing ecofining and ethanol to jet technologies honeywell now offers multiple routes to market to meet the rapidly growing demand for renewable fuels including saf united strongly supports the development of new technologies that can help bring additional quantities of saf to market said united airlines ventures president michael leskinen using green h 2 and co 2 to produce esaf has the potential to dramatically increase the volume of saf required to enable the aviation industry to reach its decarbonization goals in a timelier manner united is proud to be the first airline to use saf in regular operations and increasing our saf consumption is essential to meeting our commitment to reach netzero carbon emissions by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets hif global is the first customer to sign a commercial agreement for the production of esaf using honeywell uop efining hif expects to deploy the solution at its second commercialscale efuels facility in the us the hif esaf project is expected to be the worlds largest esaf facility recycling approximately 2 million tons of captured co 2 to make approximately 11000 barrels per day of esaf by 2030 renato pereira ceo of hif usa added honeywell and hif global together will transform recycled co 2 into a useful feedstock to replace fossil fuels in the very hard to abate aviation sector at hif global we view honeywells uop efining technology as the new frontier in sustainable aviation fuels and we look forward to deploying it to decarbonize over 12 billion air passenger miles per year 2 demand for saf continues to grow in 2021 the biden administration announced its sustainable aviation fuel grand challenge for the us aviation fuel supply sector to produce at least three billion gallons of saf per year by 2030 and reduce emissions from aviation by 20 with an eventual goal of meeting 100 of us aviation fuel demand with saf by 2050 the european council released its refueleu aviation rules as part of the fit for 55 package which aim to increase the share of sustainable fuels at eu airports from a minimum of 2 in 2025 to 70 by 2050 with an additional subtarget for esaf of 12 by 2030 and 35 in 2050 these and other incentives including the inflation reduction act are intended to accelerate commercialization of technologies like honeywell uop efining to help meet the growing demand for saf honeywells uop efining technology offers a highly integrated design that can process flexible feedstocks using commercially proven processes resulting in operational reliability minimized capital expenditures and low energy intensity honeywells efining is the latest technology in a line of offerings that are driving the decarbonization of the aviation sector the company offers multiple routes to market using a variety of feedstocks including ecofining technology which uses fats oils and greases and the recently launched ethanol to jet technology honeywell is committed to achieving carbon neutrality in its operations and facilities by 2035 this commitment builds on the companys track record of sharply reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of its operations and facilities as well as its decadeslong history of innovation to help its customers meet their environmental and social goals about 60 of honeywells new product introduction research and development investment is directed toward products that improve
