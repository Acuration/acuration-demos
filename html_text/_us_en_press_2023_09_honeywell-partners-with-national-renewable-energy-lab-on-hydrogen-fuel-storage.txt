renewable energy lab on hydrogen fuel storage honeywell will collaborate with nrel to scale hydrogen fuel storage solutions for uncrewed aerial vehicles september 12 2023 phoenix sept 12 2023 prnewswire honeywell nasdaq hon announced today that it has partnered with the us department of energys does national renewable energy laboratory nrel on a yearlong collaboration to prototype and support the commercialization of a cartridgebased hydrogen fuel storage solution for uncrewed aerial vehicles uavs honeywell will provide technological expertise testing for fuel cartridge technology supply chain support prototyping and fuel cell evaluation to qualify for the fuel additives for solid hydrogen flash carriers in electric aviation project the flash project will mature a new hydrogen carrier technology developed at nrel as part of the hymarc hydrogen materials advanced research consortium project the program is funded by a partnership of the does hydrogen and fuel cell technologies office nrel and honeywell electric uavs are seeing rapid adoption in industrial applications such as surveying infrastructure inspection and security many of these applications previously required inefficient groundbased vehicles or hazardous use of piloted helicopters for shortrange applications uavs have the potential to offer greater efficiency reliability and precision compared with conventional combustiondriven aircraft for longrange and heavypayload applications however batterypowered electric uavs today fall short the nrel and honeywell collaboration seeks to prove that hydrogen can help address these longerduration highpayload challenges todays longrange drones are typically powered by internal combustion engines while they provide the required range that batterypowered electric uavs lack these engines have issues with excessive noise vibration and emissions including carbon emissions said katherine hurst nrel senior scientist and group manager this is an exciting opportunity to demonstrate the performance of hydrogen storage materials that we developed in our laboratory together with honeywell to fuel a reallife flying vehicle this is a dream project for a national lab researcher said steve christensen one of the nrel leads on the project proposal honeywell has already built and tested devices that can use our materials giving us the chance to drop our technology directly into their systems and move this promising drone fuel toward commercialization through collaborative research and development we and our partners at doe are very excited at this opportunity to see does support of hydrogen technologies result in a market application this partnership with nrel is the latest example of how honeywell is driving the future of sustainable aviation said dave shilliday vice president and general manager urban air mobility and uncrewed aerial systems honeywell aerospace hydrogen can offer significant advantages for electric vertical takeoff and landing systems in terms of endurance and range additionally using hydrogen as a power source can also significantly expand the possibilities of uavs beyond the limitations posed by batteryelectric powertrains honeywell will work with nrel to develop the necessary hydrogenrelated technology to contribute to the further growth of the industry the flash project seeks to deliver an alternative approach in which efficient and longlasting hydrogen storage is coupled to a fuel cell that converts hydrogen to electricity to power electric uav flight the resulting system will enable longrange flights but without the noise and tailpipe emissions of combustion engines it will also enable sensitive drone applications like atmospheric monitoring where exhaust gases and rumbling engines would reduce performance the flash project is focused on a solid material that can rapidly release hydrogen gas for use by the fuel cell the material has a high hydrogen capacity and can operate at low temperatures approximately 100c this class of materials is highly versatile to industrial hydrogen delivery requirements about honeywell honeywell aerospace products and services
