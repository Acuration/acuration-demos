hood from honeywell protects firefighters against hazardous substances april 18 2017 dayton ohio april 18 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon a leading supplier of protective gear for firefighters and other emergency responders has developed a new hood to better protect firefighters from the longterm health threats of hazardous substances produced when todays building materials burn honeywells new life guard hood features an innovative design and fabrics that provide better blocking protection against hazardous particulates and toxins compared with traditional firefighter hoods it also features a lighter roomier fit that integrates with a firefighters selfcontained breathing apparatus scba and other turnout gear the hood was developed by honeywell first responder whose products ranging from helmets to boots to respiratory gear are used by 80 percent of the 20 largest municipal fire departments in north america fighting fires is dangerous enough but the added risk posed by hazardous substances in smoke means we need to do more to protect the men and women who put their lives on the line every day said ken schmidt vice president and general manager of honeywell first responder which provides headtotoe protective gear for fire fighters and first responders today the most permeable piece of gear firefighters wear is their hood we worked with fire chiefs and firefighters to develop our new life guard hood which blocks the particulates and toxins firefighters encounter in both air and water to help safeguard their longterm health there were more than 500000 structure fires in the united states in 2015 and new building materials make those fires even more dangerous to firefighters longterm health modern synthetic products can release hazardous particulates lethal gases and toxins when burned and studies show that the skin and glands of the neck and face are especially prone to absorbing toxins in addition studies show that several types of cancer are occurring at higher rates among firefighters than the general population according to the firefighters cancer support network which provides education and support to first responders when training first responders around the country we receive many questions about how firefighters can protect themselves better from the toxins that are present in fire smoke said jason krusen president of the fire smoke coalition which provides training to firefighters and first responders on the longterm health consequences of fire smoke hoods such as life guard go a long way toward protecting responders
