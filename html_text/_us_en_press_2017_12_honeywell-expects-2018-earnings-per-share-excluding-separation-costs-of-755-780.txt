occurrence and impact of acquisition and divestiture transactions all of which could significantly impact our reported sales percent change in addition forwardlooking quantitative reconciliations herein exclude separation costs because management can not reliably predict or precisely estimate without unreasonable effort those costs given the preliminary nature of the estimates a reconciliation of earnings per share excluding separation costs and pension marktomarket has not been included because management cannot reliably predict or estimate without unreasonable effort the pension marktomarket expense as it is dependent on macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the return generated on invested pension plan assets and the separation costs are given the preliminary nature of the estimates based on economic and industry conditions future developments and other relevant factors these assumptions are subject to change 2018 outlook press release final pr nongaap
