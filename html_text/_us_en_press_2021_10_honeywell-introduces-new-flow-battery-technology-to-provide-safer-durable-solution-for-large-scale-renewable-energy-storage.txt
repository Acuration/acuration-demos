solution for largescale renewable energy storage honeywell introduces new flow battery technology to provide safer durable solution for largescale renewable energy storage nonflammable flow battery to be field tested at duke energys mount holly nc facility for largescale deployment for diverse energy storage solutions sustainable solution uses wind and solar to reduce carbon emissions and lower costs october 26 2021 des plaines ill oct 26 2021 prnewswire honeywell nasdaq hon today announced a new flow battery technology that works with renewable generation sources such as wind and solar to meet the demand for sustainable energy storage the new flow battery uses a safe nonflammable electrolyte that converts chemical energy to electricity to store energy for later use while meeting the environmental longevity and safety objectives of utilities honeywells new technology delivers greater flexibility and extended duration for utilities the battery stores energy that can be used when wind and solar are absent in the event of power outages and when power grids are at capacity it can store and discharge electricity for up to 12 hours exceeding the duration of lithiumion batteries which can only discharge up to 4 hours the battery is designed with recyclable components and does not degrade over time it maintains system performance providing a reliable and costefficient system for 20 years the flow battery technology will be tested by duke energy at its emerging technology and innovation center in mount holly nc the company has more than a decade of experience testing various battery chemistries and has deployed numerous largescale energy storage projects across the country honeywell will deliver a 400kilowatthour kwh unit to duke energys facility in mount holly in 2022 if the battery is deployed at scale it will reduce the use of duke energys fossilfuel power plants by utilizing solar and wind these renewable generation sources are increasingly cost competitive versus traditional fossil fuels and represent over 70 of new power generation honeywell aims to deploy a utilityscale pilot project of 60megawatthours starting in 2023 with this flow battery honeywell has developed an innovative energy storage technology to answer upcoming energy storage needs beyond the current technologies available on the market said ben owens vice president and general manager honeywell sustainable technology solutions as utilities and corporations seek costeffective alternatives to coalfired plants with longduration energy storage solutions they are switching to renewable energy targets that work around the clock to reduce carbon emissions by partnering with duke we can implement this innovate energy storage technology at scale and bring to market a revolutionary flow battery to meet growing energy storage demands while assisting companies in meeting their carbon neutral goals duke energy is executing an aggressive clean energy strategy with goals of a 50 percent reduction of carbon emissions versus 2005 levels by 2030 and netzero carbon emissions by 2050 duke energy has followed flow battery technology for a number of years and is interested in the advancements honeywell is pursuing said tom fenimore director smart grid emerging technology and operations our emerging technology and innovation center is an ideal proving ground to study this technology over the next five years duke energy plans to install almost 400 megawatts of battery storage capacity in our service territory we have a keen interest in breakthrough technologies industry data states that the long duration energy storage market will grow to 137b by 2030 and require 115 gigawatts gw of energy storage to support the implementation of wind and solar capacity the honeywell flow battery can also be combined with honeywells unified system for process business and asset management experion pks and its enterprise performance management solution honeywell forge for remote monitoring the combination of technologies and renewable energy generation sources will provide a complete integrated energy storage solution for utilities and independent power producers to meet netzero carbon goals the overall system will also establish honeywell as one of the first vertically integrated endtoend energy storage solution providers from battery manufacturing to integration
