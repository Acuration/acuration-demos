honeywell shares tips to help keep indoor air safer when outdoor air quality reaches harmful levels from wildfire smoke to air pollutionridden cities buildings must focus on healthier indoor air quality amidst outdoor air crisis fueled by climate change july 20 2023 atlanta july 20 2023 honeywell nasdaq hon today released strategies to keep indoor air quality iaq in buildings safer when the outdoor air index reaches unhealthy levels according to the epa i exposure to fine particle pollution can cause respiratory and cardiovascular health issues recent outdoor air pollution events including wildfire smoke are prompting health officials to advise staying indoors however indoor air pollutants can be two to five times worse than outdoor air ii which is often offset by bringing in outdoor air when fresh outdoor air ventilation is not available to improve indoor air quality building owners should take extra precautions when the outdoor air index reaches unhealthy levels it is advisable to avoid introducing external air indoors the main concern then becomes ensuring the maintenance of healthy indoor air when the option to bring in fresh air is not available said manish sharma vice president and chief product officer of honeywell connected buildings to promote better air quality in situations like these buildings should consider utilizing automated and sophisticated sensing filtration air purification and air circulation solutions the question then arises how many buildings can presently claim to possess such important capabilities at times like this intelligent and advanced technology becomes critical honeywell shares these tips for how to keep iaq safer for occupants tip 1 continually assess and communicate iaq building owners should utilize iaq sensors to monitor co2 tvoc temperature relative humidity and pm25 iii an extremely dangerous fine particulate matter that can travel deeply into the respiratory tract sensors help analyze data track trends and alert building managers when indoor air is not safe once a baseline for a buildings health is established facility managers can integrate their buildings heating ventilation and airconditioning hvac system with the iaq sensors to continually monitor air quality detect contaminants and clean the air automatically building owners should also consider communicating to occupants the buildings iaq levels according to the 2023 honeywell healthy buildings survey iv data 82 of office workers want to be informed about their buildings iaq often or sometimes tip 2 rethink ventilation ventilation is an important factor in maintaining healthy iaq levels and thermal comfort as it freshens up the air inside buildings and dilutes the concentration of harmful particles while the simplest cheapest and most traditional way to improve ventilation is to open a window that is not always a viable option especially if the air outside is more polluted than that inside to keep air clean building owners can use mechanical ventilation devices such as fans that vent to the outdoors or portable air cleaners which may be particularly helpful when ventilation with outdoor polluted air is not possible without compromising indoor comfort or health buildings can also tap into the buildings hvac system to help maintain safer iaq levels through adequate ventilation tip 3 improve filtration and purification one of the most effective ways to improve iaq is to clean existing indoor air especially when outdoor air ventilation is limited building owners can utilize filtration and purification technologies to eliminate the contaminants from a buildings air supply for example hepa or high efficiency particulate air filters can capture particulates of 001 micron and greater v with an extraordinary efficiency by diffusion and interception mechanisms pressurization technologies control the movement of air contaminants within a building and lead to improved iaq control of air pressure both positive and negative inside a building is key to providing comfort and preventing outdoor contaminants from entering a space a slight positive pressure will prevent hot outside air from penetrating into the building during the summer and negative pressure during the winter can maintain humidity by allowing outside air into the building honeywell healthy buildings solutions integrate air quality safety
