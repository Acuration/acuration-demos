how we are teaming up with astrazeneca to reduce the environmental impact of respiratory care solstice propellent technology will be used in nextgeneration inhalers for patients with chronic respiratory diseases innovation is critical to the future of healthcare and the environment as a scienceled biopharmaceutical company astrazeneca is focused on delivering its ambition to reach zero carbon emissions from its global operations by the end of 2025 and be carbon negative across its value chain by 2030 one way astrazeneca plans to reach those goals is by teaming up with honeywell to implement the nearzero global warming potential gwp solstice air propellant in respiratory inhalers heres what to know about the collaboration inhalers are a common treatment for patients with asthma and copd worldwide approximately 339 million children and adults worldwide suffer from asthma and 384 million patients suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd around the world according to the global asthma network and the world health organization a large percentage of people with asthma and copd are prescribed medicine in a type of respiratory inhalers known as a pressurized metereddose inhaler pmdi according to the world health organization solstice air reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 999 compared to the propellant it will replace currently available inhalers use propellants in the form of hydrofluorocarbons hfcs which have a high global warming potential gwp astrazenecas nextgeneration inhalers will use solstice air which is based on hydrofluoroolefins hfos and is the only nonflammable nearzero gwp medical propellant alternative to high gwp hfcs available and in clinical development today for pmdis said jim ling lead scientist of fluorine products who led the team that developed solstice air as a medical propellant for respiratory inhalers solstice products are providing solutions for a variety of industries respiratory inhalers are just one application for hfos which are licensed as the solstice line of products beyond this application honeywells breakthrough solstice hydrofluoroolefin technology helps customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency without sacrificing endproduct performance this portfolio is used in various applications such as for foam insulation in commercial and residential buildings in air conditioner for buildings as refrigerants in supermarkets and in aerosolbased personalcare products the global adoption of solstice refrigerants blowing agents and propellants has amounted to avoiding the potential release of 250 million metric tons of carbon dioxideequivalent emissions into the atmosphere according to honeywells calculations thats the same as potentially removing more than 52 million cars from the road in one year more than 25 times the number of cars sold in the us in 2019 according to the environmental protection agencys greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator we sometimes wonder as individuals what else can we do to contribute to sustainability in our daily lives ling said he added being a part of bringing solstice air to this application that will reach millions of patients gives me a big picture of the impact were making and the opportunity to help create a better future for the next generation pictured above astrazenecas research and development
