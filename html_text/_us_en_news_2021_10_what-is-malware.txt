what is malware what is malware malware or malicious software isnt going anywhere as we become more reliant on our tech its no secret that our computers phones and other devices contain much of our lives from irreplaceable photos and important files to banking information or even health and personal data on an individual level if our devices get infected with malicious software malware for short those valuable contents can get stolen deleted leaked or corrupted cybersecurity attacks can pose even more dangerous and costly consequences for businesses and organizations ranging from lawsuits and crisis communications to business disruptions and privacy leaks and beyond but how exactly do malware attacks happen and what can we do to protect our devices heres what you need to know software vs malware whats the difference software or code is typically developed to do something productive faster and more efficient than methods before maybe its a wordprocessing photo storage or another program that is meant to do something good cybercriminals write software code that does the opposite something unintended or malicious malware can give cybercriminals access to and the ability to steal information which seems bad enough as is but today malware poses even more severe threats to technology according to donovan tindill senior cybersecurity strategist and expert in industrial control systems ics infrastructure and operational technology ot cybersecurity this is because malware continues to get more advanced over time as people become more dependent on their devices malware becomes more disruptive tindill said today one of the biggest threats is that malware can cause what are known as cyberphysical or kinetic consequences when targeting ics and ot historically malware would result in information loss unauthorized use or denial of access but many sectors rely on computers to operate machines pumps motors and more this is where we are trending with increased digital transformation and connectivity this is being leveraged by attackers to control someones computer or physical assets like warehouses pipelines and water treatment tindill said types of malware malware is an umbrella term that encompasses different types of malicious software here are some of the common methods of malware ransomware an increasingly dominant cyberthreat groups behind ransomware attacks benefit financially from the campaigns which block users from using their devices or threatening to release sensitive info until they pay even when they pay their files or the integrity of their devices may no longer be trustworthy spyware malware that is designed to collect a user or organizations information and covertly send it to third parties worm malware that can replicate itself within a network to multiple devices remote access trojan a type of malware designed to masquerade as a regular computer file but unknowingly gives cybercriminals remote command and control their device how can a device get infected with malware using usbs and removable media devices is a common source of malware attacks according to our 2021 usb threat report which analyzed data from hundreds of energy oil and gas chemical buildings aerospace and other industrial plants 37 of cybersecurity threats were specifically designed to utilize removable media devices up from 19 in the 2020 report and 9 in the 2019 report the flaw today is that when you plug a usb device into your computer it trusts it automatically tindill said malware attacks also commonly stem from phishing emails emails that leverage social engineering to entice the recipient to open its attachments or click its links the messages lead to downloading different malware listed above and allow cybercriminals to obtain information or unauthorized access malicious emails continue to pose byfar the biggest threat today tindill said what can we do about malware there are steps we can take to protect our devices from malicious software including avoiding accessing internet or email with a user account that has administrative privileges being cautious when opening emails or files from outside your contacts list or organization never reusing passwords and instead using a password manager tool performing regular and automated software updates and leveraging browser plugins that help filter malicious content but tindill said that more and more people should take a zerotrust approach to their devices in other words trust nothing and always verify over the years a lot of our code has assumed trust such as correct user input or no remote access tindill said zero trust is the most recent paradigm shift that we trust whats in our computers less and less because whats hiding behind could be malware for businesses undergoing a digital transformation journey adopting a zerotrust approach to cybersecurity today will have cost savings in the future if youre transforming youre upgrading or implementing new digital systems and improving the performance of a refinery of buildings of airplanes and more cybersecurity is intended to protect this investment in technology at the same time from a cybercriminals perspective the attack surface is bigger as we adopt new technologies it is more costeffective to address cybersecurity during design and implementation rather than rework and remediate
