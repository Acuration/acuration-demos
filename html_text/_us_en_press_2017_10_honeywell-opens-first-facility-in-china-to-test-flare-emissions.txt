flare emissions october 13 2017 shanghai oct 12 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon uop announced that its callidus technologies business began operation of chinas only facility capable of testing flare emissions for volatile organic compounds or vocs the test center in luoyang henan province aids customers that are working to reduce emissions of vocs in industrial flare systems and improve flare operation the callidus luoyang combustion research and development center is the largest test facility of its kind in asia its design and testing methodology was developed by callidus in conjunction with the us environmental protection agency resulting in a significant improvement over industrial design requirements measuring flare emissions can be difficult and dangerous because flares lack an enclosed combustion chamber often are elevated and they come in many different designs and sizes said henry liu vice president and general manager of honeywell uop china combusted gases can be emitted in any direction at any velocity so we use a patentpending hoodlike structure and sampling rake with multiple sample ports to gather accurate readings from the flare flare voc emissions can be reduced by controlling combustion performance the destruction and removal efficiency endash or dre of flare gas is measured as a percentage of total hydrocarbons removed or destroyed by the flare this is one of the key factors to measuring the performance of flare voc emissions because it represents how well the flare performs the test facility confirms that the dre of callidus flare tips exceeds 995 percent resulting in a 75percent reduction in voc emissions and exceeding standard industrial design requirements of 98 percent of dre as china enacts stricter environmental regulations callidus capabilities in flare technology make it possible for its customers to comply with those regulations and better ensure sound environmental practices until this test center was commissioned testing of this kind was not performed in china the dre test capability at honeywells luoyang rd center will provide a valuable reference for the whole industry and national regulations said professor xiu guangli of east china university of science and technology currently we are working on a research project sponsored by the shanghai environmental protection bureau about shanghais voc emission standard and its testing and certification technology standard as a global flare technology leader honeywells advanced callidus technology complete database and profound experience in related areas definitely will contribute to the successful completion of our project we encourage companies to think ahead and consider switching to more environmentally friendly solutions for the long run honeywell uop has an 80year history in china beginning in 1937 when it helped build one of chinas first refineries in yumen gansu province it was among the first american companies invited
