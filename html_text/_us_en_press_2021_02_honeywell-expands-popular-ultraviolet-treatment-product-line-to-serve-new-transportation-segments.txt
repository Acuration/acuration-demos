the product that includes a uv wand and portable backpack designed to help reduce pathogens found on hightouch surfaces in a quick and lowcost manner this new device can be easily used in a multitude of transportation options from buses and trains to cars and small aircraft in early june we debuted the honeywell uv treatment system which was designed to roll up and down the aisles of a passenger aircraft we quickly recognized our customers need for another option that was more portable and easier to use in smaller spaces so we built the honeywell uv treatment wand said brian wenig vice president mechanical systems and components honeywell aerospace with this new system smaller aircraft and other vehicles like trains and buses can benefit from the same proven ultravioletc uvc technology shown to reduce various viruses and bacteria the honeywell uv treatment wand includes a handheld wand approximately 12 inches long to dispense uvc light the entire system weighs roughly 15 pounds and can be used in any size space where a person will fit including vehicles buildings and other shared spaces the backpack portion of the device which also rolls like a small piece of luggage contains a battery that lasts for one hour of steady usage it takes about 25 hours to recharge the battery when fully drained the new portable option contains a single uvc lamp and it can be operated for as little as 10 cents per use the wand can be used at varying speeds and distances from a target surface at its ideal dosage and speed the wand can be used to cover approximately one square meter in 17 seconds or about 35 meters per minute the device could treat hightouch surfaces in a midsize business jet cabin cockpit and lavatory in less than 15 minutes the surfaces in a typical rental car could be treated in five minutes unlike chemical cleaning solutions uv light does not leave chemical residues on surfaces or require storage and frequent replenishment of chemicals when properly applied uvc lights have been found capable of delivering doses that clinical studies show reduce or inactivate various viruses and bacteria including sarscov and merscov results vary based on uv dosage and application and no testing has been done specifically on protection against sarscov2 honeywell is currently accepting orders for the uv treatment wand with first shipments coming this april
