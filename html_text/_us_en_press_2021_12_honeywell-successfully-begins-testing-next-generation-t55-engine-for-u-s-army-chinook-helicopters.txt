battleproven t55 engine testing of the first t55ga714c engine was successfully initiated at honeywells phoenix test facilities in november to verify the design and establish the performance benchmark in preparation for the engine installation on the flight test aircraft this is an essential next step for the us army to test the new t55ga714c engine capability for its latest ch47 chinook helicopters to date the engine has tested through maximum continuous power demonstrating mechanical operation and acquiring key performance data additional testing is planned at significantly higher power levels first engine to test is a significant achievement for the program and is the culmination of detailed design work component manufacturing system integration and validation now all the engineering is coming to life in the rigorous testing of this enhanced engine for the us army said dave marinick president engines and power systems honeywell aerospace this engine is a natural incremental complement for the chinook keeping the platform relevant for the next generation of warfighters we are confident that our 714c engine will exceed the expectations of the us army with 6000 horsepower honeywells upgraded engine is 23 more powerful and consumes 8 less fuel than the current t55 even in the most demanding operating conditions new modifications also make the nextgeneration t55 easier to maintain with lower operating costs delivering increased readiness for the warfighter we are proud to partner with the us army on the crada program for the nextgeneration t55ga714c engine said steven williams vice president defense aftermarket honeywell aerospace we will be able to demonstrate the power capability and reliability of the upgraded engine to the us army additionally we are on track and on schedule to deliver the new engines and meet the us armys needs the t55ga714c engine is specifically designed for nextgeneration military operators and will improve the chinook helicopters ability to lift troops and heavy cargo for the us army because the engine is based closely on the t55 version currently in use minimal airframe modifications are required the same intake exhaust and engine airframe mounts are used this design provides the us army with a major engine improvement without the need to retrain their maintenance and operational staff or undertake major aircraft changes in 2020 honeywell won a competitive repair and overhaul contract for the t55 in addition honeywell completed a new worldclass engine repair and overhaul facility in phoenix that move allowed the repair and overhaul work on the t55ga714a engine to be fulfilled in the same location as new engine production the t55 center of excellence provides for a shared workforce facilities and engineering resources between both engine lines and delivers up to 20 engines per month to the us army foreign military and commercial customers honeywell first delivered the t55 engine to the us army in 1961 at 2200 shaft horsepower on the ch47a helicopter since that time the engines power has nearly tripled to 6000 shaft horsepower each performance increase on the t55 is accompanied by reduced fuel burn increased reliability and decreased maintenance hours the t55 engine is the world leader in powering heavy lift helicopters over 900 ch47 helicopters are operated
