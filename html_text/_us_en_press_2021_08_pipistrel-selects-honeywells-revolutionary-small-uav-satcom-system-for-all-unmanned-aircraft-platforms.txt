unmanned aircraft platforms pipistrel selects honeywells revolutionary small uav satcom system for all unmanned aircraft platforms honeywells satellite communications system for nuuva v300 v20 and surveyor aircraft is worlds smallest but packs the punch of technology found on jetliners august 16 2021 phoenix aug 16 2021 prnewswire a honeywell nyse hon breakthrough in compact satellite communications technology will bring the safety connectivity and efficiency trusted for decades by airplane manufacturers and airlines to three of pipistrels exciting new aircraft including the fixedwing surveyor and both unmanned nuuva platforms the v300 and smaller v20 weighing in at only 1 kilogram 22 pounds honeywells small uav satcom system is 90 lighter than the companys next smallest connectivity system yet it brings the same capabilities enjoyed by larger aircraft to the nuuva v300 v20 and surveyor honeywells offering a highly innovative and popular product targeting a rapidly growing new market segment will for the first time be implemented specifically on an unmanned cargo or optionally manned aerial vehicle we are excited to offer our customers a global communication solution which is location independent and costeffective said pipistrel ceo ivo boscarol the addition of honeywells small uav satcom to our unmanned aircraft platforms unlocks global beyondvisuallineofsight bvlos connectivity for commandcontrol as well as missionspecific data relay our customers will enjoy the ability to connect to their assets anytime anywhere without the need to set up elaborate groundbased bvlos infrastructure satellite communications or satcom refers to a broad category of key technologies that connect aircraft to each other and to operators or air traffic control on the ground via satellites traditionally satellite communications terminals have only been available to install on larger business and commercial transport aircraft due to their large size weight and the power required however honeywells small uav satcom system is 30 lighter than competing options customizable and can be installed in different locations on an aircraft to accommodate a wide range of platforms honeywells small uav satcom system is a gamechanger for small or mediumsized unmanned aircraft such as the nuuva cargo or surveyor aircraft that previously couldnt be equipped with satellite communications said stphane fymat vice president and general manager unmanned aerial systems and urban air mobility at honeywell aerospace now they have access to everything weve come to expect from the largeaircraft experience like global connectivity or fleet monitoring but its been packaged in a size that is conducive to a much smaller aerial vehicle the system provides unmanned aerial vehicles with global coverage and realtime video streaming to the ground it also enables beyondlineofsight capabilities so vehicles can be operated remotely beyond the operators visual sight it can be used for a variety of applications including logistics and delivery services performed by uavs also the small uav satcom can keep vehicles connected even in remote areas or over water where other groundbased communications systems such as 4g are not available pipistrels nuuva v300 is a longrange largecapacity autonomous uav it will take off and land vertically with battery power meaning it does not require a runway and has significantly lower operating costs than helicopters it can carry loads up to 460 kilograms 1010 pounds for more than 300 kilometers 186 miles making it an ideal solution for deliveries to areas traditionally accessible only by helicopter its smaller sibling the nuuva v20 shares the same architecture and advantages of the larger v300 but is designed to serve as a lighter cargo transport vehicle carrying loads of up to 20 kg the surveyor aircraft uses a fixedwing design that is designed to be customized with various sensors and cameras for use in applications like wildlife management coastal patrol traffic observation or search and rescue efforts honeywell is a major player in the emerging urban air mobility segment offering a full line of avionics flight control navigation radar communications actuation cooling motors and turboelectric propulsion systems all tailored for piloted vertical takeoff and landing urban air mobility and
