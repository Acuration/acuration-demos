contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news mission to mars how innovation will take us there mission to mars how innovation will take us there phoebe henson whose work focuses on human life support systems for space breaks down the unique challenges of a mission to mars and how innovative technologies will make it possible its an exciting era for space exploration and one of the next milestones on the horizon is getting humans to mars a journey to mars is different than a mission to the moon in many ways for one thing its a much longer trip the average distance from earth to the moon accounting for rotation in orbit is around 238900 miles whereas the distance from earth to mars the red planet is an average distance of 140 million miles what does that translate to in terms of travel time a nasa mission to mars is slated to take roughly a year each in traveling to and from the planet with an additional year dedicated to proving that we can live there in 2018 nasa pointed to the trend of technological advancement since the original apollo mission as a sign that favors a successful manned mars mission in the nottoodistant future mars may be 200 times farther than the moon at closest approach but we may be thousands of times more prepared to achieve this in other words with the rate of technological breakthroughs in development now a mission to mars may be closer than you imagine keep reading to learn more about groundbreaking research that could provide something critical to getting astronauts to mars and helping them stay there a life support system that allows them to breathe even amid extremely oxygen poor atmospheric conditions innovations to astronaut lifesupport systems are key to understand the technology that will allow humans to breathe on mars in the future its important to learn about the life support systems that allow people to breathe on the international space station iss today the iss uses a space environmental controls and life support systems eclss system that converts carbon dioxide co 2 to oxygen the current system the carbon dioxide removal assembly cdra has limitations compared with the needs a mission to mars presents the current process of harvesting oxygen from co 2 or the sabatier reaction can be used for the relatively close iss and recover 50 of oxygen however if the same life support system were to be used for the mars mission that percentage translates to a significant amount of oxygen that then needs to be transported to mars for mars adding the mass of the additional required oxygen even at 50 recovery of co 2 is just way too high adding a technology like methane pyrolysis enables the recovery of 100 of oxygen from co 2 and decreases the mass required for a mission to mars said phoebe henson senior life support systems engineer human space research and development we dont want the mission to be cost prohibitive she says referring to the cost per kilogram of anything launched into space while the cost per kilogram has decreased for loworbit flights every kilogram you can leave behind on exceptionally long trips counts even more hensons work at honeywell focuses on space life support systems specifically a co 2 removal system known as the carbon dioxide removal by ionic liquid system cdrils technology it uses a regenerable ionic liquid to capture the co 2 from the atmosphere of a spacecraft henson said cdrils combined with a sabatier reactor and the methane pyrolysis technology create a completely closedloop life support system that is able to recover 100 of oxygen from co 2 recruited out of arizona state university while completing an engineering internship with honeywell henson has 12 patents relating to the carbon harvesting system henson explained that the durability of the main components of cdrils means it can be provided in a much smaller package which is good for future astronauts on the mission to mars in addition to major reductions in volume and mass cdrils also requires less power than the co 2 removal system used at the international space station the system is also a major upgrade in another key area it has less equipment mass and requires less maintenance astronaut time is valuable for a mission to mars we cant have astronauts spend all their time working to maintain a technology she said we need our astronauts there to go and do valuable science set up equipment for future missions and so on the greater reliability of the system is also meant to ensure ongoing safety over a much longer timeline preliminary missions will help prepare for the future henson explained that one of the challenges with a mission to mars is the latency in communication between earth and mars as opposed to the near direct communication between the iss and mission control in houston according to nasa the delay in communication between mission control and mars will range from 4 to 24 minutes the sensors need to be extremely reliable when we go to mars if theres an issue we cant be waiting on mission control back home to execute on solving that problem henson said so its not just about the sensors but its also about the control system and just having astronauts that are trained in every possible scenario that could go wrong everything is going to need to be a lot more selfsufficient henson states speaking of ongoing testing the upcoming nasa artemis ii manned orbit around the moon and artemis iii manned mission on the moon missions will test capabilities for deep space exploration honeywells continuing partnership with nasa in space exploration include involvement in various aspects of the artemis i launch which sent the unmanned orion spacecraft around the moon to prove capabilities for future missions pictured nasas artemis i an uncrewed mission to the mission on launch day in november 2022 the artemis program plans to bring humans back to the moon as well as to mars honeywell provided the full navigation and guidance system for the artemis i launch vehicle and throughout the course of the artemis program honeywell technology will play an increasingly critical role in the orion spacecraft and the artemis missions nasa is using the moon as a kind of steppingstone to mars henson said we will have some communication latency not a very big one but i think that being further away will help us build the capability to be more selfsufficient with a lot less risk than a mission to mars itll also give us the opportunity to test capabilities like potentially using martian or lunar resources in order to create valuable things for the mission like fuel henson said we know the first companies to be able to create fuel on the moon or mars will create a lot of value for nasa and commercial companies going to space as far as inspiring the next generation of innovators henson said i hope that when kids hear were going back to the moon in preparation for the mars mission theyre just as amazed as i was when i learned about the iss for the first time want to learn more about what makes the mars mission unique check out this episode of the future is podcast featuring amanda childers lead rd scientist whose
