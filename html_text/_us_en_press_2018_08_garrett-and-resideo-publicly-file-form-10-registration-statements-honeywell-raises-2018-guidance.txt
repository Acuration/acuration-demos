spinoff impact to honeywell following the spins honeywell will have a simpler more focused portfolio that operates in fewer end markets as we transform into a softwareindustrial company the announced transactions are expected to strengthen honeywells alreadystrong financial position through a combination of onetime dividends and ongoing reimbursements from the spin companies for the majority of honeywells environmental and bendix asbestos payments on or around the effective date of each spin honeywell will receive onetime dividends from garrett and resideo totaling approximately 3 billion honeywell intends to use the proceeds to pay down its debt and repurchase honeywell shares in addition the company intends to eliminate all of honeywells redundant functional corporate and shared services costs caused by the two transactions by the end of 2019 garrett and resideo will make payments to honeywell under separate indemnification and reimbursement agreements that largely offset honeywells related legacy liability spending including the bendix asbestos liability that arises from the operations of the legacy transportation systems business under the indemnity agreements 90 of honeywells bendix asbestos and a subset of its environmental spending net of 90 of related insurance receipts and certain other recoveries is expected to be offset by future payments from garrett and resideo in total the indemnity agreement payments are expected to offset honeywells future legacy liability payments by as much as 315 million in respect of any year once both spins are complete assuming 350 million of expense in a year the offset would be 315 million for such expenses or approximately 040 of earnings per share based on honeywells projected fullyear 2018 weighted average share count of 754 million shares indemnity agreements and capital structure each spins payment is capped to limit future uncertainty regarding their cash payment obligations to honeywell the garrett payment is capped at 175 million and the resideo payment is capped at 140 million in respect of any year under the agreements honeywell will continue to effectively manage its bendix and other asbestos claims and legacy environmental liabilities until such matters are resolved honeywell carefully considered the financial operating requirements and capital needs of both spins in determining an appropriate capital structure for the new entities and anticipates that the entities will have a strong financial foundation as independent publiclytraded companies both companies are anticipated to have highyield corporate credit ratings accounting treatment in the course of preparing the garrett spin and through the sec review process honeywell reviewed the accounting treatment of its legacy asbestos liabilities after careful deliberation a decision was made to revise the accounting related to the time period associated with the determination of appropriate accruals for the legacy bendix asbestosrelated liability for unasserted claims the prior accounting treatment applied a fiveyear time horizon the revised treatment reflects the full term of the epidemiological projections through 2059 the change was made in consideration of a number of factors including the subjective nature of applying a fiveyear or any other fixed time horizon when estimating liability for unasserted claims recent changes by several other registrants to accrue for unasserted asbestos claims over the full term of the epidemiological projections and the desire to facilitate comparability among honeywell garrett and the companies respective peers honeywells historic earnings per share in certain periods increased as a result of the changes to legacy liability expenses with no impact on cash flow in any historical period the accounting revision will have an immaterial positive impact to honeywells fullyear 2018 adjusted earnings per share 1 as referenced above but has no material impact on operating income and no impact to net sales segment margin or operating cash flow the company anticipates an immaterial increase to future earnings it also does not impact honeywells aa2 credit rating
