sustainability ultimately puts business outcomes center stage where they belong sustainability experts say is a process not an event making processes environmentally sustainable means taking a deep look at how things are done and rethinking entire ways of doing business a panel of top insiders in sustainability and energy offered insights about small and large changes you may need to make watch the full conversation on demand 1 understand that sustainability is a business outcome just as industrial businesses reinvented their processes during the quality revolution of the mid20th century we have to take that same mindset and incorporate that with sustainability says evan van hook honeywells chief sustainability officer we have to go beyond looking at sustainability as an initiative and think of it as an outcome of a good operating or manufacturing environment 2 rethink entrenched technologies the electric power grid has been essentially unchanged since the days of thomas edison notes david holmes the chief technology officer for the energy vertical at dell technologies but by putting sensors into the grid and placing intelligence into industrial facilities and homes that communicate with the grid theres an opportunity to significantly optimize energy consumption and generation 3 be actionoriented its a widely accepted principle that you can act your way into a new way of thinking more easily than you can think your way into a new way of acting says evan if you want to create a sustainability culture remember that cultural changes that stick are rooted in behavior not the result of corporate dicta 4 document successes and replicate them honeywell has identified about 6000 sustainability projects of all sizes over the last decade down to the detection and elimination of compressed air leakage it sounds like a small thing evan says but man you do that 1000 times across your company and you have saved a lot of money and youve saved an awful lot of energy you cant really get there until you have a systems approach that makes it part of how youre operating the company 5 get analytical collect data on your processes and use it says alex robart strategy
