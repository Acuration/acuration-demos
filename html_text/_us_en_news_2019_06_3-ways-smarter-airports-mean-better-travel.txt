detector is activated or a security point is breached the airport may need to be evacuated this can be costly and logistically difficult before initiating an action the airport team must evaluate the risks by examining the area with cctv to verify the threat crosscorrelating with other sensors such as temperature to validate the extent of the issue and prepare staff for a potential emergency in the case of an evacuation the staff are better equipped to control and orderly exit through controlled security doors 3 more comfortable waiting stuck at the gate stay comfortable sensorbased iot combined with data analytics can help monitor equipment health and performance and notify personnel of potential issues before they threaten entire airport operations this includes the heating and
