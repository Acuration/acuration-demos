rising ev adoption and increased lithiumion liion battery production raise safety concerns liion batteries that power evs can lead to dangerous thermal runaway incidents causing intense and prolonged electrical fires workers assembling batteries face risks like hand injuries exposure to chemical hazards and potential electrocution a focus on safety is crucial in this ev boom to address safety concerns across the spectrum of people involved in ev manufacturing transport and usefrom drivers to ev plant workers to first responders and othershoneywell nasdaq hon has created a number of
