contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news this engineers earplugs are now a work of art this engineers earplugs are now a work of art meet the artist who designed an elevated everyday object thats in the permanent collection of the museum of modern art object number 202200613 matrix noroll singleuse earplug is in the permanent collection at the museum of modern art moma in new york a true example of form meets function the earplugs were created in 1995 by engineer john jenkins we caught up with john to find out the story of how a simple piece of safety equipment became such a big deal what made these earplugs museumworthy the museum curators interpretation of contemporary arts influence on industrial design indeed when the earplug was designed we specifically made effort to keep the design as simple as possible so that the focus would be on product performance and function contemporary art played a role in influencing that initial design direction and remained part of the project throughout when were they on display they have been part of two exhibitions in moma in manhattan the first was an exhibition called born out of necessity and the second called safe design takes on risk they were in a display wall behind glass it was super cool they welcomed me like a rockstar they knew i was coming because they sent an invitation that i accepted and they asked me to show a card that i was given when i arrived and i have a lifetime membership as an artist what was your inspiration with the design contemporary art being a challenge to what is accepted today with a focus at on functionality and performance devoid of design features that are nonfunctional or only aesthetic i wanted to even do them without color and we only added color as a differentiator within variations of the product within the family can we get a pair today we just discontinued them end of last year a sad day but alas not everyone understands arts enduring value how did you find out about being in a museum i found out when the curator called my desk phone directly and asked for permission to use the product in the exhibitions we proceeded to provide samples of the product and all of the legal work that needed to be performed in order to make it happen what inspires you i get inspired when given the opportunity to do something with my background education and experience that has not been accomplished before occasionally by being told that something is not possible whos your favorite artist prince because his work was very personal to him and because of that he made so much of who he was a part of what he did this carried over into not only his music but his style and entire life thats a real artist to me someone who lives his work and allows others to enjoy it or not enjoy it but still remains true to themselves what are you working on now several projects bringing some of our hearing protection products up to date bluetooth impact sport earmuffs and inear lanyard style bluetooth and hearthrough earbuds is engineering like art engineering is very much like art the interpretation of the market need into a product can take many different directions and while direction is given by business needs the decision made along that journey are on many occasions made personally which is where the art comes in engineers are very much creating something where nothing existed before from external influence suggestion and direction which invariably includes their personal experience and then sharing it thats art innovation related content the future is ai
