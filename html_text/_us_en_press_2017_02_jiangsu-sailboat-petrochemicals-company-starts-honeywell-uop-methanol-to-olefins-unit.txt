petrochemicals company starts honeywell uop methanoltoolefins unit february 23 2017 des plaines ill feb 22 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon announced that jiangsu sailboat petrochemical company ltd started its uop advanced methanoltoolefins mto unit during a 10day test to confirm successful operation when the full unit goes on line it will have an annual production capacity of 833000 metric tons per year making it the largest singletrain mto unit in the world located in lianyungang city in chinas jiangsu province the sailboat facility will produce propylene for the production of acrylonitrile which is used to make clothing and fabrics and highperformance polymers used in automotive parts hard hats and other hard plastic products the plant also will produce ethylene for the production of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers which are used to make adhesives foams medical devices photovoltaic cells and other products as well as c4 olefins for the production of butadiene an ingredient in synthetic rubber we expect china to invest more than 100 billion in coaltochemicals technology in the next five years said mike millard vice president and general manager of uops process technology and equipment business with chinas demand growth for propylene of 7 percent per year ethylene demand growing nearly 6 percent and butadiene at almost 4 percent our advanced mto process provides an excellent solution to meet that demand ethylene and propylene the two most widely used components to make plastics in the world have traditionally been derived from crude oil for regions such as china that lack domestic sources of crude oil the advanced mto technology allows for the use of other more economical feedstocks such as coal and natural gas jiangsu sailboat chose the advanced mto process because it produces the highest yields of light olefins at the lowest cost of production with the lowest catalyst consumption and the lowest operating cost in addition the unit is configured for production of c4 olefins as well as ethylene and propylene honeywell uops advanced mto process combines the uophydro mto process and the totaluop olefin cracking process to significantly increase yields and feedstock efficiency the process converts methanol from coal and natural gas into ethylene and propylene at the heart of the technology are uops proprietary catalysts which make it possible to efficiently adjust the ratio of propylene and ethylene produced so operators can most effectively meet demand for those products jiangsu sailboat petrochemical co ltd is a whollyowned subsidiary company of shenghong holding group located in xuwei new district industrial park lianyungang city jiangsu province when fully completed the 500hectare facility will produce about 25 million tons of
