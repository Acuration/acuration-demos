and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities for which there is a planned amount of restructuringrelated charges additional restructuring represents only amounts that are incremental to those planned restructuring amounts for the three months ended september 30 2017 the company funded approximately 100 million of restructuring approximately 60 million of which was incremental to the planned amount this additional restructuring was enabled by a lower than expected effective tax rate for the period we believe that the exclusion of this additional restructuring provides a more comparable measure of yearonyear results earnings per share attributable to additional restructuring uses a tax rate of 26 for the three months ended september 30 2017 we believe earnings per share adjusted to normalize for the expected effective tax rate of 26 for the most recently completed fiscal quarter as presented in prior guidance for such quarter and to exclude the 2016 divestitures is a measure that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends scott sayres email financial what we do
