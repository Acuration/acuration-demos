performance the system model h1 becomes the first to achieve a demonstrated quantum volume of 1024 honeywell quantum solutions has set another record for the performance of its trapped ion quantum computing technology the 10qubit system model h1 recently achieved a quantum volume of 1024 the highest measured to date it is the third time in 10 months the system model h1 has eclipsed its own record for quantum volume a measure of the overall capability and performance of a quantum computer the system model h1 debuted in september 2020 with a thenrecord quantum volume of 128 honeywell quadrupled its performance to reach a quantum volume of 512 in march 2021 and then doubled it again to 1024 this month tony uttley president of honeywell quantum solutions attributed the increase in performance to the continuous upgrades to the system we are always fine tuning our system and making improvements he said our goal always has been and continues to be to have the highestperforming quantum computer available how we did it the system model h1 operations have continued to improve since it was first released the average singlequbit gate fidelity for this milestone was 99991 the average twoqubit gate fidelity was 99726 and state preparation and measurement spam fidelity was 99705 we ran 800 circuits with 20 shots each using standard qv optimization techniques to yield an average of 10859 twoqubit gates per circuit the system model h1 successfully passed the quantum volume 1024 benchmark outputting heavy outputs 7036 of the time which is above the 23 threshold with 9890 confidence the plot above shows the heavy outputs for honeywell quantum solutions tests of quantum volume and the dates when each test passed all tests are above the 23 threshold to pass the respective quantum volume benchmark circles indicate heavy outcome averages and the violin plots show the histogram distributions data colored in blue show system performance results and red points correspond to modeled noiseincluded simulation data white markers are the lower 2sigma error bounds the plot above shows the individual heavy outputs for each quantum volume 1024 run the blue line is an average of heavy outputs and the orange line is the lower 2sigma error bar which crosses the 23 threshold after 707 circuits honeywells quantum systems are accessible directly and through ecosystem partner platforms including microsofts azure quantum cambridge quantum computings tket zapata computings orquestra and the strangeworks qc platform in addition to offering highfidelity fully connected qubits our system features a unique combination of midcircuit measurement with qubit reuse and conditional logic which enables users to explore new classes of algorithms and to greatly reduce the number of qubits needed for certain algorithms for more information about getting started accessing our system please contact quantumsolutionshoneywellcom quantum related content how quantum can help
