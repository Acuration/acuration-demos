nextgeneration inertial sensors to unmanned vehicles segment recent findings show the accuracy of new sensors is improved by greater than an order of magnitude over current offerings january 25 2021 phoenix jan 25 2021 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon with funding from the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa is creating the next generation of inertial sensor technology that will one day be used in both commercial and defense navigation applications recently findings gathered in honeywell labs have shown the new sensors to be greater than an order of magnitude more accurate than honeywells hg1930 inertial measurement unit imu product a tacticalgrade product with more than 150000 units currently in use an imu uses gyroscopes accelerometers and electronics to give precise rotation and acceleration data to enable a vehicle system to calculate where it is what direction it is going and at what speed even when gps signals arent available there are various types of imus on the market and some like the nextgeneration version currently under development use sensors based on microelectromechanical systems mems technology to precisely measure motion typically mems inertial sensors have been on the lower end of the performance scale but this latest milestone shows we are changing that paradigm said jenni strabley director of offering management for inertial sensors honeywell aerospace with this nextgeneration mems technology were increasing performance without having to significantly change the size or weight of the imu this is a gamechanger for the navigation industry where customers need highly accurate solutions but cannot afford to compromise on weight or size over the past few years honeywell has been working with darpa to develop the next generation of high precision navigation grade imu technology under the precise robust inertial guidance for munitions thermally stabilized inertial guidance for munitions prigm tigm program these new higher performance mems sensors will use different sensor design and electronics to enable higher performance they will serve a broad range of applications in autonomous land and air vehicles for both military and commercial customers including future urban air mobility aircraft now that we have demonstrated that mems is capable of reaching these incredibly precise performance levels it is the perfect time to start talking with potential users about how this technology could help their applications said strabley we believe this new technology will have a variety of applications such as onboard future vehicles that will fly in urban environments where lightweight extremely precise navigation is critical to safer operations additionally there are other applications that havent been invented yet but may be enabled by these types of technology innovations commercial sales of an imu containing these nextgeneration sensors are still several years away but one of the first products using this new technology is expected to be more than 50 times more accurate while roughly the same size as honeywells hg1930 imu honeywell has long been a pioneer in memsbased imus including the hg1930 honeywells lineage in navigation dates to the 1920s and since then honeywell has developed and manufactured highperformance navigation solutions found on many aircraft and other vehicles
