unmanned cargo aircraft honeywell to provide critical navigation and sensor technology for pipistrels unmanned cargo aircraft new attitude heading reference system and air data module will bring enhanced safety and reliability to nuuva v300 cargo aircraft april 1 2021 phoenix april 1 2021 prnewswire pipistrel has selected honeywells nyse hon nextgeneration attitude heading reference system and air data module for its nuuva v300 cargo unmanned aerial vehicle uav the technologies provide critical navigation and motionsensing data and will work in tandem with honeywells compact flybywire system onboard the aircraft if the flybywire system operates as the brain of an aircrafts flight controls the attitude heading reference system ah2000 and air data module adm act as the heart supplying critical motion data to all avionics systems and many mechanical systems both the ah2000 and adm are key enablers for safe and efficient vehicle operations with potential to serve several flight applications including urban air mobility vehicles commercial aircraft business jets and helicopters nuuva v300s groundbreaking operational concept requires highly accurate dependable and robust navigation sensors and the ah2000 and adm are key enablers of this functionality said tine tomai chief technology officer pipistrel this technology allows us to deliver simple and intuitive mouseclick control to fly the vehicle eliminating the need for operators to be trained with traditional piloting skills which helps ensure rapid scaleup of operations for our customers pipistrels nuuva v300 is a longrange largecapacity autonomous uav it will take off and land vertically with battery power meaning it does not require a runway and has significantly lower operating costs than helicopters it can carry loads up to 460 kilograms around 1000 pounds for more than 300 kilometers about 186 miles making it an ideal solution for deliveries to areas traditionally accessible only by helicopter unmanned aircraft especially those delivering packages must be equipped with highperforming inertial systems to ensure flybywire systems are provided the best possible information on location speed and position said matt picchetti vice president and general manager navigation sensors honeywell aerospace vehicles like nuuva v300 will change the way logistics companies fulfill package deliveries and were proud to add our growing list of onboard technologies to enhance safety and make flying easier the ah2000 uses honeywells nextgeneration industryleading microelectromechanical systems memsbased inertial sensors to deliver aircraft attitude and velocity information it delivers safetycritical attitude and velocity data to drive the flybywire flight control system and provides navigation data to the flybywire guidance system this data provides the high level of safety normally seen on commercial aircraft but in a more compact size this data is necessary for flybywire control navigation and cockpit displays honeywells adm utilizes the industrys most stable pressuresensing technology to provide safetycritical avionics with measurements for accurate altitude and airspeed honeywell is a major player in the emerging uam segment offering a full line of avionics flight control navigation radar communications actuation cooling motors and
