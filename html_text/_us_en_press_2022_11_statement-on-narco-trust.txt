by the trust after march 31 2023 until the buyout closing frequently asked questions faqs how did honeywell acquire this liability narco north american refractories company manufactured highgrade heatresistant refractory products for various industries refractory materials are typically used in furnaces kilns incinerators and reactors honeywells predecessor allied corporation owned narco from 1979 to 1986 allied sold the narco business in 1986 and entered into an agreement under which allied and later honeywell shared liability with narco for asbestos claims arising primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestoscontaining refractory brick and mortar sold or manufactured by narco honeywell established its initial liability for narco asbestos claims in 2002 what is the history of the trust narco filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and emerged from bankruptcy in april 2013 at which time a federally authorized trust was established to evaluate and resolve all existing narco asbestos claims the trust honeywell is protected by a channeling injunction which bars all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requires all asbestosrelated claims based on exposure to narco asbestoscontaining products to be made against the trust the narco trust agreement ta and the narco trust distribution procedures tdp set forth the structure and operating rules of the trust and established honeywells evergreen funding obligations to fund among other things claims against the trust and the trusts annual operating expenses which were 21m in 2021 this number can vary yeartoyear based on claims processing legal and other fees why have we pursued litigation against the trust the tdp operating rules define criteria claimants must meet to establish that their asbestosrelated claims are valid once the trust became operational in 2014 it began processing and paying claims honeywell identified several issues with the way the trust was operating and consistently raised its concerns with the trust that the trust was improperly paying claimants who have not demonstrated the requisite exposure to narco asbestoscontaining products in violation of the tdp the trust refused to alter its practices for payment of claims and in september 2021 honeywell filed suit against the trust in bankruptcy court alleging that the trust has breached its duties in managing the trust including breaches of certain provisions of the ta and tdp honeywells lawsuit seeks appropriate relief preventing the trust from continuing these practices the bankruptcy court conducted a trial on these matters during may 2022 should the buyout agreement be approved by the bankruptcy court the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the buyout agreement the buyout closing would also resolve all outstanding litigation currently ongoing between honeywell and the trust in the event bankruptcy court approval is not obtained honeywell will continue to preserve all its available rights what will happen if there is no buyout if the buyout is not consummated honeywell will continue to manage our ongoing litigation with the trust until concluded and will continue to comply with our obligations to fund the trust in accordance with the operative trust agreements to manage the liabilities accordingly and to preserve all of our available rights why does the upfront cash payment exceed the existing narco reserve the upfront cash payment the buyout amount will exceed our current narco reserve the reserve represents the companys estimate for the resolution of narco asbestosrelated claims for all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 but does not account for potential benefits related to hwi or insurance recoveries the reserve does not include any of honeywells obligations associated with the trusts operating expenses in addition to its obligations to fund narco asbestosrelated claims honeywell has an ongoing evergreen obligation to pay the trusts annual operating expenses including its legal fees which operating expenses for reference were approximately 21 million in 2021 though this number fluctuates year over year based on the trusts claims and litigation activity this provides a general sense for what is expensed in recent years the buyout agreement provides that the trust will retain its equity interest in hwi unless and until such equity interest is sold and that the economic rights of the trust in such equity interest including any dividends or sale proceeds will continue to inure to the benefit of honeywell following the buyout closing honeywell will continue to have the right to collect proceeds in connection with its narco asbestosrelated insurance policies caitlin leopold director external
