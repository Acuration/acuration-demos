for contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle press media air pressure sensors deployed in measurement systems air pressure sensors deployed in measurement systems october 30 2018 fort mill sc oct 30 2018 endash honeywell nyse hon today announced that its pressure sensors are being used to help test a range of innovative technologies including the next generation of advanced unmanned aerial vehicles uavs honeywell supplied its trustability rsc series and hsc series digital board mount pressure sensors to surrey sensors ltd ssl for integration into highprecision measurement systems that are used in a variety of sectors including aerospace and formula 1 trustability is a series of boardmounted pressure sensors designed to measure low airflow with high accuracy they offer enhanced reliability to minimize system downtime and also help shorten design cycles by simplifying the deployment process the sensors meet a list of strict requirements especially at ultralow pressures they have been installed within a range of ssl technologies including its digital sevenhole probe system that uses pressure as a proxy to measure air velocity speed and direction in a very small and accurate package for use in windtunnel testing motorsport and uavs we needed very small and accurate board mount pressure sensors said dr david m birch director of research at ssl the competitor products we examined couldnt come close to trustability especially in performance size and cost leslie neill senior product manager of honeywells sensing and iot business said that the trustability sensors were the perfect fit for ssls applications several ssl testing solutions address specific measurement needs at ultralow air pressures he said working in this particular band of the pressure continuum requires highprecision sensors that must meet a set of performance factors that are generally difficult to achieve with the same sensor they must be more accurate and sensitive to smaller pressure changes more stable and have a higher threshold of burst and over pressures in addition to the digital sevenhole probe system the trustability sensors are used for the core pressure sensing components in several other ssl products these include a pressure sensor interface card for use in pressure prototyping validation and acquisition systems and a 64channel modular pressure scanner system which offers multichannel pressure measurement for rapidly changing requirements such as those found in surface pressure measurement and process control applications formed as a partnership between a private venture and the university of surrey surrey sensors ltd delivers innovative aerodynamics and flow testing solutions to read a case study highlighting guildfordbased ssls use of
