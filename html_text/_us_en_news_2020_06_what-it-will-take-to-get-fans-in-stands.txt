contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news what it will take to get fans in stands what it will take to get fans in stands go team eager to cheer at events once again technology and safety measures will help make it possible home runs touchdowns goals slam dunks sport fans everywhere are looking forward to cheering on their teams again according to a seton hall university poll 72 of fans dont want to return to stadiums until there is a vaccine and forbes reported that games with no fans come with a revenue risk of more than 5 billion for the nfl its clear that social distancing and public health measures will be important for the safety of players staff and fans but those changes cant ruin the game day experience we dont want a hassle factor said greg turner senior director at honeywell with more than two decades of experience with building solutions we dont want anything that makes their experience less than what they expect from a professional sports venue or college sports venue here are some of the changes that will get fans back in the stands buying tickets before you can download tickets on game day you could be required to pass a health screening check which would have fans answer questions about their recent health history then they will be given a time slot to enter the stadium by staggering entry the amount of people congregating can be reduced at entrances scanners can read ticket barcodes making granting access a touchless interaction entering the stadium upon entering you will pass by thermal cameras to screen body temperatures those with an elevated body temperature can be sent for additional screening measures to ensure the safety of other fans once inside you will head to your seats in routes that limit facetoface interaction that means implementing oneway traffic flow and distancing measures similar to those now common at grocery and retail stores greg said meanwhile face masks will be as much of the gameday wardrobe as face paint those masks can be branded to match team colors making them more pleasant for fans artificial intelligence software in cameras keep fans safe from other threats and can scan to make sure fans are wearing face masks where required buying concessions pretzels hot dogs popcorn nachos pizza soft drinks beer the stadium snacks are as key to the experience as the game itself but long lines at concession stands must be avoided as a result apps that can coordinate food delivery to fans at their seats will help other technology like mobile payment and scanners can also reduce touchpoints like passing credit and debit card back and forth protecting players players are the heart of professional sports teams you cant have a game without players and you cant have players without an enormous amount of infrastructure that goes into conditioning and workouts and practice and all of the things that lead up to a game greg said a lot will change within practice and team facilities to protect players and staff they will also use technology like health screening questionnaires thermal imaging cameras and personal protective equipment a player cant very well play in a mask but they can sure watch film in a mask greg said transporting teams getting a team to an away game also will require safety precautions teams will want to make sure they have a safe and sterile environment on aircraft or team buses greg said on the teamowned aircraft environmental control systems can ensure air is being filtered while uv and other solutions can make sure the plane is cleaned effectively between flights cleaning locker rooms in locker rooms players are often close together changing out of sweaty equipment to help with social distancing a maximum occupancy could be set the headcount in an area can be regulated with access controls that limit the number of people in the locker room if the room is at capacity then another person would not be permitted to enter until someone leaves meanwhile surfaces in locker rooms must be cleaned often software can regulate how often cleaning cycles are put in place based on data with respect to the use of the space automating behind the scenes behindthescenes the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system can make sure that contaminated air in a space is being replaced often that can be used in indoor stadiums locker rooms office spaces and anywhere else people gather meanwhile automation throughout the stadium will be essential realtime information about how the building is being used can allow officials to respond as necessary while assuring players and fans of the actions taken to protect them for example such information can help suggest appropriate changes to energy use airflow cleaning schedules and more once
