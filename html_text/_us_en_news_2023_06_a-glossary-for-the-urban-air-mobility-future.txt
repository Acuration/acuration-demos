contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news a glossary for the urban air mobility future a glossary for the urban air mobility future terms to know for the advent of air taxis and automated electric aircraft the advent of ondemand transportation flying over traffic and terrain is changing how we think about getting from point a to point b the emerging world of urban air mobility uam will make transportation more efficient while launching an entirely new sector of the aerospace industry technology being developed today by the worlds largest aerospace manufacturers and by innovative startups is making air taxis drone delivery and allelectric autonomous flight a reality this new industry already encompasses many evolving concepts and subsectors here are some important terms to know as this technology takes us to new heights autonomous flight refers to aircraft that are capable of sensing deciding and acting with greater autonomy through all phases of flight from takeoff to landing urban air mobility uam this emerging field of aviation and aerospace centers on developing aircraft and infrastructure to transport people over urban environments on demand advancements in battery technology distributed electric propulsion and automation are driving innovation in this field advanced air mobility aam expanding on these concepts advanced air mobility envisions use cases beyond urban environments including regional city pairs public services emergency response and cargo delivery electric vertical takeoff and landing evtol the technology behind most advanced air mobility vehicles is evtol aircraft typically use rotors to take off vertically then those rotors either mechanically shift in place for fixedwing cruising flight or another propulsion system takes over uncrewed aerial vehicles uavs also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or drones uavs are often remotely piloted aircraft used for aerial photography and surveillance firefighting military applications insurance adjusting and crop spraying larger uavs are currently in development for cargo and package delivery uncrewed aerial systems uas a term often used in the aerospace industry by the united states military and the federal aviation administration uncrewed aerial system emphasizes elements in addition to the aircraft including data links control stations remote pilots on the ground and other systems flybywire system allelectric vehicles both for urban air mobility and uavs require ultralight systems these advanced aircraft like modern airliners are controlled with a flybywire system essentially the brains of the aircraft although conventional control systems are heavier and draw considerable power honeywell engineers have developed a compact flybywire system about the size of a paperback book while eliminating the need for heavy hydraulics improving safety and drawing less power beyond visual line of sight bvlos detectandavoid is a key component of beyond visual line of sight operations drones equipped with bvlos technology can fly farther and carry more weight with less human intervention urban air mobility vehicles also will need highly advanced detectandavoid systems to operate beyond the visual lineofsight of their remote pilots and eventually to operate autonomously detectandavoid to fly safely autonomous aircraft will need to detect airborne traffic and decide on a course of action to safely maneuver around it this detectandavoid capability is extremely complex in the air to test the honeywell intuvue rdr84k radars detectandavoid abilities our engineers flew two quadcopter drones at each other over the desert in multiple flights the aircraft detected the others flight path and calculated a maneuver to safely avoid it simplified vehicle operations svo a concept where a pilot onboard supervises flight operations and intervenes only as needed once the flying public becomes comfortable with automation it will be possible to take the pilot offboard and put them in an operations center to supervise the aircraft remotely learn more about the latest innovations in urban air mobility and uavs and meet a
