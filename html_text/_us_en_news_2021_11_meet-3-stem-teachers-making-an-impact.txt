engineering computer sciences and more keep reading to learn the teachers stories and how their involvement with digibridge is powering a more equitable future finding their purpose middleschool science teacher keith burgess was a college biology student with his sights on medical school but an aha moment led him to get his teaching certification he envisioned the impact he believed he could make as an educator and never looked back he said he feels its his mission as a teacher to maximize his students exposure to possible careers in stem science technology engineering and math the growth for stem careers is exponentially growing so working with the students in my community and being in an underserved community my responsibility is more than teaching them about science burgess said its also how can i change your social and economic outlook through science and what opportunities will be available to you if you learn this burgess whos in his seventh year of teaching in charlotte is also currently pursuing a doctoral degree in urban education eighthgrade technology teacher torie leslie said that teaching is in her blood but she didnt embrace it as a career path until she was a college student studying computer science the reality is that teaching was always a part of my life my mother was a teacher and my grandmother was a teacher leslie said now in her 18th year as an educator leslie said she cant imagine not being in the classroom since the start of her teaching career leslie said shes felt strongly about connecting the dots between computer science and equity when i started teaching my schools offered a lot that i didnt have when i was a student so i felt compelled to make sure that whatever i was doing i was making kids aware of what was possible she said its about giving a child an opportunity to try something versus them not knowing its even an opportunity at all latasha monford a technology educator for kindergarteners through fifth graders has been teaching for 19 years she finds inspiration in leading handson activities that get her students exploring and tinkering throughout her career shes taught science workshops for girls and often leads robotics activities its amazing to see what students come up with when they are given the opportunity to solve problems and be creative she said adding that one of her students recently made a flashlight out of tape popsicle sticks and batteries making an impact beyond the classroom leslie burgess and monford continue inspiring students after school hours as facilitators through digibridge

skills we provide teachers the training resources and access to resources they need to feel empowered and inspired while teaching we want them to set an example of learning as you go sharpe said burgess said his involvement with digibridge stands out as an opportunity to reinforce what hes teaching in science class at no cost to the student its one thing to do the heavylifting by yourself but when you know you have community partners helping you with that heavylifting it makes things that much easier he said the teachers said that when students are given the opportunity to envision themselves being engineers construction workers doctors business owners and more its nothing short of inspiring the future of charlotte is in our classroom monford said social responsibility
