capture and storage technology honeywell collaborates with the university of texas at austin for innovative carbon capture and storage technology honeywell establishes licensing agreement with texas carbon management program group at the university of texas at austin new advanced solvent technology will capture carbon dioxide generated from combustion flue gases from power steel cement and other industrial plants december 15 2021 des plaines ill dec 15 2021 prnewswire honeywell nasdaq hon announced today an agreement with the university of texas at austin that will enable the lowercost capture of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and heavy industry 1 honeywell will leverage ut austins proprietary advanced solvent technology to create a new offering targeted at power steel cement and other industrial plants to lower emissions generated from combustion flue gases in new or existing units the solution provides these sectors with an additional tool to help meet regulatory requirements and sustainability goals honeywell has committed to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations and facilities by 2035 this new carbon capture technology builds on the companys track record of sharply reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of its operations and facilities as well as its decadeslong history of innovation to help its customers meet their environmental and social goals about half of honeywells new product introduction research and development investment is directed toward products that improve environmental and social outcomes for customers the licensing arrangement with ut austin expands honeywells leading carbon capture technology portfolio today 15 million tons per year of co 2 is being captured and used in storageutilization applications through honeywells co2 solutions process expertise honeywell currently has the capacity to capture 40 million tons per year through its installed projects worldwide 2 ut austins patented solution utilizes an advanced solvent which enables carbon dioxide to be captured at a lower cost through greater efficiency using smaller equipment creating viable project economics today under current co 2 policy frameworks in north america and europe 13 for a typical power plant 650 mw capacity applying advanced solvent carboncapture technology would enable the capture of about 34 million tons of co 2 annually equivalent to removing nearly 735000 cars from the road each year 4 this point source co 2 removal technology can be retrofitted within existing plants or included as part of a new installation in this process carbon dioxide is absorbed into an amine solvent and then sent to a stripper where co 2 is separated from the solvent this co 2 is then compressed for geological sequestration or used for other purposes with thousands of power and industrial plants around the world the opportunity for significant emissions reduction is enormous as the world proactively seeks technology solutions that limit greenhouse gas emissions we recognize that carbon capture technology is an important lever available today to reduce emissions in carbonintensive industries that have few alternative options such as steel plants and fossil fuel power plants said ben owens vice president and general manager honeywell sustainable technology solutions by working with ut austin our advanced solvent carbon capture system will enable lower cost of co 2 captured postcombustion 1 ut austin is a leader in carbon capture research focusing in this area for more than 20 years through its texas carbon management program txcmp gary rochelle professor at the mcketta department of chemical engineering and leader of txcmp at ut austin and his team have established an efficient secondgeneration amine scrubbing system through years of research and analysis the improved performance from this solution can unlock project economics for hard to abate industries such as steel cement and chemical plants and coal natural gas and bioenergy power plants we are thrilled that our decades of research has led to carbon capture technology that can significantly reduce carbon emissions 5 the licensing agreement with honeywell enables us to commercially scale this in ways that can make major contributions toward zero emissions efforts to address global warming and to reduce pollutants in surrounding communities rochelle said in 2020 carbon capture utilization and storage ccus projects worldwide were capturing and storingusing 40 million metric tons per year of carbon dioxide according to the international energy agency iea 6 in order to align with the iea sustainable development scenario sds which demonstrates a pathway to limit global temperature rise by less than 165 c ccus project capacity must increase more than 20 times to enable capture of 840 million metric tons per year of co 2 by 2030 7 honeywell wwwhoneywellcomusen is a fortune 100 technology
