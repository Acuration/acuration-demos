commissions second c3 oleflex unit for zhejiang satellite oleflex technology chosen for a majority of propane dehydrogenation projects in china to meet the countrys growing demand for propylene september 10 2019 des plaines ill sept 11 2019 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon announced today that zhejiang satellite petrochemical co ltd is using honeywell uops c 3 oleflex technology to produce 450000 metric tons per year of polymergrade propylene for a new petrochemicals complex in china this is the second c 3 oleflex unit now operating with satellite honeywell uop a leading provider of technologies for the oil and gas industry delivered satellites first oleflex unit in 2014 oleflex technology is helping to meet the growing demand in china for propylene a key ingredient in plastics oleflex technology has been selected for a majority of dehydrogenation projects globally since 2011 including applications for propane isobutane and mixed propane and isobutane feeds in addition to technology licensing and basic engineering design honeywell provided services equipment catalysts and adsorbents for the satellite plant zhejiang satellite chose this second oleflex unit based on the operation of its first unit which has been running for nearly five years said bryan glover vice president and general manager of honeywell uops petrochemicals and refining technologies business the second unit started up and quickly reached its design capacity so the two units together now can produce 900000 metric tons per year of propylene honeywell uops c 3 oleflex technology uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert propane into propylene the primary component of polypropylene the technology is designed to have a lower cash cost of production and higher return on investment compared with competing technologies the technologys impact on the environment is minimized by its lowenergy consumption lowemissions and fully recyclable platinumaluminabased catalyst system the independent reactor and regeneration design of the oleflex technology help maximize operating flexibility and onstream reliability propylene has historically been produced as a byproduct of refining fuels but demand for propylene has exceeded the supply from refining processes propane dehydrogenation such as the oleflex process can bridge this gap by producing onpurpose propylene from propane that is
