nextgeneration air quality technology honeywell and syracuse university establish research partnership to develop nextgeneration air quality technology honeywell to fund research by syracuse universitys college of engineering and computer science on emerging indoor air quality technologies to create healthier and safer building environments march 1 2021 atlanta and syracuse ny march 1 2021 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced it has established a research partnership with syracuse university to fund research on emerging indoor air quality technologies the partnership will include the naming of a honeywell indoor air quality laboratory at syracuse universitys college of engineering and computer science which will be used by researchers to help create healthier and safer building environments air quality is essential to a healthy building it can impact occupant health and productivity energy efficiency and real estate value the quality of air is affected by the presence of pollutants in the indoor environment that may cause harm when iaq is poor occupants can experience a drop in productivity as well as adverse health effects such as asthma and bronchitis 1 the concentration of some pollutants can be two to five times higher indoors than typical outdoor concentrations 2 indoor air quality isnt a buzz word its a critical factor in creating safer healthier building environments said manish sharma vice president and chief technology and product officer honeywell building technologies our work with syracuse will measure the performance of a variety of emerging indoor air quality technologies to not only improve occupant productivity and wellbeing but also help building owners understand the best solutions for different building environments and situations in the long term this will help them to better attract occupants manage energy efficiency and improve their real estate value this is a fantastic partnership and were excited to work with honeywell on indoor air quality research that benefits people all over the world said j cole smith dean college of engineering and computer science syracuse university professors jensen zhang and bing dong have been at the forefront of indoor air quality research and the honeywell indoor air quality lab at link hall will enhance our worldclass research abilities when private industry and academia team up we can create meaningful change this collaboration will help identify potential solutions to further improve indoor air quality and create healthier building environments to enhance the occupant experience said suresh venkatarayalu chief technology officer honeywell the honeywell indoor air quality lab at syracuse university will be used to solve several research objectives to determine the impact of air quality on human productivity and creativity faculty will use the lab to conduct direct sidebyside comparisons of nextgeneration indoor air quality improvement technologies and advanced building systems in a controlled practical building environment to provide a comparative analysis of the technologies based on key iaq parameters measured by sensors and through aidriven hvac controls the research will include characterizing and evaluating iaq sensors the research will help building owners and operators better determine the right technologies to meet specific building conditions and goals additionally the research will develop artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for dynamic ventilation management the intent is to identify new ventilation strategies that comply with ashrae 621 iaq standards while also achieving goals such as improved occupant productivity with potentially fewer sick days as well as enhanced energy savings we are excited to collaborate with honeywell indoor air quality research and development people typically spend 8090 of their times indoors and occupant exposure to the various gas particulate and biological contaminants found indoors has tremendous impacts on human health productivity and creativity said jensen zhang professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at syracuse university the honeywell and syracuse collaboration will lead to energyefficient and costeffective approaches and technologies to improving indoor environmental quality and reducing the risk of infectious disease transmission
