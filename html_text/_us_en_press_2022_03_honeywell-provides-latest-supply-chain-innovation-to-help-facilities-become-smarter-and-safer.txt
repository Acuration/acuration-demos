solutions to choose from robotic collaboration showcased at modex booth b7619a in atlanta march 2831 march 24 2022 charlotte nc march 24 2022 honeywell nasdaq hon today announced a strategic collaboration with otto motors a division of clearpath robotics giving warehouses and distribution centers throughout north america an automated option to handle some of the most laborintensive roles in an increasingly scarce job market the collaboration enables honeywell customers to increase efficiency reduce errors and improve safety by deploying ottos autonomous mobile robots amrs in their facilities these amrs provide significant productivity benefits by automating the movement of carts used to transport picked orders or returns and can travel over any floor surface smooth enough to handle a traditional cart pushed by a worker instead of spending more than half the day walking workers can simply park carts in designated pickup locations throughout the facility and call robots to retrieve them these amrs also offer a flexible and powerful way to transport pallets typically accomplished primarily with forklifts and conveyor systems supply chains continue to be stressed by staffing shortages and consumer demands driving expectations of speedy and accurate fulfillment said keith fisher president of honeywell intelligrated tackling the more dynamic unstructured environments of todays distribution centers calls for more sophisticated robots and ottos amrs have been proven to be deployed and adapted quickly to changing market conditions or peak buying seasons ottos easytoinstall amrs are smart enough to interact safely with human coworkers and other vehicles find a different route if their original path is blocked and respond to rapid changes in orders or logistics needs all without human intervention otto amrs can work in conjunction with honeywell automated solutions including its smart flexible depalletizer and nextgen asrs system further increasing efficiency and automation within the warehouse otto motors provides autonomous material handling inside manufacturing facilities and warehouses and is the technology behind some of the largest deployments of amrs in north america said matt rendall ceo and cofounder of otto motors our relationship with honeywell shows we partner with the very best integrators and tech leaders to provide business with industry expertise to automate a wide range of workflows in their facilities while amrs handle repetitive and often timeconsuming tasks increasingly scarce labor resources can be shifted
