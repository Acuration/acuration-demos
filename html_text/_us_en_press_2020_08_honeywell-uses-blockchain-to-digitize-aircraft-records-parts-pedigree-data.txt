digitize aircraft records parts pedigree data a comprehensive but simple search capability on the blockchain ledger will change the game for recordkeeping in the aerospace industry august 4 2020 atlanta aug 5 2020 prnewswire for decades aerospace companies and their customers have drowned in cumbersome documentation processes and storage mechanisms honeywell nyse hon is solving those problems by fully integrating aircraft record generation into its digital blockchain ledger this provides honeywells customers with an easy way to search and retrieve scattered data through a simple user interface creating a level of speed and efficiency never before available in the aerospace industry quick and easy access to this data is critical for airlines because most use dozens of repair facilities and the paperwork from each is not integrated additionally airlines and operators commonly deal with lost printed paperwork associated with a part this paperwork or trace documents are critical to maintaining the value of a parts worth honeywells blockchain is a secure decentralized database crowdsourced by all its authorized users each user that honeywell allows has a copy of the database and knows its contents in real time instead of storing only pdf documents or a reference to the digital aircraft record honeywell now stores the actual form data on chain this data is used to reconstruct aircraft records including records that prove the us federal aviation administration has certified that aircraft parts are safe to fly these records can be accessed by customers and in the case where paperwork is missing customers can simply input the part number and serial number and the user interface will retrieve the data from the blockchain and rebuild the missing document honeywells offering is like a search engine but it works for anything and everything related to aircraft parts and service said lisa butters general manager for honeywells godirect trade and applications owner for blockchain technologies honeywell manufactures and repairs thousands of aerospace parts each day and now all of those events including the generated air worthiness certificates go on chain in aerospace this is a gamechanging technology that will simplify and transform recordkeeping for aircraft owners and airlines around the world in its purest form blockchain technology creates trust between all parties on the chain through digital transparency the goal of the company is not to be the only aerospace company creating unified aircraft records on chain but rather to collaborate and be an implementation partner so others can leverage the same technology blockchain is unique because its a team sport said butters this isnt just about honeywell data in fact this is not just about aerospace data whether you are in aerospace automotive electronics or consumer products i envision all manufacturing oems and repair shops pushing quality documentation and part provenance data to the blockchain so customers have easy access adding data to the blockchain ledger does not replace regulatory authorities current document requirements but rather supplements them more efficiently honeywell now unpacks all that parts and repair data and makes it immutable searchable and accessible to everyone in its permissionsbased ecosystem honeywell first implemented
