contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news transforming operations at 4 iconic buildings transforming operations at 4 iconic buildings with sustainable solutions facilities leaders can more efficiently monitor maintain and protect historic landmarks odds are you can identify the eiffel tower or the sydney opera house but what you may not know is that technology has enabled the environmental transformation of those landmarks and with commercial building accounting for almost onethird of global energy consumption according to the international energy agency these solutions are critical to significantly lowering carbon emissions learn how different technologies have helped transform these four iconic buildings making operations more sustainable and streamlined sydney opera house with its roof of prominent white sails the sydney opera house is one of the most renowned landmarks in australia in 2013 the opera house began a decadelong overhaul of its building management system with the goal of reducing carbon consumption by 14 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2023 in partnership with honeywell the sydney opera houses intelligent evolution introduced more sustainable building technologies to better conserve energy and water the new controls allow operators to view information about all its systems and subsystems from a single dashboard readily identify issues and quickly respond the venues upgraded operating system also enables dynamic controls based on room usage for example air conditioning now cools certain areas only during performances advancements like these have put the worldclass performing arts venue on track for a fivestar rating from the green building council of australia up from its fourstar rating in 2015 whats more the new systems were implemented with minimal disruption to the more than 2000 events hosted at the sydney opera house each year buda castle buda castle encompasses budapests most important attractions museums theaters libraries hotels churches and more first constructed in 1247 the palace recognized as a unesco world heritage site has expanded and modernized through the centuries in 2000 its it systems were due for extensive upgrades using honeywell solutions the castles modern building automation system streamlines operations connects data sources and processes and enhances protections for the scores of culturally significant artifacts housed within the castle walls the integrated system includes alarms building access surveillance cooling and heating operations communications lighting and other components of the castles centralized it network uniting these solutions within a single system enables greater visibility and more efficient response by buda castles it team and it creates more opportunities for sustainable operations johan cruijff arena the johan cruijff arena jca in amsterdam home of the afc ajax and the dutch national football teams was already one of the worlds most sustainable stadiums when it identified challenges with its central database and building management system with that database gathering and processing information about ticketing safety and security energy consumption and more the arena needed a building management system that could integrate that data into operations to further improve performance and fan experience johan cruijff arena partnered with honeywell on an integrated building solution driven by analytics and iotenabled technology it taps into the stadiums network of sensors which monitor the buildings energy storage system created from used electric vehicle batteries and powered by 4200 solar panels a wind turbine an energygenerating escalator and other inputs as well as other connected equipment throughout the complex using machine learning the platform connects data from assets processes and thirdparty applications to generate actionable insights for the arenas operations staff the improved database functionality this innovation made possible enables prompt responses to issues within the stadium and datadriven decisionmaking as a result the arenas teams can more creatively engage with visitors bring down costs and
