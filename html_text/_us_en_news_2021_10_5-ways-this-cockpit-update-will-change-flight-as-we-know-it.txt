for contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news 5 ways this cockpit update will change flight as we know it 5 ways this cockpit update will change flight as we know it in honor of our new avionics system honeywell anthem we break down why the cockpit is key to innovation in flight have you peeked into the cockpit on an airplane a lot happens in there its where pilots not only power fly and land the aircraft but it also houses important navigation information and vital data about how the aircraft is working and parts that may need maintenance no matter the size or type of aircraft youre on the pilots controls may look relatively similar a dashboard covered in buttons levers and a mix of analog and digital screens the controls youve seen in recent years maybe like the photo above may not have appeared to vary much but a major upgrade is on the horizon thats about to take us to a new era of flight enter honeywell anthem our new avionics system that gives pilots and crews the flight and aircraft data they need for smarter and smoother flights plus its able to be used in aircraft beyond commercial and business jets meaning a future of flying taxis is closer than ever heres a closer look at how flying with this system is set to change the typical flight experience less time waiting for maintenance then to access and transfer data about the aircraft and its equipment both mechanics and pilots had to be onboard the aircraft with a wired connection potentially causing delays in maintenance now cloud connected for the first time the avionics system allows pilots and mechanics to access information about the flight or equipment even if theyre not personally on the aircraft before an aircraft lands or takes off and even if the aircraft is powered off mechanics and crew can see if theres an equipment fault and start working on a solution ready for takeoff faster then for pilots and crew preparing for a flight could often amount to ample time in the cockpit where theyd complete pretakeoff tasks manually before revving up the aircraft now once they arrive on the aircraft and power up anthem pilots can find their flight plan already preloaded making it faster to get off the ground bringing alwayson cloud connectivity to the cockpit helps pilots save up to 45 minutes of time before trips by minimizing the preflight tasks they have to complete manually smoother flights then a dashboard comprised solely of traditional radar displays and analog navigation tools only gives pilots so many ways to look at and out their aircraft when its on the ground and in the air now with digital displays that mimic the quality of a smartphone screen pilots get a clear view of whats around and ahead of them integrated with tools like 3d maps the system can also help reduce the potential for ground collisions and other aviation incidents on the runway by 50 plus pilots can customize whats on their dashboard whether they rearrange how the tools are ordered or add a thirdparty app to show what the weathers like where theyre landing simplified pilot training then using traditional dashboard displays and complex maps during simulations or flights can be complicated for pilotsintraining soon equipped with the clearest symbology yet and trackbased synthetic vision system svs to give pilots an easytounderstand view of their flight and route honeywell anthem is designed to help every pilot feel comfortable in the cockpit the skys the limit then the traditional cockpit is built for commercial aircraft rotorcraft like helicopters and business jets soon in addition to the above honeywell anthem is also designed to be used in urban air mobility or uam aircraft which are lowflying electric vehicles designed to transport people across and between metropolitan areas the avionics system will be used in vertical aerospaces piloted zeroemissions electric batterypowered aircraft and in the lilium jet which holds six passengers and is the worlds first electric jet that takes off and lands vertically aerospace related content tracking recent extreme weather with the swot satellite mission to mars how innovation will take us there a
