to adopt honeywells groundbreaking godirect maintenance service may 18 2017 shanghai may 18 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon has signed an agreement for hainan airlines to become the first airline in the world to use honeywells godirect maintenance service program which uses connectivity and data analytics to improve maintenance operations and reduce equipment downtime specifically hnas current fleet of more than 50 airbus a330s will be outfitted with honeywells connected auxiliary power unit apu predictive maintenance service to improve fleet availability by identifying potential mechanical issues or failures before they happen honeywell will also outfit hnas future fleet of more than 40 a330s with the same service totaling more than 90 a330s using this honeywell godirect maintenance service the connected apu service works by using an existing data connection on the plane to download apu maintenance and fault data to predict impending hardware failures those failures are routinely the highest cause of apu interruptions that fault data is then shared with honeywell and analyzed before being presented back to hainan airlines maintenance team in an easytounderstand visual manner the data identifies what maintenance actions are required to fix the apu and avoid an unscheduled maintenance event the business and passenger impact of honeywells connected apu service for hainan airlines is significant not only will the airline receive better and more predictive maintenance services that will reduce mechanical delays and cancellations it will also improve firsttime fix rate reduce false removals and improve passenger experience said brian davis vice president airlines asia pacific honeywell aerospace this is a monumental agreement not only for honeywell and hainan airlines but for the aerospace industry as it undergoes a digital transformation thats opening up new forms of datasharing and changing the industry as we know it we are committed to providing our

airlines honeywells godirect maintenance service helps us maintain this commitment by reducing apu downtime keeping our planes in the air more often to do what we need them to do which is getting passengers to their destinations safely and on time the future of connected maintenance managing unscheduled maintenance events can be both costly and timeconsuming for an airline causing delays that put ontime performance at risk that is why honeywell with more than 80 product lines and nosetotail technologies is using its expertise to change the concept of airplane maintenance as only it can as part of its suite of connected aircraft services honeywells godirect maintenance services program will keep airline maintenance groups a step ahead of any potential issues before they ground a plane thereby reducing operational disruptions and costs in fact existing trials of honeywells predictive maintenance services resulted in a 35 percent reduction in inoperative equipment and a significant reduction in operational disruptions with a false positive rate of less than 1 percent whether analyzing data to catch a potential issue with an apu before it becomes a problem or informing a pilot
