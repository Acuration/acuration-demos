elementary school flash forward the way i make music is intertwined with technology ai is a newer more advanced form of computing that is going to change the way we do everything driving authenticating identities education criminal justice and many jobs in customer service and clerktype roles that will eventually go away for every job category that goes away ai will create a whole class of new roles we dont even know about yet one emerging job is teaching computers to recognize the human voice the tone the accents and multiple languages another role is bias prevention if machines are making decisions but they are using flawed logic or contain innate bias the current state of discriminatory behavior will just perpetuate itself youve been producing performing and making music during the pandemic what is that like music has been my retreat a place to focus my concerns and express how i feel about what is going on in the world making music that black eyed peas can share and help lift peoples spirits and spread happiness is important to us not traveling as much has actually been great for productivity in terms of producing the black eyed peas first album in eight years and this album includes five mega hit singles weve gotten really creative and are using technology to perform remotely and in socially distant safe ways to appear on tv specials and during live events around the world we are rising up to work around roadblocks that are temporary challenges what things have you been doing to adjust to spending less time traveling and more time at home traveling less frequently has given me more time to make music to focus on running my businesses and also finding new ways to harness technology to work around obstacles presented by not being able to gather perform before a live audience or travel im also spending more time on my personal fitness working out every day and riding my bike more often since going out to eat in restaurants has been interrupted im cooking more at home and have become my own vegan chef covid19 innovation safety related content the future is ai and the next big breakthroughs mission to mars how innovation will take
