efficient route manual intervention is always possible when needed asmgcs also helps to provide clear instruction to pilots and vehicle operators allowing them to easily follow assigned routes indicating which areas are restricted or unavailable for use follow the greens icn is among the first airports to adopt follow the greens an intelligent guidance procedure functioning alongside asmgcs technology to help improve capacity and safety these systems use taxiway lighting to efficiently direct crews and aircrafts only activating segments of taxiway lighting that are needed leaving others switched off this protocol helps improve the safety of runway traffic by distributing aircrafts more evenly across taxiways and addressing potential conflicts sooner rather than later this work is
