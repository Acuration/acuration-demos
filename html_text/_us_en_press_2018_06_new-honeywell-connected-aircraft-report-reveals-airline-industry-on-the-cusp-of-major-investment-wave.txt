connected aircraft report features survey responses from maintenance personnel flight and ground crew fleet management personnel and other key stakeholders in the commercial airline sector on near and longterm technology purchase plans connected aircraft technologies are seen as one of the most important longterm investments to improve allaround operations and competitive standing within the industry the benefits of these technologies also go well beyond passenger entertainment in the cabin the next wave of investment in connectivity is to address three main challenges maintenance effectiveness fuel consumption and aircraft turnaround time challenge no 1 maintenance maintenance issues routinely cause airlines to ground aircraft minutes before departure which is never ideal for a business that relies on taking off and arriving on time and safely these delays cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars a year and contribute significantly to passenger dissatisfaction

top priority in the report with 88 percent of respondents labeling it as an extremely important or a very important investment in my business commercial aviation safety and reliability is paramount therefore it is high priority to provide preventive predictive and reliable maintenance said one respondent from an aircraft original equipment manufacturer oem we want to be able to predict when a component is about to fail and change it before it does said a fleet management professional at a passenger airline challenge no 2 fuel consumption fuel typically accounts for 20 to 40 percent of an airlines operating costs if airlines can reduce the amount of fuel used that will make a dramatic impact on the bottom line therefore its no surprise that 73 percent of survey respondents listed fuel efficiency as extremely important or very important to an airlines investment plan we are one of the biggest domestic operators with comparatively lower turnaround time so fuel use data is a big concern for us we are operating in a very busy environment if a single flight is disrupted it becomes a great concern to manage the schedule said a fleet management employee at a passenger airline saving fuel shortening or eliminating delays and having better realtime information will result in lower operational costs on the customer side we want to be the brand of choice the new generation of business travelers our most lucrative customer wants to be connected at all times and have information readily available the airline that can provide this will have a competitive advantage said a ground operations employee at a passenger airline challenge no 3 aircraft turnaround time to keep passengers happy and costs on track pushing back from the gate in a timely manner for ontime arrivals is important passenger experience was one of the top reasons for airlines to invest in the connected aircraft with 76 percent of respondents listing it as extremely important or very important connectedrelated purchases will increase operational efficiency improve fleet management provide energy efficiency ensure flight safety give customers delight and reduce aircraft turnaround time and costs said an aircraft research and development expert at an aircraft oem big investment now bigger investment later investing in the connected aircraft is important for airlines around the globe in fact 81 percent of respondents cited connected technologies as a high or very high priority for their business and while 86 percent of respondents said they were looking to make a connected aircraft purchase over the next year the number jumps to 95 percent over the next five years connectivity technologies are a high priority because of the accurate statistical data they provide in all sorts of ways its very important in this industry to have tools that help you be proactive rather than reactive connectivityrelated products go a long way in making this approach possible said a ground operations professional from a passenger airline according to the report 61 percent of respondents are planning to spend more in the next year than they currently do on connected aircraft technology and 69 percent are planning to spend even more in the next five years airlines are also willing to give that investment time to pay off 27 percent expect a return between 12 and 18 months and 28 percent expect a return between 19 months and three years about half of the respondents expect to spend up to 1 million per aircraft on connectivity technologies over the next year with most looking to spend 100k to 500k the bigger jump is seen over the next five years with 38 percent of respondents reporting that they expect to spend at least 1 million per aircraft on connected technology during
