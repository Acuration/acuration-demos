monitoring outcome based service for mechanical systems uses data analytics and sensorbased internet of things iot connectivity to monitor the health and performance of mechanical equipment helping uncover issues and faults that can impact system performance and efficiency a building is much like a living breathing organism from its basic framework to the central nervous system of controls and the very heart of it all the mechanical hardware that keeps everything operating said john rajchert president of building solutions honeywell home and building technologies keeping watch and maintaining these systems is possible with the right connectivity and knowledge which weve made possible with honeywell outcome based service it now extends to mechanical systems providing even more data and insights to promote improved performance and maintenance of building health outcome based service for mechanical systems monitors mechanical equipment performance in line with key performance

equipment and their key components from boilers and chillers to other hardware that make up the core equipment of a building in near real time helping uncover many faults and anomalies faster than traditional routine maintenance the new service module also taps sensor data to monitor the asset health of individual mechanical equipment comparing actual equipment performance with optimal operational performance values to identify deviations this helps alert personnel to many issues sooner than traditional maintenance so organizations may have the opportunity to make changes or fixes before they lead to costlier and more disruptive problems the deviations also help inform conditionbased dynamic tasking as to when and how to address mechanical system maintenance needs such as when to replace air filters on hvac equipment the asset health kpis can also provide deeper insights into the duration or useful life of mechanical equipment because not all equipment degrades at the same rate organizations can make betterinformed financial and maintenance decisions about repairing or replacing equipment honeywells connected services portfolio outcome based service for mechanical
