top innovations of 2020 top innovations of 2020 the pandemic caused global challenges and spurred new inventions this year was like no other it was defined by the rapid spread of covid19 around the world in response it created demand like never before as the world changed momenttomoment we transformed manufacturing facilities to make millions of n95 masks to help health care workers and governments help fight the coronavirus we also created new technologies to help industries in the shortterm combat the pandemic and prepare for the future here are the top innovations of the year quantum computing becomes reality what this year we released honeywell system model h1 quantum computer with a quantum volume of 128 the computer is now available commercially to enterprises seeking to leverage quantum computing as part of their technology roadmap why its innovative a focus on reducing errors and producing the highest quality quantum operations builds trust that quantum computers can deliver accurate and reliable results to problems that can currently be confirmed using classical methods as these problems grow beyond what classical computers can handle trust in the accuracy of the underlying technology becomes paramount collisionavoidance for drones what it is a lightweight radar the intuvue rdr84k radar system can help detect other air traffic birds and weather why its innovative in addition to detecting obstacles it can provide alternative navigation if the primary guidance fails and assist with accurate automated landings it saves weight and space by replacing other sensors which is key for urban air mobility uam vehicles like air taxis and unmanned aerial vehicles like drones millions of masks what it is in order to combat covid19 healthcare workers needed personal protective equipment ppe to help treat patients in response we transformed existing facilities around the world to make n95 masks to meet the demand by frontline workers why its innovative building the setup to manufacture masks usually takes about nine months but as covid19 spread the process had to move fast as a result the new setup at our rhode island facility was completed in just five weeks and n95 masks were rolling off the production line by april buildings that protect people what it is as the pandemic spread around the world offices became vacant but certain buildings had to be kept up and running including manufacturing facilities and hospitals we used technology that analyzes air quality safety and security to building owners minimize potential risks of contamination that includes monitoring both the building environment and building occupants behaviors why its innovative technology helps reassure occupants that buildings are safer to return our healthy buildings solutions can support the needs of any building and features specific solutions for premium commercial buildings airports hospitality healthcare stadiums schools and universities uvc light used in new ways what it is honeywells uv treatment system uses uvc light inside aircraft cabins treating hightouch surfaces such as trays seats aisles and luggage bins why its innovative uvc light as a disinfectant itself isnt a new concept its been used for about four decades to disinfect drinking water wastewater and more according to the international ultraviolet association iuva but applying the treatment to a plane cabin is a big deal the system can run the length of a narrowbody aircraft in 10 minutes or less visibility to whats in the air what it is particles in the air are no longer invisible with the air detective we use technology analyze an air sample and record them with holographic images those images are then sent to the cloud for onthespot analysis of the types of spores pollens and other airborne particles why its innovative a powerful holographic microscope powered by ai allows heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac technicians to take a snapshot of the air inside your home no need to wait for a sample to get sent to a lab operating remotely what it is from fire alarm systems to industrial facilities we helped the world pivot to remote operations for example honeywells connected life safety systems enable fire technicians to operate a buildings fire panel with the cloud meanwhile our honeywell process solutions pivoted a critical process control facility in orange texas to remote operations why its innovative many facility maintenance teams are working with reduced staff and have limited access to facilities due to shutdowns with remote operations fewer staff can be onsite and critical tasks can still be performed machine learning cyberprotection what it is as soon as a hacker attempts malicious behavior in an industrial setting our machinelearning based application knows about it why its innovative identifying security issues in industrial control systems and industrial internet of things technology is increasingly important communications abnormalities can indicate hardware problems anomalies security and configuration issues and even cyberattacks 3dprinted engine parts what it is we created the first certified flightcritical engine part using 3d printing formally known as additive manufacturing why its innovative by 3d printing critical parts manufacturers can produce parts more quickly and in smaller quantities during this process components are built from the bottom up with layers of powdered metal fused on top of one another using a laser covid19 innovation related content the future is ai and
