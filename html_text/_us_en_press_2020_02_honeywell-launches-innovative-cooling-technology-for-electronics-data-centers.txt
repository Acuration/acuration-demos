cooling technology for electronics data centers new solstice ecooling heat transfer agents cool data centers and other electronic applications with greater efficiency reduced environmental impact february 2 2020 orlando fla feb 4 2020 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced the launch of a breakthrough platform of liquid heat transfer agents that cool highperformance electronics more efficiently and effectively than traditional methods that use air and water these new heat transfer agents lower operational costs for applications such as data centers that use highperformance servers solstice ecooling the newest addition to honeywells revolutionary line of nextgeneration lowglobalwarming potential refrigerant technologies uses a twophase liquid cooling process to remove heat from electronic applications while reducing environmental impact the new technology is available now and being previewed at the air conditioning heating and refrigeration expo ahr in orlando fla honeywell works to develop solutions that help the world prepare for the future and with the global demand for more data and processing there is an overwhelming need for efficient and effective cooling mechanisms said chris lapietra vice president and general manager honeywell stationary refrigerants with solstice ecooling data centers and other highperformance electronics can increase efficiency while lowering costs and their carbon footprint data centers currently use about 3 of the worlds electricity and that number is expected to rise to 8 by 2030 according to research by global markets insights gmi with cooling systems accounting for approximately 40 of total energy consumption the need for intelligent and energyefficient solutions is expected to drive data center cooling market growth the twophase solstice ecooling process allows for more energyefficient and uniform cooling better heat rejection and reduced pumping power than singlephase liquid cooling where fluid remains in its liquid form throughout the cooling process solstice ecooling is also a dielectric solution serving as an electrical insulator for equipment to prevent damage from contact with fluids honeywell has a long history of innovation in developing leading heat transfer agents including r410a solstice yf solstice ze and solstice zd with an ultralow gwp and zero ozone depletion potential solstice ecooling allows for improved cooling capabilities while minimizing environmental impact along with its extensive heat transfer agent portfolio honeywell has commercialized applications to prove the viability of twophase liquid cooling and to test products like solstice ecooling for global adoption honeywell is a world leader in the development manufacturing and supply of refrigerants sold worldwide under the solstice and genetron brands for a wide range of applications including refrigeration and building and automobile air conditioning honeywell and its suppliers have completed a
