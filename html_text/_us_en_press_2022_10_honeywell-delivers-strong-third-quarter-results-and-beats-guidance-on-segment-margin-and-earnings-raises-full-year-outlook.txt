driven by working capital as a result of improved receivables and inventory honeywell executed exceptionally well in the third quarter meeting or exceeding guidance for all metrics said darius adamczyk chairman and chief executive officer of honeywell despite ongoing challenges across supply chains we grew sales by 6 on a reported basis and 9 organically 1 with strong doubledigit growth in our advanced materials commercial aerospace and building products businesses our backlog remains near record levels closing the third quarter at 291 billion 5 up 9 year over year and providing us with confidence in our demand expectations against an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic backdrop we continued to reap the benefits of our honeywell digital transformation investments made over the past few years and we leveraged these digital tools to drive agile commercial and operational actions which enabled us to stay ahead of the inflation curve expand margins and beat the high end of our adjusted eps guidance we also executed on our capital deployment strategy deploying 12 billion in the quarter including 04 billion of share repurchases and raising our dividend for the 13th time over 12 consecutive years adamczyk continued the honeywell playbook continues to deliver outstanding results as we successfully maneuver through a challenged operating environment these operating principles combined with our attractive endmarket exposures and differentiated portfolio of solutions will allow us to maintain resiliency and continue successfully navigating the current economic crosscurrents the third quarter was a strong performance for honeywell and i remain confident that our best quarters lie ahead as a result of the companys thirdquarter performance and managements

quarter were up 6 year over year on a reported basis and 9 year over year on an organic basis 1 the thirdquarter financial results can be found in tables 2 and 3 aerospace sales for the third quarter were up 10 year over year on an organic basis 1 led by growth in commercial aviation commercial aftermarket demand remained strong as flight hours continued to recover with both air transport aftermarket and business and general aviation aftermarket sales growing over 20 organically commercial original equipment sales increased 30 year over year in the third quarter primarily driven by higher shipset deliveries to air transport customers increased commercial aviation sales were partially offset by lower defense volumes segment margin expanded 40 basis points to 275 led by commercial excellence partially offset by cost inflation honeywell building technologies sales for the third quarter were up 19 on an organic basis 1 year over year including 23 organic sales growth in the building products portfolio building solutions also grew double digits organically in the quarter led by increased project volumes segment margin expanded 60 basis points to 241 due to commercial excellence partially offset by cost inflation performance materials and technologies sales for the third quarter were up 14 on an organic basis 1 year over year despite an approximate 3 headwind from russia sales growth was led by advanced materials which grew more than 30 organically due to continued pricing actions and improved volumes sales strength was also driven by refining catalyst shipments and thermal solutions both of which were up double digits in the quarter this growth was partially offset by lower equipment volumes in uop and lost russian sales 2 orders increased double digits year over year headlined by strength in fluorine products within advanced materials segment margin expanded 40 basis points to 226 primarily due to commercial excellence partially offset by cost inflation safety and productivity solutions sales for the third quarter decreased 4 on an organic basis 1 year over year strength in the advanced sensing and gas detection portions of our sensing and safety technologies business and growth in productivity solutions and services was offset by lower volumes in warehouse and workflow solutions and personal protective equipment segment margin reached the highest level since 4q18 expanding 250 basis points year over year to 157 primarily driven by commercial excellence and favorable business mix partially offset by cost inflation in july
