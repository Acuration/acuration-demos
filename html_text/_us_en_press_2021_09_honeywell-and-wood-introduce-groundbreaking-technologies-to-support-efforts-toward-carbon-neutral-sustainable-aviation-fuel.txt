support efforts toward carbonneutral sustainable aviation fuel honeywell and wood introduce groundbreaking technologies to support efforts toward carbonneutral sustainable aviation fuel woods hydrogen plant technology coupled with honeywell uop ecofiningtm process technology and carbon capture and storage can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions 100 when compared to petroleumbased aviation fuels widespread use of honeywell and wood technologies have potential to remove the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2030 september 23 2021 des plaines ill and aberdeen scotland sept 23 2021 prnewswire honeywell nasdaq hon and wood lse wg today announced a comprehensive package of technologies to support the effort to produce carbonneutral aviation fuel when used together the technologies which are based on honeywells uop ecofining process technology and woods hydrogen plant technology could reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions ghg by 100 using certain feedstocks when compared to traditional petroleum aviation fuel the uop ecofining process technology converts waste oils fats and greases into honeywell green jet fuel tm a dropin replacement for jet fuel when using a feedstock such as used cooking oils lifecycle ghg emissions can be reduced by 80 at this stage compared to conventional petroleum jet fuel as the next step in enhancing the ecofining process technology offering woods technology will be integrated to use the byproducts of the uop ecofining process technology to produce renewable hydrogen reducing lifecycle ghg emissions a further 10 when compared to the total ghg emissions produced by conventional petroleum jet fuel the renewable hydrogen is then injected back into the honeywell ecofining process to remove feed impurities and create a cleaner burning renewable fuel the carbon dioxide co 2 that is generated from the production of the hydrogen can be captured and routed for permanent underground sequestration using the honeywell h 2 solutions technology suite further reducing lifecycle ghg emissions an additional 10 when compared to the total ghg emissions produced by conventional petroleum jet fuel the combination of technologies results in an aviation fuel that is effectively carbon neutral compared to petroleum fuels the combination of these technologies from honeywell and wood greatly reduces fossil carbon dioxide emissions compared to traditional fuels by using byproducts to provide hydrogen for the ecofining process said ben owens vice president and general manager of honeywell sustainable technology solutions as a result a renewable fuels refinery can be essentially selfsustaining in hydrogen production while reducing the carbon intensity of the renewable fuels to very low levels wood has a rich history of collaborating on technology developments with honeywell and together we are now producing solutions for the production of carbonneutral renewable fuels said andy hemingway president energy optimization and innovation at wood this solution utilizes our longestablished experience in hydrogen plant technology to help fuel producers reduce operating costs while meeting sustainability goals with proven reliable and efficient technologies recently the us department of energy doe the us department of transportation dot the us department of agriculture usda and other federal government agencies worked together to introduce the sustainable aviation fuel grand challenge with a goal to produce 3 billion gallons per year of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 in the us if those 3 billion gallons of saf were produced using honeywells comprehensive package of technologies it could result in the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of cumulative carbon dioxide avoided per year depending on the oil and fat feedstock mix used the uop ecofining process has been used for commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel since 2016 by world energy in california the facility remains the only 100 renewable jet fuel unit in the world the ecofining technology is used in most 100biofeed units producing renewable diesel and all the licensed renewable jet fuel production in the world today honeywell uop currently has licensed 22 ecofining units in nine countries around the world processing 12 different types of renewable feedstocks wood is a ftse
