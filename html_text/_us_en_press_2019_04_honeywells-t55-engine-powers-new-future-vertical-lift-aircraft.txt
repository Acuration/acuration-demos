costs increase aircraft readiness and lower the fuel burn all while increasing the aircrafts useful load and flight range the t55 engine has been powering the us armys chinook helicopters for generations but this latest variant in the series of engine modernizations positions the army to take advantage of nextgeneration technologies while maintaining the support infrastructure it needs to move forward with its future vertical lift platform that platform will comprise a family of five military helicopters for the united states armed forces all of which share common hardware such as sensors avionics and engines while the focus of the latest t55 variant is on fuel savings reliability and maintainability the improvements also create a downstream result of greater horsepower the new
