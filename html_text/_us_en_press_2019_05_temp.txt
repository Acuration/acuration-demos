for calcasieu pass export facility venture global lng selects honeywell modular lng pretreatment technology for calcasieu pass export facility may 12 2019 des plaines ill may 13 2019 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon announced today that venture global lng inc will use a series of technologies from honeywell uop to remove various contaminants from natural gas prior to liquefaction at its calcasieu pass lng export facility in cameron parish louisiana honeywell uop will provide engineering procurement and fabrication services for the complex which when completed will produce 10 million tons per annum mtpa of liquefied natural gas lng for export to markets in asia europe and other locations with this project honeywell uop is helping venture global lng build a facility that provides the lowestcost supply of lng by using largescale highperformance equipment said ben owens vice president and general manager of honeywell uops gas processing and hydrogen business by delivering this technology in modular form we can reduce construction and installation costs compared with traditional fieldconstructed systems honeywell uop is an established leader in advanced proprietary technologies for gas pretreatment and were pleased to be partnered with them on this critical project said bob pender coceo of venture global lng these technologies are proven and reliable and the delivery of those technologies in modular form provides better quality and adherence to delivery schedules added coceo mike sabel the project will include a honeywell uop mercury removal unit mru and three separate trains each consisting of an acid gas removal unit agru and molecular sieve dehydration unit taken together these modular units will remove water mercury carbon dioxide and sulfur from 16 billion standard cubic feet per day of natural gas so it can be liquefied and safely transported to customers on oceangoing vessels mercury occurs naturally in small concentrations in most natural gas effective mercury removal processes are necessary to protect cryogenic equipment used to liquefy natural gas uops nonregenerable adsorbents in the mru remove even trace quantities of mercury effectively other naturally occurring contaminants such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide often referred to as acid gases must be removed from natural gas before it can be liquefied the natural gas is treated by passing it through an amine solution in the agru after being treated the natural gas is dehydrated using uop molecular sieves to remove all the water to prevent freezing in the cryogenic liquefaction process honeywell uop is the global leader in gas processing technologies its solutions for contaminant removal and hydrocarbon management are used to produce 40 percent of the worlds liquefied natural gas these technologies are optimized for onshore and offshore natural gas conditioning treating and natural gas liquids recovery lng pretreatment and synthesis gas purification from singleunit to highly integrated multiple technology operations venture global lng is a longterm lowcost provider of lng to be supplied from resource rich north american natural gas basins venture global lng has begun construction of the 10 mtpa venture global calcasieu pass facility at the intersection of the calcasieu ship channel and the gulf of mexico and is developing the 20
