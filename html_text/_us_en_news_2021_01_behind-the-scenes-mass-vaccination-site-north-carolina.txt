thousands of shots a day the charlotte motor speedway recently hosted a different kind of race the site served as a north carolina mass vaccination clinic where hundreds of atrium health medical staff worked to speed up the delivery of covid19 vaccines to eligible individuals this enabled about 5000 people a day to receive their first of two shots more than 10 times the amount administered at community clinics the effort is part of a publicprivate partnership between honeywell atrium health tepper sports entertainment and the state of north carolina and backed by gov roy cooper heres a look at what happened behind the scenes patients stay in their vehicles a steady stream of cars entered the speedway snaking along the track and throughout the site because of the ultracold storage
