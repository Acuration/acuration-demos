2020 the intentions gathered from respondents are consistent with what the oems reported to investors in q2 an increase in delivery pace during the first half of 2023 which further aligns with the industrys efforts to scale up production in response to recordhigh backlogs our industry is on the upswing operators are showing confidence with plans to expand their fleets at a faster rate than any time in the previous decade notably we are excited by the recent announcements from fractional operators indicating their intent to acquire several hundred new jets including midsize and supermidsize jets powered by honeywell htf engines said heath patrick president americas aftermarket honeywell aerospace theres also a positive shift toward sustainability as operators are keen to reduce carbon emissions additionally new users in business aviation have increased demand by 500 aircraft and 6 more flights over the next 10 years this along with expected doubledigit increases in turbofan deliveries in 2023 and 2024 shows our industrys commitment to meeting growing demand key findings in the 2023 honeywell global business aviation outlook include new business jet deliveries in 2024 are expected to be 10 higher than in 2023 expenditures are expected to be 13 higher fiveyear purchase plans for new business jets are up two percentage points compared with last years survey this surpasses 2019 levels and is equivalent to 19 of the current fleet fleet additions are up for the third year in a row topping 3 of the fleet new jet deliveries and expenditures over the next decade

more and just 7 expect to fly less large longrange and ultralongrange aircraft classes are expected to account for about 69 of all expenditures of new business jets in the next five years 4 of surveyed operators plan to dispose of an aircraft without replacement which is double of the rate gleaned in 2022 most citing retirement or death of the aircraft owner sustainability in business aviation honeywell is committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 in its operations and facilities and to driving aviation sustainability with a wide range of readynow solutions that will support a more sustainable future for the sector this years survey for the third consecutive year features a dedicated section on operators current and future plans to reduce their carbon footprint during operations almost 60 of this years surveyed operators report currently implementing at least one method to reduce their carbon footprint which is 10 percentage points above last years survey the most frequently mentioned current method to reduce carbon footprint is fewer private jet trips in favor of commercial flying 31 followed by slower cruising speeds 18 67 of operators plan to either adopt or increase methods for more environmentally friendly operations in the future and 40 cite saf as the most common way to achieve this goal the survey asked the remaining 33 what would compel them to adopt any methods to address sustainability in the future and 65 of these operators cited economic incentives such as tax benefits or operating cost savings followed by 44 citing government regulations regional breakdown and preowned aircraft north america north american fleets account for 64 of the fiveyear new jet deliveries this years share is on par with last years and is likely driven by 90 of north american respondents believing that the economy will at least remain the same if not improve this makes north america the most optimistic region in 2023 europe european operators will make up 14 of the fiveyear new jet deliveries this is one percentage point below last years share driven by economic uncertainty and a strong focus on sustainability in this continent latin america operators in the latin american region will make up 5 of global deliveries in the next five years two percentage points below 2022s share nearly 70 of latin american operators report that local economic conditions will remain the same or decline in the near future making this region the most pessimistic asia pacific this region will make up 11 of new jet demand over the next five years one percentage point up from the previous year operators here have seen the secondhighest business aviation utilization growth in 2023 behind only the middle east middle east africa fleets here will account for 6 of the fiveyear new jet deliveries this is two percentage points above last years share this region accounted for the most growth in bizav flights in 2023 preowned aircraft fiveyear purchase plans for used jets total 27 of the current fleet just one percentage point below last years results after recordhigh demand for used jets the past two years 2023 will see a slight increase in the inventory of jets available for sale update on new users of business and private aviation the business aviation industry experienced a surge in firsttime private aviation users and buyers after the onset of the covid19 pandemic at certain points in 2022 this trend drove flight activity to levels not seen since 2007 however in 2023 global flight activity declined and is expected to decrease this year by approximately 4 compared with 2022 this decline can be attributed to factors such as inflation and the resumption of commercial air service on key routes furthermore the pace of new orders for jets has slowed down while oems focus on meeting current demand by significantly increasing production rates over the next several years it is anticipated that flight activity will stabilize in 2024 and return to growth in 2025 driven by an accelerated pace in ipos corporate profits and easing inflation rates consequently we will be able to assess in 2024 how many of these new users and buyers have remained in the business aviation sector and determine their longterm impact however a large impact is already being felt 500 additional bizjets the precovid 2020 longterm new jet delivery forecast contained just over 8000 aircraft for the 20242033 period while the latest 32nd annual honeywell outlook forecasts 8500 6 more flight activity 2023 flight activity is still expected to finish at least 10 above 2019 levels if we assume a historically consistent average annual growth rate of 1 to 2 it can be anticipated that 2023 will conclude with flight activity 2 to 6 above where the industry would have been if it had not been impacted by covid making an impact on business decisions the global business aviation outlook reflects current operator concerns and
