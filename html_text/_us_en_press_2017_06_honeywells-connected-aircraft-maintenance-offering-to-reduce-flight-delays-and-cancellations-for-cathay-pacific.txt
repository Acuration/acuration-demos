godirect connected maintenance saved cathay pacific several hundred thousand dollars in operational and reactive maintenance costs per aircraft and reduced apurelated delay minutes by 51 percent cathay pacific is also considering extending the godirect connected maintenance program to the airlines fleet of boeing b777s to improve ontime departures and reduce maintenance costs a new era of connected maintenance honeywells connected aircraft services demonstrate to airlines that being connected improves not only the passenger experience but also allows an aircraft to become a more comprehensive and agile platform that makes flying safer more efficient and costeffective managing unscheduled maintenance events can be both costly and timeconsuming for an airline causing delays that put ontime performance at risk thats why honeywell with more than 80 product lines and nosetotail technologies is using its expertise to change the concept of airplane maintenance the predictive fault analyses from the godirect connected maintenance program have a false positive rate of less than 1 percent these analyses highlight the most critical faults to repair giving actionable
