us armys ch47 chinook honeywells t55 engine upgrade to provide more power better fuel efficiency for us armys ch47 chinook new variant of predominant chinook engine meets the exacting requirements for army aviation heavylift missions october 13 2019 washington oct 14 2019 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon is finalizing a new and improved t55 engine to power the us armys chinook helicopters the newest upgrade for the legendary t55 will offer over 20 more power at sea level a nearly 10 power increase at high and hot altitudes and use 9 less fuel than before this new variant of the t55 will also greatly reduce ownership costs improving the overall value of what is already one of the most battletested engines in the history of warfare this current round of optimization and riskreduction testing is a continuation of honeywells internally funded upgrade program for the t55 which has powered chinook helicopters around the globe for more than five decades the new t55 also represents the lowest risk to integrate onto the chinook as it already fits in the existing nacelle and maintains all the same connections to the aircraft honeywell is committed to continually improving the t55 engine to meet military needs and developing reliable timetested engines that require less maintenance and can withstand harsh environments said dave marinick vice president engines honeywell aerospace our dedication in continually improving the t55 is a testament to more than five successful decades working alongside the us army to protect and serve its soldiers the new t55 updates do not require changes to the helicopter engine mount or engine interfaces making the t55 engine the ideal dropin replacement the upgrades include advanced compressor technology which results in more horsepower and range to continue to support the evolving heavy lift needs of the chinook other benefits include reliability and maintainability improvements as well as lower engine maintenance costs this engine upgrade will be fully compatible with the us armys existing t55 infrastructure tooling support equipment and organic capabilities thus further reducing lifecycle costs compared with alternatives upgrading the combatproven t55 is the lowest cost and lowest risk path to keeping chinook fleets operating at maximum efficiency marinick said there is no better option for todays warfighter the t55 engine has been in operation on the ch47 chinook helicopter for nearly 57 years with more than 6000 t55 engines having been produced and logging some 12 million hours of operation the engine is a stepping stone to what honeywell believes could be the lowest cost bestvalue offering for propulsion power for us military future longrange assault aircraft flraa part of the future vertical lift fvl program marinick said the new offering will be available as both a new engine version and a lowcost kit to upgrade engines during overhauls more than 1000 chinook engines can increase their capabilities while simultaneously lowering operational costs for more information on the t55 engine upgrades please visit honeywell at ausa booth 1217 in hall a at the walter e
