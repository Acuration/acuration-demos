contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news how uv light helps clean air and surfaces explained how uv light helps clean air and surfaces explained from aircraft to buildings ultraviolet uv light can help inactivate pathogens all around us there is a new bright light shining on ultraviolet uv light its the spectrum of light just beyond the visible range that has several bands of wavelengths you might be familiar with uva and uvb which are the two types of rays that reach earth they can cause premature aging and sunburn then theres uvc it can be an effective tool for inactivating pathogens which are germs for starters uvc is too weak to penetrate the earths atmosphere so organisms are not typically exposed it as a result many organisms have no natural defenses against it another reason is because there are no chemicals residues or waste products left behind properly applied it also acts fast clinical studies have demonstrated that at the right doses it takes only a matter of seconds to drive significant reductions in certain pathogens uvc light has been used extensively for more than 40 years in disinfecting drinking water waste water air pharmaceutical products and surfaces against a whole suite of human pathogens according to the international ultraviolet association iuva here are a few examples of how the technology works aircraft clinical studies have shown that certain pathogens can survive for days on surfaces especially in cool and dry environments a prime example of a place like that is inside an aircraft airlines have a need to quickly clean surfaces between each flight properly applied uvc can enhance airlines cleaning efforts said bob lenz who has seven years of experience overseeing aerospace technology products honeywells uv cabin system deploys uvc light inside aircraft cabins using a combination of lights specially designed to deliver uvc light at specified distances and angles to treat hightouch surfaces testing with customers like jetblue have shown that the uv cabin system can traverse a narrowbody aircraft in 10 minutes or less thats key when airlines have little time between flights to clean and prepare an aircraft uv cleaning can also be applied to other areas on your travels including baggage compartments lavatories and galleys buildings inside buildings air can stagnate to help make facilities safer to work in and reoccupy multiple uvc solutions can be deployed for the air a common strategy is using the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system to combine recirculated air with outdoor air that can have an increased cost when cooling hot outdoor air to dilute the indoor air an alternative is to treat the air using uvc light that can take place above or below the ceiling tiles for example an emerging solution is combining uvc light with electrostatic technology in one filter in an air handling unit ahu or an inroom unit can circulate the air through a hepa or other filter then apply uvc light the key is to carry out a comprehensive building assessment that factors in regulatory compliance existing and new operational costs what the organization is already doing and what additional measures might need to be considered said mike pringle a honeywell sales consultant with an engineering background and member of the iuva aerospace building technologies
