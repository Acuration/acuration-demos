fractionation and hydrogen purification system will enable the capture of about 7 million tons of carbon dioxide co 2 annually installation of honeywells solution will help reduce emissions at exxonmobils baytown complex february 15 2023 des plaines ill feb 15 2023 prnewswire honeywell today announced that exxonmobil will deploy one of honeywells carbon capture technologies honeywells co 2 fractionation and hydrogen purification system at its integrated complex in baytown texas this technology is expected to enable exxonmobil to capture about 7 million tons of carbon dioxide co 2 per year the equivalent of the emission of 15 million of automobiles for one year 1 honeywell uops carbon capture technology will be integrated into the design of exxonmobils lowcarbon hydrogen production facility and enable it to capture more than 98 2 percent of associated co 2 emissions the captured co 2 is expected to be sequestered and permanently stored by exxonmobil exxonmobil s baytown lowcarbon hydrogen ammonia and carbon capture facility is expected to produce around one billion cubic feet of lowcarbon hydrogen per day making this the largest lowcarbon hydrogen project in the world at planned startup in 20272028 exxonmobils baytown integrated complex is home to the largest olefins plant in the united states the site is located on approximately 3400 acres along the houston ship channel exxonmobils investment in carbon capture technology shows our commitment to supporting customers in their decarbonization efforts and to reducing emissions at our own operations said dan ammann president of exxonmobil low carbon solutions the scale of this project is expected to enable up to 30 of scope 1 and 2 emissions from our baytown facility by switching from natural gas as a fuel source to lowcarbon hydrogen the use of honeywells technology enables exxonmobil to reduce co 2 emissions at a large scale said barry glickman vice president and general manager honeywell sustainable technology solutions our readynow carbon capture technology works to decarbonize production processes and is effective because it can allow for significant emissions reduction that can play a major role in the energy transition with more than 50 years of experience in gas processing honeywell has extensive experience with proven carbon capture and hydrogen technologies honeywells new advanced solvent co 2 capture and hydrogen solutions allow for co 2 to be captured transported and stored at a lower cost through greater efficiency while allowing for smaller equipment and lower capital operational expenses needed to run the plant compared to existing technologies today 15 million tons per year of co 2 is being captured and used in storageutilization applications through honeywells co 2 solutions process expertise current honeywell customers have the capacity to capture 40 million tons of co 2 per year through installed projects worldwide that utilize honeywell co 2 technology 3 honeywell is committed to achieving carbon neutrality in its operations and facilities by 2035 this commitment builds on the companys track record of sharply reducing the greenhouse gas
