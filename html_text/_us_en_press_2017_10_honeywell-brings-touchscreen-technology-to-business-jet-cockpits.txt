business jet cockpits october 10 2017 las vegas oct 9 2017 prnewswire through its primus epic portfolio of cockpit solutions honeywell nyse hon is now bringing advanced touchscreen technology to business jet cockpits the honeywell touchscreen forward displays will provide pilots with a more efficient and more enjoyable pilot experience by allowing them to interact with the cockpit just like they do with consumer electronic devices but in this case getting easy access to flight management communications checklists and weather information having just received a federal aviation administration technical standard order late last month honeywells new du1310 touchscreen will provide flight crews with more control of the cockpit by enabling the forward displays with touchscreen functionality as an alternative to a cursor control device or joystick touch screens can significantly improve operational efficiency in the cockpit with much faster navigation through the commands and data previously pilots could only perform the same operations using a cursor control device or joystick by using a touchscreen pilots can cut in half the time required to input data and control cockpit functions pilots today expect the same hightech functionality in the cockpit that they use in their everyday lives and touchscreens are at the top of that list said jeff merdich vice president cockpit systems honeywell aerospace much like our position on inflight wifi we believe in giving pilots the same experience as they have at home or in the office honeywells new du1310 touchscreen primary flight display and multifunction display is a dropin replacement for the du1310 displays currently installed in primus epic cockpits the new display will also reduce weight on the aircraft by three pounds per display in addition with honeywells avionics protection plan operators can protect against a significant unplanned expense to learn more about honeywells touchscreen technology for
