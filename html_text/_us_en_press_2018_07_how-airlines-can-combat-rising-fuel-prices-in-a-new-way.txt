july 24 2018 prnewswire what makes for efficient air travel that depends on who you ask for travelers it means getting to and from the airport without incident and arriving at your destination on time and with your bags from the airlines perspective efficiency can mean many things experience the interactive multichannel news release here httpswwwmultivucomplayersenglish8369251honeywellaerospacegodirectflightefficiency ontime performance will always be important but as airlines strive to increase efficiency there are several other factors that contribute to running an efficient airline how quickly can an aircraft be turned around from one destination to the next is every seat occupied is the internet connectivity strong enough to allow passengers to relax with a movie or get some work done as important as these factors are fuel prices especially when they are rising tend to be the dominant concern from the airlines perspective when it comes to efficiency were in the thick of earnings season and it is no surprise that the recurring theme in quarterly reports from airlines is rising fuel prices and how they are cutting into profits jet fuel prices continue to put enormous bottomline pressure on the worlds airlines and those prices have soared 54 percent from june 2017 to june 2018 according to the international air transport association iata the increases in the first six months of 2018 added more than 42 billion worldwide to carriers operating costs iata estimates prices are still below their historical peak research from the massachusetts institute of technology shows us airlines spent a combined 428 billion on fuel in 2012 when prices topped out that number was 252 billion in 2017 and will inevitably be higher this year just think if a global carrier could cut fuel costs by just 1 percent the savings could top 50 million a year and thats if prices hold steady airlines have addressed fluctuating fuel prices for many years but theres a big difference with this latest spike in fuel prices now airlines can use connected aircraft technologies fueled by big data and advanced analytics to become more efficient managing their fleets and their fuel its not hard to understand that the heavier the aircraft the more fuel is needed to propel it but ironically fuel itself is a large component of the weight carried on a typical flight software like honeywells nyse hon godirect flight efficiency helps airlines better understand the amount of fuel they need to operate an aircraft without sacrificing safety the software examines not just how much but how fuel is used weve all been on flights that take off about 30 minutes late and the pilot says well make it up on the way what that really means is the pilot will throttle up during flight and burn more fuel than anticipated to make up the lost time travelers land on time but the airline burns money along the way honeywells software can help prevent this common and costly habit by analyzing historical flight data to make better strategic decisions on flight routes that take into consideration weather patterns the time of day approach patterns and more additionally pilots can make tactical decisions in flight based on that historical data this is accomplished through honeywells algorithm that blends engineering and flight operations expertise with advanced statistical and machinelearning methods the result is a new level of airspace efficiency that airlines could never achieve before the benefit of this technology to travelers can be seen in their pocketbooks as airlines implement more advanced software technologies to drive out inefficiencies rising fuel costs will put less pressure on ticket prices in addition analytics that optimize routes will reduce time in holding patterns around busy airports and enable more ontime arrivals operating an airline is one of the most logistically challenging undertakings in the business world despite the challenges airlines connect every corner of the world each day with a remarkable amount of efficiency thanks to new technology airlines will only grow more efficient and we will all benefit because of it michael edmonds has led the honeywell aerospace services and connectivity business since 2010 and has nearly 20 years of experience
