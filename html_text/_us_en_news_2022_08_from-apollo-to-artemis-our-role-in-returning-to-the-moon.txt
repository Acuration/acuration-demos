a new era of space travel learn about the mission and how it continues honeywells legacy of innovations for nasa voyages were going back to the moon nasas artemis program aims to bring humans back to the lunar surface for the first time in more than 50 years to celebrate the upcoming launch of artemis i get to know what the journey will entail and learn how our technologies have played a role in every nasa human space mission artemis fast facts the first mission artemis i is uncrewed during artemis i the orion spacecraft will fly for six weeks the mission will take it 280000 miles away from earth where it will circle the moon before returning back to earth the space launch system which sends orion to space is the worlds most powerful rocket according to nasa why were going to further exploration of deep space on the moon and eventually mars how were helping as part of a longterm partnership with lockheed martin the honeywell teams contributions to artemis missions include a mix of hardware and software solutions these include guidance and navigation systems command data handling displays and controls including two hand controllers that astronauts will use to control the orion spacecraft and flight software that will support maintenance functions that share flight data information reflecting on our legacy in space a flight director attitude indicator for the apollo missions a cockpit instrument shown undergoing final assembly at honeywell in minneapolis minnesota circa 1968 source minesota historical society from the mercury capsule that took the first americans to space to the international space station which serves as a homeawayfromhome for astronauts honeywell has been a part of every nasa human space mission as we celebrate the next step in returning to the moon take a look back at some of the biggest space travel milestones 1959 1963 project mercury astronauts in weightless flight simulation training for mercury missions source nasa as nasas first crewed space flight project the mercury program consisted of six manned missions and famously flew seven crew members the mercury 7 the first us astronauts in space in 1962 as part of the mercuryatlas 6 mission john glenn became the first us astronaut to orbit earth how we helped our engineers provided stabilization navigation and environmental control systems for the capsule that took the first nasa crews to space 1965 1966 project gemini source nasa during the gemini 4 mission in 1965 ed white became the first us astronaut to complete a spacewalk pictured above the gemini missions also served as preparation for the first moon landing in later apollo voyages how we helped contributions from honeywells engineers included environmental controls systems as well as electronics that helped spacecraft change its orbit 1968 1975 apollo program neil armstrong on the lunar surface source nasa famously the apollo program with the apollo 11 mission marked one small step for man one giant leap for mankind in the words of neil armstrong after his walk on the lunar surface additionally the apollo program established technology to help astronauts further explore space carried out scientific experiments on the moon and developed human capability to work on the lunar surface according to nasa how we helped our engineers designed developed and supplied the stabilization and control systems used in apollo missions one system was the environmental control system technology that helped astronauts breathe provided fresh water regulated cabin temperature and pressure and removed cabin waste additionally we contributed 50 displays switches and flag warning devices to the lunar module used for the mission 1981 2011 space shuttle program view of the approach of the sts79 orbiter atlantis source nasa the space shuttle served as the first reusable spacecraft and the program helped construct the international space station how we helped honeywell products provided computing and control capabilities throughout the space shuttle program 2000 present international space station source nasa the international space station is a large spacecraft in low orbit around the earth that serves as a platform for research and has made it possible for humans to have an ongoing presence in space how were helping our engineers provide over 30 products to support the vessel housing humans in space for more than 20 years 2022 artemis i launch the historic mission is the first in a series of voyages with artemis ii set to take humans to the moon by 2024 follow along the artemis journey with nasas updates want to learn more about human space exploration listen to our podcast episode about returning to the moon and the technology that will take us there and meet some of our engineers whose
