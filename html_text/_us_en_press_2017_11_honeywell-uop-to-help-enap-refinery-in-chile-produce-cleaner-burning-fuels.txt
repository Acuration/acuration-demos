in chile produce cleanerburning fuels november 14 2017 des plaines ill nov 14 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced that empresa nacional del petroleo enap has begun using honeywell uops hyt6219 unity hydrotreating catalyst in conjunction with unity hydrocracking catalysts to produce cleanerburning diesel fuel at its b o b o refinery in hualpen chile the hyt6219 catalyst pretreats the petroleum feed used to make diesel fuel removing sulfur nitrogen and aromatics that would otherwise hurt the performance and longevity of hydrocracking catalysts later in the refining process the refinery also uses honeywell uops hc130 and hc120 unity hydrocracking catalysts as part of its production process enap chose the unity catalysts for hydrotreating and hydroprocessing based on their superior economics said mike cleveland senior business director for honeywell uops refining catalysts product line the catalysts meet all of enaps demanding performance requirements of less than 5 parts per million of sulfur and longer catalyst life hydrotreating is a critical step in the refining process where hydrogen and a proprietary catalyst are used to pretreat petroleum and other products by removing contaminants before conversion into transportation fuels the process helps produce cleanerburning gasoline and diesel that meet increasingly stringent global fuel regulations such as the euro v standard which specifies sulfur content of less than 10 parts per million in transportation fuels honeywell uop inaugurated the use of catalysts in the refining industry in 1931
