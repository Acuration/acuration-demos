contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news behind the scenes of a major quantum breakthrough behind the scenes of a major quantum breakthrough heres what it means for solving the worlds toughest challenges its almost time by the middle of 2020 were releasing the most powerful quantum computer yet thanks to a breakthrough in technology were on track to release a quantum computer with a quantum volume of at least 64 twice that of the next alternative in the industry we have demonstrated our quantum charge coupled device qccd architecture in a scientific paper that major technical breakthrough accelerates quantum capability that means the world will be able to begin undertaking problems that were impractical to tackle with traditional computers there are a number of industries that will be profoundly impacted by the advancement and ultimate application of atscale quantum computing said tony uttley president of honeywell quantum solutions why our quantum computer is the most powerful our quantum solutions business has been at the forefront of the industry a team of more than 100 scientists engineers and software developers has been working to develop quantum computers along with the algorithms to solve customers problems quantum computers use qubits which are quantum computing bits to process information in a unique way that leverages the properties of quantum physics our quantum computer will be the most powerful available because it will have at least double the quantum volume of alternatives quantum volume is a metric that considers the number connectivity and low error rate of qubits and we plan to increase that volume rapidly jp morgan chase will use our quantum computer jp morgan chase wants to develop new ways for quantum computing to help the financial services company support its customers theyre partnering with us to figure it out other partnerships include two strategic investments by our venture capital fund honeywell ventures in quantum software and algorithm startups cambridge quantum computing cqc and zapata computing in addition many industries can leverage the technology quantum computing will enable us to tackle complex scientific and business challenges driving stepchange improvements in computational power operating costs and speed said honeywell chairman and chief executive officer darius adamczyk materials companies will explore new molecular structures transportation companies will optimize logistics financial institutions will need faster and more precise software applications pharmaceutical companies will accelerate the discovery of new drugs heres what will happen next we will have several ways organizations can use our quantum computer some enterprise partners prefer to work with us directly others prefer support from ecosystem companies that develop specific quantum algorithms and software based on intended use cases we are partnering with microsoft as a part of the azure quantum offering it allows end users will be able to make use of azure classical computing resources while also accessing honeywells quantum computer quantum related content what reaching 20 qubits
