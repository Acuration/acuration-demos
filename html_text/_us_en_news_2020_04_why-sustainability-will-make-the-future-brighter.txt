contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news why sustainability will make the future brighter why sustainability will make the future brighter our chairman and ceo darius adamczyk talks about the importance of the environment and what technology can do to help the 50 th anniversary of earth day marks a milestone in the environmental movement and a time to reflect both the past and future honeywells chairman and ceo darius adamczyk recently talked to the yale business sustainability summit about the role of technology in promoting a cleaner and more sustainable environment why does honeywell see itself as playing a leadership role in sustainability honeywell has a long legacy rooted in sustainabilityrelated innovation several decades ago we developed the refrigerants and aerosols that helped reverse damage to the ozone layer our technologists invented the catalytic converter an automobile control system that reduces toxic gases and pollutants from emissions today we are developing innovations that can help make big improvements in sustainability across a wide range of industries many of our existing technologies could already make a substantial difference give us an example of an existing technology that would be impactful hydrofluorocarbons hfcs are highglobalwarmingpotential molecules used commonly in applications such as refrigerants if left unmitigated airconditioning refrigerants would contribute 20 to 25 percent of global warming by 2050 honeywell has pioneered a new generation of lowglobalwarmingpotential hydrofluoroolefin hfo refrigerants along with aerosols solvents and blowing agents that can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions impact of current offerings on the market by more than 99 percent our solstice portfolio of lowglobalwarming products have already helped customers avoid discharging the equivalent of over 150 million metric tons of co 2 what about renewable fuels honeywell is developing alternatives to petroleumbased fuel using waste products or plantbased feedstocks such as algae and jatropha which dont compete with food resources to make green fuels for example honeywells technology allows refineries to produce green jet fuel which can enable 60 to 85 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis honeywells technologies also can enable production of green diesel from renewable oils which can generate an 85 percent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from road rail and shipping transportation how can honeywell enhance sustainability in the aviation industry if applied widely today honeywells existing technologies can enable up to four times the flights that occurred in 2019 with half the greenhouse gas emissions honeywell forges cloud software analytics can optimize aircraft operations and routing saving up to 5 percent of energy use per flight we are also producing electric and hybrid electric aircraft systems that reduce fuel use and emissions particularly during takeoff landing and taxiway operations all of which typically occur in densely populated urban areas commercial buildings have a big environmental footprint how can honeywells technologies help electricity use from commercial buildings currently accounts for 18 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 commercial buildings are expected to consume more than half the electricity generated worldwide our technologies are present in more than 10 million buildings worldwide making them safer more secure more comfortable and up to 40 percent more energy efficient honeywell forge analytics provide predictive maintenance and dynamic control to further reduce energy costs by as much as 20 percent on existing standard building management system finally our financed energy savings programs can help schools municipal buildings government facilities and other building portfolios save energy and money these solutions allow for upgrades in energyefficient technologies that are paid for with energy savings to date we have implemented 6000 of these projects which have collectively decreased customers energy and operating costs by an estimated 6 billion what is honeywell doing about improving the sustainability of supply chains with our reliance on ecommerce and home delivery growing even faster during these times it will become critical to make our supply chains more sustainable honeywells smart warehouse and smart logistics solutions shorten supply times enable more efficient ecommerce reduce food spoilage and optimize final delivery routes according to the united nations the world grows enough food to feed 10 billion people today but onethird is lost between the farmer and the consumer one of our customers in the online grocery space was able to use our technology to more than double the orders it could fulfill per day our system and software allowed the company to expand its services to offer sameday delivery in a major metropolitan area honeywell is even developing unmanned aerial vehicles which reduce power and emissions for lastmile delivery whats next for the future of sustainability as we look to tomorrow the world will use more wind and solar power and that means the key to our renewable energy future is energy storage honeywell is developing energy storage technologies such as flow batteries that allow surplus wind and solar power to be stored and used when needed we are also on the cusp of transitioning to a more hydrogenbased economy which offers the potential for big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions we are working on ways to decarbonize residential commercial and industrial energy by replacing natural gas with hydrogen which ultimately can be produced by electrolyzing water using renewable power in fact we are already working with gas companies to make their distribution systems ready for hydrogen in 2020 the world is very focused on the coronavirus outbreak is sustainability still relevant given the concerns around public health yes sustainability is very much relevant long after the coronavirus situation is resolved the environment will be an important area for all of us to focus on over the coming decades during this time of global crisis it is fitting now more than ever that we plan for a clean and sustainable world for our children and grandchildren even in this economy with the challenges it brings we will make the necessary investments in our sustainable technologies and our sustainable future at honeywell we believe the future is what we make it when it comes to sustaining the environment these words ring true we all need to work together toward this common purpose everyone can make a difference leadership innovation related content the future is ai and the next big
