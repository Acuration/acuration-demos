solution to help meet 70 carbon reduction target extensive carbon and energy management initiative introduces shoretoship power units further carbon emissions reduction plans already in place to meet sustainability goals april 8 2021 atlanta april 7 2021 in a global first for the maritime industry port esbjerg and honeywell are working together on a climate cooperation designed to help reduce carbon emissions at the danish port by 70 by 2030 in line with the countrys climate target port esbjerg located on the southwest coast of denmark is working with honeywell on a comprehensive carbon and energy management programme to help achieve the ports emissions reduction goal the initiatives also contribute towards the international maritime organizations ambition to halve greenhouse gases from international shipping by 2050 compared with 2008 levels the port esbjerg team recently inaugurated its first shoretoship power units which allow docked vessels to run on renewable electricity from offshore wind turbines instead of using onboard diesel generators this power connection is enabled by the cooperation between honeywell and port esbjerg specifically supported through understanding estimations of the vessels carbon footprint the port can access this data at any time through the honeywell enacto carbon and energy management system the shoretoship units can simultaneously power multiple large vessels helping to reduce co 2 sox and nox emissions as well as reducing noise pollution given the size and complexity of our operation there was no simple offtheshelf solution for our green transition we worked with honeywell to fully customise a system that can monitor energy consumption and emissions as well as pinpoint potential improvement opportunities explains port esbjerg ceo dennis jul pedersen the honeywell enacto carbon and energy management system is a cloudbased fully scalable solution that enables the port to monitor the emissions and resource consumption of every individual power socket and most importantly every vessel with 1200 measurement points the system uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms in conjunction with data collection from energyconsuming or producing assets at the port its open protocol platform allows for flexible and seamless integration with legacy systems if consumption changes significantly the system sends an automated message to the port office meaning any abnormalities are immediately identified and action may be taken vessels carbon emissions are closely observed with the aim of reduction through operational investments in sustainable infrastructure including use of renewable energy and in the future clean fuel technology based on data generated by the honeywell system port esbjerg can optimise its energy and carbon footprint in real time in the future it will be able to prioritise financial resources where the most significant co 2 reductions can be made generating tangible emissionslowering results the port esbjerg project is setting a new benchmark for ports globally on how to use fully integrated technology to help meet ambitious sustainability goals says lionel caillat general manager honeywell building technologies we worked closely with the port esbjerg team to understand their objectives and customise a solution that can help to achieve them its exciting to go from initial planning to seeing the port meet their renewable shoretoship power supply milestone we look forward to our continued work with the port to help them cut emissions down further in the next phase of the project port esbjerg and honeywell will monitor and manage water consumption and heating as well as the emissions performance of businesses around the port the plan also features significant investments in electric vehicle technology and hydrogenpowered cranes the target is for all port vehicles to be powered by electricity by
