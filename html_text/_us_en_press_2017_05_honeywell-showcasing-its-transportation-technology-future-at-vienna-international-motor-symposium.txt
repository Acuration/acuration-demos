showcasing its transportation technology future at vienna international motor symposium october 5 2018 honeywell is uniquely positioned to be automakers partner of choice for gasoline and diesel turbochargers electric boosting and automotive software honeywell has more than 30 years of indepth experience in developing industrial connected software solutions that it is drawing upon for the automotive industry vienna april 27 2017 honeywell nyse hon is showcasing at the vienna international motor symposium 2017 its latest gasoline and diesel turbocharger technology alongside its electric boosting and automotive software solutions that are all helping automakers to reduce emissions increase fuel economy and improve performance honeywells most recent innovation is helping launch a new generation of fuel efficient gasoline vehicles in europe this year by applying its leading variable geometry diesel technology to gasoline engines providing improved performance and fuel economy in addition honeywell is also displaying a new twostage diesel engine turbocharger featuring a combination of a variable geometry and wastegate turbochargers for increased performance across the whole engine map honeywell transportation systems leverages the expertise of honeywell aerospace to apply some of its experience with high temperature gasoline applications enhanced aerodynamics and coatings and materials to automotive standards future powertrain solutions are also on display as honeywell displays its twostage electric compressor application for fuel cells honeywell is drawing upon its engineering competencies in the automotive and aerospace industries to advance this technology even further to providing sustainable zeroemissions transportation new gasoline and diesel technology on display in vienna will be honeywells gasoline vnt turbocharger which features a variable geometry turbine stage rather than a typical wastegate valve to help achieve better fuel economy designed to work in tandem with a combustion phasing technology known as the miller cycle this turbo takes on more work and allows greater thermal efficiency in the engine this results in improved fuel economy and reduced co2 emissions at nearly all engine speeds honeywell has applied the performanceenhancing vnt technology to nearly 70 million turbos used with diesel engines during the past three decades it is an industry first to apply vnt technology for the highertemperature gasoline engine environment suitable for highproduction volume passenger vehicles without resorting to expensive exotic materials honeywell developed its latest vnt turbocharger for the volkswagen groups 15l gasoline engine to be used in various vw and audi models in its most recent benchmarking study industry analyst fev group gmbh determined that the carbon dioxide emissions 108gkm for a 1250 kg vehicle with honeywells technology represents bestinclass performance for the industry in 2017 honeywell is also displaying its newest twostage turbo system for diesel engines combining its fifth generation vnt technology and electric actuation with a second wastegate turbo in an overall compact package aimed at passenger cars in the midsize diesel engine range this technology helps improve engine power density by 17 percent and drivability with 10 percent better lowend torque and improved acceleration the turbo also helps improve engine emissions with a 10 to 20 percent reduction in nox and 10 percent reduction in co2 emissions in real world driving conditions electric products honeywell is bringing a look into the future to its display with examples of electric boosting products that can help provide additional benefits for automakers to use in improving performance and meeting regulatory targets these include eturbo the addition of an electric motor with traditional turbocharger into a single unit to improve packaging and cost while also returning excess energy to the vehicle to help power an advanced electrical system it can help improve acceleration by 1530 percent across various speeds fuel economy by 1015 percent and nox emissions by 20 percent twostage electric compressor for fuel cell honeywells unique design has helped reduce the size of earlier hydrogen fuel cells by 40 percent while supplying constant power ratings far above previous industry generations honeywell has drawn upon its engineering competencies in the aerospace industries to introduce oilfree air bearings into this electronic boosting device that are already being used by honda motor co for its hydrogenpowered clarity fuel cell vehicle according to honeywells most recent turbo forecast these solutions will continue to grow in demand as electric and hybrid vehicles are expected to grow globally from a total of 3 million vehicles sold in 2016 to a total of 16 million sold annually by 2021 within the electrified category mild hybrids are expected to account for 46 percent of the mix full hybrids will account for 40 percent and pure electric vehicles will be most of the remaining 14 percent honeywell estimates 70 percent of all mild hybrid vehicles will have a turbo or multiple turbo systems mechanical and electric software honeywell will also offer a demo of three software initiatives aimed at diagnostics and prognostics of vehicle condition automotive
