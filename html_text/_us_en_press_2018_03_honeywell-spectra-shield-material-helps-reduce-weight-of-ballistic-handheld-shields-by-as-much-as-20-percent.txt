nyse hon announced today that safariland group is using honeywell spectra shield in a breakthrough new design that changes the way ballistic glass is installed in ballistic handheld shields the resulting shields can be up to 20 percent lighter safariland is introducing the new design in its new x series line of lightweight ballistic shields sold under its protech tactical brand handheld shields have a lens cap also known as a viewing window made from ballistic glass it is typically installed into a frame that is then bolted into the shield using spectra shield safariland is able to integrate the lens cap directly into the rest of the shield this streamlined design eliminates points of weakness that arise from the traditional bulky frame system such as drill holes and seam lines
