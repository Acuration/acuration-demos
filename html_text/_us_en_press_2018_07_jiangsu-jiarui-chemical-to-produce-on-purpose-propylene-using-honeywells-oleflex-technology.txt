jiangsu province honeywell will provide licensing the process design package proprietary and nonproprietary equipment onsite operator training technical services for startup and continuing operation and catalysts and adsorbents for the project which is honeywells 33rd award in china for oleflex technology historically propylene has been produced as a byproduct of making ethylene from petroleum but with the influx of lighter feedstocks the amount of propylene from these manufacturing processes is dramatically reduced said john gugel president of honeywell uop the oleflex process addresses the growing propylene supply gap by producing onpurpose propylene from propane which is in abundant supply honeywell uops c 3 oleflex technology uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert propane to propylene its low energy consumption low emissions and fully recyclable platinumaluminabased catalyst system minimizes its impact on the environment and has a lower cash cost of production and higher return on investment compared to other technologies the independent reaction and regeneration sections enable steadystate operations improved operating flexibility and a high onstream factor and reliability honeywell uop also licenses c 4 oleflex technology which converts butanes to butylenes the primary ingredient for making highoctane fuel additives and synthetic rubber including this project honeywell uops oleflex technology has been selected for 52 out of 64 propane and isobutane dehydrogenation projects globally since 2011 since the technology was first commercialized in 1990
