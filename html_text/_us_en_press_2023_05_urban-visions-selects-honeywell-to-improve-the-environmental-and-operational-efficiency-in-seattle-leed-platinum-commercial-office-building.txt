first floor that brings the total to 216000squarefeet though 200 occidental targets being fully decarbonized with regards to operational carbon energy still gets wasted because the hvac system is set to a daily schedule even if the building is not occupied by working with honeywell urban visions will deploy technologies to help track occupancy levels for each hvac zone to track energy being wasted when areas are not occupied occupancy is tracked with co2 sensors that also track indoor air quality in addition with the hbsm platform both tenants and building managers will have access to a comprehensive dashboard of the buildings data including device and assetlevel insights into energy use and iaq to track realtime data urban visions leverages triple net leases or nnn where the lessee

and meeting the 2050 goals energy still gets wasted the one area the built environment must change its behavior is how our leases are written with regards to heat and cooling they are schedulebased and not occupancybased and most tenants are not ready to amend their leases this will go a long way in helping to reduce our energy usage urban visions vision for sustainable development and smart
