percent compared with the prior year latin america led all global regions in the rate of new aircraft purchase plans but is down year over year and impacted by weak economic performance in brazil and

plans decreased by more than 3 percent in this years survey down for a second year in a row the sample of russian operators responding in the 2017 survey remains small which continues to add some

results from these nations overall buying plans slipped about 1 percent operator purchase plans continued to drift slightly lower compared with the past few years in the 2017 results apac operators

plans are down more than 11 percent compared with 2016 results brazilian purchase plans are down significantly by almost 20 percent in 2017 reflecting the impact of the economic recession in the
