organic 1 basis the thirdquarter financial results can be found in tables 2 and 3 aerospace sales for the third quarter were up 18 year over year on an organic 1 basis the fifth consecutive quarter of doubledigit organic growth with strength in both commercial aviation and defense and space commercial aviation growth was led by robust aftermarket demand driven by increased flight activity particularly in air transport with commercial aftermarket sales up more than 20 year over year commercial original equipment sales also increased in the third quarter on increased deliveries particularly in business and general aviation defense and space sales grew 18 year over year as supply chain improvements and strengthened orders enabled us to convert our strong order book into sales segment margin remained unchanged year over year at 275 as higher volume leverage and commercial excellence were offset by cost inflation and mix pressure in our original equipment business honeywell

particularly energy projects building products sales declined modestly on lower volumes of security offerings segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 252 driven by productivity actions and commercial excellence partially offset by cost inflation performance materials and technologies sales for the third quarter were up 3 on an organic 1 basis year over year hps sales grew 11 organically

advanced materials safety and productivity solutions sales for the third quarter decreased by 25 year over year on an organic 1 basis sales declines were due to lower volumes in warehouse and workflow solutions which continues to be impacted by softness in the warehouse automation market however our pipeline remains robust which translated into doubledigit year over year and over 50 sequential orders growth in the third quarter additionally we continue to see strong doubledigit growth in the aftermarket services business volume declines in productivity solutions and services also impacted sales as we continue to work through the impact of lower demand and distributor destocking segment margin contracted 120 basis points year over year to 145 driven by lower volume leverage partially
