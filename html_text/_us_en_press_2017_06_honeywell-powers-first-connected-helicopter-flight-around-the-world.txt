flight around the world june 29 2017 ottawa ontario june 29 2017 prnewswire honeywells nyse hon advanced connected aircraft satellite communications products and services are connecting a bell 429 helicopter during canadas first helicopter flight around the world the canadian fatherson team will use honeywells aspire 200 wifi system and godirect cabin connectivity services to share their planned 37day journey and stay connected from the air everywhere in the world including over cities mountains and oceans the c150 global odyssey team of bob and steven dengler will embark on their trip july 1 2017 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of canadas confederation the tour will kick off at the canada aviation and space museum in ottawa before making more than 100 stops in 14 countries the aspire 200 system with its highdata rate software package brings highspeed highbandwidth wifi capabilities to the helicopter with honeywells aspire 200 and godirect cabin connectivity plus highly reliable data connectivity through inmarsats global lband satellite constellation throughout the tour the team will experience wifi speeds of up to 350 kbps per channel these speeds will enable realtime uploads to social media videoconferencing capabilities and access to updated weather information along their journey honeywell has been a leader in aviation technology for more than 100 years and has been connecting planes for 25 years no one has more expertise than honeywell when it comes to getting critical data on and off an aircraft and making flights safer and more efficient said warren nechtman vice president connected aircraft systems honeywell aerospace this is why were happy to sponsor the c150 global odyssey helicopter connectivity can be a challenge due to the rotor blades interrupting the satellite signal to and from the aircraft honeywell in coordination with inmarsat satellite technology is overcoming that barrier with its aspire 200 and godirect cabin connectivity to make sure that the denglers flight has consistent highspeed connectivity from start to finish connectivity on helicopters is often spotty and inconsistent because the rotor blades that power the aircraft disrupt connections to satellites this makes maintaining highspeed reliable connectivity on global journeys very challenging honeywells aspire 200 and connectivity enable us to share photos and videos of our adventure from the air but they also provide realtime data to manage mission risk as we fly greatly enhancing our safety no matter where we travel said bob dengler pilot c150 global odyssey our biggest need for this journey is reliable global service that provides consistent coverage anywhere in the world honeywells offering does that and more in honor of canadas 150th birthday the c150 global odyssey team will fly more than 20000 nautical miles and plans to stop at more than 100 airports across 14 countries throughout their journey the team will be joined by
