automated robotic unloader for distribution centers april 5 2019 fort mill sc april 5 2019 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon today announced a new automated robotic solution for unloading a wide range of packages from truck trailers and shipping containers at distribution centers the robotic unloader uses artificial intelligence to operate fully autonomously inside of a trailer which significantly reduces the manual effort required to operate receiving docks for retail merchandise and parcel distribution centers this new honeywell intelligrated smart robotics offering will help customers improve workplace safety reduce staffing challenges and minimize damage to packages for distribution center workers unloading packages is laborintensive physically demanding and injuryprone work that is often subject to extreme temperatures these factors lead to low employee satisfaction and high turnover as much as 36 percent according to the us bureau of labor statistics said matt wicks vice president of product development at honeywell intelligrated with our robotic unloader we are using advanced machine learning to allow workers to remove themselves from the extreme environment and to oversee multiple unloading machines increasing productivity and improving safety honeywells new robotic unloader drives into a trailer or container and uses machine vision to identify various package shapes and sizes as well as the optimal approach to unloading a robotic arm with a series of small suction cups conforms to the package shape to gently extract it from the stack a conveyor below the arm can serve as a sweeper for packages to move them out of the trailer in realworld applications we are unloading a rate of up to 1500 cases per hour and helping companies maximize throughput safely and efficiently said wicks were working with carnegie mellon university to deploy advanced machine learning to expand the robotic capabilities with improved 3d vision perception processing power and gripping unlike other unloading solutions the honeywell intelligrated unloader is fully autonomous and is designed to work within existing fleets to eliminate the need for costly configurations or modifications to trailers or standard shipping containers the unloader features patented gentle mechanisms to minimize package damage without impacting performance for nearly three decades honeywell intelligrated has developed robotics solutions for warehousing operations and is a certified robot integrator by the robotic industries association in addition to its collaboration with carnegie mellon university s national robotics engineering center honeywell intelligrated is also combining efforts with fetch robotics to deploy autonomous mobile robots to distribution centers live demonstrations of the robotic unloader will be on display at the honeywell intelligrated booth at the automate 2019 expo in chicago from april 811 2019 honeywell intelligrated will also feature live
