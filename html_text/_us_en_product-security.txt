contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle product security menu policies vulnerability reporting pgp key acknowledgments policies we take security concerns seriously and work to quickly evaluate and address them once reported we commit the appropriate resources to analyze validate and provide corrective actions to address the issue the goal of our product security incident response team psirt is to minimize customers risk associated with security vulnerabilities by providing timely information guidance and remediation of vulnerabilities in our products including software and applications hardware and devices services and solutions this team manages the receipt investigation internal coordination remediation and disclosure of security vulnerability information related to honeywell products psirt coordinates the response and disclosure of all externally identified product vulnerabilities reporting a potential security vulnerability we welcome reports from independent researchers industry organizations vendors and customers concerned with product security to find out more information on how to report a potential vulnerability please visit the vulnerability reporting web page coordinated vulnerability disclosure we strive to follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure cvd this process allows independent reporters who discover a vulnerability contact honeywell directly and allow us the opportunity to investigate and remediate the vulnerability before the reporter discloses the information to the public the psirt will coordinate with the reporter throughout the vulnerability investigation and will provide them with updates on progress as appropriate with their agreement the psirt may recognize the reporter on our acknowledgments for finding a valid product vulnerability and privately reporting the issue after an update or mitigation information is publicly released by honeywell the reporter is welcome to discuss the vulnerability publicly following the cvd allows us to protect our customers and at the same time coordinate public disclosures and appropriately acknowledge the reporter for their finding if a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product the psirt will notify the vendor directly coordinate with the reporter or engage a thirdparty coordination center vulnerability management process assessing security risk using common vulnerability scoring system cvss we use the common vulnerability scoring system version 30 cvss v30 to evaluate the severity level of identified vulnerabilities this enables a common scoring method and a common language to communicate the characteristics and impacts of vulnerabilities and attempts to establish a measurement of how much concern a vulnerability warrants the model uses three distinct measurements or scores that include base temporal and environmental calculations each consisting of a set of metrics the full standard which is maintained by the forum of incident response and security teams first we follow cvss v30 specification document qualitative severity rating scale to define severity ratings as shown in the table below security impact rating cvss score critical 90 100 high 70 89 medium 40 69 low 10 39 we reserve the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the cvss score when and where applicable honeywell security bulletins will provide the cvss v30 base score we focus on the base metric group only because it brings the most value to our customers and represents the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local installation we recommend consulting a security or it professional to evaluate the risk of your specific configuration and encourages you to compute the environmental score based on your network parameters and that all customers take into account the base score and any temporal and environmental scores that may be relevant to their environment to assess their overall risk this overall score represents a moment in time and is tailored to your specific environment you should use a security or it professionals assessment of the issue and this final score to prioritize responses in your own environment vulnerability communication policy honeywell uses the following guidelines for nonthirdparty software vulnerabilities to determine the appropriate communication plan security impact rating cvss score communication plan critical 90100 security bulletin high 7089 medium 4069 product release note low 39 or below if there is a security issue with a thirdparty software component that is used in a honeywell product we may publish a security bulletin if a security bulletin is published for a thirdparty software component vulnerability then we typically use the cvss score provided by the component creator in some cases the cvss score may be adjusted to reflect the impact to the product we reserve the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the cvss score notifying customers of vulnerability in most cases we intend to notify customers when there is an identified practical workaround or fix for a security vulnerability the notification is through either targeted communications or by posting a security bulletin on the specific product web page this will be posted after the psirt has completed the vulnerability response process and determined that sufficient software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address the vulnerabilities security bulletins attempt to balance the right amount of information by providing sufficient details to enable customers to make informed decisions to protect themselves but not verbose details that would allow malicious users to take advantage of the information they will typically include the following information products and versions affected common vulnerability enumeration cve identifier for the vulnerability brief description of the vulnerability and potential impact if exploited the common vulnerability scoring system cvss severity rating for the vulnerability mitigation details such as an upgrade fix mitigation or other customer action credit to the reporter of the identified vulnerability and acknowledgment for coordinating with honeywell we will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the security bulletin or other documentation such as release notes knowledge base articles faqs etc we do not distribute exploit or proof of concept code for identified vulnerabilities in accordance with industry practices we do not share the findings from internal security testing or other types of security activities with external entities it is important to note that any scan of our services and production systems will be considered an attack if you are an oem partner please coordinate your needs with your honeywell program manager security notice we may release a special communication to respond quickly and appropriately to public disclosures where the vulnerability may have received significant public attention or is expected to be actively exploited in such an event we may expedite the communication and may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds vulnerability remediation we take security concerns seriously and works to evaluate and address them in a timely manner response timelines will depend on many factors including the severity the product affected the current development cycle qa cycles and whether the issue can only be updated in a major release remediation may take one or more of the following forms a new release a honeywellprovided patch instructions to download and install an update or patch from a thirdparty a workaround to mitigate the vulnerability notwithstanding the foregoing we do not guarantee a
