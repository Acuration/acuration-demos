transformed two facilities to make sanitizer to help fight the coronavirus to help meet demand for hand sanitizer during the covid19 pandemic two honeywell chemical manufacturing plants are producing hand sanitizer behindthescenes those facilities had to be reconfigured to be able to make the hand sanitizer we leveraged remote working tools to accelerate crossfunctional decision making from the regulators to honeywell down to the operating business said omar vikin general manager who has been in the specialty chemical industry for more than 20 years what would take months we did it in hours here are three things to know about the plants 1 where are the facilities one facility is in muskegon michigan that plant manufactures highpurity solvents and blends making more than 1500 products that can be used for environmental analysis precision cleaning pharmaceutical testing and more the other plant is in seelze germany that facility produces more than 500 products including highpurity solutions for laboratory research and testing applications 2 how have the plants been set up to make hand sanitizer the facilities repurposed existing equipment to accommodate new hand sanitizer production guidelines from us and german regulators it required reconfiguring process flow to allow charging of the mixing vessels based on the revised guidelines and formulation from the regulators omar said we had to read interpret and implement the mixing procedures and we trained personnel in the safe handling of the ingredients running a chemical plant is all about tight process control omar said these two plants pivoted within days to figure out how to make this happen it really took a willingness to be flexible within a wellrun chemical facility 3 where will the hand sanitizer go during
