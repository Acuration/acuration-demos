computer how we push the boundaries on system capability we achieved a quantum volume of 128 on our quantum computer in late september 2020 this and future increases in the capabilities of quantum computers will empower our customers to achieve results beyond what they thought was possible honeywell has made a commitment to shape and accelerate the development of quantum computing and bring its power to our customers said tony uttley president of honeywell quantum solutions our differentiated technology exemplified by the highfidelity and fullyconnected qubits with midcircuit measurement and qubit reuse enables our customers to push the frontier of quantum computing applications and what is really exciting is that this is still just the beginning the plot above shows the heavy outcomes for honeywell quantum solutions tests of quantum volume and the dates when each test passed all tests are above the 23 threshold to pass the respective quantum volume circles indicate heavy outcome averages and the violin plots show the histogram distributions data colored in blue shows system performance results and red shows modeled noiseincluded simulation data white markers are the lower 2sigma error bounds the system successfully passed the quantum volume 128 test outputting heavy outcomes 7178 of the time which is above 23 threshold with 99934 confidence the average singlequbit fidelity is 99971 and the average twoqubit gate fidelity is 99547 with fullyconnected qubits the plot above shows the individual heavy outcomes for each quantum volume 128 run the blue line is an average of heavy outcomes and the red line is the lower 2sigma error bar which crosses the 23 threshold after 186 circuits our systems are accessible directly through honeywell and through ecosystem partner platforms including microsofts azure quantum cambridge quantum computings tket and zapata computings orquestra in addition to offering highfidelity fullyconnected qubits our system features a unique midcircuit measurement capability which enables users to explore new classes of algorithms and to greatly reduce the number of qubits needed for certain algorithms for more information about
