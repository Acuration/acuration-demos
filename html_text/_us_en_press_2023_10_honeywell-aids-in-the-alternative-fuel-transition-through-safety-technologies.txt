fuel transition through safety technologies latest infraredbased flame detector helps make industrial facilities producing hydrogen safer october 4 2023 charlotte nc october 4 2023 honeywell recently announced a new infraredbased ir technology that quickly and reliably detects hydrogen flames before they grow into major fires honeywells fs24x plus flame detector helps protect workers and facilities from risks associated with hydrogen production and use hydrogen is highly flammable colorless odorless and 14 times lighter than air 1 there is no known odorant that can be added to hydrogen that is light enough to travel along with it which makes a leak imperceptible to the human senses clean hydrogen has a much lower carbon impact than traditional energy sources and has great potential when it comes to powering our future said sarah martin president of honeywell sensing safety technologies by innovating in technologies that help safeguard hydrogen facilities and workers we are driving further use of hydrogen as both a fuel source and a method of energy storage hydrogen fuel cells which generate electricity heat and water can be used to provide power to homes and other buildings as well as electric vehicles the energy transitions commission projects hydrogen will be the source of 13 of final energy demand in 2050 and reach a market value of 25 trillion or more 2 this is incredibly promising for the future of clean energy as hydrogen can be produced from diverse domestic resources and has the potential for nearzero greenhouse gas ghg emissions when hydrogen is burned in a fuel cell the primary byproduct is water vapor flame and gas detectorsparticularly those like the fs24x plus that can detect flames even in rainy foggy or smoky conditionsare important components of a comprehensive safety program for industrial facilities using hydrogen today hydrogen is critical to our infrastructure from oil refineries and power plants to chemical production facilities making ammonia and fertilizer as a byproduct hydrogen can also be found in data centers battery production plants and wastewater facilities to learn more about honeywells innovations in gas
