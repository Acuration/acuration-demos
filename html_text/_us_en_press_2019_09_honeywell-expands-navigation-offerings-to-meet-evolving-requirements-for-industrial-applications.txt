lightweight package without compromising on cost built to withstand almost any environment in the air on land or underwater these smallbutmighty sensors can serve several markets including agriculture robotics surveymapping unmanned vehicles and transportation an imu uses gyroscopes accelerometers and electronics to give precise rotation and acceleration data to a platforms control system the imu enables the system to calculate where it is what direction its going and at what speed even when gps signals arent available honeywell is committed to expanding our inertial sensor and navigation offerings to meet the needs of new industrial customers with our hguide i300 and hg4930 sclass imus said chris lund senior director hguide navigation and sensors honeywell aerospace our customers are
