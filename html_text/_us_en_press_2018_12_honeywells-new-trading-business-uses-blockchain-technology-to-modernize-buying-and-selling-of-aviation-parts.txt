selling of aviation parts honeywells new trading business uses blockchain technology to modernize buying and selling of aviation parts december 17 2018 phoenix dec 17 2018 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon is bringing the ease of everyday online buying and selling to the aviation parts industry with godirect trade the new ecommerce platform will improve access to new and used aircraft parts for airlines air transport and business aviation customers by offering transparent pricing and the option to buy inventory directly from its website a firstofitskind experience godirect trade represents an evolution in our market and being backed by a major equipment manufacturer brings the confidence we need to be one of the early adopters said thomas noonan director of material and part sales standardaero total aircraft spares this technology will help propel the aviation industry forward into the realm of other ecommerce sites that many of us use each day without a second thought previously buyers looking for aviation parts such as avionics auxiliary power units and more would have to call numerous companies wait days or even weeks to price a part and risk buying from a company that did not have the inventory immediately in stock on godirect trade honeywell is using blockchain technology to ensure every listing includes images and quality documents for the exact part being offered for sale giving the buyer confidence about purchasing the part in addition every part on godirect trade is immediately available for sale and shipping there is no need to wait days or even weeks for the seller to confirm availability currently less than 25 percent of all transactions in this space are done online said lisa butters who is leading the new honeywell aerospace venture up until now the ability to shop for spare parts online with prices product images and quality documentation all in one place was unheard of for the aviation industry building upon experience from the
