at honeywell i get to use a wide variety of my beloved materials machinery and sciences to solve important reallife problems that includes keeping people safe and helping them return home to their families in your eyes what qualities does a futureshaper possess a futureshaper pays attention to everything and learns to see patterns and connections a futureshaper understands the science surrounding a problem but they dont get bogged down in being a perfectionist a futureshaper must sometimes balance the conflict between doing what theyre told and solving the problem at hand they realize that they can either work to optimize a mediocre process or they can build a completely new one why is honeywell a great place to work at honeywell we are encouraged to work at the boundaries of what is possible we are also given the tools and support that we need often impressive breakthroughs happen in very ordinary environments it is amazing what can happen when bright motivated people deviate from the playbook and take educated risks when you are not working what do you do for fun i like to recall stories from my misspent youth and when time permits i write them down i also enjoy singing karaoke on occasion but i spend the most time running recreationally my family enters a few races each year so we have that in common but usually i trail the field learn more about what it is
