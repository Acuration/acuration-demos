bendix automotive brake pads among other products and eventually became the garrett spinoff the agreement was structured and sized to enable garrett to generate sufficient cash flow to make the required payments subject to an annual cap and other protections and operate in the marketplace as a standalone company garretts ceo and other garrett executives understood and communicated the spin structure and the new spin companys obligations including under the agreement at issue to investors ratings agencies analysts and the media in advance of the spin transaction in addition the spin
