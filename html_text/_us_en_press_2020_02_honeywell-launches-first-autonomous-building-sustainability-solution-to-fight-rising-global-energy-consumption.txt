sustainability solution to fight rising global energy consumption machine learning autonomously adjusts building energy settings to deliver up to doubledigit energy savings and a seamless occupant experience february 25 2020 atlanta feb 26 2020 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon announced today the launch of honeywell forge energy optimization a cloudbased closedloop machine learning solution that continuously studies a buildings energy consumption patterns and automatically adjusts to optimal energy saving settings without compromising occupant comfort levels honeywell forge energy optimization the first autonomous building solution focused on decreasing energy consumption may deliver doubledigit energy savings decrease a buildings carbon footprint and can be implemented without significant upfront capital expenses or changes to a buildings current operational processes system agnostic optimization and advancing the latest building iot technologies during a pilot at hamdan bin mohammed smart university hbmsu in dubai united arab emirates honeywell forge energy optimization demonstrated an initial 10 energy savings hbmsu is the first accredited smart university in the uae and is known for its technology and innovation programs honeywell forge energy optimization was applied to hbmsus existing building management system which uses competitor technology to demonstrate the platforms open architecture and hardwareagnostic capabilities the additional energy savings is especially significant because hbmsu is regarded as a highly smart energy efficient building with fully connected lighting cooling building management power and efficiency control that is optimized based on realtime occupancy the pilot also uncovered local control issues with the chiller plant and fresh air handling unit that were not adjusting to set points as a smart university we look to deploy the latest technology across our campus and ensure our buildings are efficient we were pleasantly surprised by the results we saw from honeywell forge and its ability to drive further energy savings beyond our achievable optimization with the techniques we have said dr mansoor al awar chancellor of hamdan bin mohammed smart university our further partnership with honeywell will help to support the advancement of artificial intelligence ai modeling for building automation and provide our students with firsthand applications of how ai and machine learning ml will drive operational efficiencies in buildings our goal is to collaborate with leading organizations like honeywell that support our vision of educating the innovators of tomorrow buildings arent static steel and concrete theyre dynamic ecosystems and their energy needs fluctuate based on everchanging variables like weather and occupancy said david trice vice president and general manager honeywell connected buildings with honeywell forge energy optimization were evolving building operations far beyond what would be possible even with a robust team of engineers and the rules they code in their building management system by employing the latest selflearning algorithms coupled with autonomous control we can help build portfolio owners finetune their energy expenditures to drive efficiencies and create more sustainable practices for our customers achieving energy savings beyond standard techniques energy consumption in commercial buildings is a significant issue because these buildings account for more than 36 of global final energy consumption and nearly 40 of total direct and indirect co 2 emissions 1 additionally heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac often presents the largest opportunity for energy savings in a commercial building 2 honeywell forge energy optimization autonomously and continually optimizes a buildings internal set points across hundreds of assets every 15 minutes to evaluate whether a buildings hvac system is running at peak efficiency when honeywells solution finds a need to make an adjustment it analyzes factors such as time of day weather occupancy levels and dozens of other data points to determine the optimal settings per building and makes calculated decisions 96 times per 24hour period for every building in a portfolio 365 days a year across the system of assets repeated results have shown doubledigit reductions of hvacrelated consumption while not impacting customer comfort traditional hvac control solutions incorporate varying levels of sophistication the most basic involve static set points that dont account for variable factors such as occupancy or weather the second and most common relies on scheduled setpoint adjustments using estimated occupancy and climate conditions finally set points can be managed by a certified energy manager however most facilities have not found this solution to produce a viable return on investment due to the sheer volume of variables involved and the difficulty in producing accurate calculations in any scalable manner honeywell forge energy optimization is simple for building portfolio owners to deploy with plugandplay capabilities no changes to business mechanics are needed and theres no need to rip and replace systems to add energy optimization to a building click here for more information on honeywell forge energy optimization 1 international
