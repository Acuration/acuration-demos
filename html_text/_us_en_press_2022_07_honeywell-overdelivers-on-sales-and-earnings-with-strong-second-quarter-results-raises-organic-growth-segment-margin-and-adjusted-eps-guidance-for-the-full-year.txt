original equipment grew double digits while air transport original equipment grew over 25 year over year as we continue to see strong build rates growth in commercial aerospace was partially offset by lower defense volumes segment margin expanded 80 basis points to 265 in the second quarter led by commercial excellence partially offset by cost inflation honeywell building technologies sales for the second quarter were up 14 on an organic basis year over year driven by strength in both building products and building solutions orders were up double digits for the second consecutive quarter led by building projects building management systems and security products segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 235 due to pricing actions partially offset by cost inflation performance materials and technologies sales for the second quarter were up 10 on an organic basis year over year despite an approximately 3 headwind from russia sales growth was led by solid pricing and greater volumes in advanced materials as well as strength in petrochemical catalyst shipments and thermal solutions which both grew over 20 in the quarter this growth was partially offset by lower equipment volumes and lost russian sales in uop segment margin expanded 150 basis points to 223 primarily driven by price actions partially offset by cost inflation safety and productivity solutions sales for the second quarter decreased 10 on an organic basis year over year as strength in advanced sensing technologies and productivity solutions and services was offset by lower personal protective equipment and warehouse automation volumes excluding the impact of lower covidmask volumes organic sales decreased by 5 in the quarter advanced sensing technologies grew 25 and productivity solutions and services grew 19 demonstrating excellent execution in a difficult supply constrained environment segment margin contracted 140 basis points to 126 primarily driven by lower volume leverage cost inflation and a
