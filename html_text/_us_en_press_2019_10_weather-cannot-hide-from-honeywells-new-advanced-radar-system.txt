radar system the allnew intuvue rdr7000 weather radar brings added safety comfort and efficiency to previously unserved aircraft platforms october 20 2019 las vegas oct 21 2019 prnewswire with the allnew honeywell nyse hon intuvue rdr7000 weather radar system bad weather doesnt have to be bad news for pilots or passengers the latest most advanced addition to the intuvue family expands honeywells advanced weather radar capabilities to more aircraft helping pilots safely navigate inclement weather keep passengers comfortable and get them to their destinations on time this intuitive system builds upon the technology and success of honeywells existing intuvue rdr4000 weather radar system found in larger commercial and military aircraft and expands its reach to include additional smaller platforms like regional and business jets as well as helicopters now more pilots passengers and operators can experience intuvue which is the most technically advanced weather radar available and the only radar to depict a vertical view of storms this provides pilots with an intuitive display of weather along a flight path to help choose the safest most comfortable route weatherrelated delays and cancellations cost the aviation industry billions of dollars every year while turbulencerelated incidents impact passenger comfort and safety the rdr7000 weather radar can accurately predict the presence of lightning or hail so pilots can avoid hazardous weather beyond weather conditions the radar can also detect turbulence up to 60 nautical miles ahead enabling the crew to avoid the turbulence or alert the passengers sooner like the existing intuvue rdr4000 the new radar system brings the proven technology of 3d volumetric scanning analyzing a storm cloud in 17 different scans from the ground up to 60000 feet providing a 3d view of the entire storm cell weather is difficult to predict and pilots continually run the risk of encountering unexpected weather like hail or thunderstorms which can impact the safety and comfort of all onboard said stevan slijepcevic president honeywell aerospace electronic solutions the rdr7000 reduces this risk by more than 50 using the new and improved automated mode which helps pilots focus on upcoming weather hazards and reroute decisions instead of operating the radar the rdr7000 provides fully automatic operation without requiring pilots to manually point the antenna to analyze a storm resulting in improved weather situational awareness with reduced cockpit workload business jet and regional carrier aircraft operators
