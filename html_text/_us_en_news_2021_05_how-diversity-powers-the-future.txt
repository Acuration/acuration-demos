diversity and celebrating asian american and pacific islander culture business development leader roopa shortt focuses on innovation that helps reduce carbon footprint in her role at honeywell she makes it easier for solar and wind power generation to completely replace coal and gas plants to celebrate asian american pacific islanders heritage month we asked roopa about shaping the future how does diversity power the future diversity comes in many forms its about your heritage your experience and learning and your unique point of view when we use all these perspectives to make products better to find ways to collaborate youre really unlocking the best of us all if we dont act inclusively and allow everyone to have their voice then its more likely we could be doing something wrong or missing on the full potential of the team we are in a really interesting period of the world right now there is no longer a normal way things are done its so fun to experience other cultures advances in technology have allowed us to learn more about other people and other cultures the opportunity for people to bring their authentic self to work will drive the next big things in the world how does your background shape your career i was born in india and moved to the us when i was 4 years old growing up in an indian immigrant family there are often expectations to go into medicine or engineering that started me on the engineering path since i love math science and problem solving i use those skills every day in my job and its helped me to be analytical and strategic in my career my engineering degree helps me understand multiple technologies and then translate the technical to simpler terms for customers this has helped me be able to move to excel in four industries three at honeywell and i started in automotive finally i work with people all over the world and coming from a unique heritage myself it makes it easier to connect with my colleagues and customers how have you been inspired by aapi leaders it is great how many aapi leaders we now have as role models which wasnt the case when i was younger in particular indian american women such as vice president kamala harris actor writer and producer mindy kaling and former pepsico ceo indra nooyi have made great impact in their respective fields and have also shown others the realm of the possible its inspiring to see so many asian americans succeed in diverse areas how do you inspire others there is definitely an aspect of people being able to visualize themselves in a role that can be critical to personal success i do hope that if others see me in my role they feel that they can do it too i have been a mentor for many colleagues at work i am also a girl scout troop leader and work to encourage girls to learn about science technology engineering and math stem the outdoors and other cultures girl scouts hold an annual event called thinking day and every troop represents a country we have highlighted japan india south africa among others and it helps kids get interested in people that arent like them your role is centered on sustainability why is that important for the future there has often been debate on how as the world population grows do we feed clothe and house all these people innovation has been the key human beings find new solutions to the worlds problems the critical piece now is how is that is done in a manner that is gentle to the planet it is critical for the future that honeywell remains on the forefront of supplying the worlds energy needs in a sustainable manner
