sophisticated active defense featuring autonomous deception tactics to outsmart attackers and provides high fidelity threat detection honeywells technology features an approach recommended by governments and cybersecurity standard bodies because of its ability to detect and control attacks 1 traditionally building ot environments rely on prevention technology and passive detection such as perimeter security and network traffic analysis to secure systems yet more than 1 in 4 27 surveyed facility managers experienced a cyber breach of their ot systems in the last 12 months according to a recent survey conducted by honeywell building technologies threat actors continue to target building systems with both targeted attacks and ransomware attacks these attacks can go beyond accessing private customer data and may potentially impair the operations for critical organizations that keep society running such as utilities data centers hospitals and airports htdp uses deception tactics to confuse and mislead threats away from critical assets and devices resulting in low false alerts and a high rate of detection the solution leads threat actors to decoy assets which appear to be valuable ot and it devices however none of the devices are real and there is no access to the enterprise assets the solution makes real critical operational devices harder to find slowing down adversaries and helping security teams capture them faster the quantity and complexity of cyberattacks unfortunately are increasing every day reinforcing the need for building owners and operators to
