ways retailers can meet the needs of the postpandemic shopper since the start of covid19related shutdowns in early 2020 the retail industry has experienced wave after wave of challenges now the retail industry is returning not to prepandemic practices but to a new normal with 2023 around the corner we asked one of honeywells retail experts tony boncore for his perspective on what the industry can expect in the year ahead whats the biggest change youve seen that will impact retailers in 2023 boncore in a word consumers theyve changed of course consumer behavior was shifting well before the pandemic but the widespread shutdown of brickandmortar stores moved online shopping from convenience to an ingrained customer behavior across many demographics consumers are also more demanding they want what they want and they want it now regardless of supply chain issues if you cant satisfy a consumers need today theyll look for a retailer who can i think a lot of this behavior comes from the easy access to information and options people discovered as they moved online in droves years ago retailers had power over the consumer today consumers have power over retailers the good news is that people are excited to get back out there in many if not most cities and towns 2022 holiday shoppers kept stores busy how can retailers adapt to this new normal boncore first adopting a unified commerce approach is critical while people are returning to stores they will continue to research and buy online at levels far higher than before the pandemic taking a unified commerce approach means that retailers need to meet you the consumer everywhere and anywhere including stores websites and social media channels with consistently excellent shopping and buying experiences as well as seamless pickup delivery and return experiences second minimize friction everywhere on the salesfloor that means being able to address customers questions or concerns on the spot how do you do that you need to provide shoppers andor salespeople instant access to information depending on the level of customer service shoppers expect at a particular retailer that could be by issuing employees connected devices like a smartphone or tablet or it could be via kiosks located throughout the store then think about the checkout experience everywhere you shopped you used to walk up to the cashier and they cashed you out now in so many stores youre expected to do it and of course youre not getting paid to do it talk about friction i believe well see more stores adopting touchless checkout technologies where your smartphone your payment method your shopping cart and artificial intelligence all connect in the cloud to eliminate the need for a physical checkout counter altogether what should retailers be doing to sustain or grow brickandmortar sales boncore retailers need to realize that enhancing the frontline worker experience is key to a better customer experience that means among other things equipping salespeople with the technology they need to deliver that great customer experience todays shoppers are better informed than ever many times and virtually all the time for larger considered purchases consumers have done their research before hitting the stores and of course they were narrowly focused on what they were researching if retail workers are going to be able to bring anything to the party theyre going to need technology onhand that helps them keep up with and get ahead of what customers know about a product too many times to count ive seen a team member on the sales floor pull out their personal smartphone to do some onthefly research on a customers behalf resourceful yes professional not so much employees just like the shoppers want a very specific experience that they can portray to the consumer retailers need to recognize that their employees are shoppers too and therefore understand the shopping experience very well investing in instore technology that mimics the personal devices workers use every day is just smart business what else should retailers consider when it comes to empowering their teams running stores boncore retail associates are a primary point of contact and theyre not yesterdays salespeople either retail floor sales used to be an entrylevel position but as wages rise the worker profile changes a bit as do retailers expectations technology can go a long way toward aligning everyones expectations and driving productivity tony boncore guides the strategic direction of honeywells instore connected retail solutions
