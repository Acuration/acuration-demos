in championship hunt at midpoint of f1 season october 5 2018 rolle switzerland aug 25 2017 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon has partnered with scuderia ferrari in an ambitious project to develop advanced turbocharging systems in formula 1 racing as the famed team seeks the 2017 world constructors championship scuderia ferrari has recorded four wins and 12 podium finishes through the first half of the season honeywell a global leader and innovator in turbocharging and connected vehicle technology has worked with the team since the series changed its rules for the 2014 season to include smaller 16l v6 turbocharged engines as part of an overall power unit designed with the latest in energy recovery technology the partnership we have forged with scuderia ferrari in recent years is based upon continuous improvement and a constant push for everincreasing power density and engine efficiency said honeywell transportation systems chief technology officer craig balis our motorsport efforts allow us the opportunity to work in uncharted areas that are well above anything that has been certified for production vehicles by pushing the known limits in turbocharging technologies we strengthen our ability to continue to bring the worlds leading turbochargers to market turbochargers developed for formula 1 typically achieve rotational speeds that are 20 to 35 percent faster than similarly sized turbochargers used in passenger vehicles the wear and tear an engine and turbocharger experience during a typical formula 1 race is estimated to be more than an average passenger car would see
