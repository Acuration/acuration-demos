solutions predicts 2020s top cybersecurity trends for buildings november 13 2019 securing building operational systems will become a priority for many businesses as increased threats related to connected building technologies will likely arise the need to secure both operational technology ot and traditional information technology it is expected to create demand for a new skillset and new type of security professional brussels nov 14 2019 honeywell nyse hon today released its predictions on emerging trends that will shape cybersecurity for buildings next year honeywell building solutions cybersecurity professionals identified insights and expected changes resulting from more open connected and smart building systems and provided advice on how businesses can better safeguard valuable assets against cyber threats as their facilities digitally transform mirel sehic global director of cybersecurity for honeywell building solutions led a linkedin live broadcast yesterday nov 13 about cybersecurity for building operational technology ot at honeywells technology day in brussels view the linkedin live broadcast on the honeywell linkedin page four key predictions for 2020 include buildings will likely see an increase in cyber related threats as they become more connected putting data reputation and people at potentially greater risk according to gartner buildings will account for 81 of all connected things in 2020 still connected buildings often remain a lessguarded entry point and cybersecurity has oftentimes not been a primary focus when managing operational technology ot research from accenture shows that online intruders are increasingly seeking to exploit this weakness as security breaches have increased by 65 in the last five years we expect this will continue in the years ahead causing serious disruption sehic explains ot systems are in some instances being targeted to directly manipulate operations and as a bridge to it data for example attacks on ot systems sometimes occur in hospitals and can lead to ransomware incidents where staff are locked out of their computers this can lead to issues such as delays in accessing patient files or even admitting patients and when it takes 23 days on average to resolve a ransomware attack this can be catastrophic cybersecurity for ot is expected to become a key safety and security metric for many businesses in 2020 as digitization and the interconnectivity of systems potentially opens up new routes of access for cyberattacks as buildings become smarter they generally produce more and more connected data and therefore oftentimes attract more potential threats in fact a ceb study found that nearly 20 of organizations with iot networks have experienced at least one iotrelated attack already as businesses experience more attacks and the resulting damage caused many will likely develop new and more robust strategies to keep pace we expect to see more preventative measures in the coming year such as training focused on addressing potential cyber threats in ot and on conducting cybersecurity assessments to identify gaps sehic says historically weve often seen a serious lack of awareness and preparation around ot cybersecurity issues but thats starting to change more attention and more budget is oftentimes being dedicated to furthering basic cyber hygiene upkeep and ot cybersecurity incident readiness and we expect that to continue in 2020 but its typically not enough cybersecurity assessments must be carried out across a buildings ot infrastructure to identify gaps honeywell recently helped one of the worlds largest financial services institutions better safeguard its assets which included multiple buildings and thousands of employees the team performed vulnerability testing deploying advanced strategies for cybersecurity and creating a methodology for data management to help prevent leakage of valuable digital information demand is expected to increase for a new type of security professional as ot and it responsibilities often overlap by 2021 iot security service spending will more than double to nearly 21 billion according to gartner as cyber threats evolve and the demand for ot cybersecurity grows the role of the security professional is often changing ot and it functions have been increasingly working together to prepare for and respond to cyberattacks but in 2020 we will likely see more individual professionals with both ot and it capabilities these employees typically start their career in one function but grow their skillset overtime as they gain more overarching security experience sehic says weve seen a lot of employees take action and actively develop new and broader abilities it is becoming increasingly common for it cybersecurity professionals to learn more about ot as well as traditional ot engineers wanting to find out more and grow their skillsets in cybersecurity at honeywell building solutions we recognized this emerging need and have been fostering a learning environment to expand our talent and cybersecurity workforce we believe the industry will soon follow a global standard for cybersecurity is expected to become a top priority across industries 2020 will likely bring a greater focus to standardization for building cybersecurity and we expect to see at least one framework emerge as a leading guide for securing a buildings ot system there are many different frameworks being discussed making standardization an ambitious prospect says sehic the move toward standardization will almost certainly gain traction globally in the year ahead this year honeywell joined the global cybersecurity alliance gca created by the international society of automation isa as a founding member to accelerate the development and adoption of cybersecurity standards sehic concludes 2020 will very likely be a transformative year for building technology as businesses make bigger strides toward securing their ot systems against increased cyber threats having the right skillsets to combat the rise of threats is becoming increasingly more important about honeywell building technologies
