groundbreaking alkylation technology sinochem hongrun petrochemicals to produce cleanerburning fuels with honeywells groundbreaking alkylation technology april 25 2019 des plaines ill april 25 2019 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon uop announced today that sinochem hongrun petrochemical co ltd will use honeywell uops isoalky ionic liquids alkylation technology to produce cleanerburning motor fuels at its refinery complex in china hongrun is the first petrochemicals manufacturer in china to license isoalky technology a costeffective solution for refining companies as an alternative to conventional liquid acid systems or solid catalyst systems to produce highquality alkylate for cleanburning fuels developed in conjunction with chevron usa inc in 2016 the isoalky technology is the first successful liquid alkylation technology to be introduced in more than 75 years the technology uses ionic liquids instead of conventional hydrofluoric or sulfuric acids as a catalyst to produce alkylate a critical component for making highoctane motor fuels isoalky technology can be used in new refineries as well as in existing facilities undergoing capital improvements alkylation units add highoctane hydrocarbons to gasoline helping prevent knocking or autoignition of the fuel in an engine while helping the fuel to burn with fewer exhaust particulates isoalky technology is a compelling solution to meeting the increased demand for cleanerburning fuels but with far simpler handling requirements than with conventional liquid acid technologies said bryan glover vice president and general manager of honeywell uops process technology and equipment business the ionic liquid catalyst at the heart of the process delivers equal or better yields of highquality alkylate needed for refiners to meet new requirements for higheroctane cleanerburning fuels the technology was proven in a demonstration unit at chevrons salt lake city refinery where it operated successfully for five years and where chevron is currently converting its hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit to the new technology more than half of the worlds approximately 700 refineries currently have alkylation units that use hydrofluoric or sulfuric acid ionic liquids have strong acid properties that enable them to produce alkylate but without the volatility of conventional acids ionic liquids are comprised largely of ions that convert c 4 paraffins and other olefins into an excellent gasolinerange blending product due to their low vapor pressure ionic liquids allow simpler handling procedures than sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids the technology also can produce alkylate from a wider range of feedstocks using a lower volume of catalyst operating at temperatures below 100c the liquid catalyst has a negligible vapor pressure and can be regenerated onsite sinochem hongrun petrochemical co ltd produces and sells liquefied petroleum gas diesel fuel gasoline asphalt and lubricating oil
