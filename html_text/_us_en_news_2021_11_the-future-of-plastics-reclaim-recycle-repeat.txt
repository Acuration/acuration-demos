contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle news the future of plastics reclaim recycle repeat the future of plastics reclaim recycle repeat a new recycling process technology could help contribute to an environment with less plastic waste you have probably seen the recycling triangle reduce reuse recycle plastic circularity is the next generation of that concept the goal is to be able to use the plastic infinitely carrie eppelheimer of honeywell sustainable technology solutions said today mechanical recycling current mechanical recycling technology is limited in the kinds of plastics that can be recycled as a result a critical solution is needed for recycling more plastic waste to avoid potential adverse longterm global impacts to ecosystems food supply and human health theyre still showing up in our waterways and rivers and theyre leaking out of landfills eppelheimer said of plastics we have a waste plastic challenge with these lightweight materials getting into the environment in ways that we need to solve most plastic today ends up in landfill or is incinerated mechanical recycling processes only a fraction of current plastic waste volumes and it usually produces lowerquality plastic for example your food packaging might be transformed into lawn furniture not back into another food package you often cant get the same performance when you mechanically recycle because youre heating that product and thats degrading the molecular bonds eppelheimer said that means it cant reenter the same sort of highperformance application the upgrade chemical recycling enter advanced recycling or chemical recycling chemical recycling takes plastic waste unsuitable for mechanical recycling and chemically breaks it down into a recycled polymer feedstock rpf that feedstock can then be used in the plastic production value chain to manufacture new highquality plastics with chemical recycling complementing other methods of recycling you can increase the amount of plastic that actually gets recycled by about three times over current levels eppelheimer said this allows for the plastics to be used for products including but not limited to food packaging pharmaceuticals and medical devices reducing waste and carbon footprint there are many different types of plastics including polyethylene polypropylene and pet they each have very different endoflife options upcycle developed by honeywell uop can reduce the carbon footprint of plastic waste handling typically by more than 50 relative to conventional incineration and landfilling so not only are we providing a new repeatable route to keep plastic waste out of the environment and return it back to useful plastics were also helping lower the global warming footprint of these valuable materials
