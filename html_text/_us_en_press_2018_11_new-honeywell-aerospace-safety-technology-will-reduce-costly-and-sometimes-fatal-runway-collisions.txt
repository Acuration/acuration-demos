runway collisions new honeywell aerospace safety technology will reduce costly and sometimes fatal runway collisions november 13 2018 rolle switzerland nov 13 2018 prnewswire honeywell nyse hon has completed initial testing of its new safety technology that helps airlines and business jets avoid runway accidents and collisions developed under the single european sky air traffic management research program with program partners airbus dassault and eurocontrol the softwarebased surface indications and alert system surf ia gives pilots visual and audio warnings about approaching hazards on the runway in europe runway incursions which can be costly and dangerous occur at least twice daily there are no independent avionics systems on the market today that can help avoid runway accidents and collisions said mike stewart vice president advanced technologies honeywell aerospace with solutions such as honeywells smartrunway smartlanding and now surf ia we are pioneering accident prevention through better pilot awareness less latency in decisionmaking and quicker actions surf ia allows us to take our existing technology a step further by helping reduce the risk of an incident with other aircraft on the runway the technology is the latest among the safetyfocused product breakthroughs and inventions that honeywell has delivered to the aerospace industry including smartrunway and smartlanding the enhanced ground proximity warning system and smarttraffic collision avoidance system traditionally pilots have relied entirely on their line of sight and instructions from air traffic control to avoid collisions the new honeywell technology through softwarebased data analysis and algorithms provides early warning to aircrews empowering pilots to make quicker decisions and avoid runway incursions the system analyzes aircraft position data and calculates factors such as time to collision through specialized algorithms to alert pilots of surrounding aircraft honeywells system is designed to require minimal changes to existing avionics and uses automatic dependent surveillancebroadcast out data a globally mandated technology upgrade due by 2020 to make installation of the solution quick and simple after successful prototype testing aboard honeywells test aircraft honeywell plans to begin fullscale production development for more information about
