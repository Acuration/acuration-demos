technology now one step closer to the battlefield october 19 2017 phoenix oct 19 2017 prnewswire augmented and virtual reality could soon be keeping our men and women safer in combat vehicles on the battlefield honeywell nyse hon has successfully completed research and testing of a virtual window technology as part of the defense advanced research projects agencys ground xvehicle technologies program an augmented and virtual reality headset along with a wraparound display successfully allowed operators of a windowless vehicle to effectively see what was around them this is the first case where a natural viewing experience has been achieved in an indirect windowless driving system we leveraged our expertise in highspeed graphics processing human factors design and display systems to create a virtual landscape that enables driving a windowless vehicle over actual terrain at operationally realistic speeds said brian aleksa senior technical manager research development honeywell aerospace after bringing a smart design to life with realworld testing weve developed a windowless display that overcomes traditional challenges associated with motion sickness and eye strain our solution proves that a safer closedcockpit experience is possible there is plenty of future growth and potential application for this technology in both military and commercial markets the first phase of the gxvt program began in july 2015 with honeywell experimenting with the concept and possibility of a windowless land vehicle drivers tested their performance using an augmented and virtual reality headset and panoramic active window displays after successful initial testing the defense advanced research projects agency darpa continued its contract with honeywell through aug 29 2017 honeywell successfully tested virtual window systems by driving a fully enclosed vehicle on a rugged offroad desert course as part of the test professional drivers maneuvered through the track at speeds of more than 35 miles per hour they drove the windowless vehicle using 160degree battlefield views through the virtual window display by reimagining how a driver interacts with the outside world future systems based on gxvt research could enable an entirely new way of driving vehicle operators could eventually be given a full 360degree view of their surroundings which would allow them to use new methods and strategies to stay protected from external threats these future systems could also provide operators with more information about their mission such as optimal routes difficult terrain or troop movements by augmenting what they are seeing the virtual reality technology would also be useful in training or simulation environments supporting resources read more about honeywells
