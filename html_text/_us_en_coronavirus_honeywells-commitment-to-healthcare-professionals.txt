contenthoneywellbtusensearchhtml title subtitle honeywells commitment to healthcare professionals and first responders april 3 2020 honeywell is communicating the following principles to our stakeholders to ensure our personal protective equipment ppe products are being placed quickly and costeffectively in the hands of those most in need including first responders and medical professionals at honeywell we are committed to supporting the safety of our employees customers and fellow citizens around the world this is a critical time in our industry and in our history and the number of requests and orders we have received for personal protective equipment ppe related to the covid19 pandemic is unprecedented to that end we have begun to invest in new production facilities and expand existing ones to increase production of these critical ppe products and bring them to market as quickly as possible we are working around the clock with our teams to ensure that we are serving the most critical needs of our partners and our communities and to ensure that those who need these critical items most the medical care workers and first responders have access to the ppe they need so they can care for others safely there has been substantial media coverage recently describing how certain distributors and individuals have purchased and hoarded critical healthrelated products such as ventilators masks and sanitizers obtained through various channels to engage in price gouging of enduser customers this activity is indefensible immoral and illegal it puts lives at risk and strains the already financially challenged resources of our most vulnerable population and we have zero tolerance for this we expect that at a minimum all of our partners will comply with all applicable laws prohibiting price gouging and apply appropriate diligence to the greatest extent possible to understand how our products are being purchased so that they are placed quickly and costeffectively in the hands of those most in need including first responders and medical professionals in addition while we do not control the prices that third parties set we have established standardization and fair pricing on select personal protective equipment used in the covid19 response effort if we find that one of our partners is not upholding the letter or spirit of this commitment we reserve the right not to fulfill that partners orders and terminate our relationship with that party the days ahead will be stressful for all of us only by working together will we ensure that the most critical needs are met and those that are placing themselves in harms way will have the protection needed to serve those affected by this pandemic we thank our partners for the efforts they are undertaking to help serve our communities and look forward to working with them in the weeks ahead as we stand together in this crisis to serve those impacted by this great challenge
