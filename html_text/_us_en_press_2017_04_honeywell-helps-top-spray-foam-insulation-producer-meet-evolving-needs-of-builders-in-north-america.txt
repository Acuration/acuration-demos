are a critical ingredient in foam insulation allowing the foam to expand and enabling its excellent insulating performance which in turn affects energy use unlike other types of insulation closed cell spray foam provides a unique combination of outstanding thermal insulation and air sealing performance which can lead to higher energy efficiency for example in comparison with fiberglass spray foam offers twice the insulation value 1 and superior energy efficiency solstice lba has an ultralow gwp of 1 which is 999 percent lower than hfcs and equal to carbon dioxide solstice lba offers several other added benefits as well it can provide a higher yield reduce clogs in the spray guns the installation teams use create better consistency of the foam itself and it can provide better adhesion to

president demilec we are seeing growing acceptance of spray foam by architects builders and homeowners they recognize the value of a wellsealed building insulated with spray foam i think solstice lba will become a key differentiator as people demand a more comfortable living space with greater energy efficiency the launch of heatlok hfo is a milestone for demilec as it transitions its closedcell foam product line from hydrofluorocarbon hfc blowing agents with high globalwarmingpotentials gwps to alternatives with ultralow gwp such as solstice lba the transition is occurring well ahead of regulations calling for a phaseout of hfcs and positions demilec for growth with innovative products with a strong presence in the united states and canada demilec is highly respected when it comes to
