ways engineers use pi 5 ways engineers use pi its not just for math class on day were exploring why 314 matters engineers use pi every day the mathematical constant 31415926 is the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter its key in a range of calculations especially those related to round things heres how professionals use pi in the real world 1 to talk to satellites getting wifi to work on airplanes that takes pi our jetwave satellite communications system enables seamless connectivity for aircraft the hardware on the plane includes an antenna pictured above that must point toward the selected satellite that it wants to communicate with said allyce macon a senior advanced embedded engineer no matter the location of the plane or the attitude of the plane no thats not a typo of altitude attitude is how the plane is tilted in space the antenna is like a satellite dish on your house allyce said for example you only have to point the one on your house once and it works all of the time to point toward the satellite in the sky we must use trigonometry allyce said we need pi for that summary pi helps us figure out how to point an antenna toward a satellite under any circumstance 2 to drive electric motors pi has a big role to play in actuation actuators control the flaps that move on aircraft wings and tails or the parts that open and close valves on jet engines controllers send signals to electric motors telling them how fast they need to spin to make the actuators move said terry ahrendt a systems engineer that requires the controller to put out a frequency in sync with the motor speed the equation omega 2 times frequency hz to get the speed rpm that answer is divided by 2 along with other factors youve likely already heard of rpm or revolutions per minute theres a device on the dashboard of your car that measures this for how quickly your tires are spinning called a tachometer note each 2 cancels each other out but each step is essential if you need a part of the equation this is useful for instance in calculating the power required to move the actuator summary pi helps a controller drive a motor to move an actuator 3 to size up vessels at refineries pi is used to calculate the volume of cylinders in case youve forgotten since math class that formula is volume pi multiplied by the radius squared multiplied by height v r2h one example of a large cylinder would be vessels that are used in catalyst manufacturing sites as well as refineries said elvan sari lead process engineer that business provides technology for petroleum refining gas processing petrochemical producing and manufacturing refineries also use metal vessels to make fuel said willie coetzee a service manager the chemicals in those vessels must have optimal flow to complete chemical reactions in that process pi helps us guarantee that is the case summary pi helps us calculate the size of giant cylinders used form refinery equipment to rolls of paper for printers 4 to measure a roll of paper on a smaller scale the paper capacity of barcode printers affects the size of paper rolls used these printers used in hospitals warehouses power plants and more use a wide variety of printable materials such as paper and polyester each requiring a different roll length if we make the rolls too large they wont fit in the printer said engineer anders wallenius pi is used in a formula that finds a materials maximum roll length for these printers summary pi helps determine how large of a roll of paper will fit in a printer 5 to determine the capacity hot water storage tanks and heaters our services group that works on buildings upgrades existing old and inefficient facility equipment in k12 schools municipal facilities and colleges during those projects they replace equipment with energy efficient heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems senior engineer paul peters explained that the existing tanks need to be replaced with new tanks that have the correct amount of storage required to serve the building occupants summary pi is used to determine the volume of the new tanks innovation culture related content the future is ai and the next big
