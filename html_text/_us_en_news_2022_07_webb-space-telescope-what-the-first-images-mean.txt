history nasas webb space telescope is helping to unfoldtheuniverse by capturing the deepest infrared images of space see the first images and learn how honeywells engineers played a role have you ever wished you could go back in time how about to a time 137 billion years ago or just a few hundred million years after the big bang thats about how far back into the universes history were now able to view thanks to the observatory known as the webb space telescope which is the worlds largest and most powerful space telescope nearly six months after being launched into space the webb telescope is situated about 1 million miles away from earth and its instruments have started capturing images the telescope is now open for scientific operations in other words taking images of the first objects that illuminated the universe known as first light objects after the big bang observing how galaxies and stars have evolved and studying if there are conditions favorable for life on other planetary systems nasa has released the webb telescopes first fullcolor images keep reading for highlights on what makes the images innovative and how honeywell aerospace engineers played a role in one of webbs twopart instruments what do webbs first images mean sources nasa esa csa and stsci among the webb space telescopes first fullcolor images released by nasa was the image above showing galaxy cluster smacs 0723 as it appeared 46 billion years ago its the most detailed infrared image of the early universe to date according to nasa why its innovative webbs image captures an area of the sky that is approximately the size of a grain of sand and it reveals some of the faintest objects ever observed sources nasa esa csa and stsci another webb image shows cosmic cliffs captured in infrared light which is a starforming region called ngc 3324 in the carina nebula according to nasa why its innovative the image reveals areas of star birth that were previously invisible according to nasa sources nasa esa csa and stsci this webb image the largest image from the telescope yet shows stephans quintet a visual grouping of five galaxies why its innovative webb was able to show previously unseen details in the galaxy group because of the telescopes resolution and infrared vision according to nasa read more about webbs first images a closer look at webb an international program led by nasa with its partners the european space agency and the canadian space agency webb is considered the scientific successor and is complementary to the hubble space telescope the two have different capabilities and webb can see deeper into space than hubble according to nasa the four instruments on webb each play an important role in allowing it to capture images that are expected to help scientists observe deep into the universes past source ball aerospace via nasa honeywells aerospace engineers built and tested a two for one instrument that the canadian space agency contributed to webb the first part is the fine guidance sensor fgs which helps guide the telescope and point it precisely so it can focus on an object of interest the fgs is the most sophisticated guidance sensor of any telescope and it remains active during all of webbs observations the second part is the near infrared imager and slitless spectrograph niriss which is designed to help scientists observe distant galaxies as well as study the chemical composition of exoplanets atmospheres to possibly search for conditions that may be favorable for life neil rowlands engineering fellow and project scientist in our aerospace business has been a part of the canadian space agencys contributions to the telescope since the idea of a nextgeneration telescope was just a concept with webb we can see deeper into the universe than hubble did which means well look back further in time when stars and galaxies released this first light that webb and its instruments will now see they were only a few hundred million years old much closer to the big bang and closer to their formation environment scientists will now try to link what they see in the early universe with webb to the universe we see today revealing a fuller picture of the universes evolution rowlands said aerospace related content tracking recent extreme weather with the swot satellite mission to mars how innovation will take us there a glossary
