that the work that human sign spinner was doing could be done by the sun what advice would you give to someone who wants to be an inventor my advice to those who want to be an inventor is that the old adage necessity is the mother of invention holds true look for opportunities to solve a problem that is a societal need use all your experiences from your past and from others to solve the problem hunter hammond engine structures lead engineer number of patents 2 and one trade secret what was it like to receive your first patent it was very exciting to receive my first patent when i performed my initial disclosure of the invention i was unsure if the ideas were actually patentable however as the process progressed i was assured the ideas had merit and as the application process moved forward my excitement grew i still proudly display my first patent award in my cubicle what advice would you give to someone who wants to be an inventor i feel theres a misconception in our society that inventors are people who only strive to invent things and simply do nothing else in reality most inventions are a byproduct of attempting to solve problems or issues do not focus on inventing

electrical engineer number of patents 12 what was it like to receive your first patent my first published patent was very exciting i love being an engineer and trying to find ways to solve hard

you can about the technology youre inventing validate your ideas with experts to avoid repeating mistakes others have made and never give up when you know you have a good solution daniel c merkel

these phds really get a patent the rest is history someone snapped a photo of me receiving a certificate for it from a retired lead patent lawyer at the annual patent awards banquet that i still display in my office i also vividly remember the pride in my wifes eyes when i was walking back to our table what advice would you give to someone who wants to be an inventor change your mindset
