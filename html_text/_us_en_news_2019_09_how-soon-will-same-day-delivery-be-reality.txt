retail federation heres what it will take for sameday delivery to become a reality bring products closer to home the expectation for fast delivery is already happening with food delivery services said eric rice another warehouse automation expert who has been at honeywell for more than 20 years but restaurants are close to consumers which helps with fast delivery and keeps food warm when it arrives people are less and less likely to want to walk out their front door for food and other products eric said to achieve faster shipping with things like clothes toiletries and other nonperishables retailers will need to keep goods close to consumers thats already occurring with some sameday delivery options on select products eric expects todays massive warehouses often located in rural areas
