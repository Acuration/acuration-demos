and with less human intervention compared with traditional drones using batteries and lineofsight radio links drones equipped with honeywells beyond visual line of sight bvlos technologies can fly farther carry more weight avoid hazards up to three kilometers away and stream video of their progress anywhere in the world these are technologies that businesses have been waiting for said stphane fymat vice president and general manager of honeywells unmanned aerial systems and urban air mobility business unit they will help make drones profitable for a world of new applications honeywells

avionics engines and apus for airplanes helicopters and military drones the bvlos suite comprises honeywells 600watt and 1200watt hydrogen fuel cells honeywells rdr84k multipurpose radar honeywells inertial measurement units imus honeywells uav satcom the worlds smallest and lightest satellite transceiver the fuel cells in the bvlos suite operate three times longer than batteries with equivalent output they work silently unlike gasoline engines and emit no greenhouse gases operators can refuel or swap hydrogen tanks in minutes enabling more time in the air honeywells rdr84k is a phasedarray radar that steers beams electronically meaning it has no moving parts and requires minimal maintenance it also requires no heavy cooling systems in addition to avoiding other aircraft the radar can detect obstacles map terrain and identify landing zones it can act as a radar altimeter and provide mapping for alternate navigation if gps guidance fails the bvlos suite will allow drone designers to combine data in clever new ways to save weight and power its radar computes an avoidance path using builtin circuitry rather than requiring a separate processor its satellite uplink can be used to download realtime weather and traffic reports from other drones honeywells uav satcom and imus are available now with some imu models priced as low as 1800 the rdr84k and fuel cells are in latestage
