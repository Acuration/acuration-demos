Distributed Energy
Putting distributed energy resources to work to make the grid cleaner, more flexible, and more resilient.

Resource Aggregation
Energy Is a Two-Way Street
Distributed Energy for a Cleaner, More Resilient Grid
The popularity of on-site renewables, energy storage, demand response, electric vehicles, and EV charging continues to grow among commercial and residential customers. The opportunities—and challenges—of orchestrating these distributed energy resources has quickly evolved from “nice to have” to “essential.” In the process, Enel X has emerged as the partner of choice to help utilities master their energy transition.
Technology for a Greener Grid
Automating and orchestrating the distributed energy revolution takes technology leadership. Digital platforms that enable customers to monitor demand response events and, in the case of batteries, charge and discharge levels are key to tracking and analyzing performance.

Energy Is a Two-Way Street
Energy used to be one-directional. Today, it’s a two-way street with more and more power, literally, in the hands of consumers in the form of distributed energy resources and demand response participation. Smart utilities are harnessing that power to become greener and more reliable.
