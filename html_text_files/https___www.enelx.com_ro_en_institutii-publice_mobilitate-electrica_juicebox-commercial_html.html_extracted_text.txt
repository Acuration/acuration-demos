How it works
Consultancy
Full control
We are here to provide complete solutions that reduce costs for public administrations and help them accelerate the transition to sustainable transport.
The installation of a charging station or the creation of an infrastructure for the fleet of electric cars or buses is done quickly and safely, with the accessories included.
You manage charging stations for electric or hybrid plug-in cars in one place. You provide access to users of electric cars through the JuicePass app.
By connecting the station to a smart meter, the power limiting functionality allows charging at the maximum available power, without exceeding it.
Your advantages
Accessible
With JuiceBox you easily manage charging sessions and reports, using integration with the Enel X dashboard.
For modern institutions
We created a dedicated environment for the institution’s applications, which allows you to charge at the car charging stations, monitor consumption and receive notifications.
Other solutions for local administrations
Enel X equips cities and companies with smart tools to efficiently manage their electric fleets.
