Cookie Policy
This Cookie Policy provides information for users on the way we use cookies and/or monitoring technologies to collect information given when they visit the Website.

1. What are “cookies”?

1.1. Cookies are small text files that websites send to users’ devices (e.g. computer, tablet, smartphone, notebook, etc.), where they are saved and then sent back to the same sites on the user’s next visit. Cookies may require the user’s prior consent.

1.2. Cookies allow the device on which they are stored to be identified for the entire period of their validity or registration. During visits to the Website, navigation data-related information received from the user’s device may be stored in cookies installed on the latter.

1.3. Cookies perform different functions and make navigating the Website more efficient by remembering the user’s preferences and enhancing their navigation experience. They can also help personalize the advertisements shown during navigation and the marketing activities aimed at the user, ensuring that they reflect his/her interests and preferences.

1.4. Cookie settings can be changed at any time. The following information provides further detail about the cookies used by the Website and the ways the settings relating to them can be managed.

2. Types of cookies used

2.1. When a user connects to the Website via their web browser, cookies may be installed on their device in order to enable the Website to recognize that device, ensuring the effective use of the Website for the lifetime of the cookies, and to collect information on accesses to the Website.

2.2. When navigating the Website, cookies may also be sent to the device from other sites or servers (i.e. “third parties”); these may contain certain elements (e.g. images, maps, sound, specific links to pages in other domains) present on the site being visited. With regard to this profile, these may be:

2.2.1.
First party cookies
, sent directly by Enel to the user’s device.

2.2.2.
Third party cookies
, which are sent by a third party but on Enel’s behalf.

2.3. Depending on the purpose of the cookies, these can be divided into:

2.3.1.
Technical cookies
: their use does not require user’s consent. The use is strictly limited to the transmission of session-identifying data (numbers generated randomly by the server) necessary for the secure, efficient navigation of the Website; these are not persistent cookies stored on the user’s computer but are erased when the browser is closed. These cookies are used for security reasons and to improve the service offered to users. Analytics cookies that collect information in aggregate form on visits to the Website and its navigation, in order to optimize its contents, can be equated to technical cookies.

2.3.2.
Analytics cookies
: Enel uses analytical cookies in order to analyze the number of users and how they use the Site. In case of aggregate collection of information on visits to the site and its navigation, analytics cookies used can be equated to technical cookies and do not require consent, being therefore included in the category of "Technical cookies", mentioned in the previous paragraph. Otherwise, their use is allowed with the user's consent (e.g. analytics cookies from a third party that combines them with other processing)..

2.3.3.
Profiling cookies
: this kind of cookies require user’s consent. Profiling cookies create user profiles and are used to send out advertising messages that reflect the preferences expressed by the latter while surfing the web or to enhance their navigation experience. These cookies can be used for this purpose only with the user’s consent. Profiling cookies can also include Retargeting cookies, i.e. cookies that enable the display of personalized advertisements based on the user's interests and behavior. These cookies allow partners to communicate, optimize and serve advertisements based on the user's browsing history.

3. Third-party content on our site
