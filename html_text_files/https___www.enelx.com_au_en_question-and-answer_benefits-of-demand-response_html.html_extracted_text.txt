FAQ
What are the benefits of Demand Response?
Maximise payments to your bottom line
: Enel X manages your participation from start to finish, ensuring you earn the highest possible financial reward.
Improve your facilities’ resilience
: Demand response participants receive advanced notification of grid stability issues, enabling them to proactively protect their facilities from potential power outages. In addition, if you enrol your backup generation assets in our VPP, participation leads to more regular testing, and helps to iron out any assumptions around reliability, with the safety net of grid power to switch back to.
Support your community
: Your participation helps maintain reliable electricity in your community, and helps to keep the lights on.
