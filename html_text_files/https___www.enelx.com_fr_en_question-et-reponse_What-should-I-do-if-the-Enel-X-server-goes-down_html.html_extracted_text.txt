FAQ
What should I do if the Enel X server goes down?
Our server receives upgrades from time to time and we may experience server outages when this happens. We will always do our very best to minimize downtime and apologize if you are adversely affected because of downtime.

You will still be able to charge your EV normally, but your Time of Use and amperage settings will be unavailable.
If you are using TOU and need to override, but controls are unavailable, please unplug your charging station to erase the temporary memory of the schedule. It will then charge until full, unplugged, or when the servers come back up. When servers return online you will then need to override to charge.
If you had previously set up a Load Group or a wire rating on the dashboard for your current wire ampacity, this setting will be remembered by the JuiceNet device regardless of power cycling the box.

We are always striving to improve our server-side capabilities to give you the smartest electric vehicle charging experience. Again, we sincerely apologize for any inconveniences caused by downtime.
