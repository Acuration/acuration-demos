Useful tips
We are here to set up the best electric mobility solution for your business.

Fast and safe, with all accessories and cables included.

You manage the charging stations for electric and hybrid cars in the fleet, from one place: the JuicePass application.

By connecting the station to a smart meter, the power limiting functionality allows charging at the maximum available power, without exceeding it.

Your advantages
Accessible
When you have a business, organizing means everything. With JuiceBox you can easily manage RFID cards for charging, charging sessions and reports, using the Enel X dashboard.
For business clients
We have created a dedicated environment which allows you to charge at the company's car charging stations, monitor power consumption and receive notifications.
