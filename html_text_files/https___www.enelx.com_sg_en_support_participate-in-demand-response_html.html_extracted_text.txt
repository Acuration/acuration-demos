How do I participate?
Enel X makes participation easy. We take care of the complex details so you can stay focused on running your business.
Our expert team will work with you to identify your energy reduction potential and create a strategy that delivers maximum value with minimum impact to your operations.
In some cases, we install necessary metering devices at your facility to establish communication with our Network Operations Center (NOC), so we can monitor your energy consumption levels in real-time.
Your site is then enrolled and ready to respond when a dispatch begins. Our team remains on standby to support you at all times.
Throughout the process, we fully manage enrolment, measurement, verification and payments on your behalf.
