Consultancy and Installation
The charging process
You will speak with an Enel X consultant prior to purchase to ensure that the electric vehicle and the space where you want to install the charging station are compatible with the JuiceBox version you have chosen.
Upon delivery of JuiceBox you will receive the installation and user manual, as well as the accessories for fixing the frame on the wall.
To start charging the electric or hybrid plug-in motor-vehicle, connect the car to JuiceBox. The charging of the electric car starts automatically and you control all the actions in the JuicePass mobile application.
The colors of the LED indicators on the JuiceBox tell you everything about the status of the charging station of the electric car: white = on, purple = off, green = charging completed, yellow = waiting.
Your advantages
Intuitive use
After a full day in the city, you return home and connect the electric car to the JuiceBox charging station, the innovative Enel X station! The station will power the electric or hybrid car, while you will relax with your family.
Innovative Design
The JuiceBox station has an elegant design and is made of recycled plastic, a proof of Enel X's commitment to the circular economy and innovation.
