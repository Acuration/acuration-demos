About the Monitor for Circular Fashion
The fashion industry is one of Italy’s most strategic economic sectors and among those with the most significant impact on the environment. Therefore it needs to become a key driver of the circular economy if we want a more sustainable future. To
contribute to creating a more sustainable economy
, SDA Bocconi and Enel X have teamed up to produce the Monitor on Circular Fashion, an overview that provides
clear visibility into the circular maturity level of the Italian fashion industry
.

What we do
The Monitor on Circular Fashion covers a representative
cross-section of the Italian fashion industry across the entire value chain
, reporting on best practices and gaps, and proposing models and methods for integrating
circular approaches into the business cycle
.

In its first year, 2021, Enel X created a
Circular Economy Report
that summarized the company's energy assessment, conducted one-on-one sessions, and created a
tailored roadmap
of solutions to improve the level of circularity.
The second year (2022) of activity builds on these foundations by working with 16 brands, retailers and service providers throughout the upstream and downstream supply chain, as well as a KPIs Committee made up of consultants who are experts in measuring circularity. The pilot projects focused on
supply chain partnerships
in which Monitor companies will mentor and support young designers and Italian landmark entities to share values through circularity. The pilot projects also tested the principles of the UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) sustainability claims.

For the third year, in 2023, the project was significantly upscaled and presented three projects consisting of an
open innovation approach
with 26 partners, including
TOD's Group,
Ferragamo
, and
Vivian Westwood
.
The benefits
Companies that take part in brainstorming sessions receive an SDA Bocconi research report as well as an
individual Enel X Circular Economy Report
, with both corporate and site-specific energy analyses. The Circular Economy Report is an important tool that pinpoints areas for
improvement
, provides a
roadmap
to circularity and decarbonization, and enhances corporate communication strategies.

Our long-term goal is not only to improve the circularity of the Italian fashion industry through this project but also to
start the same outside of Italy.
