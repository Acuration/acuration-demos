Distributed Energy
Clean energy assets, precisely orchestrated, to reduce carbon emissions—and cost.
Always On, Always Green
Clean Power for the People
A Streamlined Approach to a Greener Future
The Key to Decarbonization
The public sector is on the leading edge of national, state, and local decarbonization efforts. Distributed energy—from solar-plus-storage to demand response—is a critical part of the solution, and Enel X has the technology, expertise, and proven record to deliver it.
Always On, Always Green
Smart cities and institutions are looking to get greener faster while improving energy resiliency, reliability, and cost. Participating in programs such as demand response and installing batteries locally empower public entities to take greater control over their energy systems. Saving money along the way? Even better.
