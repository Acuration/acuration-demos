Why Enel X
Join the energy transition with battery storage
Battery storage is urgently needed for the renewable energy transition, and is expected to play a huge role in Japan's future power system. Businesses see battery storage as a complement to their renewable energy strategy, and a strong opportunity to improve their bottom line while accelerating their path to decarbonization. Enel X is a global leader in this space, and is a partner of choice for Japanese businesses.
Sustainability
This innovative technology helps businesses support renewables, lower their carbon footprint and reach sustainability goals.
Earn new revenue
When integrated with our market-leading VPP platform, a battery is capable of providing multiple valuable services to the power grid.
Reduce energy costs
A battery can optimise the profile of your power usage, serving to reduce demand and capacity charges you pay to the network utility.
Reduce risk
Batteries can support a business' renewable energy strategy, earn a new revenue stream and hedge exposure to energy markets.
Maximize performance with Optimization Software
Enel X’s Distributed Energy Resources Optimization Software (DER.OS) uses advanced machine learning and AI algorithms to learn your facility’s operational behaviour. DER.OS analyzes your facility's energy use alongside external data including weather forecasts, energy market pricing, tariff structures, and VPP trading opportunities. We automatically charge and discharge your battery at optimal times to deliver the highest financial return possible.
