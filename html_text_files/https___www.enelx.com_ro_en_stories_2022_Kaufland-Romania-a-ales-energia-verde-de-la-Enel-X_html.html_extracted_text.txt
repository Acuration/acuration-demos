Enel X Customer
Kaufland Romania is one of the largest investors in sustainability in our country. With a network of 152 stores and 2 warehouses nationwide, the company constantly invests in renewable energy, by equipping its network with photovoltaic panels. In 2021, for the fourth consecutive year, Kaufland Romania ranked first in the top of the most sustainable companies nationwide, a title awarded by the CST Index. The distinction is awarded on the basis of an independent analysis that evaluates Romanian companies according to a series of international parameters, depending on their level of involvement in the field of sustainability and social responsibility.
Challenge
Kaufland Romania is committed to taking action and implementing projects that contribute to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Global Compact), which address the most pressing issues on the planet, from eradicating poverty, improving health and education, increasing urban sustainability and upholding the UN-recommended principles of governance in the field of human rights, anti-corruption, environmental protection and sustainable working practices.
At the same time, the company has assumed new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, following the Schwarz Group's accession to the Science Based Targets Initiative, targets that are in line with the level of decarbonization needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 ° C.
In order
to increase its degree of sustainability
,
energy efficiency
and to achieve the objectives assumed by the Schwarz Group, Kaufland Romania has chosen the partner Enel X for part of the investments in innovative green technologies.
This first project of the company in Romania meant the
implementation of a solution for local electricity production using over
2,000
photovoltaic panels, and will expand the existing capacity in the near future. The system generates green energy and helps reduce the negative impact on the environment, eliminating over 270 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.
The substantial savings
achieved since the first year of use of the photovoltaic plant, but not only, helped the company make the decision to continue this type of projects, and the
predictability
obtained ensures stability in the current increasingly dynamic business environment.

Solution
The project involved the installation of a photovoltaic system for the Kaufland Logistics Center in Turda, by installing the following Enel X solutions on the ground:

over
2,000 photovoltaic panels
with half-cell monocrystalline cells on an area of over 9,400 square meters, on the ground in the immediate vicinity of the logistics center
8 SMA string inverters
generating 110 kW power
prefabricated
metal

structures
, specially designed for photovoltaic installations located on the ground
monitoring system
, sized for optimum energy management, monitoring and stability.

Benefits
Reduction of annual consumption
Enel X solutions help the company cover over
19.3% of the total annual electricity consumption
of the warehouse and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
272 tons/year.
The photovoltaic panel system has an installed capacity of
1 MWp
, which can generate a total quantity of electricity of approximately
1,277 MWh
per year.

Reducing energy costs
Annual electricity savings
estimated at over
167,000 euros in the first year of operation
.

Process monitoring
By constantly monitoring on-site and off-site processes, Enel X tools contribute to maximizing the energy generated, increasing the operational reliability of the photovoltaic system, minimizing downtime in case of failure and extending the life of the photovoltaic system.

"Through this approach, we want to expand sustainability actions and the fight to protect the environment. The project helps reduce the impact on the environment by lowering the carbon footprint. Green energy, which comes from renewable sources, is a sustainable alternative and helps maintain a clean environment, therefore, the company's goal will be to invest in the future in such solutions with our partners."

Valer Hancaș
, Communication and Corporate Affairs Director, Kaufland Romania
"For us, this project was a new opportunity to strengthen our position as one of the most important integrators of energy systems, which increase the competitiveness and sustainability of our customers. The process of installing the photovoltaic system for the Kaufland logistics center was an efficient one, being completed within the agreed deadline. The decision to use Canadian Solar panels was made based on the strong history we have with this manufacturer as well as the excellent price/performance ratio, which is the key to obtaining the best returns on invested capital.”
