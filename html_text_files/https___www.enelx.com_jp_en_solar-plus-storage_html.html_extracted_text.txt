What is Solar-Plus-Storage?
Solar-plus-storage is the integration of a battery energy storage system with a solar photovoltaic (PV) system. Businesses can see far greater benefits with solar-plus-storage than with solar or storage alone. Solar-plus-storage will reduce energy costs, improve renewable energy use, and will provide greater resilience in case of a power outage.
Increase the value of your solar system
Pairing a battery with a new or existing solar system significantly increases the value of the system as a whole. While solar offers inexpensive energy from a renewable source, without a battery, its usefulness can be limited at night or during cloudy days.
A battery can optimize when solar or grid energy is used, and allows excess solar power to be stored for future use when peak demand charges are high, or when the grid is down. Solar-plus-storage offers both economic and environmental benefits for your business.
Save money with Solar-Plus-Storage
Businesses that have on-site solar PV technology enjoy decreased overall energy costs, relative to what they were paying their utility. The addition of battery storage to a solar system opens up new opportunities to create a far greater margin of savings.
By pairing solar with storage, businesses can store excess solar energy to be consumed later during periods of peak demand. Utilities charge a premium for energy consumption during peak demand times, and these charges can make up the majority of the electricity bill for some businesses. A battery helps to limit grid consumption during peak demand periods, flattening a facility’s load curve.

Enel X DER.OS software transforms solar projects into intelligent, strategic solar-plus-storage assets. DER.OS combines machine learning with advanced prediction capabilities, to give the intelligence and precision-dispatching needed to participate in

and other revenue-generating programs that maximize value via our market-leading VPP.

Maximize your renewable energy consumption
Businesses can maximize energy consumption from renewables with solar-plus-storage, which helps to decarbonize operations.

For organisations with set greenhouse gas emission targets or clean energy initiatives, a solar-plus-storage system will help meet your goals.
Stored solar energy is a resilient, sustainable option during power outages.
Boost resiliency without sacrificing sustainability
Solar-plus-storage helps to prevent power loss if the grid goes down. Japan experiences challenging electricity market conditions due to frequent extreme weather events and natural disasters such as earthquakes, which can lead to power outages.”

Solar-plus-storage is one of the strongest resiliency solutions in the market. Together, it can provide backup power ranging from several hours to several days. Often solar-plus-storage can provide enough energy for operation while still allowing organisations to achieve their sustainability goals.
