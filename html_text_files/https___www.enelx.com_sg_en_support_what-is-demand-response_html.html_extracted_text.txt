What is Demand Response?
Demand Response programs provide an opportunity for commercial, institutional, and industrial organizations to earn payments for supporting the grid to maintain reliable electricity. When wholesale electricity prices are high or a contingency event occurs due to generator outage, the Energy Market Company (EMC) or Power System Operator (PSO) may dispatch Enel X’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP). Our VPP is made up of local organizations that have agreed to reduce energy usage during times of high prices or contingency events. Program participants earn payments for agreeing to be on standby and for curtailing electricity consumption in response to market or grid needs.
