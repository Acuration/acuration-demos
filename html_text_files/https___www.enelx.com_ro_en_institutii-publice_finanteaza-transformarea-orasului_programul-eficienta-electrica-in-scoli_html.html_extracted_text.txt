What is the financing program Energy efficiency for public buildings?
Public buildings managed by administrative-territorial units throughout the country have new opportunities for energy transformation in Romania in recent years. The Environmental Fund Administration program, initially dedicated only to schools, has become more ambitious and leading the way for a substantial effect in reducing pollution and raising awareness of new ways to produce and manage energy. Our synergistic solutions, based on progressive technologies, will be customized for your project by our consultants who will be with you at all stages, from project to implementation.
Municipalities
Enel X is the strategic partner of municipalities that want to switch to renewable energy and smartly manage consumption.
Towns

Eligible expenses
What concrete investments you may finance
Eligible beneficiaries and amounts
The program to increase energy efficiency and smart energy management in public buildings was originally addressed only to schools, but
expanded to include other public sector beneficiaries
: clinics, town hall building etc.
In 2021, the
program budget
was greatly increased and now reaches Lei 1.4 billion.
The
registration period
in the IT platform will is
from 20 September 2021 to 19 April 2022
.
Contact the Enel X team as soon as possible, so that we can prepare together, in advance, the best project for your energy transformation objectives.
The AFM program, which allows local governments to finance the transformation of public buildings to increase energy efficiency and move towards smart energy management, covers several expenses for the change process.
Among the eligible costs, in addition to the costs for the actual investment included in the project, we mention:
costs with the feasibility
studies
,
design and technical assistance
,
consultancy
expenses,
those for conducting an
energy audit before the transformation
,
for preparing a
subsequent implementation report and
for obtaining an important document: the
energy performance certificate
.
Regarding the seismic risk assessment, so useful before an energy modernization project, the program of the Administration of the Environmental Fund also covers the costs with the
technical expert valuation of the building
.
Enel X supports you with all-in-one solutions based on the most efficient technologies, in all stages of the project. The basic investment to achieve the goal of increasing energy efficiency may include measures such as interventions for:
the thermal retrofitting of the building - the building envelope
the water heating system
the air conditioning/ventilation system, which ensures the quality of the air inside
the interior lighting system
installation of equipment to produce electricity/heating from renewable sources for own consumption
an integrated energy management system
For energy efficiency increase projects, public sector applicants
can finance up to 100% of the project value through this dedicated AFM program
, limited to the amounts set for each application category.
In 2021, the program includes not only educational institutions amongst the beneficiaries, but also:
County councils

Any public building managed by the administrative-territorial unit that applies to the program, for example the buildings where the town halls and clinics are located.
For one financing session, the maximum amount that can be awarded to an applicant, through one or more financing applications, is:
For
communes
