In Korea, we manage over 500MW of flexible load for our customers across over 500 business sites. Each local dispatch is managed by our global NOC.

With our Virtual Power Plant (VPP) and Demand Response (DR) services, our commercial and industrial customers have the ability to participate in the energy market, monetize their energy assets and flexible load, while contributing to global decarbonization.

Our NOC was established in Dublin as the DR command hub. To guarantee uninterrupted operations, the team continuously tests and enhances our procedures’ effectiveness, with backup plans to ensure that no failure can affect the stability and safety of our operations. The NOC operates 24-7, 365 days a year.
