General Motors Saves Over $49 Million With Enel X
DOWNLOAD PDF

The Challenge
As one of the world’s largest and oldest automotive manufacturers, energy represents a significant portion of General Motors’ overall operating costs. The Company, which manufactures cars in more than 35 countries, realized that in order to get a handle on basic energy costs, it needed a robust software platform to centralize and analyze utility bill data.

The Customer
General Motors, commonly known as GM, is a multi-national corporation that designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes vehicles and vehicle parts, and sells financial services. For 77 consecutive years, from 1931 to 2007, the Company led the global vehicle sales market, and today, General Motors remains one of the world’s largest automakers.

The Solution
In 1997, GM enlisted the support of EnTech USB, the leader in global utility bill management (UBM), which was acquired by Enel X in early 2014. Today, more than 1700 of GM’s electricity, natural gas, and other energy bills from 29 countries around the globe are entered into Enel X’s utility bill management platform each month.

Benefits
More than $49 Million in Savings
Enel X’s utility bill management software and services have saved GM more than $49 million since its initial deployment. Bill errors are identified by more than 20 bill audits performed on each bill. When an error is found, the Enel X Professional Services team works directly with the relevant utility to get the issue resolved.

Single System to Meet Global Needs
Utilities vary widely region by region. The Enel X solution currently supports more utility tariffs than any other utility bill management platform on the market. Regardless of location, users can access their utility bill data through a secure login from any internet connection.

Central Repository for Sustainability Tracking
GM strives to be a responsible corporate citizen in each of the markets in which it operates. As part of that effort, the Company participates in a number of corporate sustainability disclosure programs, such as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Enel X’s software centralizes all of the key data inputs to streamline compliance with the disclosure requirements.

Customized Reporting
Enel X’s UBM solution includes a robust library of standard reports, but for a company like GM, the team created an expansive library of custom reports. With the software, the team can track energy consumption on the sub-site Business Unit, Department, or Area (BUDA) level, or look at a customized Global Energy Scorecard.

Better Budgeting and Forecasting
In a competitive market like automotive manufacturing, the ability to accurately forecast expenses is critically important. Enel X’s software gives GM’s financial decision makers the insight they need to create robust forecasts and track progress against budgets.

Streamlined Payment Processes
Enel X’s software integrates with GM’s Accounts Payable (AP)systems, with two-tier client approval required prior to AP feed generation, ensuring the process is both seamless and secure. In addition, Enel X’s super-user bill approval functionality gives users all outstanding bills awaiting approval.

Robust Exporting Capabilities
While most analysis required to drive savings and improve systems and processes occurs directly in the platform, a customized data export feature gives GM the ability to export data for multi-site, multi-parameter reporting that individual teams or departments might require.
