Why Enel X
Driving cleaner and more efficient cities
Enel X is accelerating the transition to electric mobility, which has a key role to play in making Seoul and our cities more sustainable. The city of Seoul has banned the registration of new combustion engine buses from 2024. This reform has placed Korea on a clear path to the electrification of the majority of its 30,000+ city buses. With our experience and significant investment in electric mobility, we are preparing green transport solutions to public transport operators, with electric bus (e-Bus) services in Korea.
