New York Demand Response
New York businesses reduce energy spend and earn money with Enel X
Enel X helps hundreds of organizations throughout New York earn money, save on energy costs, and mitigate carbon emissions with demand response (DR). How does it work? When the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), the region’s electric grid operator, determines that it needs more supply to meet demand, it dispatches Enel X’s demand response network, which is made up of local organizations that have agreed to reduce energy during times of high demand. With Enel X, participating in demand response has never been easier.

Notification:
When your local utility or grid operator anticipates the need for support, it dispatches the Enel X network into action. Enel X will notify you via email, phone, or SMS informing you when the dispatch will begin.

Response:
At the start of the dispatch, your facility will reduce its electricity usage according to your pre- determined Energy Reduction Plan—either manually, or automatically through the NOC.

Support:
Before, during, and after a dispatch, the NOC remains in communication with your facility. Our staff is available 24x7x365, supporting you to ensure that you achieve the highest possible levels of performance and payments.
