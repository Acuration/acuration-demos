What is Energy Storage, and Why Are Businesses Embracing It?
Facing rising electricity costs and access to incentives through energy market programs, today’s businesses are
integrating energy storage
to manage their exposure to the grid strategically. Lithium-ion batteries and other forms of energy storage are capable of storing large amounts of electricity for consumption on demand. Facilities with on-site energy storage resources equipped with
DER Optimization Software
can automatically store electricity when it is least expensive and consume it when costs from the grid are most expensive.
Energy Storage 101
Learn more about how businesses reduce costs, improve resilience, and earn incentive payments with energy storage and distributed energy resources.
Minimize Electricity Costs and Maximize DR Earnings with Energy Storage
The ability to store and consume low-cost electricity on-demand helps C&I energy consumers by radically reducing
time-based costs. Time-based costs account for as much as 85% of total energy electricity spend in some markets! Plus you can earn payments through
demand response
and other energy market programs.
The Value of Energy Storage
Lower Utility Bills
Market Access & Revenues
Flexibility
Demand Charge Management
Reduce your facility’s peak electricity grid demand levels with commercial energy storage and enjoy lower charges based on less need during peak demand times.

Energy Arbitrage
Store low-cost power with your energy storage system so you can avoid using energy from the electricity grid during periods of high-cost energy.
Demand Response
Earn demand response payments for reducing grid demand when called upon without shutting down equipment in your facility. Enel X offers access to more demand response programs worldwide than any other provider.

Other Market Programs and Incentives
Capitalize on other regional programs offering compensation for distributed energy storage and solar-plus-storage projects.

Pairing with Solar
Integrating energy storage can make new or existing solar energy projects more valuable, providing the ability to use that clean, low-cost power at times when it is most valuable.

Improved Grid Stability
Improving your facility’s flexibility with energy storage helps to keep energy costs in control in your community and make the electric grid more reliable and sustainable.

Backup Power
Under certain configurations, energy storage can be incorporated into a resilience plan to provide backup power in the event of a grid outage.

Intelligent DER Optimization Software to Maximize Financial Performance
Enel X’s DER Optimization Software uses advanced machine learning techniques to learn your facility’s energy needs. We automatically charge and discharge your battery assets at the optimal times to deliver the highest financial return possible. Your sites will experience no difference in energy consumption, but your electricity costs will decrease as if they did!
Find out more about how Enel X's industry-leading software DER.OS automates battery operations to maximize savings.
Fully Financed, Turnkey Energy Storage Projects
With decades of experience helping C&I energy consumers capitalize on opportunities in the energy markets, Enel X covers all required costs. We also take responsibility for installing and operating the assets so your organization can capture this value without committing to a capital investment.
