Customer information
This Leggett & Platt case study is based on a project developed in Enel X North America.

Leggett & Platt
Leggett & Platt is an American diversified manufacturer that designs and produces various engineered components and products that can be found in homes and automobiles. The firm was founded in 1883 and consists of 15 business units, 20,000 employees, and 135 manufacturing facilities located in 18 countries.
The need
Leggett & Platt was founded in 1883 and consists of 15 business units, 20,000 employees, and 135 manufacturing facilities located in 18 countries. It is a Fortune 500 company with over $5.1 billion in sales in 2022.

Leggett & Platt first explored demand response (DR) as part of its energy conservation efforts.
DR programs vary in details like response time and dispatch length
, so Leggett & Platt needed a partner with experience in a variety of programs.
The solution
Leggett & Platt chose Enel X as a DR partner because of its nationwide experience, DR expertise, and responsive on-site support.

First, Enel X helped Leggett & Platt find
the best approach for each of its diverse facilities, according to their needs and the benefits of the program.

“Enel X was well-versed on all of the nuances in various markets,
” said Steve Elsea, director of energy services at Leggett & Platt.

Then, Enel X worked with Leggett & Platt to conduct a
cost-benefit analysis of implementing DR at various facilities
. Two facilities in Texas decided they would temporarily shut down elements of their production lines.  its large Sterling, Illinois, facility temporarily stops production in a rod mill, delivering
more than 11 MW of energy reduction
—one of the largest DR reductions in the region.
“When we needed detailed information to make decisions, we knew we could get it from Enel X,”
said Elsea.
The benefits
Significant revenue
In all, Leggett & Platt delivers more than
12 MW through its participation in DR and receives payments of approximately
$400,000 annually
from Enel X.
Simple participation
According to Leggett & Platt, participating in DR with Enel X was a simple process—from enrollment to implementation to testing.
“The paperwork, planning, and
all other elements of the process were seamless for us,
”
said Elsea.
In the end, Elsea complimented
“When you’re doing demand response, you don’t want to make mistakes that affect your company adversely. Enel X has deep DR expertise that ensures reliable performance during dispatches.”
Note: This Leggett & Plat case study is based on a project developed in Enel X North America. In Japan, Enel X supports global and local customers to help them to save on energy costs, earn a new revenue stream and achieve carbon neutral targets with customized products and services.
