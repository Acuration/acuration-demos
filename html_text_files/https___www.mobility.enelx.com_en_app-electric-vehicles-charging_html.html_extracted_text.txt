The strength of our offering lies in the ecosystem of products that communicate with each other, providing customers with a 360-degree monitoring experience.

Through the Enel X Way application, both individuals and companies can monitor and manage public, private, and home charging, check the status of charging points, and easily find the nearest Enel X Way station with a convenient map. With over 330.000 charging points available worldwide and accessible through our
