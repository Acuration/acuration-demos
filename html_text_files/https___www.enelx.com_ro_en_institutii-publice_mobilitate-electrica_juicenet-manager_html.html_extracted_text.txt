What is JuiceNet Manager?
How it works
Your advantages
What is JuiceNet Manager?
JuiceNet Manager is our digital system that allows institutions to manage in an integrated way the entire fleet of electric vehicles, through an accessible portal on the Enel X website.
Stations control
You monitor the current and completed charging sessions and have access to the station data, individually or per group of stations.
Access for drivers
You allow users to access charging stations via JuicePass app. For carpooling and rental services, you can offer customers RFID cards.
Reports
The portal offers full visibility of all the reports as well as the possibility to download data about charging stations and users.
Consumption optimization
You optimize charging based on available power, and limit power for a specific group of charging stations.

How it works
Main page

Drivers
Cards
Charging points
Map localization
Here you see all the essential information and data about your charging points (public and private) as well as their activity.

You monitor ongoing or completed sessions by all users. Data can be filtered by date, session type, jack type, or user type.

JuiceNet Manager allows drivers to use the Corporate Profile on JuicePass. You can filter by locations, cost centers, first and last name, and you can also manage roles and permissions.

You manage the activation status of the cards, the key features for managing the carpool and the level of use in case of car rental. You edit their details.

You see how much energy has been consumed at private and internal charging points. You have access to details about the sessions performed at a certain point. You filter by type of sockets, current availability, use of charging points, cities and locations. You can enable and disable dashboard sessions.

On the Locations page, you see the list of registered locations and charging points installed at a specific address.

Your advantages
You control the consumption
JuiceNet Manager monitors public and private stations. The status of the charging points is constantly updated and they can be remotely activated.
Smart management
With JuiceNet Manager PRO you limit the power available to a group of EVs (Demand Limitation PRO) and prioritize charging according to customer needs (Charging Prioritization).
