A PV plant to decarbonize the local electricity grid with EEW Korea
Enel X’s rooftop solar PV plant at Sacheon to help contribute to generating clean energy
Location
Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province
Client
EEW Korea
Sector
Manufacturing
On August 16, 2022, Enel X Korea signed a
rooftop solar power generation agreement with EEW Korea
and started commercial operation in November last year. The rooftop solar power plant located at EEW Korea is the second rooftop solar power plant owned by Enel X in Sacheon region.  Enel X Korea is responsible for installing, managing, and operating the rooftop solar power plant on the roof space provided by EEW Korea.

The client
EEW is a global leader in the offshore wind equipment (Pipe) manufacturing sector. It has production bases in Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province, and Gwangyang, South Jeolla Province domestically. With an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons, EEW holds ISO 9001 certification, as well as API 2B and API 5L certifications, recognizing its excellence in production capacity, quality, and business management in the global market. Additionally, EEW holds ISO 14001 certification, demonstrating its commitment to environmental management and eco-friendly operations.

The solution
The benefits
EEW Korea aimed to enhance its eco-friendly image and contribute to Net Zero through renewable energy generation. EEW Korea wanted to install solar facilities in their idle, unused roof space within its facility. Through the solar facilities, EEW Korea wanted to supply eco-friendly energy to the power grid, preventing an increase in atmospheric CO
2
emissions.
To fulfill EEW Korea's needs, Enel X Korea has undertaken the installation of solar facilities on the roof of EEW Korea's factory in Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province. Utilizing a total roof area of 22,711m
2
, 2,672 modules have been installed, producing up to 1,523.04 kWh of renewable energy per hour. The generated energy is sold to the power grid, and the revenue from energy generation is shared between EEW Korea and Enel X Korea.

Operating the power plant under a 20-year contract, a yearly production of 2,151 MWh of renewable energy is achieved. This leads to an annual reduction of 947.17 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to planting 8,500 pine trees each year.

This project marks a significant step towards decarbonization, which is one of Enel X’s global and local objectives. The project will promote the use of renewable energy while generating new revenue for EEW Korea to offset rising electricity costs, or to reinvest in other sustainability initiatives.
