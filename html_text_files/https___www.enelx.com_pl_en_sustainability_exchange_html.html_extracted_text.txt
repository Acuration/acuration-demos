Global know-how
For over 20 years, Enel X have worked with more than 100 utilities worldwide and more than 300 suppliers on our Energy Exchange platform, conducting 60,000 pricing events and transacting more than 200 TWh.

Due to our pre-auction work where products and terms are structured to align client needs to market capabilities, we guarantee successful auctions with 100% utility approvals registered thus far. This is important to drive maximum value, as bidders are assured that the process will result in a contract.
Total visibility
The complex algorithms used by Energy Exchange identify favourable purchasing opportunities to help our customers to choose the best energy supplier at the most advantageous market rates, and to monitor daily price averages and variations as well as trends over different lengths of time.

Energy Exchange’s cutting-edge dashboard displays data about the market, price fluctuations, news and opportunities to renew contracts. The platform includes a list of all energy supply contracts with their relative start and end dates, amounts and balance sheet entries.
Hands-on analysis
Our team of experts provides forecast analyses and budgeting and benchmarking reports to help customers constantly monitor the energy market so they can keep an eye on price variations and anticipate risks and opportunities.

Pay later
Customers do not pay Enel X to transact on Energy Exchange, the supplier does – meaning there is no fee until customers choose to award. More importantly, there is no obligation to award a contract. Clients do not pay anything if they do not like the results.

Key benefits
Simplification
Enel X takes care of the entire energy purchasing process, optimizing energy procurement costs, finding you the best price and negotiating to secure the best contract conditions.
