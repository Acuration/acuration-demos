Gogoro and Enel X Taiwan partnership
Gogoro and Enel X Gogoro accelerate Taiwan’s energy transition with integration of Virtual Power Plant and 2,500 battery swapping stations
Background of Gogoro and Enel X Taiwan partnership
Gogoro Inc.
(Nasdaq: GGR) is a global technology leader in battery-swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities. It offers battery swapping stations throughout Taiwan, that allows PBGN (Powered by Gogoro Network) electric scooter riders to easily swap out dead or dying batteries for fully charged one within seconds.

Gogoro and Enel X Taiwan's partnership started in 2021. In October 2021, collaboration with Gogoro was announced and Gogoro became the first electric mobility provider in Taiwan to participate in a Virtual Power Plant (VPP).
In 2022, Gogoro and Enel X Taiwan’s VPP pilot demonstrated that the Gogoro Network could safely pause charging if there was a grid imbalance or provide energy back to the grid as demand required. The Gogoro Network performed these services without causing any interruptions to Gogoro Network battery-swapping customers, demonstrating that the network is an ideal resource to support Taiwan’s energy transition. Now, in 2023, Gogoro is enrolling up to 2,500+ battery swapping stations across 1,000+ locations into Enel X Taiwan's VPP.

How does Gogoro and Enel X Taiwan partnership work?
In face of the increasing proportion of renewable energy and electric vehicles, Virtual Power Plants(VPP) are an excellent solution to cope with the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy and the sudden increase in electricity demand. Gogoro’s battery swapping stations (GoStation) serve as one of the energy resources in our VPP.

The Gogoro Network when integrated with the Enel X VPP could safely pause charging if there was a grid imbalance, or provide energy back to the grid when needed. This has the same effect as bringing new energy generation online to meet demand. Once the grid needs passes, Enel X’s VPP sends a signal to the Gogoro Network to safely restore to normal grid consumption.
Benefits in joining Virtual Power Plant with Enel X
With Gogoro joining Enel X Taiwan’s Virtual Power Plant, we can aggregate Gogoro’s energy assets, in this case, the battery swapping stations, into our VPP and offer them as an energy resource to Taiwan Power Company’s Ancillary Service market. This creates a new revenue stream for Gogoro while supporting the energy transition in Taiwan.

Aggregating 1,000+ sites is not easy. Enel X has a network operations center that operates 24/7 that can manage all these facilities without any problems. All demand response programs are implemented, managed, and monitored in real-time.

READ FAQ
What does it mean for the Gogoro riders?
Gogoro’s participation in Enel X Taiwan’s VPP has no impact on the riders. The only impact is that now riders have an even better reason to choose electric scooters because the battery-swapping stations support the energy transition and a cleaner environment for us and the next generation. It means a better reason to adopt electric scooters!

Comments from parties involved
“We are entering a new era of smart energy infrastructure, and by integrating the Gogoro Network with the Enel X Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in Taiwan we are providing a new energy resource. It is the first time this technology has been deployed this way in the world, and it creates a new Gogoro revenue stream beyond mobility”
said
Horace Luke, founder, and CEO of Gogoro
.
“We have always believed that time-shifting energy was key to enabling the sustainable transformation of energy and transportation, and Gogoro continues to be a key part of these advancements. Together, the Gogoro community is contributing to Taiwan’s net-zero targets by helping to integrate more variable power generation resources onto the grid. Today, when the energy grid begins to max out, we can dynamically pause our energy usage or provide energy back to the grid while continuing to operate our battery swapping service independently as needed.”


“The commercial expansion of the Gogoro and Enel X pilot program to more than 1,000 battery swapping locations highlights a significant step in our ancillary service to increase energy use efficiency. It is also an essential element in the development of large uptakes of renewable energy in the global electricity industry and a positive demonstration of how businesses like Gogoro can proactively participate in Taiwan’s energy market at scale,”
said
the president of Taiwan Power Company (TPC), Yao-Ting Wang.
We believe our work with Gogoro is a world-leading demonstration of what VPPs can do, and we are honored and excited to continue growing our collaboration with them.
