FAQ
What is smart public lighting?
Today, most of the
public lighting infrastructure
is still reliant on outdated technology based on traditional light sources. These street lights run on higher energy consumption levels compared to what is achievable with smart lighting systems. City governments can save energy and money by
replacing the current public lighting infrastructure
with
innovative LED lamp posts
and cutting-edge solutions that guarantee
substantial energy and economic savings
, as well as
improved security
,
life quality
and
opportunities to its dwellers
.

These
new smart lighting systems
are managed remotely by software that offers municipalities a chance to provide a better lighting service. In this way, energy consumption can be permanently tracked, faults can be detected quickly and additional services can be enabled, like
adaptive illumination
, video surveillance and environmental monitoring through a Control Room, a simple and intuitive interface that improves the management of the lighting infrastructure. We invite you to discover here the
Enel X solutions for smart public lighting
.
