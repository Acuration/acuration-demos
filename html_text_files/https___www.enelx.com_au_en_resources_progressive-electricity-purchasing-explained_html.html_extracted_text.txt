Progressive electricity purchasing
Progressive electricity purchasing is a method of buying electricity which focusses on the wholesale market price.
This allows energy users to better optimise their energy buying, by locking in energy at stages throughout the contract.

Progressive procurement of electricity or ‘progressive purchasing’ is a method of buying electricity which focusses on the wholesale market price.

This method allows energy users to better optimise their energy buying, by locking in energy at stages throughout their contract.

We help businesses across Australia and New Zealand purchase progressively, using sophisticated risk management techniques and a large amount of wholesale market information. An example of this sort of information is often represented on futures curves.

In a volatile market, this method can help organisations lower long-term costs by reacting quickly to market changes.
