FAQ
What is Demand Response?
Demand Response
programs are management measures used by power companies to guide electricity users to adjust their electricity consumption habits. It is done by reducing peak demand or shifting it to off-peak periods by providing incentives such as price or tariff reductions. This is a common practice in the electricity industry worldwide to suppress peak demand,
similar to buying insurance for power supply and unrelated to power rationing
.

When the electricity demand on the consumer side is too high or there is an excess of supply on the supplier side, it will lead to an imbalance between supply and demand, affecting the stability of the power system. Generally speaking, what often happens is that the electricity demand from the consumers’ side exceeds the supply, leading to blackouts. At this point, if energy users can temporarily reduce their energy consumption, the power grid will be able to get back into a balance between supply and demand and maintain power stability.

In response to net-zero carbon emissions and energy transition, properly implementing Demand Response can avoid the high cost of building additional power plants
, making it an increasingly important resource in the power system.

Taiwan Power Company pointed out that “Peak load hours account for only about 2% of the total 8,760 hours per year. Instead of continuously building peak-load units for these 200 hours, Demand Response can be promoted as a more economical and environmentally friendly measure for managing this demand shift.”

According to a report by the
International Energy Agency
, “the milestone for net-zero scenarios has 500GW of demand response brought onto the market by 2030, corresponding to a tenfold increase in deployment levels in 2020”. Therefore, we need more flexible power resources for demand response.

Demand Response provides a brand new opportunity for commercial, institutional, and industrial organizations in face of the energy transition. Businesses can earn a brand new revenue stream by using flexible energy resources to support the grid and maintain reliable electricity.
Effectively utilizing existing assets while improving energy efficiency is a practical action toward sustainability and adopting a
circular economy
business model.
What is the relationship between Demand Response and Virtual Power Plants?
Demand response contributes to part of a Virtual Power Plant(VPP). A VPP aggregates various distributed energy resources, including battery storage systems, generators, and energy flexibility used by businesses to participate in Demand Response programs. When these resources are aggregated, they can support the grid and provide dispatchable power capacity.

What are the benefits of participating in Demand Response Ancillary Service Programs?
New revenue stream
: Unlock brand new revenue stream with existing assets. Enel X manages your participation from start to finish, ensuring you earn the highest possible financial reward.
Improve your facilities’ resilience
: In addition to the payments, demand response participants also receive advanced notification of grid stability issues, enabling them to proactively protect their facilities from potential power outages.

What types of energy reductions can I make to participate in Demand Response?
Enel X has extensive experience creating energy reduction strategies that work within the operational limitations of a wide variety of facilities, including cold storage, manufacturing, food processing, data centers and technology companies, universities, shopping centres, office buildings and more. Common reduction examples include:
Switch from electricity grid usage to onsite generation (BESS or backup generator)
Modify manufacturing processes
Adjust HVAC equipment
Turn down pumps
Change settings in industrial freezers
Reduce non-essential lighting
Customers often facilitate dispatch participation by simply shifting many of their energy-intensive processes by a few hours.
What can I expect during a dispatch event when participating in Demand Response programs?
Notification
: When Taipower anticipates high demand on the grid, it dispatches the Enel X network into action. Enel X will notify you via email, phone or SMS, depending on your preferences, to inform you when the dispatch will begin.
Response
: At the start of the dispatch, your facility will reduce its electricity usage according to your predetermined plan - either manually or automatically through our Network Operations Center (NOC).
Support
: Before, during, and after a dispatch, our NOC remains in communication with your facility. Our staff is available 24x7x365, supporting you to ensure that you achieve the highest possible levels of performance and payments.
