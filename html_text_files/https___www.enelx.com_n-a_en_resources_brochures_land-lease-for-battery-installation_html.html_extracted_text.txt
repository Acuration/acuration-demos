Land Lease for Battery Installation
Create a Simple, No-Effort Revenue Stream by Leasing Unused Square Footage in Brooklyn and Queens
DOWNLOAD PDF

New York City creates unique challenges for its electric utility Con Edison. During periods of high demand, Con Ed struggles to balance the grid to meet customer needs. To alleviate grid pressure, Con Ed encourages the installation of batteries on private property. These batteries charge during times of low demand, and export power to the grid during times of high demand.

Enel X leases small pieces of open outdoor square footage on commercial properties for these batteries and runs them completely independent of any business operations on site. Enel X does all the work of installing and maintaining the battery—the host site has no responsibility for the operation of the system.
Key Benefits
Fixed, recurring payments create a reliable, sustainable revenue stream
Greater value if host has large electric bill and can benefit from Con Ed bill credits. Enel X can explore this with potential clients
Enel X assumes operational and performance risk associated with the energy storage system
No technical expertise required
Site Requirements
3,000 – 7,500 sq. ft. of outdoor space with at least 10 feet clearance in all directions
Located in key NYC Con Ed zones (see map)
