Improving Quality of Life in Cities
Smart cities move with electric transportation. As urban areas shift to a more sustainable approach, Enel X can leverage its trailblazing experience and substantial investment in private e-mobility to offer zero-emissions transportation solutions for local governments. Transitioning to e-powered public transportation improves air quality, reduces emissions and noise pollution, cuts costs, and provides the public with a more comfortable and more extensive service.
Not Just Electric Buses
Converting public vehicle fleets is just the beginning. E-powered public transportation solutions include upgrading bus stops and shelters, which will become smart and multifunctional. Sustainable, integrated, efficient and technological solutions also transform passengers’ public transport experience, even making wait times useful.
Enel X's Electric Buses
Enel X helps improve efficiency in our cities, making them smarter and more comfortable. Electrification of urban transport accelerates the development of sustainable mobility and helps governments save money and optimize operations.
Our Solutions
End-to-End Offering
The electrification of public transportation does not just mean substituting obsolete carbon-fueled buses with electric ones. It also encompasses a wide spectrum of capabilities and know-how—from electric services management to urban mobility planning, from charging station construction to fleet operation and maintenance. The Enel X offer extends across the entire project cycle, providing end-to-end turnkey solutions to deliver electrified public transportation systems.
Vehicles
Enel X helps its clients choose the most suitable vehicle fleets as well as the best way to finance them. Through in-depth feasibility and cost/benefit analyses and thanks to an extensive network of partners, Enel X can propose several different financing options for the supply of vehicles, batteries and maintenance services.
Charging Infrastructure
Enel X is the ideal partner to design, install, maintain and manage electro-terminals for e-bus charging thanks to in-depth preliminary studies on topography, user habits, local traffic and weather—the first step in designing the most efficient infrastructure and to calibrate the smart charging software. Enel X can also supply 100% renewable energy for a sustainable end-to-end service.
Smart Mobility Services
Digital ticketing systems, Big Data analyses on passenger flows, smart bus shelters with multiple assets delivering multiple functions are just some of the many services that Enel X can integrate into an e-bus project. Bus shelters, for example, can become multifunctional smart hubs with security cameras, digital screens for targeted communication, and integrated e-bike and scooter charging stations.
Fleet Electrification Management
With Fleet Electrification Management by Enel X, public administrations can electrify their fleets through a turnkey solution complete with consulting, charging infrastructure supply and management services. The goal is to identify the methods, timetables and benefits of fleet electrification by analyzing the actual conditions of use of the vehicles concerned.
