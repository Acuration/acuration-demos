The Vineyard Transit Authority’s Sustainable Advantage
Enel X and the Martha’s Vineyard Transit Authority (VTA) have partnered together on a project that embraces circularity and renewable energy as the keys to the future. The project includes a microgrid composed of 8 solar carports that will power half of the island’s fleet or 16 electric buses, and a 1.5 MWh battery storage system for always-on dependability. VTA will be enrolled in demand response, and will generate an estimated $1 million in revenue over 20 years by using the battery to sell energy back to the grid. Together, Enel X and VTA will provide clean transportation for the islanders and power the transition to a sustainable future.
