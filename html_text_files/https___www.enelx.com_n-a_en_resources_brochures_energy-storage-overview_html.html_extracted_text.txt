Enel X’s energy storage solution combines reliable battery hardware with sophisti­cated optimization software to lower your energy bill. Through automated controls that seamlessly discharge electricity when prices are high, energy storage can offer substantial energy savings without disrupting business operations.

How Energy Storage Lowers Energy Costs
1. Demand Charge Management
Demand charges, which make up a significant portion of your utility bill, are based on your peak usage levels during certain intervals. A battery can lower your consumption from the grid during these periods to reduce demand charges.

2. Time-of-use (TOU) Energy Management
Energy prices fluctuate throughout the day. A battery will charge when prices are low and discharge when prices are high, thereby lowering your daily energy costs.

3. Demand Response (DR) and Wholesale Market Access
In many areas, energy providers will pay customers to be available to reduce grid demand during only a few critical hours of the year. A battery allows you to participate in these programs while minimizing the energy curtailment required at your site.
Additional Benefits of Storage
Pairing with Solar
Energy storage systems can absorb excess solar power generation and discharge when the sun stops shining, further lowering demand charges and unlocking additional value.

Grid Sustainability
By powering your facility with on­site storage when the grid is under heavy stress, you displace the carbon­ intensive fuel sources needed to power peaking generators.

Backup Power
Under certain system configurations, batteries can provide temporary back­ up power and other forms of resiliency to keep your site operating when the grid experiences reliability issues.

Seamless Integration and Automation
No Upfront Cost
Enel X will install a storage or solar­plus­storage system at no upfront cost to you and under the financing option that you choose.

No Disruption of Business Operations
Our advanced machine learning and optimization software will automate the battery’s operation to optimize financial performance with no active management required on your end.

No Ongoing Operation & Maintenance Required
Enel X will take care of all ongoing operations and maintenance to ensure the system continues delivering top performance.
Enel X has the computer software, the knowledge, the algorithms, and the staff to maximize the value of energy storage.
