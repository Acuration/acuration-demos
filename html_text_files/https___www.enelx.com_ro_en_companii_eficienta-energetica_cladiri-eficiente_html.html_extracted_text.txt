We increase the energy efficiency of buildings
How it works
Your advantages
We increase the energy efficiency of buildings
Companies from various industries seek to transform the buildings used as offices or working points according to the energy transition. Enel X guides you through this radical rethinking of the way you consume energy during industrial processes. We come to your aid with advanced equipment that enhances the energy efficiency of the buildings. We accelerate the change by using integrated solutions, which help you extract as much value as possible from this smart orientation towards the future.
Type of buildings
Whether it’s an office building or a production unit, your company can count on all-in-one solutions adapted to your needs.
One-stop-shop
Enel X is your strategic partner from the first step for energy transition until the maximum exploitation of the energy potential.
Decarbonisation
We reduce your energy consumption, thus the carbon footprint. We harness top technologies for the benefit of the customers and the planet.
How it works
We increase the building’s efficiency
Synergic solutions
Following a detailed analysis of your energy consumption, we assess, project and install advanced energy efficiency solutions that optimize the consumption in buildings and industrial units.
What we can install in order to increase the energy efficiency of industrial buildings, thus reducing energy costs:
monitoring and control
meters
ultra-efficient
LED lighting
technologies
smart sensors
(building management system - BMS)
heating and air conditioning systems that reduce the primary electricity consumption
high-efficiency industrial water heaters
that can be associated with cogeneration systems
uninterrupted power sources (
UPS
)
systems for the correction of the power factor (
PFC
).
Offering all-in-one solutions. We can integrate the energy efficiency of the buildings with an energy diagnosis and with monitoring and control programs.
Also, we offer you various financial options, in line with our EaaS approach (energy as service).

Your advantages
Technology reduces costs
You are making significant savings if you install a more efficient technology. You keep a high level of comfort at the work point and improve industrial production standards.
Efficiency is environment-friendly
When the buildings of the plants and other industrial units consume energy in a smart way, greenhouse gas emissions decrease.
