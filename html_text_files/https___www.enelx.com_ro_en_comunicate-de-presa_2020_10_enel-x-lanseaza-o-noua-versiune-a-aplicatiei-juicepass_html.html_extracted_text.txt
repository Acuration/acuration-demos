Enel X Romania launches the new version of JuicePass electric vehicle charging app
With JuicePass or the charging card, vehicle users can now, in addition to the public stations, manage their JuiceBox station at home
The new version of the app allows drivers to configure their car model for quick information about consumption, remaining range or the duration of the vehicle recharging.

Bucharest, October 22, 2020
- Enel X Romania, a part of Enel X, the advanced energy services division of Enel Group, has launched a new version of JuicePass, the application for charging electric cars at Enel X points. The new version allows greater flexibility in the process of charging electric vehicles and simplifies the drivers' access to useful information about the consumption of their own cars.

Drivers can now connect and subscribe directly to the Enel X mobility solutions available through the app based on the user account created. For customization, the users of electric vehicles will be able to associate one or more car models and, based on the information entered, they will receive real-time data on the duration and need for recharging or on the remaining range.

Through the application, users can now purchase a digital card that works based on RFID technology and use it at stations as an alternative method to start the charging process. In addition, by simply accessing the JuicePass application, drivers can automatically pay for the charging at public stations, accept and change the price plan or the payment method (bank card) associated with the account. The history of the charging sessions and of the received invoices are available in a dedicated section.

Roughly a quarter of Romanian electric car drivers have created accounts in the JuicePass app and can access a network of almost 55,000 public charging points in 18 European countries. The app can be downloaded from Google Play or App Store, and an installation guide can be accessed on the enelx.ro website.

Drivers can check the locations and status of Enel X charging points on an interactive map either on the JuicePass app, or on the website, here. They can see in real time whether a charging station is available, busy or under maintenance, as well as its type (fast or ultra-fast charging), the type of the charging cable, the power, the accessibility, and the distance and route to reach it. Currently, Enel X Romania has installed over 60 public JuicePole and JuicePump-tyoe charging points in cities such as Bucharest, Timisoara, Constanta, Deva, Drobeta Turnu Severin or Focșani.

The products launched by Enel X are part of the "Juice Family" range which includes:
JuicePole: The recharging solution designed for a perfect integration in any urban context: public use, strategic mobility points or in company car parking. It can ensure the simultaneous charging of two vehicles by AC power.
JuicePump: The fast recharging solution that paves the way for electric mobility outside the cities and makes it accessible to everyone. It allows the recharging of two electric vehicles at the same time, having three standard connectors (CCS, Chademo, Type 2).
JuiceBox: Box-type station that can be installed in individual homes, being also available in a commercial version for charging fleets of vehicles.
