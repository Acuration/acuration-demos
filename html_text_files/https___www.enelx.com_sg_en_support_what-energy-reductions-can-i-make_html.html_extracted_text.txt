What types of energy reductions can I make?
Enel X has extensive experience creating energy reduction strategies that work within the operational limitations of a wide variety of facilities, including cold storage, manufacturing, food processing, data centers and technology companies, universities, shopping centres, office buildings and more. Common reduction examples include:
Switch from electricity grid usage to onsite generation (BESS or backup generator)
Modify manufacturing processes
Adjust HVAC equipment
Turn down pumps
Change settings in industrial freezers
Reduce non-essential lighting

Customers often facilitate dispatch participation by simply shifting many of their energy-intensive processes by a few hours.
