What does remote control mean?
How it works
Your advantages
Remote control technologies simplify town lighting
Take control of the public lighting network and remotely adjust the parameters of the smart street lighting system. We catalyze the transformation of the public street lighting service with remote control solutions that contribute to the reliability of the lighting system and to the satisfaction of the inhabitants.
How it works?
How can the platform be used
The digital city
Remote management of streetlights is now easier for you and you can make decisions easier. The "control room" has multiple advantages for the representatives of the local public administration that manage the smart public lighting:
It is
simple, intuitive
It has functionalities that unlock the possibility of
remote control

for the local lighting systems of the locality
It generates
reports
and is a tool that supports the best decisions
Each point in the network of street lighting poles generates data that can be consulted and analyzed: operating status, connection, various measurements. You can vary the light intensity; you can adjust certain parameters of the smart city lighting system.

Enel X develops
cutting-edge solutions
to integrate
smart lighting
projects with other value-added services: this is how the “Digital City” is built.
