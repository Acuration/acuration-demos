What is electric mobility?

Charging locations
As more and more people make the move to EVs it is has become easier than ever to charge your electric car, whether at home, at work or out and about.

At home:
one of the biggest advantages of an EV is the convenience of refuelling at home. Home charging also saves you time and money especially with smart charging software that charges efficiently when electricity rates are low. A home charging station must be installed by a professional to ensure that it is safely connected to your electricity circuit.
At work:
employers are increasingly offering charging stations at the workplace to improve their company’s sustainability and encourage staff to change to an EV. Charging at work is ideal as your EV is sitting unused for longer periods.
Out and about:
from shopping centres and hotels to car parks and service stations, there is a network of over 45,000 public charging points across Germany where you can easily and quickly charge your EV. Find your nearest charging station

Public charging
When out and about there are only two things that you need to charge your EV.

1. EV charging app: this will help you to locate the nearest available charging station that is appropriate to your vehicle. The app connects to the charging station allowing you to charge your vehicle and pay for the electricity used. An RFD card can often also be used to pay for EV charging.

2. Cable: There are several types of cable which different car manufacturers use for their EVs. In most cases the cable will be supplied with your vehicle. Charging stations are clearly marked with the types of cable they accept and a charging app will pinpoint the ones appropriate to your needs. You simply connect the cable to the station. Fast charging stations (found on major roads and filling stations) have charging cables built in.

Home charging grant
The Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure’s KfW440 program offers a grant of €900 towards the purchase and installation of charging stations in privately used parking spaces in residential buildings.
Who is eligible:
Homeowners, homeowners’ associations, tenants and landlords. This grant is not available for charging stations for commercial use.
