Manage Dollars at Risk with Enel X’s Global Energy Advisory Services
DOWNLOAD PDF

Structured energy supply management strategies and multiple-round bidding processes are not for every organization. But if energy costs are a material risk to your profitability, a comprehensive energy sourcing and risk management strategy can deliver a competitive edge. With Enel X’s global energy advisory services, your organization is paired with a dedicated energy advisor and is supported by a team of regional market analysts.

Our experts oversee the supply management process and inform your market decisions. This is how we do it.

Energy Sourcing and Risk Management Strategy
Enel X energy experts work with your team to arrange different business objectives in a cohesive go-to-market strategy. Together, we evaluate how your goals around cost minimization, budget certainty, sustainability, and risk mitigation fit into existing energy supply management practices and planning horizons.

Our energy advisors then investigate supply and hedging options, evaluate suppliers, and make recommendations. When appropriate, your options may include alternative sourcing strategies, such as participation in wholesale electricity markets, direct connections to pipelines, renewable energy options or co-generation.

Strategic Market Participation
After systematizing your organization’s energy sourcing and risk management strategy, Enel X’s advisors get to work executing that plan.

Whether leveraging our reverse auction capabilities or using an electronic sealed-bid approach, site-level electronic RFP development is a key element of our service offering. By digitizing and stream-lining the proposal process, we help you analyze bids for different products and term lengths to find the mix that best fits your needs.

If your organization elects to spread energy risks with an incremental purchasing approach, our experts help develop RFPs that differentiate suppliers on basis price, index adders, balancing costs and hedging premiums.

For large industrial deals requiring multiple-round bidding processes, our experts perform critical short-listing evaluations to reduce time to market and alleviate administrative strains.

Seamless Negotiation and Contract Management
Your Enel X advisor and a dedicated energy supply manage- ment manager support your team throughout contract negotiations and execution. We also consolidate electronic copies of your existing and historical energy supply contracts in our award-winning Enel X Connect application, which makes it easy for you and your team to sort, review and assess their value against current market conditions.

Ongoing Analysis, Automatic Alerts, and Hedge Triggers
Your Enel X advisors and analysts regularly provide market updates to affirm that your energy sourcing and risk management strategies align with current market conditions. Our advisors also help create automatic alerts and executable triggers, which enable your team to capitalize on market movement in a moment’s notice.

Position Reports and Budget Variance Analyses
Through value at risk and custom position reports, our experts help your team understand its market exposure and hedge performance. As hedges are layered in, our experts develop a mark-to-budget analysis that compares current mark-to- market positions against budget targets.

Energy Bill Auditing
Enel X analysts can audit all transportation, utility, and/or supplier invoices for accuracy in volume and price components. Your Enel X team works with the utility or supplier to remedy any inaccuracies that may be uncovered.

For organizations requiring utility bill management (UBM), the UBM tools in our Enel X Connect application streamline bill collection, validation and payment processes, and provide visibility into when and how you use energy. For more information, read our case study on how
General Motors saved over $49 million
with Enel X’s UBM technology.

Renewable Energy and Distributed Energy Resources
If your organization is pursuing renewable energy, battery storage, or other distributed energy resources, our experts can help determine the resource mix and financing strategies that align with your broader business goals. Additionally, our experts can recommend ways to manage the renewable energy costs that may already be embedded in your current supply rates.
