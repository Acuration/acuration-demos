Enel's Leadership in the fight against climate change reconfirmed by CDP
The Carbon Disclosure Project acknowledged Enel’s leadership in mitigating risks posed by climate change and seizing the opportunities
Rome, December 13
th
, 2022
– Enel X's parent company, Enel, has been included in the prestigious “A” List for addressing climate change released by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the global environmental non-profit that provides the most valued platform to monitor business performance in the fight against climate change. In addition, Enel’s subsidiaries Endesa, Enel Chile and Enel Américas ranked in the leadership level in the CDP Climate, with an A- score.

“
Climate change is one of the most urgent challenges facing global society and requires serious action from everyone, including swift and decisive measures from companies. Enel's inclusion in CDP's Climate A List is yet another confirmation of our ongoing commitment towards fighting it,
” said
Francesco Starace
, Enel CEO and General Manager. “
Actions aimed at fighting climate change have been a core priority in our corporate strategy. As such, CDP has recognized us as a leading utility in the transition towards a zero-emission energy system in addition to acknowledging our ability to bring forward our Net Zero goal to 2040 and focus on the Group's growth in renewables and the promotion of electrification.”

CDP’s annual environmental disclosure and scoring process are widely recognized as the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency. In 2022, over 680 investors with assets of over 130 trillion US dollars requested that companies disclose data on environmental impacts, risks, and opportunities through CDP’s platform.

The Group’s climate governance model and its approach to managing climate change risks and opportunities, along with its ambition to reach zero emissions by accelerating renewables and phasing out its coal capacity, were some of the best practices recognized by CDP. Furthermore, Enel’s commitment to contribute to the decarbonization of other sectors through the promotion of electrification of end uses was also acknowledged by CDP.

The Group’s global sustainability leadership is reconfirmed through its presence in several other renowned sustainability indices and rankings, such as the MSCI ESG Leaders Indices, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index World and Europe, the Euronext Vigeo-Eiris 120 indices, the FTSE4Good Index series, the STOXX Global ESG Leaders index, the ISS “Prime” rating, the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, the Refinitiv TOP 100 Diversity and Inclusion Index, the Equileap's Top 100 Gender Equality Global Ranking as well as the ECPI indices.

Enel is increasingly attracting the attention of Socially Responsible Investors, whose stake in the company is steadily growing, representing about 14.6% of the Group’s share capital in 2021, more than double compared to 2014 levels. This increase, which is in line with the growing recognition of the importance of non-financial elements in the creation of long-term sustainable value, reflects the bolstering of Enel’s global sustainability leadership.

Renewables, electrification, energy efficiency, smart cities, and mobility are fundamental elements of Enel’s response to climate change that was key to being confirmed as a climate leader once again by CDP.
