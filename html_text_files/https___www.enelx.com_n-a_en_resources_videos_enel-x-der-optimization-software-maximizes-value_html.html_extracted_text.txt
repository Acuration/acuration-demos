How Enel X's DER.OS Software Maximizes the Value of Battery Energy Storage
A battery is only as good as the software that runs it.
As more organizations install energy assets on-site, they need intelligent software to automatically manage all of their solutions. Enel X’s industry-leading DER Optimization Software coordinates your system to maximize savings from batteries, solar, backup generation, electric vehicle charging, and more.

DER.OS is a scalable management software system designed to maximize the economic value of distributed energy resources. DER.OS monitors, communicates with, and controls your energy network, interfacing with site-level and cloud-based systems simultaneously to deliver maximum benefit to your organization. No matter what resources you have, DER.OS optimizes across all value streams to:

Predict system peaks
and minimize demand charges
Analyze grid conditions and forecast facility load
to maximize savings
Store excess on-site solar energy
to deploy when time-of-use rates are highest
Participate in grid programs like demand response
creating an additional revenue stream for your facility
