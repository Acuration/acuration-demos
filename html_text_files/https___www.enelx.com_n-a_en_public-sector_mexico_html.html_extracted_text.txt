Mexico Energy Solutions
A Skilled Advisor for Mexico’s Competitive Electricity & Natural Gas Markets
As the world’s seventh-largest oil producer,
Mexico’s market structures have recently evolved
to incorporate competitive
energy supply
as well as electricity sourced from
renewables
. The changes associated with these newly deregulated markets can bring complexity, volatility and risk. Turning risk into reward—in some cases a 20% cost reduction for those businesses that can successfully source competitive electricity and natural gas supply—takes a partner like Enel X that can deliver strategy, skill, and experience.
Enel X has successfully led many Mexican enterprises
off the state-owned utility and onto low-cost competitive supply
, greening the buyer’s portfolio along the way with renewable energy credits (RECs). Whether your business needs electricity or natural gas, Enel X can draw on the experience of thousands of transactions it has conducted around the world and, more importantly, here in Mexico.

From developing your go-to-market plan, managing your registration with CRE, vetting suppliers and their proposals, executing procurement strategies, and providing ongoing monitoring and intelligence after entering the competitive supply market, Enel X will ensure that you properly manage risk and receive the most competitive prices for your energy.
