Claim a subsidy for providing public charging
The ADVENIR premium covers supply and installation costs up to 60% for charging points in private car parks open to the public. The maximum amounts of aid can range from € 2,100 excluding tax to € 18,000 excluding tax per recharging point depending on the theoretical maximum recharging power of the equipment installed. Valid until March 31, 2022.

Charging locations
Any business where customers spend time which also has a parking area has the potential to become a public EV charging facility, for example:
Hotels and restaurants
Gyms and sports clubs
Supermarkets
Shopping malls
Multiplex cinemas
Public attractions
Earn revenue
Becoming part of Enel X’s charging network provides a hassle-free way for your customers to charge their EV (all of your locations are pinpointed in our JuicePass app) while your organization earns revenue. With our JuiceNet Enterprise platform you can set prices, authorize users and even provide coupons for loyal customers.

Attract customers
Offering public EV charging stations attracts new and loyal customers with EVs who are eager to patronize a business that is supporting the transition to electric mobility. Crucially it can also increase your customer "dwell-time" by nearly an hour - meaning more time for customers to spend money at your business.

Promote sustainability
Providing public EV charging stations at your premises demonstrates that your business embraces technologies that make the planet a cleaner and safer place to live. This signals to customers that your business seeks to encourage globally responsible behaviour and helps to establish your brand as an authority that practices what they preach. You build up trust through your actions.

Customers may also be willing to pay more at a business that demonstrates sustainability with an investment in EV charging equipment. A study by Nielsen in October 2020, found that 72% of respondents from Generation Z were willing to pay more for products and services that come from companies who are committed to positive social and environmental impact.
Embrace change
There’s little doubt that EVs are the way of the future. As EV technology continues to evolve and improve, the market for EVs will only continue to grow. By installing public charging stations, you show that you not only see this change on the horizon but want to do your part to champion it and speed its arrival. Whether or not they realize it, anyone who walks into your car park intuitively sees that your business is forward-thinking.
