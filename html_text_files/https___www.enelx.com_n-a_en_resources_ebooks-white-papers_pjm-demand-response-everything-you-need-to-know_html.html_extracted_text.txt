PJM Demand Response: Everything You Need to Know
A No-Cost, No-Risk Opportunity for Businesses to Earn Payments for Supporting Grid Reliability
PJM—the electric transmission system operator responsible for managing North America’s largest electric grid, serving customers in parts of 13 states across the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern US—and some of the electric utilities within its territory compensate commercial and industrial (C&I) energy consumers for the amount of electricity demand they can remove from the grid at the times when they need it most.

For PJM’s C&I energy consumers, DR is a no-cost, no-risk way to earn payments for their ability to reduce energy consumption from the grid temporarily and contribute to efforts to improve the reliability and efficiency of the electric grid system in their community.

This in-depth guide explains how PJM demand response works and lays out all the options available to C&I energy consumers in the region.
