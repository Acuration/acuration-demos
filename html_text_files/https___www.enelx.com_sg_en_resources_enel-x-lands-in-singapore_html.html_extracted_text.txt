Enel X lands in Singapore
Enel X's virtual power plant will support the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) with Demand Response.
Singapore, December 17th, 2020
– Enel X, the Enel Group’s advanced energy services business line, has entered Singapore’s demand response market. Enel X’s virtual power plant will support the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS), with the aim to improve overall system security and efficiency, as well as deliver cost savings to participating customers. Enel X in Singapore will work with global and local commercial as well as industrial businesses in order to provide demand response services to the grid.

“We are glad about our entry in Singapore’s market, and look forward to the future opportunities this entry will entail both for us and our partners,”
said
Francesco Venturini
, Enel X CEO.
“In addition to supporting the grid, businesses in Singapore can be flexible with their energy use so they can gain a source of competitive advantage. Leveraging on innovative technology, virtual power plant participation is a growing opportunity that can offer a new source of revenues, offset retail electricity costs, and allow for investments in new technologies such as battery storage.”

Demand response programs encourage energy users to adjust their energy consumption in order to help stabilize the grid when requested by the system. Virtual power plant participation in Singapore is increasingly important as demand for energy grows, particularly with the emergence and development of electricity-intensive sectors, such as data centers (EMA). In addition to industrial gas producers and data centers, industries well suited to participate include technology companies, cold storage units, food processing and manufacturing facilities, water utilities as well as commercial buildings.

Enel X is well-positioned to support the growth of Singapore’s demand response market, leveraging on the company’s worldwide demand response leadership, with over 6 GW of capacity under management. Enel X provides a universal customer experience with its innovative technology, which works across all countries and grid systems, meaning a single solution can be delivered to customers globally. This is the company’s entry point offering to the market in Singapore.
