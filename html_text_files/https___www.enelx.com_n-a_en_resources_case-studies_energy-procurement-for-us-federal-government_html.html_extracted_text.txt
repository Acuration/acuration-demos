Enel X C&I, institu­tional, and utility customers benefit from same platform security upgrades
Continuous improvement is essential to building and maintaining leadership in any market, and that is especially true when working with Federal agencies.

With more and more business being conducted in the cloud, the Federal Government has escalated its efforts to ensure its data is safeguarded and that the SaaS solutions it approves for agency use meet strict security protocols and are regularly monitored.

Enter the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, a.k.a. FedRAMP.

Developed in concert with the National Institute of Standards, the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security, FedRAMP provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and con­tinuous monitoring for cloud product
and services.

And, as of October 1, 2020, the Enel X Exchange, the industry’s leading online platform for energy supply management and procurement, is the first and only energy auction platform to become FedRAMP-certified.

Earning this certification wasn’t easy. Enel X made over $1 million in security upgrades to meet program requirements across 126 testable controls in areas such as Application Security, Security Monitoring, Audit Log Management, and Continuous Monitoring. The result is an even stronger, more secure Enel X Exchange that continues to be the gold standard in government energy procurement. For the GSA alone, Enel X has:
Purchased natural gas in 37 states; electricity in 10 states; and both commodities across 70+ utilities
Purchased 21 million Dth of natural gas annually, representing $98 million in contract value
Purchased 1.6 billion kWh of electricity annually, representing $104 million in contract value

FedRAMP certification, and all the enhancements that went into attaining it, isn’t just good for Enel X govern­ment clients; it also means the Enel X Exchange got that much better for large commercial, industrial, institutional, and utility energy buyers.
