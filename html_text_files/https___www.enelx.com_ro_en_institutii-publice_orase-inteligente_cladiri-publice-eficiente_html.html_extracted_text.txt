Energetically efficient public buildings
Energy efficiency of public administration buildings and spaces is a key aspect of smart cities. Enel X offers innovative high-tech services for this purpose. Today, both residential, commercial and public buildings are often energy inefficient in terms of heating needs (heating and hot water) and the use of electricity (light, air conditioning) and are often in winter and summer in the situation of having high caloric losses. It is time to accelerate the energy transition, and public buildings can signal to everyone the new era of responsible energy consumption.
Public service offices
Local or regional public administration offices, taxpayer relations centers are the targets of energy transformation.
Areas of public utility
Stadiums, cultural centers and youth centers, public swimming pools and other leisure areas are just as many opportunities for efficiency.
Educational institutions
Schools, high schools, universities, campuses, research centers, laboratories can be the landmarks of change for energy efficiency.
Health services areas
Human and natural health also means a reduction in air pollution. Hospitals and clinics can become sustainable public buildings.
How it works?
Measures of energetic efficiency
The specialized intervention of Enel X
At a first level of action, interventions are needed for:
thermal insulation
replacing traditional lighting systems
with more efficient technologies (especially LED solutions)
upgrading thermal installations through systems that use
renewable energy
, such as solar thermal energy or the use of heat pumps.
At a later stage, the most important results appear after the total
retrofitting
of the building, which includes:
the heating system of the building
the power installation
the building insulation

Enel X intervenes with a wide range of actions to increase the energy efficiency of buildings belonging to the local public administration:
Integrated design
of the building and the system
Energy reengineering
of the mechanical and electric systems
Design of
efficient interior lighting systems
, to which smart energy services can be added
Integrated management
of the building’s mechanical and electric systems.
Your advantages
A healthier environment for people
The larger the locality, the more public institutions that consume energy. When all become efficient public buildings, people and the natural environment have something to gain.
Sustainable public buildings
Public buildings can be a model of alignment with environmental and digitalization imperatives. The urban ecosystem will be proud of your sustainable offices.
