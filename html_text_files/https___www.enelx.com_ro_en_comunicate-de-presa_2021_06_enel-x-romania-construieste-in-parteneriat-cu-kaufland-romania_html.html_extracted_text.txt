The project, the first of its kind in the Kaufland Romania network, contributes to reducing the impact on the environment, by reducing the carbon footprint. Green energy, which comes from renewable sources, is a sustainable alternative and helps maintain a clean environment, therefore, the company's goal is to continue to invest in such solutions with our partners,
