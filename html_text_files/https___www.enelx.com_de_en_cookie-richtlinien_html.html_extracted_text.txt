1.               Definition of Cookies
1.1.           Cookies are small text strings that the sites visited by the user send to the device used (for example computers, tablets, smartphones, notebooks, etc.), where they are stored before being re-transmitted to the same sites at the next visit of the same user. Cookies may be subject to prior consent.
1.2.           Cookies make it possible to identify the device in which the same is stored for its entire period of validity or registration. During visits to the Site, the information relating to the browsing data received from the user's device could be stored in "cookies" installed on the same.
1.3.           Cookies perform various functions and make it possible to browse the Site efficiently, remembering user's preferences and improving the browsing experience. They can also help personalise the advertisements shown during browsing and the marketing activities directed to the user, ensuring that they are carried out in a manner consistent with his or her interests and preferences.
1.4.           Cookie settings can be changed at any time. More information about the cookies used by the Site is provided below, as well as how to manage the settings related to them.
2.               Types of Cookies used
2.1.           When connecting to the Site via a browser, cookies may be installed on the user's device in order to recognise the device used, guarantee the use of the Site for the duration of the cookies' validity period and collect information on accesses to the Site.
2.2.           While browsing a Site, users can also receive cookies on their device that are sent from different sites or servers (so called "third parties"), which contain certain elements (such as, for example, images, maps, sounds, specific links to pages on other domains) present on the site the user is visiting. Therefore, in this respect there can be:
2.2.1.
First-party cookies
, sent directly from Enel X to the user's device.
2.2.2.
Third-party cookies
, coming from a third party but sent on behalf of Enel X.
2.3.           Depending on the cookies' purposes, they can be distinguished as:
2.3.1.

2.3.3.
Social Plugin
: the Site contains
social network
plug-ins (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, etc.). By accessing a page of the Site containing a similar plug-in, the internet browser connects directly to the
social network
servers and the plug-in is displayed on the screen thanks to the connection with the browser.
Even if the user is not registered with
social networks
, the sites with active
social plug-ins
can send data to the
networks
. Each access to the Site will set a cookie with a code through an active plug-in. Considering that the user's browser, upon each connection with a
network
server, sends this cookie without a request, the
network
could create a profile that recalls websites the user has visited. In this case, it is possible to link the encoding to a person, for example when the user connects to the
social network
.
2.3.4 Third-party cookies – authorised third parties may install cookies during interaction with Enel X services.  In this case, these third parties are search engines, suppliers of tracking and analysis services, social media networks and advertisers.  These third parties generate cookies during the content supply process, including targeted advertising relevant to the interests of the user in order to track the impact of their advertisements and to carry out services on behalf of Enel X.
A list of some third parties that could install cookies when Enel X services are used can be found below.  These third parties may access the cookies that they have installed, obtain the user IP address and information about browser configurations.  In any case, these third parties may not access information about the activities carried out by the user on Enel X, e.g. searches or purchases.  The third-party cookies are unable to gather personal identity information such as names or email addresses automatically.  The third-party cookies are used during the content supply process, in order to track the impact of their advertisements, to provide the user with the most personalised content and to carry out services on behalf of Enel X.
Find out how these third parties use cookies by visiting their websites.
