Global leader: Enel X Ranks 2nd Among EV Charging and Storage Companies
May 15, 2020
Two latest reports from the research firm Guidehouse Insights position Enel X in the top 3 of energy companies in the e-mobility and storage industries, highlighting their smart energy offer across resiliency solutions as one of the main competitive advantages in the market.
In the past week, Guidehouse Insights recognized our EV charging and commercial & industrial storage solutions, each as one of the top solution sets available today. Guidehouse is a leading independent research firm, and Enel X was recently ranked #2 globally in both the Leaderboard Report: EV Charging Hardware Suppliers and Leaderboard Report: Commercial & Industrial Energy Storage Systems Integrators. On the former, Enel X improved its ranking (#3 overall) from the last version of the report in 2018; this was the first Leaderboard Report exclusively looking at the C&I storage market.

Leaderboard Reports look at the current market landscape, including what’s driving the market, what barriers remain, what geographic regions are leading the market, as well as emerging market opportunities. Leaderboard Reports also rank the leading solution providers on each company’s strategy and execution across such areas as: vision; go-to-market strategy; partnerships; technology; geographic reach; sales, marketing and distribution; product performance; product portfolio; pricing; and staying power.

The EV Charging Hardware Suppliers report evaluated the leading companies that design and produce hardware solutions for the fast-growing global EV market. Companies included within the analysis are those with an international footprint in hardware markets for homeowners, workplaces, commercial properties, fleets, and/or retail charging service providers. The companies included within this report are the 15 positioned to address the largest share of the 2030 market.

Guidehouse points to our overall leadership in the EV charging space, ranked second amongst 15 competitors in this report and the overall leader in its leaderboard report on vehicle-grid integration published last year. Additionally, the reports credit Enel X's long and notable history in electric mobility, especially in VGI, as the company has been an equipment supplier, participant, and manager of many early market pilots and demonstrations of bidirectional and smart charging technologies.

The C&I Energy Storage Integrators report defines energy storage system integration as: software and controls-based integration of core energy storage technology into complete, intelligent systems that deliver the performance required by the customer while ensuring the overall profitability of the system.

Enel X is positioned among the “Leaders” chart which includes companies that have differentiated themselves from the competition through exceptional product development, strong supplier relationships, and a sustainable business model. By achieving an overall score of 89.7 Enel X made the top 3 over other companies such Tesla amid others. Leaders are currently in the strongest position for long-term success in the DES market.

Through our acquisitions of EnerNOC, Demand Energy, and eMotorWerks, we’ve built a portfolio of technologies focused on aggregating C&I consumption, distributed energy solutions (DES), and EVs to provide both flexibility services to the electric grid and to optimize C&I loads. We deliver energy services across North America and Enel’s existing Europe and Latin American countries across three customer segments underpinned by e-mobility solutions: households (e-home), C&I energy users (e-industries), and municipalities (e-cities).

According to Guidehouse, these acquisitions add a formidable set of solutions to our energy supply capabilities with tailored approaches to meet the needs of existing customers in North America (related to flexibility and independent advisory support) and Europe (as a turnkey supply and solutions provider). As the DES industry continues to grow, Guidehouse expects Enel X will remain a leading player.
