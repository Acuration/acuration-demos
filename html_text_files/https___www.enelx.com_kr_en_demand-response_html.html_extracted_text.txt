What is Demand Response?
The charge towards Korea’s clean energy future has created the need for new forms of power capacity to ensure the reliability of the power grid while balancing the natural variability of renewable power. Demand Response is one of the best options for balancing renewables. The Korea Power Exchange (KPX) allows Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) to offer Demand Response through a market mechanism to ensure the stability and sustainability of the power grid. Our VPP allows energy users to offer Demand Response into the wholesale electricity market and to get paid for doing so.
Global experience
Enel X is a global Demand Response leader, present in 11 countries with more than 9.3 GW of flexible capacity managed.
Dedicated team
Our team of experts supports you to identify the best way your facility can support the grid without compromising your operations.
Smart platform
Advanced algorithms allow you to maximize revenue earned towards your bottom line, while maintaining the highest security standards.
Continuous assistance
Our Network Operations Center (NOC) is available 24-7-365, where all energy dispatches are actioned, managed and monitored in real time.

How Demand Response works
Demand Response Programs
1
Grid need
Grid need
The Korea Power Exchange (KPX) balances the supply and demand of electricity in real-time. When demand is very high relative to the available supply, and close to reserve capacity of 6,500MW, the KPX will issue a ‘Demand Response Dispatch’ notice to aggregators, indicating that the power grid is under stress and there is a need for dispatchable capacity to support the system.
2
VPP is called
VPP is called
Enel X’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is called on, who aggregates its customer’s energy load or distributed energy assets made up of onsite equipment, backup generation assets, and battery energy storage solutions across businesses in Korea. Enel X offers its portfolio’s capacity to the KPX as a new source of power supply during these critical times.

Customer responds
Customer responds
Customers across Korea either reduce or modify energy usage when called on. This makes their power flexibility available to the KPX, by implementing power modulation plans.

Earn regular payments
Customers receive regular payments for both their availability to provide the service, and for when their power is provided to support the grid.

Reliability Demand Response
Reliability Demand Response
To manage electricity supply in case of an emergency, load curtailment can be requested by the KPX if the reserve power level is in the “preparation” or “notice” stages (less than 6.5 GW of electricity demand reserve available), to reduce demand on the system.

With this program, businesses respond to the grid signal for 1 to 4 hours, with three to five mandatory events of curtailment per year.
2
Voluntary Demand Response
Voluntary Demand Response
There are other Demand Response programs where participation is voluntary. These include Economic, Peak Demand and Fine-dust Demand Response, which can be done without a request for demand reduction by the KPX.
Economic
: Businesses who participate in the Reliability program can also participate in voluntary bidding to compete with the generation price from power generation plants.
Peak:
Businesses can curtail their load when power supply is expected to exceed the standard level of demand due to winter and summer peak usages and earn revenue.
Fine-dust:
Businesses can curtail their load due to the emission of fine-dust caused by coal generation and be rewarded.

If your business is enrolled in Reliability Demand Response, you can opt-in to any Voluntary Demand Response program of your choice at any time of day, which we manage on your behalf.
Contact our team
to learn which programs would best suit your business.
Our offering
We extract businesses the most value from Demand Response, by selling it against utility assets in the KPX markets. We commit a dispatchable resource to the KPX in certain conditions, and get paid for being on stand-by and when utilized.
While valuable, DR can be quite complex. The KPX requirements include: unique market registrations, dedicated meter connections, real-time market bidding and dispatch procedures, and detailed performance measurement and compliance rules.
We approach market participation the same way we approach everything we do – with a mission to make it easy for businesses to access this new energy opportunity.

Technical and operational DR evaluation

Revenue planning and business case
