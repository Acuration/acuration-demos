Key benefits
What is it?
JuiceNet Enterprise is the Enel X smart platform that allows you to open your private EV charging network to all public users. This powerful tool allows you to create and manage the pricing scheme for charging sessions and gather information on your energy consumption through data management and reporting. It is compatible with JuiceBox, JuicePole and JuicePump.
Total visibility
Monitor ongoing and completed charging sessions with complete data access for each charging station.
Versatile
Define prices for both private and public charging. Create coupons for free charging.
JuicePass compatible
Authorise users able to access specific charging stations via the JuicePass app.
How does it work?

Driver
Cards
Load Optimisation
Manage and monitor charging  sessions
Use the online dashboard to manage and monitor in real time, both users and the progress of their charging sessions. View a map of your charging infrastructure by status. Restrict access to authorised users only for private charging. Independently set the pricing for charging sessions and the costs to be attributed to each charge.

Driver
Select who has access to your service via the Driver page. From this page it is possible to order the corporate codes for the configuration and activation of Driver users on JuicePass, suspend them if needed and view a complete recharge history.

Cards
The RFID card is the ideal tool for the management of your EV fleet. Each card can be purchased for operational use and managed on this page, or it can be associated with a specific Driver - the employee - who associates the card with their corporate code on JuicePass. Within the Cards area it is possible to activate, suspend or block RFID cards purchased.

Load Optimisation
Our Load Optimisation software maximises vehicle charging within the power load available at your site by balancing the available power load across multiple charging stations.

Simplicity and detail
Go public
Open your charging network to public or restrict access to specific users. Define pricing schemes for public and private charging. Easily authorise users to access specific charging stations.
