Guidehouse Names Enel X “Leader” in EaaS
Guidehouse, an energy market intelligence firm, has recognized Enel X’s inventive work in decarbonization for the second year in a row.
Enel X has again been named a market Leader in the most recent
Energy as a Service (EaaS) Leaderboard report from Guidehouse Insights
, a market intelligence and advisory firm covering the global energy transformation. The report is intended to assess the competitive landscape for EaaS solutions, and ranks EaaS companies according to Strategy and Execution scores.

In naming Enel X a market Leader, Guidehouse has noted that “Enel X’s position as a Leader in the EaaS market is supported by its global footprint in EaaS solution delivery, comprehensive technology solution stack that includes EV charging and demand response, clear EaaS vision that is central to the company’s mission, and focus on the customer experience.”

What is Energy as a Service (EaaS)?
The energy sector is being transformed, with four defining trends emerging: decarbonization, electrification, urbanization, and digitalization. Energy as a Service is a new paradigm, one intended to replace “energy as a commodity.” EaaS outsources energy management, leading to an increase in resilience and sustainability. It more efficiently finds solutions that address specific customer needs most closely. Energy as a Service is intended to go beyond merely charging customers for electricity supply, and is intended to generate added value.

Enel X’s Portfolio of EaaS Solutions
Enel X has a variety of integrated EaaS solutions for commercial and industrial customers, including
demand response
, which allows customers to monetize and earn revenue from their energy flexibility with small changes in use. Other solutions include
power purchase agreements (PPAs)
, on- and off-site energy supply technologies including
solar-plus-storage
, a variety of financing options, consulting and advisory services, and digital energy management platforms.
