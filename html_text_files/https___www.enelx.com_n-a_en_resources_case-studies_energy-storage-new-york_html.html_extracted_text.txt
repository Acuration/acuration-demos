Enel X Has a Deep History of Energy Storage in New York
DOWNLOAD PDF

With a history of developing, installing, and operating energy storage and solar-plus-storage systems, Enel X has built one of the largest distributed energy storage portfolios in New York City and has partnered with an array of customers to bring energy storage projects to life.

As New York incentive programs for energy storage have changed over the years, so too have the ways businesses can work with energy storage project developers like Enel X to capitalize on these new energy opportunities. Businesses can now utilize batteries on-site to lower utility bills at their facility or lease land to Enel X, who pays the property owner for the right to install a battery and generate revenues via energy market participation.

Below are actual customer examples of both the land lease model and the facility energy savings model showing how customers can partner with Enel X for energy storage.

Land Lease
Large Shopping Center, New York, NY
The shopping center decided to lease its unused land to Enel X in exchange for allowing Enel X to install a battery on that land. Now, the customer receives contracted, recurring payments from Enel X, while the battery strategically charges and discharges electricity from the grid to alleviate congestion and support the community.

Project Details:

System Capacity:
4.8 MW |
System Available Energy:
16.4 MWh
This project represents the largest battery storage system in New York City, supporting the local grid with energy reserve during peak periods.

Key Results & Benefits:
Fixed, recurring payments create a reliable, sustainable revenue stream
Enel X assumes operational and performance risk associated with the energy storage system
No technical energy expertise required while still supporting the local utility and the broader New York grid

Optimization of demand charge management through the combined solar, fuel cell, building load, and battery operations
Access to backup power for critical facilities in the event of a power outage

Glenwood Management, New York, NY
