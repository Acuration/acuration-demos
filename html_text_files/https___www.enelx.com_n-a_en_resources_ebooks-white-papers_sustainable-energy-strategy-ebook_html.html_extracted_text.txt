Sustainable Energy Strategy
How to Make the Business Case, Align Your Stakeholders, and Set Actionable Emissions Targets
Sustainability trends have recently made major headlines as corporations continue to announce progress and plans to combat climate change. Businesses across all sectors are setting goals of zero net emissions, committing to 100% renewable energy, reducing water and waste impacts, and even addressing indirect emissions within their supply chains. But the movement goes well beyond these headlines—as the urgency of combating the climate crisis becomes clearer, businesses of all sizes are realizing the benefits of a climate action plan.

The importance of climate action at every level of society has become clear. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly created a collection of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), or the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, that provides a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.” It's essential that companies take steps to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to levels consistent with a 1.5° Celsius scenario of global warming.

Our energy advisory services experts have prepared this guide to help organizations blueprint a successful sustainablility strategy.
