Five reasons to switch to smart public lighting in cities
Climate factors and high costs are forcing change in public lighting in big cities and beyond. Public lighting must become smart in order to be as efficient and environmentally friendly as possible, but also for other reasons that we invite you to discover in this article.
Cities change as pressure mounts
Cities are in a constant state of flux, evolving right before our eyes. It is crucial that their transformation embraces
smart solutions
to confront the challenges of today. With
climate change
, the advancements in
renewable energy
, and the
ever-growing energy demands
, the structure of the world's megalopolises - the densely populated urban areas housing over 10 million people - is being reshaped. According to United Nations projections, nearly two-thirds of the global population will reside in these bustling metropolises by 2030. Given the pivotal role that cities play in our lives, it becomes even more vital to ensure that the
urban landscape is intelligently organized
to effectively cater to the diverse lifestyles and needs of contemporary individuals in every possible aspect.

Street lighting makes a difference
Smart street lighting
, also referred to as
adaptive lighting
, encompasses
intelligent solutions
that utilize
efficiency
,
remote control
, and
LED technology
. This innovative approach
responds to usage patterns
by adjusting the brightness of the lights when motion sensors detect no movement, and
intensifying the illumination
when activity is detected within the designated area. Furthermore, smart street lighting systems can be
customized
to adapt to road traffic conditions or
integrated
with
monitoring systems
that consider factors such as vehicle flow, weather conditions, and the natural light available.

Street lighting has become widespread and more effective, distinguishing modern metropolises from cities of the past prior to the 19th century. While today's public street lighting has significantly advanced from the oil lamps of Ancient Rome, a considerable portion of the current infrastructure relies on outdated technology.
Consequently, the result is subpar illumination, frequent malfunctions, environmental pollution, and inefficient energy usage. Lighting alone accounts for approximately 25% of energy expenditure in urban areas.

Smart street lighting saves energy and costs
Through the
replacement of outdated public lighting infrastructure
with
cutting-edge technology
, local governments can achieve significant
energy and cost savings
. Implementing a
high-performance street lighting system
tailored for
smart cities
allows for
efficient energy usage
by utilizing cameras and various sensors that enable
real-time management
and
control of public spaces.

The
new infrastructure
offers several advantages, including
swift identification of faults and errors
, proactively
preventing breakdowns
and
streamlining maintenance processes
. Additionally, it provides the
flexibility
to
integrate new features
as they emerge, leveraging the existing sensor network. A broader impact of
smart street lighting
is its contribution to the
entire city ecosystem
, encompassing the
safety of citizens and assets
,
enhanced mobility
,
effective building management
, and
improved energy efficiency
.

,
fostering collaboration at all levels
.

Architecture and art, displayed at their best
Smart lighting plays a crucial role in creating a harmonious perception of architecture and artworks within their surrounding spaces. Our dedication to this principle is evident in
over 1,500 projects we have undertaken worldwide
. These projects encompassed comprehensive restoration efforts for
architectural lighting
in renowned locations like the Pantheon in Rome, Italy, the ancient ruins of Pompeii, Italy, and the majestic Real Alcazar palace in Seville, Spain. Through these endeavors, we have showcased our commitment to enhancing the visual experience of iconic spaces through smart lighting design.

We offer comprehensive support throughout
every stage of a project
, regardless of its scale, providing services ranging
from design to financing
. Our expertise encompasses
construction
,
materials supply
,
installation
, and
maintenance
. With the ever-evolving urban landscape, Enel X presents a
comprehensive portfolio of solutions
, beginning with
lighting
. By doing so, we ensure that the
transformation process is intelligent
,
efficiently managed
,
sustainable
, and
delivers time
,
energy
, and
cost savings for each of our valued customers
.
