EV Batteries Start a Second Life at Airports in Rome

Sector
Aviation
Enel X focus on developing new technologies for li-ion solutions batteries and for their application.

When batteries reach the end of their ‘automotive’ life cycle, they still have a residual capacity of about 70-80% and can be applied for different usage after their initial lifecycle has come to an end. They can be used in stationary systems, in combination with renewable energy generation, such as wind and solar, and/or to supply services to the electricity network.

This case study is based on a project developed in Enel X Italy.
Customer information
Aeroporti di Roma (ADR)
Aeroporti di Roma (ADR) operates the Italian capital’s two airports, making it the leading air travel hub in the country. Fiumicino airport, also called Leonardo da Vinci International Airport – the larger of Rome’s two airports, with two passenger terminals that cater to international and intercontinental travelers – is the first and only airport in Italy to have been awarded a 5-star Skytrax rating for excellence standards in service quality. Ciampino airport is mainly used by low-cost airlines, express couriers, and for general aviation activities.

Sustainability is a key driver of ADR’s mission, a dedication recognized - among others - by the UN’s World Tourism Organization (WTO), which is 2020 recognized the airport operator for “Leadership in Sustainability and Commitment to Responsible Travel”.
The need
ADR has
embarked on a journey to attain net zero emissions by 2030
, ahead of the targets set by the European airport sector.

As part of its efforts to reach its sustainability goals, ADR requires an
energy efficiency solution
for its Fiumicino international hub that will
enable it to cut CO₂ emissions
.

The solution
Enel X supports ADR with two projects.

Create an innovative battery energy storage system using second-life EV batteries
Used EV batteries were combined to create an energy storage system with a
capacity of 10 MWh.
These second-life batteries store the excess energy produced by the solar plant. This project is named "Pioneer- airPort sustaInability secONd lifE battEry stoRage" and has been awarded a grant of more than 3 million euros from the Innovation Fund, the EU's climate innovation fund.
This is the first-of-its-kind project that
uses only second-life batteries
from
multiple car manufacturers.
Build self-consumption photovoltaic system
This system will be completed in 2024. Once the facility is fully operational, it will be the largest of its kind in Europe, comprising
approximately 55,000 solar panels
and covering a surface area of
340,000 square meters.
It will have a maximum capacity of
22 MWp
and produce
32 GWh of renewable electricity each year, eliminating 11,000 tons of CO₂ emissions annually
. This is equivalent to the amount absorbed annually by planting 100,000 trees.
By
integrating this system with a 10 MWh second life EV battery energy storage system
, the airport will store the excess energy produced by the solar plant and cover any evening energy demand peaks at the airport.
The benefits
Our projects have several benefits for ADR and society.

Reduce CO
２
Emission
Using electric vehicles reduces CO

emissions. CO
2
emissions can be further reduced by using the same batteries for other purposes.
Reduce Amount of  Waste
The use of second-life batteries is a crucial step in the battery production chain, before their actual end of life, where they are recycled to ensure those valuable materials are available again to produce new batteries, with a circular and sustainable production vision.
Social Contribution
Second-life batteries promote environmental, community, and business well-being and sustainability.
Promote Renewable Energy
Extending the life of batteries means increasing the amount of renewable energy on the grid.
Encourage Circular Economy
Recycling materials batteries contain at the end of their life is an effective application of the Circular Economy.
Accerelate Electric mobility
Having an intermediate step, or second life, between using them for electric mobility and recycling optimizes costs along the supply chain and makes electric cars cheaper to buy.

This pioneering project is added to the other important innovation activities we are carrying out within the framework of the European Commission's IPCEI calls for proposals to make the battery and electric vehicle supply chain increasingly sustainable, and once again confirms our commitment to combine innovation and sustainability.
