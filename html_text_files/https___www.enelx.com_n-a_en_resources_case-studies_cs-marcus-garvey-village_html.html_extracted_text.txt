Marcus Garvey Village Microgrid, NYC
The owners of Marcus Garvey Village, a 625-unit apartment complex in Brooklyn, NY, understand that the value of distributed energy resources extends beyond the confines of their buildings. As one of the most energy-intensive urban environments in the world, New York City faces a significant challenge maintaining reliable access to power during periods of high demand for electricity. An investment in distributed energy resources would not only improve the apartment complex’s access to independent power, but could contribute to efforts to bolster the grid in its community.
