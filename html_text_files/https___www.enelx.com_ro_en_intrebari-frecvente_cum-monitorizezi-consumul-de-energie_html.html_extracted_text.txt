FAQ
How to monitor energy consumption in your company?
Consumption monitoring is the first step to energy efficiency. Today, it can be achieved with an
Energy Management System
(EMS), a digital platform that allows medium - to large-companies to
gather
,
analyze
and
compare data on consumption of electricity
,
gas
, and
water
use across all their systems.

The software notifies the user when the level of consumption changes and can automatically suggest steps to take to optimize consumption. For this reason, an
EMS is a platform that helps a company or business achieve its energy efficiency goals
. An intelligent Energy Monitoring System can also
flag any faults in real time
, and indicate what
energy-saving measures
will solve the problem.

Moreover, it can provide Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as patterns relating to specific areas of energy consumption, intensity of energy usage and other indicators that can be of use in setting energy targets.

An
EMS
can be supported by other analytical tools that are useful to monitor energy consumption and improve efficiency, based on the most appropriate strategies.

We invite you to discover the
Enel X Energy Management System

digital solution
we offer to increase energy efficiency.

Other
analytical tools
are designed specifically to help companies fight climate change, but are useful for
energy monitoring
as well. A sustainability report informs stakeholders inside the company about concrete steps it is taking to reduce emissions, which usually includes energy efficiency.

Setting science-based targets to reach
Net Zero
nearly always include steps to cut energy waste and improve efficiency. Lastly, non profit organizations like the
Carbon Disclosure Project
dedicated to helping companies achieve their climate goals and energy efficiency can help with
info
and
technical expertise
.
