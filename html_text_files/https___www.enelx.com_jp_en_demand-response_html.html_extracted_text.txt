Why Enel X
What is Demand Response?
Demand Response was introduced in Japan as a new solution to stabilize the grid by adjusting "demand-side resources" rather than the supply-side of electricity. Organisations offer their capacity to support the electricity grid in exchange for regular payments. Businesses respond by powering down or switching to a backup power source to give their capacity back to the grid. They do this via our Virtual Power Plant (VPP) which has unmatched access to a range market programs.

Global experience
Enel X is a global Demand Response leader, present in 18 countries with 9.4 GW of flexible capacity managed.
Earn significant revenue
Earn a recurring new revenue stream that can offset electricity bills, or be reinvested in further sustainability initiatives.
Smart platform

Continuous assistance
Our Network Operations Center (NOC) is available 24-7-365, where all energy dispatches are actioned, managed and monitored in real time.

Capacity Market

Summer/Winter Reserves
The capacity market is a market where "future supply capacity (kW)" is traded, rather than the "quantity of electricity (kWh)" traded in the traditional wholesale electricity market.

How to participate:
Businesses generate or share their reserve electricity by either starting up their own generators or powering down or adjusting their production facilities for a few hours.
History:
Established in FY2020; starts in FY2024 (bidding in July 2020)
Procurement period:
Procurement four years in advance
Procurement organization:
Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators, Japan (OCCTO)
Procurement area:
Nationwide
Bidding method:
Single-price auction
Demand Response is called on when the system is facing a low reserve margin.

How to participate:
We give customers the opportunity to sell 'Negawatts' or excess power capacity on the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) and earn revenue.
History:
Enel X entered the market in December 2020
Procurement period:
