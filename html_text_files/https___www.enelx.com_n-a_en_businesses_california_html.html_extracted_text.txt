Opportunities for California’s Pace-Setting Clean-Energy Agenda
From San Francisco to San Diego, California represents a top-five world-economy with lots of sunshine, coastline, and clean-energy ambitions. Under Senate Bill 100 (SB 100)—a historic piece of legislation mandating 100% renewable energy by 2045—California’s goals will require innovation, commitment, and accountability.
Enel X offers California’s commercial and industrial (C&I) customers a broad portfolio of advanced energy solutions to not only comply with the demands of SB 100, but to thrive under them.

First, Enel X helps organizations tap the power of the sun with
solar-plus-storage
solutions subsidized under the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), reducing the cost of on-site renewable generation through lucrative rebates. Next,
demand response
programs in PG&E and Southern California Edison provide additional revenue streams for C&I organizations while supporting grid reliability and helping prevent blackouts. On top of that, Enel X energy advisors help businesses apply for competitive
retail supply
via the Direct Access program while helping integrate
renewables
into your supply mix.

Whether you are a commercial property owner, academic institution, hospital or manufacturer, Enel X has the insights, experience, and customer focus to unlock bill savings and new revenue-generating energy opportunities for your organization.
