We help cities have a sustainable transport
Smart cities get moving with electric public transport. As urban areas adopt more sustainable solutions, Enel X can become involved through substantial experience and investment in private electric mobility, providing zero-emission public transport solutions for local authorities.
Green buses and public charging stations
Collaboration between companies and local authorities is needed to promote the widespread adoption of electric mobility. To this end, Enel X has developed an action plan for public administrations. In the localities where we conclude an agreement with the local administration, we undertake to design the most suitable solution for the local conditions, then to make available the charging infrastructure, to install and maintain it, in accordance with the regulations of the institution. This service is completely free.

What does an Enel X complete solution entail?
In the packages for local administrations we offer the installation and activation of the infrastructure, the supply of electricity, the maintenance for 8 years, a dedicated call center and the possibility to locate the columns with the help of our application. In addition, we offer the possibility of personalization with the logo of the administration of public charging stations for electric cars.

Electric mobility monitoring
The integration of the electric public transport fleet and adjacent solutions in our digital system allows any institution to manage their consumption in an integrated way, through a portal accessible on the Enel X website.
