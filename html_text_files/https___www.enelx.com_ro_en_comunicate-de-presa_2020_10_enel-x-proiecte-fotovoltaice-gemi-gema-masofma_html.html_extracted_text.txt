, said Cosma Gheorghe, shareholder of Gemi, Gema and Masofma.
“Optimizing energy consumption is very important for a shopping and sports center, and the solution proposed by Enel X is one that suits our needs. At the same time, our customers are open to electric mobility, some of whom are already owners of electric vehicles, so we have also included solutions for charging these vehicles in our plan"
, George Țucudean, shareholder of Gemi, Gema and Masofma, added.

The system installed on the Gema Superb buildings in Sebiș (Arad County) will contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 114.2 tons/ year.
