CES 2020: The Future of Energy is Integrated
Climate change requires a holistic approach to energy. At CES, Enel X exhibited its energy solutions for transportation, businesses, cities, and more.
January 16, 2020
Our energy ecosystem is in dire need of modernization
As extreme weather and natural disasters such as wildfires rise in frequency, our resources – and the ways we deploy them – are increasingly strained.
At the same time, we’re making significant strides in driving toward a cleaner future in areas such as renewable energy and electric vehicles. While these changes are already bringing about positive impacts for the environment and the consumer, getting to a zero-carbon grid will require the accelerated deployment of more distributed energy solutions.

At Enel X, our attention is focused on taking a holistic, customized, and collaborative approach that integrates smart solutions to address our near-term challenges while building a more modern system in the years to come. If we’re going to impact climate change, we must look across all of our options, including renewables, battery storage, EVs powered with smart charging, and smarter energy management through tools such as demand response and efficiency, and recognize their interdependence as we seek a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

We are fresh off of the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and feeling inspired by the promise we saw on the showroom floor. From zero-impact cars to water recycling systems, CES demonstrated that innovative companies have the potential to impact global sustainability initiatives in a major way. As impactful as each of these solutions are independently, tackling climate change requires a holistic look at the way we create and consume energy. A holistic approach will ultimately lead to cost savings and a more stable energy supply by taking the entire ecosystem into consideration from the get-go.

CES predicts widespread EV adoption in the 2020s
The automotive pavilion at CES made apparent that the future of transportation is undoubtedly electric. Mercedes-Benz unveiled the Vision AVTR, a “zero impact car” powered by a battery composed without rare earths and metals, making it compostable and recyclable. Electric scooter company NIU presented their RQi electric motorcycle and the TQi three-wheeler covered scooter that aim to bring affordable electric motorcycles to the United States.

Electric vehicle adoption is on the rise. A
recent Enel X study
found that, after learning about the full range of electric vehicle benefits, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they plan to purchase an EV in the future. This is a sign of what’s to come: global sales are predicted to keep increasing, with
Bloomberg predicting 12 million forecasted EV sales for 2025
.

A critical component to widespread EV adoption is the reliability and accessibility of charging stations. Just last week, we launched our
next generation of smart charging solutions
in North America for residential, commercial, utility, and automotive customers. The product line builds off of our best-selling flagship charger, the JuiceBox 40, and will speed EV adoption and support the decarbonization of energy and transportation sectors by providing greater accessibility to smart charging. As more customers turn to EVs, Enel X is meeting the rising demand with technologies that helps communities reach ambitious clean energy goals more efficiently and cost-effectively.
