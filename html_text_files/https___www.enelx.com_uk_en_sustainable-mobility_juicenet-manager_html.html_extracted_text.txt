It is compatible with JuiceBox, JuicePole and JuicePump.

Charging sessions
The dashboard provides a summary of all the charges made in the public and private sectors, with detailed data on individual charge sessions. Apply filters and download customised reports for complete data management.

Driver
Select who has access to your service via the Driver page. From this page it is possible to order the corporate codes for the configuration and activation of Driver users on JuicePass, suspend them if needed and view a complete charge history.

Cards
The RFID card is the ideal tool for the management of your EV fleet. Each card can be purchased for operational use and managed on this page, or it can be associated with a specific Driver - the employee - who associates the card with their corporate code on JuicePass. Within the Cards area it is possible to activate, suspend or block RFID cards purchased.

Charging points
Each purchased JuiceBox, JuicePole and JuicePump can be configured on JuiceNet Manager for private charge, with constant monitoring of use and status.

Add and modify new offices beyond your main office location. Your Fleet Manager can also assign the charging infrastructures to a location and specify a local manager.
Coupons
Create coupons for free charging sessions to be distributed to your EV drivers or customers to increase the attractiveness of your business.

Load Optimisation
Our Load Optimisation software maximises vehicle charging within the power load available at your site by balancing the available power load across multiple charging stations.

Key benefits
Easy to manage
JuiceNet Manager’s smart platform allows you to manage your company’s EV fleet, monitor employee charging at company, public and home stations, manage Driver and Card users, check the status of owned charging points and request assistance.
