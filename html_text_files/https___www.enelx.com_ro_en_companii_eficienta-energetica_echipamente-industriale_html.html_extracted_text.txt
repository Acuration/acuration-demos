Industrial equipment for energy and efficiency resilience
UPS
PFC
Generators
Uninterruptible power sources (UPS) provide a
continual supply
when energy is suddenly interrupted. They become operational for providing protection to overvoltage and voltage disturbances and prevent the malfunction of the power supplied devices.

Power factor correction systems (PFC) are advanced solutions that help you increase the quality of the power supply. PFC brings direct savings, by
reducing the costs
due to the suboptimal consumption.

Electrical energy generators reduce the risks for your business, as they will provide the
backup power supply
.
