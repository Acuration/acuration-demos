”
We struggle for a cleaner air by the power of the example, the green energy having an instantaneous impact on the FOX products. We started with electric vehicles, continued with the energy of the PV cells and other investments will follow, with the same beneficial consequences on the users' health

Iulian Marinică,
CEO FOX COM SERV
Solution
Enel X Romania proposed the turn-key supply of an ON-GRID PV system by the installation of the following components
2,640 photovoltaic panel
s with poly-crystal type cells at ground level
432 photovoltaic panels
with poly-crystal cell installed on a sunshade type structure specifically designed for the parking lot

39 inverters
with rated power of 25 kW
prefabricated
metal structures
specifically designed for PV systems placed on the ground or in parking lots
SMA Smart Meter
monitoring system



The system was designed and sized for self-consumption considering that the customer becomes a prosumer that does not inflow any energy into the system. The equipment and technologies used by Enel X in the project have high performance and reliability, and are sourced from acknowledged producers on the global photovoltaic system market.
Benefits

Reduction of annual consumption

The project of Enel X Romania will help the company to decrease significantly its annual power consumption and also to prevent the emissions of glasshouse gases of about 391.13 tons per year. The photovoltaic panels system has a total installed capacity of 998.4 kWp

Reduction of costs

FOX COM SERV will manage to diminish its annual costs with the help of the green energy and will have a modern and sustainable technical basis for production.




Digitalization of processes

By using of the "eco-design" logic and architecture to find an ideal cost-benefit ratio, Enel X Romania supplies equipment and software applications specialized in the optimization and monitoring the proposed PV systems. Therefore, FOX benefits from the most advanced technologies to maximize the energy production and the performance, with a minimum impact on the environment.
”
The solution proposed by us result from some analyses which best answer the needs of the customers and consider the particularities of each company, so that we maximize the energy efficiency level those companies can reach. The complex project conducted together with FOX has brought, apart from the benefits reflected in the energy bill, the achievement of some sustainability objectives targeted by the company.
