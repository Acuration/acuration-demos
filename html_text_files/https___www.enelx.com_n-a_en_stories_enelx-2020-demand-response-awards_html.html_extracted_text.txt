Enel X’s 2020 Demand Response Awards Recognize Industry Leaders
February 16, 2021
In 2020, demand response programs were more crucial than ever in helping to ensure a stable, reliable grid. And during this unprecedented year, many businesses we work with went above and beyond in their demand response curtailment, making localized energy reduction contributions as a demand-side resource for the energy grid, and supporting sustainability and their local communities.

We’ve honored customers with awards for their performance—together, our 2020 award winners curtailed more than 1.5 gigawatts of energy demand when the grid needed it most. Our awards spanned markets across Alberta, California, Ontario, New York, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, New England, and Texas. Below, we highlight a few of our Sustainable Footprint Award winners.

Sustainable Footprint Award
The Sustainable Footprint Award honors customers’ commitment to grid stability and energy flexibility wherever they operate, as demonstrated by enrollment in six or more demand response programs throughout the US and Canada. Demand response not only helps grid reliability, it helps boost the grid’s sustainability by providing a renewable, cost-effective solution to peaks in energy demand. Recipients of the Sustainable Footprint Award include:

Altium Packaging
, one of the largest plastic container companies and suppliers of rigid plastic packaging in North America, supports demand response programs across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic, including New Jersey, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania, New England, California, Tennessee, Florida, and Ontario.

For almost 120 years,
Americold
has been the world’s largest publicly-traded REIT focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of temperature-controlled warehouses. In addition to being an integral component of the food supply chain, Americold supports local energy demand response programs in Tennessee, California, New England, Missouri, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and Virginia.
