Vestas signs agreement with Enel X to accelerate the electrification of its corporate fleet
Aarhus - Rome, December 15th, 2020
- Vestas Wind Systems A/S, a world leader in sustainable energy solutions, signed a partnership with Enel X, the Enel Group’s advanced energy services business line, to accelerate the electrification of its company fleet. Through the agreement, Enel X will be providing Vestas with the required charging infrastructure to electrify its corporate fleet across its most prominent service markets.
“This new agreement marks another fruitful step in the collaboration between Vestas and the Enel Group,
” said
Francesco Venturini
, CEO of Enel X
. “Enel X’s key role as a technology leader in the electric mobility sector keeps on boosting the e-Mobility Revolution, and will support Vestas on the journey towards its ambitious sustainability goals, as well as further promoting electric mobility as one of the true enablers of the zero-emission future towards which the two companies have been working together for a long time.”
“If we are to succeed with the energy transition across a global scale, industry leaders have a duty to implement the change we want to see,”
said
Anders Nielsen
, Chief Technology Officer at Vestas
. “One of our key goals at Vestas is to enable more sustainable energy systems by supporting the increased deployment of renewable energy beyond power and into the transport sector. By joining forces with Enel X, we can proudly demonstrate this process of deployment across our own global footprint, and help pave the way for a more sustainable future.”
Enel X
will provide Vestas with a cloud-based charging platform solution, and 370 charging stations. The charging stations will be comprised of JuiceBoxes, enabling mobile e-vehicle charging, and JuicePoles, enabling the charging of two vehicles at the same time through an RFI card or App. The charging network will support Vestas’ service and benefit car fleets across workplace locations in 15 of Vestas’ largest markets, spanning Europe and the Americas. The collaboration marks a key step in Vestas’ journey towards retiring conventional vehicles by 2025, and forms part of Vestas’ commitment to becoming carbon neutral, without the use of offsets by 2030, as part of its broader sustainability ambitions. Once the transition to electric vehicles is complete, Vestas anticipates more than one third of its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions to be displaced.
In addition, Vestas and Enel X have committed to leveraging their extensive resources as industry leaders in a joint effort to explore new innovations that will advance the energy transition. Both companies will begin an effort to identify opportunities to collaborate on developing innovations across e-mobility, grid integration and sector coupling.
