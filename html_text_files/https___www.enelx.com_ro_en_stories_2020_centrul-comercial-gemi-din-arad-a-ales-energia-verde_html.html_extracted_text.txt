Customer
Gemi Center
is a company with all Romanian private capital and the first shopping center ever opened in Arad.

Challenge
Increasing energy efficiency through investments in renewable energy technologies was essential for Gemi Center, out of the desire to become a sustainable and modern shopping center for its contractors and visitors.

The operator of the Gemi Center wants to have an efficient control of the annual energy consumption and envisaged implementing smart solutions for monitoring and optimizing this consumption with a view to keeping the building's energy performance at an optimal level.

With the aid of green energy, Gemi Center has become a sustainable company, that will significantly cut down its energy costs, while also reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.

BEGIN SIMULATION
”Energy consumption optimization is very important for a shopping and sports center, and the solution proposed by Enel X is one that meets our needs. At the same time, our customers are open to electric mobility, some of them already owning electric vehicles. For this reason, our plan included also solutions for charging these vehicles."

Cosma Gheorghe
,

General Manager of Gemi Center
Solution
Enel X proposed placement of a stand-alone photovoltaic system on the roof of the shopping center, connected to the general switchboard of the building, as well as installation of electrical infrastructure solutions and JuicePole charging stations for visitors that drive electric vehicles.

The
photovoltaic system
consists of:
318
high-efficiency Canadian Solar
photovoltaic panels
, with polycrystalline-type cells
1
power
inverter
of 100 kW – manufacturer ABB
Metal support structure
for ballast-mounting with concrete tiles on the roof
Communication and monitoring system



Each
JuicePole
electrical vehicle charging station:
can charge two vehicles at the same time (22 kW for each socket)
can be accessed via the JuicePass mobile application or a RFID card
is compatible with all available electric vehicles with self-locking type 2/type 3a sockets available in Europe.
The equipment and technologies used by Enel X in the project have high performance and reliability and are sourced from traditional producers on the global photovoltaic system market.
Benefits

Reduction of annuall consumption
The system installed by Enel on the Gemi Center building in Arad will contribute to the
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 48.6 tons/year
, it has an installed capacity of 103.35 KW.

Reduction of costs

Gemi Center will achieve a reduction in annual costs with the help of renewable energy, and, in the long run, will allow the center's contractors to reduce their energy bills, too.




Digitalization of processes

Applying the
"eco-design"
logic and architecture,

for both photovoltaic panels and the JuicePole charging stations, Enel X has available smart hardware and software to optimize and monitor the proposed systems with a view to obtaining the best possible architecture and maximizing the energy produced and performance.

These actions aim to find an ideal cost-benefit ratio for the Gemi Center, with the lowest possible impact on the environment.
”The investments made by the operator of Gemi Center of Arad show that increasingly more Romanian entrepreneurs are interested in clean energy, obtained from renewable sources both because of its reduced costs, and its sustainability."
