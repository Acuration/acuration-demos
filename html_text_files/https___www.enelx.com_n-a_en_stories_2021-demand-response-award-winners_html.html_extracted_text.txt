2021 Demand Response Award Winners
Find out more about organizations that went above and beyond in supporting their local energy grid with demand response.
March 4, 2022
Demand response only succeeds through the efforts of all the organizations that reduce energy use when needed. And in 2021, a year where demand response was crucial to keeping the energy grid reliable in regions across the US, many of our customers went above and beyond in their efforts.

With our annual Demand Response Awards, we look to recognize customers who made important contributions during demand response events in 2021, meeting and beating their energy reduction commitments to help to keep energy flowing for their local communities. Below we honor our first group of 2021 award winners—our full list of winners spans Alberta, California, Ontario, New York, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, New England, and Texas.

Sustainable Footprint Award Winner: Americold Logistics LLC
Americold is the world’s largest publicly-traded REIT focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of temperature-controlled warehouses. In addition to being an integral component of the food supply chain, Americold supports local energy demand response programs in Tennessee, California, New England, Missouri, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and Virginia. This is Americold’s second demand response award; they also won a Sustainability Footprint award for their work in 2020.

Sustainable Footprint Award Winner: US Foods
US Foods is one of America’s great food companies and a leading foodservice distributor, partnering with approximately 300,000 restaurants and foodservice operators to help their businesses succeed.

From office to retail, logistics to multifamily, and hospitality to development, they work across sectors to bring high-quality, sustainable real estate to life around the globe every day.
