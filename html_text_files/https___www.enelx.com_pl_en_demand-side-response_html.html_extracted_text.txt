Why choose Enel X?
What is it?
Demand Side Response (DSR) is the temporary reduction of electricity demand by energy users to support the electricity system. DSR programs offer remuneration to companies that reduce their power consumption from the grid at the request of the system operator during critical power supply shortages. Such calls are very rare and have practically no impact on the core business of companies. Companies, which will choose co-operation with Enel X, can guarantee themselves stable, long-term revenues up to 2026.

The program is open to all enterprises with at least several hundred kW of connected power and which can, for a short time:
Shift the power consumption to other hours
Temporary reduce power consumption
Switch to a back-up generation source or energy storage

There are many ways to reduce / shift the power consumption and we present only examples below:
Switch off some appliances or lighting
Adaptation of production processes to periods of demand for power reduction
Changing the set points and operation schedules of HVAC installations, pumps, industrial freezers and compressors
Starting reserve aggregates or changing the cogeneration work schedule
Customers operating in almost every industry can benefit from participation in the DSR program if they can temporarily reduce power consumption. The programs are intended for both large and medium-sized recipients, including:
cement plants
steel mills
chemical plants
food processing plants - food processing
cold stores
water and sewage companies
recycling companies
packaging producers
hospitals
...and many others.
There
are many benefits to participating in a DSR program:
Remuneration for readiness to reduce energy demand
Reduction in electricity costs due to planned energy purchases and consumption
Advanced notification of energy supply threats allowing time to protect company processes and equipment
Contribute to the security of the country’s power grid. Program participants are authorised to use the ‘I Support Poland's Energy Security’ logo established by PSE
Earn additional points towards multi-criteria LEED and BREEAM building certifications

The amount of remuneration depends on your company's power reduction potential and the DSR program you choose. For the readiness to reduce some of the power consumption, a company can earn up to PLN 200,000 per year for 1 MW of power.

Program participation is limited and must comply with regulatory deadlines. Please contact us as soon as possible to receive a recommendation for the optimal strategy for your business.

Why choose Enel X?
Minimize your risk
Power grid operators cannot be so flexible about the recipients' capabilities and therefore, as a rule, recipients participate in DSR programs through aggregators like Enel X. We help companies throughout the entire process, assuming a large part of the risk associated with participation, including protection against fines for failing to participate in energy reduction when needed. Enel X provides some flexibility for companies to change the level of liabilities to given calendar periods or all
