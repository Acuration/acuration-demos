Interruptible Load Program
Earn a significant new revenue stream while supporting Singapore’s most affordable path to decarbonization
Interruptible Load Program
How does it work?
Demand Response
Why Enel X
What is the Interruptible Load program?
Singapore’s Demand Response program is called Interruptible Load (IL), and was introduced by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to allow Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) to offer Demand Response to the market. We help businesses earn a new revenue stream by offering their load flexibility to the power grid. Participate and you can reduce your cost of energy while providing important support to Singapore’s decarbonisation plans.
Support the grid
Protect the grid in case of generation outages by being flexible with energy use.
Reduce energy demand
Temporarily reduce onsite power usage or switch to a backup power source in response to a grid need.
Participation is flexible
You can opt-in and opt-out of participation at any time to suit your operational needs.
Earn regular payments
Earn a recurring new revenue stream by being on standby to respond.
How does it work?
1
Grid need
Grid need
The IL program is designed to arrest a fall in the power grid's frequency and to restore it to within its normal operating range. This can happen if there is an outage or trip of a power generation facility, or in the rare case of a transmission outage. EMA then notifies the aggregator of the need for dispatchable capacity to support the system.

Enel X’s VPP is called on. We aggregate our customers' energy load or distributed energy assets made up of onsite equipment, backup generation assets, and BESS across businesses in Singapore. We offer our portfolio’s capacity to help keep the lights on.

Customer responds
Customer responds
Customers across Singapore either switch to backup power sources (BESS, backup generation) or reduce or modify energy usage when called on. This makes their power flexibility available to the grid operator, by implementing power reduction plans (manually or automatically). The load reduction is used by the network operator to restore the demand and supply imbalance in the system.

Earn regular payments
Earn regular payments
Customers receive regular payments for both their availability to provide the service, and for when their power is provided to support the grid.

Advance Singapore's renewable future
Advance Singapore's renewable future
DR provides additional, dispatchable capacity to support the grid. This new capacity is essential to supporting the renewable energy transition, because dispatchable resources help to integrate variable renewable energy sources onto the grid.
Why Demand Response?
Demand Response is increasingly valuable
With the increase of renewable energy and as large nuclear power units retire, IL will strengthen the resilience of the grid, and its value and importance will continue to increase over time.
The IL Program is bankable
IL is a permanent fixture of day ahead energy market, meaning businesses can count on an ability to participate and to earn ongoing, significant revenue from capacity payments for being available to support the grid.
The program is low risk with Enel X
Enel X makes participation easy for businesses by removing financial and technical barriers.  Customers bear no cost to become fully enabled in our VPP.
Participation can be flexible
While Demand Response is valuable, your core operations come first. When done properly, your participation in IL can be designed around your operational priorities. At Enel X, we first seek to understand your operations, and then to design a plan which will maximise your earnings subject to your operational limits.
Our offering
We extract businesses the most value from Demand Response, by selling it against utility assets in the energy markets.

While valuable, the IL program requires dedicated expertise. Requirements include: licensing, training and 24/7 operator availability, dedicated data connections and platform integration, market bidding and dispatch procedures, and detailed performance measurement and compliance rules.

The market is evolving with more products expected to launch in future, so businesses need an experienced VPP and platform solution provider to adjust to market changes without facing financial risks. We offer a turnkey service that manages all aspects of Demand Response participation.

Our market-leading and comprehensive service offering includes:
Technical and operational DR evaluation
Revenue planning and business case
Metering and controls (at our expense)
Connection to our VPP platform
24/7 Network Operations Center bidding and dispatch management
Trading and co-optimisation of DR value
