Eligible beneficiaries and amounts
The program on boosting energy efficiency and smart energy management in public lighting infrastructure was pioneered by the Administration of the Environment Fund (AFM) for a purpose that guides us at Enel X: more energy efficient public lighting systems.
The competition aims for more and more administrative-territorial units to use LED products with a high level of energy efficiency, as are our innovative products. Once more and more communes, towns and municipalities will streamline their public lighting network, air quality will improve, following the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
Do you want to modernize the public lighting infrastructure, replacing the classic lighting fixtures with
state-of-the-art lighting fixtures with LED technology
and
take control of the light flow through a remote management program
? Apply to the Public Lighting Program with Enel X! We will facilitate the transformation of your locality through business-ready solutions based on progressive technology.
With Enel X, your project has the best chances of success, because our synergic solutions support the eligibility of the project, as defined by AFM, for example:
You will demonstrate a
minimum energy saving of 25%
, given that our LED products have a much higher efficiency
You will become the user of a
dimming/remote management system
or, as we call it, a remote-control technology, through which you will be able to adjust the brightness of the entire infrastructure
The program budget is worth
500 ml. lei
and the applications through the app can reach up to 150% of the total program budget.
The enrollment period starts on 19.08.2022 and ends when the threshold of
150% of the program budget
is reached.
The AFM program, which supports the local public administration to finance the transformation of the public street, road and pedestrian lighting system, has among the eligible expenses:
the
design and technical assistance costs
the
consultancy
costs
from the main investment - the purchase and installation of
LED lighting devices and network connection accessories, public lighting poles, electric lighting network and accessories
from the main investment - purchase and installation of the
digital dimming / remote management platform
, through which the luminous flux of any point in the smart public lighting infrastructure can be adjusted
Enel X will be in almost every stage of your financing, from the design of the project eligible for the AFM Public Lighting program to its implementation. You will have as a strategic partner a technology leader, which will contribute to the success of your project in the community: energy efficient quality street light, which contributes to the safety of residents with
minimal costs for the budget and environment
.
