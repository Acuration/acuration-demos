South Australian Backup Boost Program
We've partnered with the South Australian government to support local businesses by changing the way they use energy

Enel X is building a 20 MW portfolio of dispatchable capacity in South Australia with $2 million in funding support from the South Australian government. The program supports backup generator upgrades and the installation of battery energy storage systems (BESS) across a number of South Australian businesses to help unlock the potential for cheaper, more reliable electricity.

The program will connect businesses’ backup generators and BESS to support grid stability by participating in Enel X’s
demand response programs
and being part of our Virtual Power Plant (VPP). It’s designed to deliver more affordable and reliable electricity to South Australian households and small to medium businesses.

The works are being partially funded by the South Australian government’s Backup Boost grant, with no requirement to repay, accelerating sites’ entry into the market. The remaining costs are recovered from revenue generated from participating in our VPP.

To learn whether your business qualifies,
get in touch
with our team.
Enabling businesses to supply the electricity market will give them a new revenue stream and deliver lower prices for everyone else. It is commonsense to make use of resources that are currently under-utilised for the benefit of  both the owners of the assets and the wider community.
Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP
Minister for Energy and Mining, South Australia
