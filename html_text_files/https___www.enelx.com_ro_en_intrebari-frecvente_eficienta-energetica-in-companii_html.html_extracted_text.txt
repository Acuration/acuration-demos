FAQ
How to improve energy efficiency for your company?
We are increasingly concerned about
reducing energy costs
and about climate change, which is why
energy efficiency
is more important than ever for companies.. Fortunately, today there are
many ways to improve energy efficiency
. Achieving this
objective
requires an
initial investment of money
and
effort
, but the long-term cost savings will repay the outlay over the years. Here are the measures that can make your company energy efficient!

Energy audit
The
first step
to
improve energy efficiency
is an
energy audit
. Like a financial audit, an energy audit
looks at energy consumption levels
and
how this can be optimized
. The audit starts with a diagnosis, or an analysis phase, to obtain an overall assessment of things like peak loads, leaks, energy-sucking equipment and inefficient lighting. On the basis of the audit, heating and electricity systems can be tweaked for efficiency and then monitored going forward.

Energy audit
The energy diagnosis shows how the company consumes energy.

Adopt more efficient equipment
Many countries now apply „energy class” labels to appliances and equipment, making it easy to upgrade older less efficient equipment.

Using
laptop computers
and
LED lights
at work are other examples of ways
equipment can increase energy efficiency
.
Smart choices
Smart thermostats and lighting that self-regulate according to building occupancy eliminate waste.
Smart devices
also make it easy to
monitor consumption in real time
, helping a business better understand how, where and when it consumes the most.

Employee engagement
Any effective
energy efficiency plan
works better with buy-in from
staff
.
Getting them engaged
in every day actions, like setting thermostats lower in winter and higher in summer is key, it is essential.

Renewable energy sources
The
solar panels
can be combined with Energy Management System (EMS) software that make them more efficient. Once the installation costs are recouped, renewable energy results in savings, and contributes to achieving climate change goals.

Buildings more efficient through insulation
Temperature control is one of the largest energy expenditures, so energy efficiency starts with reducing heat or cooling losses. Weather-proofing an office or factory is fundamental to achieving energy efficiency.
