JuiceNet Manager
Manage and control your JuiceBox via our web dashboard JuiceNet Manager. It provides full access to all data on your charging stations, charging sessions and users.

Authorise user access to specific charging stations with the JuicePass app.
Activate and deactivate RFID cards (for carpooling and rental) directly from the dashboard.
Load Optimisation software maximizes vehicle charging within the power load available at your site by balancing the available load across multiple charging stations.
JuiceNet Enterprise
Power your JuiceBoxes with JuiceNet Enterprise. It is the turnkey solution to open your private network to all public users, create and manage the pricing scheme for the charging sessions, and gather information on your energy consumption through data management and reporting.
Invite drivers to use your private network, via the JuicePass app. Easily manage roles and permissions.
Set your charging station(s) as “public” or “private” and define the price for final users.
Sustainability
JuiceBox Plus and JuiceBox Pro are designed to fit our vision for sustainability.

With a 100% recycled case, the JuiceBox can be recycled at the end of its useful life. In 2020, 60 tons of plastic waste were used to manufacture 30,000 JuiceBoxes.

JuiceBox’s Pro’s ability to adapt its output to the available power on the meter makes more efficient use of energy and improves energy capacity for the grid.

Features like these are part of the Enel X Circular Economy Boosting Program, a company-wide approach to assess and increase both the level of circularity in our solutions portfolio and our clients’ Circular Economy maturity. The Boosting Program identifies new technologies, business models and innovations that can be applied and integrated within portfolios, projects and processes.
