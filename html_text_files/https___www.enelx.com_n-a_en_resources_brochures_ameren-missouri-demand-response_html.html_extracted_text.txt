What can I expect during a dispatch?
Notification:
When Ameren Missouri anticipates the need for support, it dispatches the Enel X network into action. Enel X will notify you via email, phone or SMS, depending on your preferences, informing you when the dispatch will begin.
Response:
At the start of the dispatch, your facility will reduce its electricity usage according to your predetermined Energy Reduction Plan—either manually, or automatically through the NOC.
Support:
Before, during and after a dispatch, the NOC remains in communication with your facility. Our staff is available 24x7x365, supporting you to ensure that you achieve the highest possible levels of performance and payments.
