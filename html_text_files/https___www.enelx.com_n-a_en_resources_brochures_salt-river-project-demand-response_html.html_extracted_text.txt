Enel X and Salt River Project’s Business Demand Response Program
Enel X and Salt River Project are partnering to offer commercial, institutional, and industrial organizations incentive payments for participating in a program to maintain a reliable and cost-effective electric grid. In this program, large energy consumers can earn payments for making targeted energy reductions during periods of peak demand. Enel X, the world leader in demand response programs, connects large energy consumers to these payments and ensures that they are able to maximize their payments while keeping disruption within their facilities to a minimum.

Program FAQs

What is demand response?
What is demand response?
Demand response programs provide an opportunity for commercial, institutional, and industrial organizations to earn incentive payments while helping maintain reliable electricity. When the demand for electricity approaches critical peak levels, utilities and grid operators dispatch Enel X’s demand response network, which is made up
of local organizations that have agreed to reduce energy usage during times of high demand. Program participants earn payments for agreeing to be on standby and for curtailing electricity consumption in response to high electricity demand.

In addition to the payments, demand response participants also receive advanced notification of grid stability issues, enabling them to proactively protect their facilities from potential power outages.

How do I participate?
How do I participate?
Enel X makes participation easy. We take care of the complex details so you can stay focused on running your business.

1.
Our expert team will work with you to identify your energy reduction potential and create a strategy that delivers maximum value with minimum impact to your operations. We outline these measures ina detailed Energy Reduction Plan.
2.
In some cases, we install necessary metering devices at your facility to establish communication with our Network Operations Center (NOC), so we can monitor your energy consumption levels in real-time.
3.
Your site is then enrolled and ready to respond whena dispatch begins. Provided your site has Enel X metering, log into
apps.enelx.com
at any time duringa dispatch to view your performance in real-time. While it is expected that all dispatches will take place during the specified Program Period, there is a chance of dispatch outside of that period if SRP encounters severe capacity constraints. Should this type of dispatch occur, it would not impact your payments.
4.
Throughout the process, we fully manage enroll- ment, measurement, verification and payments on your behalf.

What can I expect during a dispatch?
What can I expect during a dispatch?
Notification:
When SRP anticipates high demand on the grid, it dispatches the Enel X network into action. Enel X will notify you via email, phone or SMS, depending on your preferences, to inform you when the dispatch will begin.

Response:
At the start of the dispatch, your facilitywill reduce its electricity usage according to your predetermined Energy Reduction Plan—either manually, or if requested, automatically through the NOC.

Support:
Before, during, and after a dispatch, our NOC remains in communication with your facility. Our staff is available 24x7x365, supporting you to ensure that you achieve the highest possible levels of performance and payments.

What types of reductions can I make?
What types of reductions can I make?
Enel X has extensive experience creating energy reduction strategies that work within the operational limitations ofa wide variety of facilities, including cold storage, manufac- turing, food processing, universities, malls, office buildings and more. We can also help to implement full control systems that allow your electric load to be toggled remotely.
Common reduction examples include:
Reduce non-essential lighting
Modify manufacturing processes
Adjust HVAC equipment
Dial back pumps
Change settings in industrial freezers

Customers often facilitate dispatch participation by simply shifting many of their energy-intensive processes by a few hours. Ask us about our experience working with customers like you.
