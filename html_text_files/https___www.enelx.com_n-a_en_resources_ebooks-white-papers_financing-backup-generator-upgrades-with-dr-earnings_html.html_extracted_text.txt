Financing Backup Generator Upgrades with Demand Response Earnings
How Organizations Are Using the Promise of Demand Response Payments to Finance Equipment Upgrades
Today, many large C&I energy users are partnering with DR providers to finance and implement equipment upgrades to meet compliance standards for participation in DR, increase their DR earnings potential, and improve their generators’ overall performance and capabilities. The future DR payments provide a reliable source of revenue to finance the upfront hardware and installation costs, thereby eliminating the need for the energy consumer to make a capital investment.

This whitepaper will explain the history behind these kinds of agreements and walk through sample projects to explain how the economics work for all parties involved.
