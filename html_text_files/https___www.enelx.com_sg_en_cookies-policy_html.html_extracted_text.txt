2.3.5.
Social Plugin
: the Site contains
social network
plug-ins (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, etc.). By accessing a page of the Site containing a similar plug-in, the internet browser connects directly to the
social network
servers and the plug-in is displayed on the screen thanks to the connection with the browser.
Even if the user is not registered with
social networks
, the sites with active
social plug-ins
can send data to the
networks
. Each access to the Site will set a cookie with a code through an active plug-in. Considering that the user's browser, upon each connection with a
network
server, sends this cookie without a request, the
network
could create a profile that recalls websites the user has visited. In this case, it is possible to link the encoding to a person, for example when the user connects to the
social network
.
