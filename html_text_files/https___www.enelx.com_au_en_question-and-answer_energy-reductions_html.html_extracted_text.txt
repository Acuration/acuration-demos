FAQ
What types of energy reductions can I make?
Enel X has extensive experience creating energy reduction strategies that work within the operational limitations of a wide variety of facilities. This includes cold storage, manufacturing, food processing, data centers and technology companies, universities, shopping centres, office buildings and more. Common reduction examples include:
Switching from electricity grid usage to onsite generation (BESS or backup generator)
Modifying manufacturing processes
Adjusting HVAC equipment
Turning down pumps
Changing settings in industrial freezers
Reducing non-essential lighting

Any type of energy reduction is done in a way that has minimal or no impact on your business operations, and is agreed to in close consultation with you.

Customers often facilitate dispatch participation by simply shifting their energy-intensive processes for a period of time. Depending on what programs you are enrolled in, the response time can range from 10 minutes to a few hours.
