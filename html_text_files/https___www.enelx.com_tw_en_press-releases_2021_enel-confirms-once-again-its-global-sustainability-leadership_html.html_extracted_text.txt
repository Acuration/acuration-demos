Enel confirms once again its global sustainability leadership with inclusion in Dow Jones Sustainability Index
Rome, November 13
th
, 2021
– Enel, our parent company, has been confirmed in the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) for the eighteenth year in a row with a total score of 88 across the economic, environmental and social dimensions used to assess the companies, through the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment.

Enel is one of seven electric utility companies listed in the DJSI World and its Spanish subsidiary Endesa has also been included. In addition, the Group’s South American subsidiary, Enel Américas, has been confirmed in the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index and Dow Jones Sustainability MILA
[1]
Pacific Alliance Index, as well as in the Dow Jones Sustainability Chile Index, while Enel’s Chilean subsidiary Enel Chile has been confirmed in the three indices.

Francesco Starace
, Enel Group CEO and General Manager said “
Our inclusion in the DJSI for the eighteenth straight year is a reflection of our continued focus towards developing a sustainable business model, leading the energy transition and promoting responsible business practices, therefore maximizing shared value for all our stakeholders. We indeed look at sustainability as a journey into the continuous enhancement of our business models, products, services and our entire company, always aiming to be in harmony with our stakeholders, the environment and society as a whole
.”

Launched in 1999, the DJSI is today one of the main global indexes tracking the performance of companies leading the way on sustainability worldwide. DJSI recognized Enel’s proactive role in taking on climate change and promoting a low-carbon energy model. Enel also excelled in other criteria focused on assessing responsible business management practices such as risk and crisis management, water related risks, human rights, human capital development and stakeholder engagement. Finally, the index acknowledged Enel’s commitment to promoting transparency on social and environmental performance.

Enel’s global sustainability leadership is acknowledged through its presence in several other renowned sustainability indices as well as rankings, such as the MSCI ESG Leaders Indices, CDP Climate “A” List, the Euronext Vigeo-Eiris 120 indices, the MIB ESG Index, the FTSE4Good Index series, the STOXX Global ESG Leaders index, the ISS “Prime” rating, the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, the Refinitiv TOP 100 Diversity and Inclusion Index, the Equileap's Top 100 Gender Equality Global Ranking and the ECPI indices.

Enel’s sustainability leadership, acknowledged by these indices, is increasingly attracting the attention of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investors, whose stake in the company is steadily growing, representing about 14.6% of the Group’s share capital in 2020, more than double compared to 2014 levels. This increase reflects the growing importance the financial market gives to non-financial elements in the creation of long-term sustainable value.

The Group’s long track record of inclusion in the world’s leading sustainability indices is also supported by its commitment to promote sustainable business practices across the over 30 countries and 4 continents in which it operates, implementing a creating shared value approach to build solutions to tackle major global challenges, such as climate change or access to sustainable energy, and create value for the Group and its stakeholders.  Specific examples of how Enel is boosting sustainability in the countries where it operates can be found at the following link:
