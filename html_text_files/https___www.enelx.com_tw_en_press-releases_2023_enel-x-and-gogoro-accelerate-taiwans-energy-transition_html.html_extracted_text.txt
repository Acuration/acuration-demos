Enel X and Gogoro accelerate Taiwan's energy transition with integration of Virtual Power Plant and 2,500 battery swapping stations
The first commercial deployment of this technology in the world, the companies have deployed nearly 1,300 GoStations for Virtual Power Plant (VPP) participation this month, and plan to activate more than 1,200 additional GoStations by mid-2023.
Gogoro’s participation in Enel X’s Taiwan VPP includes the dynamic pausing of Gogoro Network energy grid usage as well as sending energy to the grid as needed.

Taipei, April 19, 2023 –
Gogoro Inc. (Nasdaq: GGR), a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities, and Enel X, a global leader in innovative energy services, such as Virtual Power Plants (VPP), today announced the commercial deployment of 2,500 Gogoro battery swapping stations across 1,000 locations in Enel X’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) to support Taiwan’s renewable energy transition. The rollout follows the completion of a successful pilot program in 2022 and is the first commercial deployment of this technology in the world.

“
We are entering a new era of smart energy infrastructure, and by integrating the Gogoro Network with the Enel X Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in Taiwan we are providing a new energy resource. It is the first time this technology has been deployed this way in the world, and it creates a new Gogoro revenue stream beyond mobility,
” said
Horace Luke, founder, and CEO of Gogoro
. “
We have always believed that time-shifting energy was key to enabling the sustainable transformation of energy and transportation, and Gogoro continues to be a key part of these advancements. Together, the Gogoro community is contributing to Taiwan’s net-zero targets by helping to integrate more variable power generation resources onto the grid. Today, when the energy grid begins to max out, we can dynamically pause our energy usage or provide energy back to the grid while continuing to operate our battery swapping service independently as needed.
”

In 2022, Gogoro and Enel X’s VPP pilot in Taiwan demonstrated that the Gogoro Network could safely pause charging if there was a grid imbalance or provide energy back to the grid as demand required. Once the demand subsided, Enel X’s VPP sent a signal to the Gogoro Network to safely restore grid consumption. The Gogoro Network performed these services without causing any interruptions to Gogoro Network battery swapping customers, demonstrating that the network is an ideal resource to support Taiwan’s energy transition. Integrating Gogoro Network battery swapping energy into the Enel X VPP in Taiwan has the same effect as bringing new energy generation online to meet energy demand.

The companies have deployed nearly 1,300 GoStations across more than 500 locations this month and plan to deploy more than 2,500 GoStations in total across 1,000 locations by mid-2023 to support grid efficiency and stability.

“The commercial expansion of the Gogoro and Enel X pilot program to more than 1,000 battery swapping locations highlights a significant step in our ancillary service to increase energy use efficiency. It is also an essential element in the development of large uptakes of renewable energy in the global electricity industry and a positive demonstration of how businesses like Gogoro can proactively participate in Taiwan’s energy market at scale,
”
said president of Taiwan Power Company (TPC), Yao-Ting Wang.
“
Enel X’s VPP aggregates Gogoro’s battery swapping energy load to contribute to TPC’s Energy Trading Platform for ancillary service. Our Energy Trading Platform allows organizations like Gogoro to be active contributors of energy in Taiwan and we encourage more businesses to participate through professional aggregators like Enel X, to work together towards Taiwan’s renewable energy future.
”

"
Our work with Gogoro showcases the vital role that VPPs will play in the transition to renewable energy.  As new distributed resources are built to electrify and decarbonize our energy use, VPPs will unlock greater sustainability impacts and improved financial returns by connecting these assets to the broader energy system. Our platform does this by aggregating thousands of these 'new energy’ assets into a resource that can help balance the intermittency of large-scale renewable power stations. We believe our work with Gogoro is a world-leading demonstration of what VPPs can do, and we are honored and excited to continue growing our collaboration with them
”, said
Jeff Renaud, Head of Enel X Asia and Oceania
