—PRODUCT MANAGER
As an intern here at Enel X, I feel like a valued member of the team and that my opinion matters. It’s great to work for a company where everyone is passionate about what they do and there is a truly collaborative environment."

—INTERN
I care where I work and who I work with because this is where I spend most of my time. I choose to work at Enel X because of the people, culture and company. There are many places to work in Boston and a lot of them have cool offices, free food, etc., but not all of them believe in trying to make the world a better place. Do good, feel good. Now that's a motto!"

—SOFTWARE ENGINEER
Enel X is full of incredibly bright, driven employees who are passionate about their work. Our mission to change the way the world uses energy, backed by our disruptive technology and passionate employees, makes Enel X a great place to work. The combination of work-life balance, excellent benefits, a team-oriented environment, and a mission-driven culture drives Enel X to the top of my list of best places I've worked at."
