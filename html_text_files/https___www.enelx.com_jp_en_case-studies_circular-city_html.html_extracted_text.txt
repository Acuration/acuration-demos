This case study is based on a project developed in Enel X Italy.

Open Data is data that can be freely accessed by anyone. Enel X is committed to transforming this data into valuable information that can be used to build a circular city, rather than just information.

As part of this effort, Enel X has launched a new initiative in Italy to
provide useful indicators
to support the sustainable evolution of cities from data. The indicators,
calculated from Open Data
collected from public sources and scientifically validated to ensure maximum coverage and consistency across all Italian municipalities, are an
effective tool for municipalities to plan urban development
based on objective information on infrastructure, mobility, and services.

We have also developed
City Analytics, a platform for municipalities
that integrates and analyzes a vast amount of information (all fully compliant with privacy laws), including not only Open Data, but also connected devices, installed Enel X solutions, and other Big Data.

Using City Analytics, we partnered with HERE Technologies, a digital mapping company, to create Mobility Maps, which were made available free of charge to citizens in
Spain, Italy, and Brazil
during the
Covid-19 pandemic
and the
recovery phase from the pandemic.
Free + high transparency
Based on Open Data, provided free of charge
For all municipalities
To all public administrations regardless of size

City Analytics
City Analytics is a platform that provides
highly accurate information on issues related to the movement of people and vehicles
in targeted urban areas. It means that the public administration as well as private companies have the information they need to make the right decisions about public transportation routes, how to accommodate tourists, and how to install infrastructure in the right places for the number of people who want to use it at a particular time. They can
identify the causes of traffic jams, take measures to create a smooth traffic flow, and predict future behavior.

An example of how City Analytics was effectively used at the e-Prix in Rome's EUR district was as a means to monitor the number of visitors and the flow of traffic into a particular area, analyze the number of visitors, and estimate where the crowds were coming from. Having
visibility into where race spectators came from and how they traveled
enabled the city to provide services based on actual demand, organize public transportation more efficiently, and ensure crowd safety.
Mobility Map
City Analytics shone during the pandemic when we used the data to create a dashboard
showing the way people’s movements varied in national, regional and municipal areas
. The
City Analytics Covid-19 – Mobility Map
was based on analysis of anonymized and aggregated data from vehicles, maps and navigation systems, and was
free to access for citizens
wanting to see the effects of the travel containment and social distancing measures adopted in response to the emergency.

We are honored to provid the country with an effective solution for evaluating developments in mobility flows across the country, which can be used to plan the recovery phase.
