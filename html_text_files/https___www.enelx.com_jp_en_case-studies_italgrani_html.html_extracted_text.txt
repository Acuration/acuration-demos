Semolina and durum flour miller
Customer information
This Italgrani USA case study is based on a project developed in Enel X North America.

Italgrani USA
Italgrani USA is the largest semolina and durum flour miller in North America—the company buys durum wheat from across the continent and brings it to St. Louis, where it’s milled to produce semolina flour, an ingredient in high-quality pasta.” The company also operates grain elevator services in North Dakota and full-service grain merchandising in Minnesota.
The need
Italgrani USA is the largest semolina and durum flour miller in North America—the company buys durum wheat from across the continent and brings it to St. Louis, where it’s milled to produce semolina flour, an ingredient in high-quality pasta. As James Meyer, the president of Italgrani USA, notes, “If you enjoy pasta, we have customers that are providing you pasta in whatever form or setting you’re eating it—from frozen meals to food service.”

Italgrani USA recently began a
serious effort to take action on environmental, social and governance (commonly referred to as ESG) issues.
They quickly realized that
Demand Response would fit in well
with this new effort.
The solution
The Demand Response (DR) program provides payments to large energy users who agree to reduce their energy demand duringgrid stress. The payments are a benefit, Meyer said, but the potential ESG benefits were what really stood out to the company.

The benefits
More aware and more focused
Meyer said “being part of the Enel X program makes us more aware and more focused. You could say proceeds from Enel X made that opportunity to make this investment in this new program.”

Reinvesting DR earnings for more ESG initiatives
The money that they’ve earned from the program, Meyer said, has been helpful, and that extra revenue has in some ways indirectly allowed them to pursue other ESG initiatives. The business has installed automatic lights throughout their campus to minimize wasted electric use, and they’ve also created a new program to recycle food material that is left over after deliveries.
“A lot of our product is shipped in rail cars, and when an empty rail car comes back to the facility, there may be residual product at the bottom of the car,” Meyer said. “We have to remove that material, and previously it would go to a landfill. Now, we recycle that material. It’s been part of our ESG initiatives.”

Minimal disruption to operations while participating Demand Response
The program, Meyer said, has not been a major disruptor to normal operations, because the company is typically aware of when an event is a possibility.
“One of the keys has been advance notice,” Meyer said. “And we’re also completely aware that demand on the grid will be highest when temperatures are highest, so we can to an extent anticipate when we might get the call about an upcoming event. It’s typically a few hours during a weekday, and we can handle that.”
Note: In Japan, Enel X supports global and local customers to help them to save on energy costs, earn a new revenue stream and achieve carbon neutral targets with customized products and services.
