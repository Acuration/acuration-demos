Hybrid Power Purchase Agreement
For Solar + Storage Projects
The simplicity of a traditional PPA for solar with the flexibility of a benefit share agreement for storage
The Value of Solar + Storage
Installing solar PV lowers your energy bill by reducing your usage of grid power. You can avoid expensive utility rates when the sun is shining by consuming lower-cost, renewable onsite solar energy. Battery storage adds flexibility to your energy consumption via load shifting. Being able to strategically deploy stored energy lowers peak demand charges, unlocks grid incentives, and enables increased participation in demand response programs.

Why the Hybrid Power Purchase Agreement (hPPA)?
The hPPA combines Enel’s best-in-class storage offering with the design and construction experience of Enel X’s industry leading solar partners, providing an integrated system at no upfront cost to you. The entire project is managed from start to finish by Enel X using advanced machine learning algorithms to maximise bill savings, while also taking advantage of key market incentives and grid service programs such as demand response. Our systems generate lower energy costs for your business today and in the future.
Low Solar PPA Rate:
As an alternative to high-cost utility rates, you pay Enel X a lower flat rate for the energy generated from your solar panels.
Shared Storage Savings:
You and Enel X split the benefits unlocked by the battery storage system, creating a lower “net effective PPA rate” and aligned incentives to maximise performance.
Enel X Assumes the Risk:
Enel X finances the entire system, so there is no upfront cost to you. You start saving on day one.
