Who We Are
Circular Economy
Enel X takes inspiration from the principles of the Circular Economy, a new paradigm in which resources are continually cycled through the economy and the use of nonrenewable energy and creation of waste are minimized.
Creating a Circular Economy at Enel X
For Enel X, the transition from a linear to a circular economy represents an opportunity for sustainable innovation. The move creates tangible benefits for the environment with an impact that is amplified by the implementation of new technologies. Keeping the environment in mind when we create our solutions means focusing on the modularity, longevity, reparability and recyclability of the products and services we offer.
Reducing the use of non-renewable resources and focusing on innovative and sustainable elements makes the circular economy a strategic model for combating environmental challenges such as the scarcity of resources, global warming and waste management.

Recycle and Reuse
Using renewable energy and renewable, recyclable or biodegradable materials in consecutive lifecycles

Promoting the use of platforms for collaboration among asset users and owners to help consumers make savings and earn profit from better use of resources

The producing company remains the owner of the asset, designed for longevity, and offers clients a service that often includes not only the use of the product but also further related benefits (training, assistance etc.)
Design and production involving extension of the product lifecycle by companies—the value that would otherwise be lost by wasting materials and energy is retained or even enhanced by repairs, updates, regeneration or remarketing

Creating production and consumption systems where assets previously regarded as waste are reused as input for new processes
