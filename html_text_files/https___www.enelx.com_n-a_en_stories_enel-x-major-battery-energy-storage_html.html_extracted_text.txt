Enel X’s Major Battery Energy Storage Project
Read about Enel X’s project with Imperial Oil, likely the largest behind-the-meter battery energy storage system in North America.
May 23, 2022
Enel X is working with Imperial Oil on what may be the largest behind-the-meter battery energy storage system (BESS) in North America at 20 MW/40MWh. Imperial Oil’s motivation for the project was to address peak demand charges known in its jurisdiction as Global Adjustment, which can make up a large part of an energy bill.

Imperial chose Enel X as its energy-storage partner, expanding the existing relationship between the two companies – Imperial already participates in demand response programs with Enel X. This BESS will help to reduce Imperial’s energy spend, while installation, management and optimization will be a simple process with Enel X.
