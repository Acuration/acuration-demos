What does Enel X and Gogoro’s latest partnership involve and why it supports Taiwan’s energy transition?
Enel X and Gogoro recently announced 2,500+ battery swapping stations across 1,000+ locations to be enrolled in Virtual Power Plant, learn more below.
How did Enel X and Gogoro’s partnership start?
Enel X and Gogoro’s partnership started in 2021. In October 2021, we announced our
collaboration with Gogoro to provide critical support to Taiwan’s electricity grid
. Gogoro is the first electric mobility provider in Taiwan to participate in a Virtual Power Plant (VPP). We first started with a few pilot sites and now
we are enrolling up to 2,500+ battery swapping stations across 1,000+ locations into our VPP
.

How does Enel X and Gogoro’s partnership work?
The Gogoro Network when integrated with the Enel X VPP could safely pause charging if there was a grid imbalance, or provide energy back to the grid when needed. This has the same effect as
bringing new energy generation online to meet demand
. Once the grid needs passes, Enel X’s VPP sends a signal to the Gogoro Network to safely restore to normal grid consumption.

What are Gogoro's benefits in joining Enel X’s Virtual Power Plant?
With Gogoro joining Enel X’s Virtual Power Plant, we are able to aggregate Gogoro’s energy assets, in this case the battery swapping stations, into our VPP and offer it as an energy resource to Taiwan Power Company’s Ancillary Service market. This creates a new revenue stream for Gogoro while supporting the energy transition in Taiwan.

What are the advantages Enel X offers?
Aggregating 1,000+ sites isn’t easy. We are capable of making it happen and confident in aggregating as many sites as 1,000+ because we have a robust platform, and
24-7 support
locally and internationally all year round to ensure all dispatch events are handled with expertise and in real-time.
Plus, we have a large customer portfolio, which means more safety when responding to dispatch events.

It means a better reason to adopt electric scooters! Gogoro’s participation in Enel X’s VPP has no impact on the riders. The only impact is that now riders have an even better reason to choose electric scooters because the battery swapping stations support the energy transition and a cleaner environment for us and the next generation.

How does Enel X and Gogoro’s partnership support Taiwan’s grid?
Taiwan is rapidly developing renewable energy. In face of the increasing proportion of renewable energy and electric vehicles,
Virtual Power Plants
(VPP) are an excellent solution to cope with the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy and the sudden increase in electricity demand.

Gogoro’s battery swapping stations serve as one of the energy resources in our VPP, providing its flexibility to the grid when a grid imbalance occurs. This helps to keep our power grid stable without any blackouts.
What’s the business opportunity for commercial and industrial energy users?
Commercial and industrial energy users are now energy prosumers. Meaning that energy users can now offer their flexibility to the grid in
Taiwan Power Company’s Energy Ancillary Service
market via aggregators like us. Participants will receive a fee for being on stand-by, and an energy fee when being dispatched.
