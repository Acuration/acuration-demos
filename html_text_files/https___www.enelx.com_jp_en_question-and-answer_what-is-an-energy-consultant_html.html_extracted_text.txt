FAQ
What is an energy consultant and what do they do?
An energy consultant or energy advisor is a person who provides a company with the full spectrum of support in the management of all energy-related matters. They can help foster better-informed decision-making about purchasing energy by developing structured strategies for energy procurement and risk management. Energy consultants can offer clients a number of benefits, including:
Reductions in energy supply costs
thanks to their knowledge of the market and contacts with a large number of suppliers, which can be made to compete for business
Improved knowledge of energy markets
at a lower cost than independently-managed energy procurement
Implementation of a procurement and
energy management strategy
that yields long-term economic advantages
Better command of
regulatory changes
, thanks to their market insights
Ability to
implement complex strategies
that can significantly impact the company’s energy structure.

It's possible to perform independent energy management but it takes expertise, time and resources to do properly. Companies often turn to energy advisors because they have been impacted significantly by the cost of their energy supply, lack of knowledge about the energy markets, do not understand the complex pricing structures of providers, or simply do not have the time to negotiate with them.

Energy consultants can provide more complex services that have higher added value, such as the possibility to self-produce energy and improvements in

energy efficiency
in order to meet sustainability targets and cut consumption costs.
