FAQ
What are the advantages of smart public lighting?
The technical development of public lighting infrastructure
has been shaped by the need for local authorities to fulfill two requirements:
limiting energy consumption
and
reducing light pollution
. The most innovative technical solutions involve the use of
remotely managed LED units
. This Smart Lighting technology means units can be managed in a more innovative and efficient way, enabling users to:

Cut energy consumption by around 65% and generate a further 20% in savings by adjusting light output according to vehicle traffic needs, delivering a reduction in CO2 footprint. This is a key consideration for cities with a rapidly growing population.
Manage units more effectively through longer product life and reduced labor requirements, thereby reducing maintenance costs. Smart street lights can  more accurately predict when lamps need changing.
Improve lighting quality by using the latest generation microchips, enabling a high color rendering that turns the surrounding environment in a well-lit and pleasant milieu.
Increased functionality. When equipped with sensors or cameras, smart lighting systems can monitor traffic, parking, and air quality.
By opting for an upgraded street lighting system with energy-efficient LED products, such as those from Enel X, you benefit from all these advantages. In addition,
the intelligent street lighting solutions provided by Enel X Romania
, which also include remote management systems, ensure reductions of up to 80% in energy consumption.
