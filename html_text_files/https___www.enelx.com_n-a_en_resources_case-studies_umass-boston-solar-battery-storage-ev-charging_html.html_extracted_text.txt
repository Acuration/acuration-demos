Project Summary
University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston) is a 120-acre campus serving more than 16,000 students. Part of the university’s 25-year master plan includes making the campus environmentally sustainable.

To help optimize the facility’s energy consumption and contribute to the Massachusetts electric grid, UMass Boston partnered with Enel X for a fully financed, turnkey project that includes a 1 MW solar photovoltaic system, a 500 kW/2MWh lithium-ion battery storage system, and 11 Enel X JuiceBox electric vehicle (EV) smart charging stations on the campus.

The combined solar-plus-storage system will use Enel X’s DER Optimization Software to automatically store and consume clean, low-cost electricity at times when consuming from the grid is most expensive. Enel X’s JuiceBox smart charging stations will leverage renewable power and optimize timing to minimize the costs and impact of EV charging on campus.

Key Results & Benefits
Projected for $1.5M in total value generated via the distributed energy resource system
Enrollment in Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program, which compensates projects that alleviate pressure when the grid experiences peak demand
Earning payments through ISO-New England’s demand response program
Minimizing electricity costs related to exposure to demand-related charges
Project financing eliminated need for UMass Boston to cover hardware and installation costs
