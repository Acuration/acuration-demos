Enel X: New Global Record for Demand Response
2022 was a record year for Enel X: more than 8GW of capacity offered in electricity markets
Enel X 's journey toward
sustainability
continues at a rapid pace, thanks in part to the
Demand Response
numbers achieved. Our flexibility solutions have shown their full potential in addressing the energy crisis in recent months. In 2022, the
Demand Response capacity
offered in
markets
across the world exceeded
8GW
. This achievement is only made possible by the work of our expert local and global teams who work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

These results are made possible by the Dublin-based

Network Operation Center
(NOC)
and local operations teams, who provide the utmost attention down to the last kW, making sure that every request received from any of the 49 Transmission System Operators (TSOs) where we have active Demand Response programs.
