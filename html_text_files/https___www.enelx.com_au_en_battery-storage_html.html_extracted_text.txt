Why Enel X
Join the energy transition with onsite storage
Battery storage is urgently needed for the renewable energy transition, and is excpected to play a huge role in Australia’s future power system. BNEF predicts that by 2050, up to 87GW of solar capacity and 83GWh of storage capacity will be added in Australia. Businesses see battery storage as a complement to their renewable energy strategy, and a strong opportunity to improve their bottom line while accelerating their path to decarbonisation. Enel X is a global leader in this space, and is a partner of choice for Australian businesses.
Sustainable progress
This innovative technology helps businesses support renewables, reach sustainability goals and lower their carbon footprint.
Battery investment
A significant expansion of battery storage is needed to replace coal, and enable the  renewable energy transition.
The opportunity
Batteries offer businesses a new way to support their renewable energy strategy, and further hedge their exposure to energy markets.
Trusted partner
Enel X is recognised as a world-leading commercial & industrial battery integrator, providing turnkey solutions.
How onsite batteries support your business
1
Reduce your power supply costs
Reduce your power supply costs

A battery can optimise the profile of your power usage, serving to reduce demand and capacity charges you pay to the network utility, and can utilise your sites
solar production
that would otherwise be exported.


2
Earn a new revenue stream
Earn a new revenue stream
A battery, when properly integrated into a
Virtual Power Plant

(VPP) platform, is capable of providing multiple different valuable services to the power grid. In aggregate, this can generate significant revenue.
3
Accelerate your path to decarbonisation
Accelerate your path to decarbonisation
Batteries are the critical enabler to support variable renewable energy. By installing a battery you are creating an important new source of green power capacity for your site that can also help support the grid’s overall transformation.
Whether you have an on-site solar (PV) system or an off-site renewable energy Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a battery can help balance the variability of your renewable supply. This could allow you to increase your utilisation of renewable energy while reducing the price risks you face when the sun isn’t shining.
4
Improve the quality of your power supply
Improve the quality of your power supply
Depending on its configuration, a battery can enhance your protection against grid emergencies, providing a source of backup power supply in a blackout.
Optimisation Software to maximise performance
Enel X’s DER Optimisation Software uses advanced machine learning techniques to learn your facility’s operational behaviour, and analyse it alongside external data including weather forecasts, energy market pricing, tariff structures, and VPP trading opportunities. We automatically charge and discharge your battery at the optimal times to deliver the highest financial return possible.
Find out more about how Enel X's industry-leading optimisation software automates battery operations to maximise savings.

A turnkey services platform compatible with Tier 1 battery systems

No CAPEX
You receive a share of value for hosting on your site

Owned
You own the battery, and we operate it

We invest the capital in the battery and build it at your facility. We sign a long-term contract that pays you a fixed share of all value created by the battery, including retail tariff savings and VPP revenues. You get a new revenue stream and enhanced power quality benefits without having to invest any capital.

You invest the capital and own the battery. We build, operate and maintain it on a long-term basis at your facility. We retain a fixed share of all value created by the battery, including both retail tariff savings and VPP revenues. With access to our VPP and DER.OS platform, and with a structure that aligns our financial returns with yours, we can de-risk your business case and maximise your ROI.

Central Irrigation Trust Battery Project
We're installing one of Australia's biggest onsite battery projects for Central Irrigation Trust in South Australia. The first phase of the 14MWh project is complete, with batteries installed at its Berri and Loveday pump sites.
