What is the EPC formula
How it works
What is the EPC formula?
Decarbonisation and electrification are today’s must for companies all around the world. But when is the moment for the investment in energy transition? Enel X can help you get very close to this moment. We offer you customized financial tools to simplify the change process.
Guaranteed savings
Energy costs reduction due to the decreased energy consumption recommended by our experienced consultants.
Zero financial risk
With the financial aid represented by the EPC formula, you invest in sustainability and efficiency without down payments.
Zero technical risk
Enel X assumes both the financial and the technical risk and guarantees by contract that the solutions implemented will reduce consumption.
How it works
Mechanism
Benefits for your company
By the EPC (Energy Performance Contract) contract, we undertake to offer - by our own means or with third-party financing - a series of
services and plans for the modernization and improvement of your company’s energy efficiency
.
This means a
reduction of financial risks
for you. Therefore, you cut down costs due to electricity savings, following the implementation of energy efficiency measures.

With the EPC formula, your organization benefits from contract secured savings.
There is no need to put down a payment or to make an initial investment.
Enel X finances in full the energy efficiency initiative: it takes the implied technical risk and guarantees for the savings resulting from this process.
