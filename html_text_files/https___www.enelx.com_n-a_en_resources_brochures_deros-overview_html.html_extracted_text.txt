DOWNLOAD PDF

Enel X’s DER Optimization Software is a highly scalable, management software system delivered as a managed service on a subscription basis. Our DER Optimization Software enables you to monitor, communicate with and control your energy network. The system interfaces with distributed energy resources to monitor energy usage and production in real time.

Our software is comprised of two components, one cloud-based and one site-based, that interface with other software systems and hardware devices in a holistic energy management ecosphere.
