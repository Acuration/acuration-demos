Gyeonggi Province will hold briefings for industrial park tenants and support site discovery and licensing to activate RE100 projects in Gyeonggi industrial parks; Enel X Korea Consortium will find and invest in sites for industrial park tenants in Pyeongtaek, install renewable energy and generate electricity; and Samsung Electronics will purchase renewable energy and provide comprehensive cooperation to support RE100 for its affiliates and subsidiary companies.

The Enel X Korea Consortium plans to build a
45MW solar facility in the Pyeongtaek region and sell the renewable energy generated to Samsung Electronics for 20 years.
This will contribute to Samsung's RE100 goal for its local business operations.
We are pleased to be creating new measures together with the common goal of supporting local companies to implement RE100. We look forward to further promoting renewable energy penetration through the 'Gyeonggi Industrial Complex RE100 Project' and ultimately implementing RE100 in Korea.

10MW solar facility utilising

official investor for industrial parks in Gyeonggi Province

to support the achievement of RE100, and is actively promoting the development of RE100-related businesses in Korea.
