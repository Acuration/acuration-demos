Enel X has more than 20 years of experience in the U.S. deploying technology to help our customers save on energy costs and reduce emissions. Our team of energy experts can work with your school to understand your unique transportation requirements and budget constraints, then define electrification options based on your school’s needs. Enel X offers turnkey solutions that remove the high up-front cost of electrification by reducing maintenance costs, identifying funding sources and creating new revenue streams. All our bundled solutions are designed to simplify the electrification process for schools and offer one low annual fee.

The School Bus Electrification Journey
The Most Flexible Line of Turnkey Services to Meet School Needs
Electric Bus-as-a-Service
Enel X’s core school fleet electrification solution is a comprehensive electrification bundle with a low annual fee. With this service Enel X manages electrification from A to Z. Schools receive fully charged buses for their drivers to use 365 days a year. School administrators can focus on what matters most: providing a quality education for their students.

Charging-as-a-Service
For schools that prefer to own their school bus fleet, this solution provides everything required to charge an electric fleet. Schools purchase and maintain electric vehicles while Enel X designs, installs, manages, and maintains the charging infrastructure, guaranteeing its continuous operation.

School Sustainability
Enel X designs and builds systems to increase resilience and reduce environmental impact. Our energy experts will propose the right combination of solar panels, on-site battery storage and efficiency solutions by working with your facilities and sustainability managers to design a system to address your schools' specific needs. Enel X has designed and implemented hundreds of projects that use renewable energy to provide backup power and reduce monthly energy expenditure. Our solutions work perfectly with school sustainability goals.

Project Funding
Enel X will exhaust all resources to ensure your project
is optimally funded. We identify and apply all public funding available at that federal, state and local level. Also, our existing relationships with local utilities allow us to work quickly and efficiently to ensure utility incentives are applied. Beyond this, Enel X will also leverage industry knowledge to create additional revenue streams from programs like demand response as well as V2G when available. Our approach ensures the lowest possible cost for your project.

24/7 Customer Support
Enel X already supports over 100,000 charge points in the United States with our 24/7 customer support center. Our US based support team can troubleshoot most issues remotely and is available via phone, email, or chat. When needed, technicians are dispatched to your school within 48 hours.
