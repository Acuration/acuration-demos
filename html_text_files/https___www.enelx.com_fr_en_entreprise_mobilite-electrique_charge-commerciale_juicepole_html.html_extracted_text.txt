Smart metering
JuicePole can be integrated into smart charging logics, leveraging specific algorithms and advanced smart metering functions.

Sustainability
JuicePole is designed to fit our vision for sustainability.

We identified the opportunity to extend the lifetime of EV charging infrastructures – including JuicePole - thanks to the remanufacturing and regeneration of spare parts for maintenance and repair purposes. Regeneration reduces the need for brand-new spare parts, thus reducing our environmental impact and procurement costs.

Features like these are part of The Enel X Circular Economy Boosting Program, a company-wide approach to assess and increase both the level of circularity in our solutions portfolio and our clients’ Circular Economy maturity. The Boosting Program identifies new technologies, business models and innovations to be applied and integrated within portfolios, projects and processes.
Key benefits
