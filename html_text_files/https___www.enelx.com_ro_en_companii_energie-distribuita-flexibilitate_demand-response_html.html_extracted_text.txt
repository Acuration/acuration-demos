Synergic solutions
Are you wondering what are the stages by which you can contribute to the levelling of the electric grid by your energy consumption management? Here is what happens when the system needs your action:
The national transport controller foresees a problem in the grid’s stability and requests the issue of a
levelling order
from the aggregator.
The aggregator
modulates the consumption and/or the production
of its client portfolio to
increase or decrease energy use
.
Customers implement (manually or automatically) the modulation plans.
The difference in the energy quantity is used by the national transport operator.
Customers are
paid for each modulation performed
.

Using the innovative Demand Response opportunity, your company has access to the dispatching services market (dispatching services market, MSD) and comes to support consumption/supply peaks.
When you make available the production capacities, especially, if they are highly flexible and managed in aggregated form, you become part of an advanced group of companies which become important players in the national energy system.
The Demand Response service offered by Enel X addresses commercial and industrial customers that come from various activity sectors. Actually,
the size of the location
is irrelevant, even smaller work points may participate when they are managed in aggregate.
It is important to know that, in order to attend the Demand Response program, you must not interrupt your own consumption, but you may guarantee a certain
degree of modulation
.
We have a team exclusively dedicated to supporting customers in collecting the necessary technical material for c
hoosing the most suitable business processes that can be subject to consumption modulation
. How do we guide you?
the team performs a standard preliminary analysis of the unit’s main characteristics
follows an in-depth analysis of the industrial processes involved
we identify the consumption that can be flexible
We use a
revolutionary technological platform
in order to manage the Demand Response services, which uses top algorithms capable of selecting the optimal solution from a technical and economic point of view.
Therefore, we are offering you
revenues
for energy consumption management, and to the electricity transmission operator we offer maximum safety.
We manage the system with the help of an
operational center available
7 days a week, 365 days per year. We use
automated notifications
for levelling orders by SMS/e-mail or by the dedicated application.
We are able to offer business-ready and integrated solutions, for example, by combining cost management solutions with distributed generation sources and with the consumption monitoring platform, supported by financial instruments adapted to your needs, in line with our EaaS (energy as a service) approach.
