What is adaptive lighting?
How it works
Your advantages
What is adaptive lighting and whom does it serve?
Enel X unlocks a new era of smart lighting for all public roads in Romania. We use the most progressive smart lighting systems, because we know the needs of the community, public administration and the planet. We respond to these needs directly, through advanced energy services dedicated to lighting on roads and public roads. Adaptive lighting means a smart system of sensors, poles and other equipment that adjust light to traffic, weather and visibility conditions.
Cities
Smart lighting provides quality lighting for human safety, energy efficiency and a system integrated in the aesthetics of the city.
Communes
With Enel X solutions, rural communities save energy in road lighting and benefit from a technologically progressive system.
Roads connecting cities
Drivers will benefit from optimal visibility conditions through adaptive lighting systems that are activated only when necessary.
How it works
Street lighting for smart cities
Digitalization: sensors, video cameras and platform
Enel X's Smart Lighting systems are a step forward in terms of street lighting. Designed for
maximum energy and financial savings
, they offer
excellent visual comfort
and create
safe conditions for citizens
.
Enel X's innovative technology ensures
even light distribution and reduces light pollution
.
Public administrations collaborating with Enel X are also offered interventions and
energy efficiency measures to ensure compliance with regulations
, at zero cost, as well as a
significant reduction in operating expenses from the first year
.

At Enel X, we take care of everything: from design to the installation and maintenance of the smart lighting system. We also make sure that you, as a representative of the public administration, become an expert in using this intelligent adaptive lighting system.
Adaptive lighting uses sensors and/or video cameras. Due to this, it can be used either exclusively
to adapt the light from the poles to traffic conditions
, or also to weather conditions and ambient light.
The software solution developed by Enel X gives the local administration the possibility to visualize and manage public lighting services, including by remote control.
The digital platform for public lighting
offers real-time transparency on the operation of lighting poles and smart sensors,
configuration
of certain light parameters,
visualization of traffic volume
, data on
energy consumption of public lighting infrastructure and so on
.
Your advantages
Optimizing both light and costs
Smart adaptive systems help localities make substantial energy savings and automatically adjust light intensity to traffic and visibility conditions.
Safety of public areas
In some important areas, the light is maximum and continuous, for the safety of the inhabitants: for example, at pedestrian crossings. The monitoring function can also be added.
Sustainable local administration
Using progressive adaptive lighting systems, the town halls show the community that together, with smart street lighting solutions, we reduce the local carbon footprint.
Discover other services that change the city life
Smart cities use energy-efficient, connected systems for control and optimization, adaptable to the needs of the community and the environment.
