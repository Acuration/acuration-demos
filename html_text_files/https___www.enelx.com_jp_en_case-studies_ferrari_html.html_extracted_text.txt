The need
Ferrari wants to
increase its self-production of energy and reduce CO₂ emissions
as part of an environmental and economic path towards sustainability.
Carbon neutrality
is the ultimate goal.

The solution
To meet Ferrari’s needs Enel X designed a solar photovoltaic (PV) system that will be installed on the rooftop of Ferrari’s famous factory in Maranello, Italy.
Boosting the company’s self-production of energy while reducing CO₂ emissions
emissions was the main goal of the project. The solar PV system, comprised of more than 3,800 solar panels, will have a maximum capacity of 1,535 kWp that will cover part of the Ferrari premises’ electricity consumption.
In addition, Enel X will
create a solar PV parking canopy that is completely off grid
, combining the solar with a battery storage system to meet the charging needs of Ferrari’s new hybrid range and future full-electric vehicles.
The charging performance will be monitored and shared
through Enel X’s Energy Management System, which will display the data in real-time.
The benefits
Once running at full capacity, the entire project will save more than
18,500 metric tons of CO₂ over 25 years.
The plant will be able to generate 1,626,802 kWh/year, helping to
reduce emissions and meet the company’s carbon neutrality goals.
