The smart home: energy efficient, safe and comfortable
In recent years, we have been talking more and more about energy efficient homes. With such a home, based on state-of-the-art technology, you save energy, save on bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, allowing the initial investment to be recovered over time.
Energy efficient homes

save energy
and are
environmentally friendly
. They are
well insulated
, have
heating
and
cooling systems
that do not waste energy, which is why
utility bills are considerably reduced
and
the carbon footprint is greatly reduced
. They can also be equipped with
solar panels
and with
storage solutions
that generate and store
clean energy
from
renewable sources
. Discover
how you can increase the energy efficiency of your home
making changes enhanced by new technologies!

How can you increase the energy efficiency of your home?
Improvements that make your home energy efficient include insulating your doors and windows, switching to
LED lighting
, and investing in a
renewable energy system
, such as
photovoltaic panels
, to produce
clean energy
to power your household appliances or air conditioning systems. There is also a range of
energy-efficient products
for the home, including appliances in higher energy classes (A, B), as well as
smart appliances
and technologies that can be
managed remotely
via an app, such as HOMIX from Enel X. Don't forget that smart homes allow for
increased energy efficiency
, translated into
lower costs
and
greater care for the environment
!

Benefits of an energy efficient home
Energy efficient homes are
comfortable
and
a healthy environment to live in
, regardless of age: they are
warm in winter,

cool in summer
,
well ventilated
, neither too wet nor too dry. Energy efficiency improvements can
lower the cost of energy bills
for homeowners, but they can also
add value to the property
through insulation and efficient heating and cooling systems. Last but not least, whether you build an energy-efficient home or renovate an existing home, you will
contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions
and
combating climate change.
