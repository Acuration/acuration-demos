Enel X electric car charging stations funded by Electric Up
We all dream of a secure future for ourselves and our loved ones, but we must not forget that the security of the future starts with the choices of the present. In recent years, major companies around the world have been looking for sustainable solutions to sustain their business, using renewable resources and solutions that reduce their impact on the environment. One of the best examples of this comes from car companies themselves, which are placing increasing emphasis on electric and hybrid cars. With the growing popularity of these types of cars, installing electric car charging stations is becoming not only a necessity, but also a business of the future. Find out more about the charging solutions Enel X offers and how you can install them with funding from the Electric Up program.

Electric charging points in Romania - is the investment justified?
Just a few years ago, electric cars were still regarded with skepticism in our country, partly because of the price and partly because of charging issues. Without a sufficient number of electric charging points, full-electric or hybrid cars seemed risky, and charging stations were meaningless without electric cars. Fortunately, the situation has changed dramatically and continues to improve: electric vehicles are becoming more affordable and Romanians have realized that they can be a convenient and sustainable solution in the long term.
Globally, a report by the Deloitte Group has highlighted that sales of electric cars will grow by 30% each year, with one in three cars sold being electric by 2030.
Therefore, if at the end of 2019 Romania had around 400 electric car charging stations, we should expect the number to increase progressively in the coming years.

The installation of charging stations is thus a future-proof solution for any company, be it for external customers or for its own fleet. Thinking about the cost of car charging stations and can't decide whether to include it in your company's current expenses? Take advantage of the Electric Up project, where you can receive up to €100,000 in funding to purchase photovoltaic panels and charging stations for electric and hybrid vehicles.
