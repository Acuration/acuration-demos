2022, Enel X New Global Record for Demand Response
Capacity delivered by Enel X to the global electricity market in 2022 exceeded 8 GW, the highest ever recorded
In 2022, the world faced an unexpected energy crisis of unprecedented scale. Electricity prices skyrocketed, with an enormous impact on the energy supply for a wide range of industries. In Japan, the demand for electricity was so high that the Japanese government issued an electricity ”power crunch alert” due to the very high summer temperatures.
Companies that want to keep electricity costs as low as possible typically think about adjusting their equipment settings or changing where they purchase their power, but there are limitations to what can be done alone.
One of the solutions that companies can choose from is
Demand Response
. Demand Response is an innovative program that allows customers to earn revenue by contributing to lowering electricity demand during times of power peak demand. Customers can help improve the ability to supply electricity to the power market by temporarily shutting down their facilities to reduce power usage or switching to backup power sources.

Atsushi Ito
Head of Japan Business Operations, Enel X Japan
In April 2023, the "Act on Rationalizing Energy Use" was implemented, and by participating in Demand Response, companies are able to contribute to the improvement of the non-fossil energy ratio that is required.

The average temperature in the summer of 2022 was the second hottest since statistics began (1898) (JMA data). In 2023, the UK's Met Office predicts that the end of the La Niña phenomenon will cause sea surface temperatures in parts of the Pacific Ocean to rise, resulting in higher global temperatures compared to 2022, which means that electricity will be in short supply as it was last year.

Why not participate in Demand Response with Enel X Japan before the hot summer of 2023 arrives?
