Decarbonising public transport with electric buses
Enel X brings its market leading e-Bus charging platform to Australia

Melbourne, May 10th 2021
- Enel X, a global leader in the energy transformation, has localised its market-leading electric bus (e-Bus) charging platform to support the electrification of public transport across Australia. Leveraging its international success, Enel X will work with public transport authorities and bus operators that are replacing traditional diesel buses with cleaner and more sustainable electric buses.
The Enel X e-bus platform includes advanced charging infrastructure to upgrade bus depots; a real-time software platform to optimise e-bus charging in relation to both operating schedules and energy costs; and long-term energy supply arrangements, including options for 100% renewable power. This integrated electrification solution, which has already been proven in overseas markets, is unique in the Australian market today.

“Enel X is working to support the transition to sustainable mobility.  We are excited to combine our global e-bus platform with our local energy market expertise to solve complex infrastructure challenges for Australian transport operators,”
stated
Jeff Renaud
, Head of Asia and Oceania, Enel X.
“We look forward to delivering a comprehensive solution that de-risks and accelerates Australia’s transition to electric public transport. In so doing, we will seek to fully leverage Australia’s increasingly abundant renewable power to drive these e-buses, while ensuring that e-bus infrastructure makes a positive contribution to the transformation of Australia’s power grid.”
Enel X is a global leader in electric mobility, with more than 232,000 electric vehicle charging points around the world connected to its platform today. Globally, Enel X has already been contracted to manage and serve more than 1,700 e-buses to public transport authorities, making Enel X the largest provider of e-bus solutions in the world today outside of China.

Fueled in large part by the actions of the NSW Government, the e-bus market in Australia is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, with many expecting more than 8,000 e-buses to hit Australian roads by 2030.

Around the world, Enel X is creating opportunities for people, businesses and cities to use energy in new, more sustainable ways. Today in Australia, Enel X is the number one independent provider of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) and Demand Response services (BNEF), and this move sees Enel X further expand its portfolio of offerings designed to support Australia’s rapidly accelerating renewable energy transformation.
