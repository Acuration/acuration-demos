Prosumer Law
What does the Enel X solution package include
What is not included in the package
The new prosumer law (GEO 15/2022)
establishes a
quantitative compensation
between the energy produced and delivered to the network and the amount of energy consumed for the previous month in a 1:1 ratio.
The surplus of energy produced will be transferred to the prosumer's bills
, and it will be used to
cover consumption in the following months
, if it is higher than the prosumer's production (for facilities of
up to 200kW/consumption place
).
The photovoltaic system in complete setu
p and eligible for financing comprises of:
Technical pre-assessment services
(determination of project feasibility; drawing up the record of findings and the technical pre-assessment report);
Photovoltaic panels, inverter, connection materials, communication system included in the inverter and mounting structure;
Guidance
for preparing the documentation and for obtaining the documents from the Distribution Operator (ATR, CER), as well as for concluding the sale and purchase agreement for the energy produced.

The Enel X solution package
does not include work on the mains connection installation
, or its changes. Any change to the connection installation may only be performed subject to the consent of the consumption place distributor.
The grounding facilities adjacent to the Enel X photovoltaic project are also not included
.
Your benefits
Your Benefits
Thanks to Enel X, you can enjoy a package of integrated services for the installation of the photovoltaic panel system - from technical support to the preparation of the documentation for obtaining the connection certificates and the actual installation of the system in your home.
Fast Return-On-Investment

Reduced costs on the energy bill
On an annual basis, the Enel X roof-mounted photovoltaic system is capable of generating green energy that can cover an important part of the energy needed for your home. Our customers’ performance curves have shown that a 3kw system with optimally installed photovoltaic panels (facing south and on a roof slope of 30-35%) is capable of generating an output of 3.600kwh.
