The need
Numera, an IT services company, has committed to becoming
more energy efficient and self-sufficient
at its headquarters in Sardinia, Italy, and thereby
reduce its carbon footprint and meet sustainability goals.
The solution
To meet Numera’s needs, Enel X designed a

maximum capacity of 650 KW
. In addition, Enel X will deliver a
Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) of 300 kVA/558 Kwh.
Three major benefits
Utilizing the full energy produced by the solar PV system will increase self-sufficiency in energy use by 80% and reduce energy costs by 86%.
The system contributes to the implementation of a sustainable society by reducing emissions by 320 tons per year.
The battery storage system will allow Numera to use store electricity during the daytime when there is an abundance of solar to be released at later times, further enhancing energy efficiency and self-sufficiency.

This project is part of an island-wide program which envisions Sardinia as the ideal land to launch a gradual decarbonization process. The underlying hope is that this initiative will serve as a model for government authorities and companies, guiding them in the green energy transition and electrification.

We are very pleased to have signed this agreement. Our wish, to reach maximum energy efficiency in a sustainable context, has found in Enel X not only a supplier, but a trusted energy partner for the integrated solutions offered and for its 360 degree consultancy support that will accompany us throughout all phases of the project.
