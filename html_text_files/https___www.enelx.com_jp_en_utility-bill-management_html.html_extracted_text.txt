How does it work?
Streamline your bills
Improve operational efficiency
Easily access data for reporting
Our solution ensures bills are processed and aligned to customer systems through customised accounts payable files, on time avoiding late fees.

Centralize and remove the burden of collating, validating and processing bills from your team and avoid the risk of human error in the process.

Access the centralized data you need to report on portfolio-wide cost drivers,  sustainability performance and meter data. We help customers to monitor and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and usage to meet renewable energy goals and report on market-based governmental, or voluntary emission reporting.
Enel X provided our bank a global UBM service, which supported ISO 14064 certification, energy performance and benchmarking, and utility bill auditing. They have solved data collection requirements ranging from the interception of in-country bills to automated data feeds from utility data services.
