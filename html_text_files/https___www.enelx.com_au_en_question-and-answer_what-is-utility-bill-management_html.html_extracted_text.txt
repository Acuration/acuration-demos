FAQ
What is Utility Bill Management?
Utility Bill Management (UBM) is a service designed for business clients with many different points of delivery and with many branches or offices.

UBM enables clients to optimise the management all utility bills in one place, including energy, gas, water and sanitation, in a clear shift away from the use of excel spreadsheets. Using a digital platform enables the analysis and comparison of invoices and the speedy production of reports featuring clear explanatory graphics.
The result is a precise evaluation of consumption levels that can facilitate future decision-making, thanks to specialised forecasting tools. In terms of environmental sustainability, Utility Bill Management can also calculate the impact of energy consumption in terms of CO2 emissions.
