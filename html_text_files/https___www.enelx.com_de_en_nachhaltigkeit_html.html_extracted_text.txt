What’s your climate commitment?
All businesses must play their part in working towards a cleaner, greener planet. From reducing carbon emissions to increasing renewable energy use, Enel X has the tools, expertise and experience to help your company make the transition.
Sustainability 360
Improving your company’s sustainability may be challenging but consider these motivations. Stakeholders want to see that organizations are properly accounting for climate change. Consumers are increasingly opting for more environmentally friendly brands. Employees want to work for more responsible companies and the investor community is making clear its commitment to withdrawing shareholder backing if climate impact is not adequately addressed.

Adopting a circular economy business model makes your company more efficient, resilient, and competitive and presents new business opportunities. At Enel X we are committed to the circular economy and having road-tested the effectiveness of this model on ourselves, can offer strategic solutions for your company’s journey to sustainability, including the Circular Economy Report, the Circular Economy Product Score and the Circular Economy Boosting Program.
