What is an energy audit?
How it works
Your advantages
What is the energy audit?
The road to the optimization of your company’s energy profile starts with the first step: the analysis of the way in which the business uses the energy, an energy audit for buildings. The expertise of the Enel X team guarantees the transparency of some processes that you can later on optimize. We assess the performance of the energy equipment and identify the energy efficiency growth opportunities. Not only will your company benefit from an energy consumption reduction, but also the environment will gain from the implicit decarbonization resulting from this transformation.
Non-stop support
Our experienced consultants identify the energy pattern of your company based on the analysis of the way you consume energy.
What you can control
We offer support for extracting the data from the existing systems and we present to you our monitoring platform.
Continuous evolution
You will receive monthly reports and we will assist you in exploring new possibilities of energetic development.
How it works
Analysis
Design
Monitoring
The energy audit service for companies allows the
consumption analysis and determination of the efficiency level
of a production plant or of a part of the location.
Energy diagnosis
is the first step for obtaining an overall assessment of the production system and starts with the analysis phase.
In this phase, we collect and analyse all the data on the use of various types of energy (electricity, gas, oxygen etc.) for an energy audit report.
We design the
energy model of your company
and we identify the
measuring systems
recommended for installation. We choose the right place to install them.
Generally, these communicate with a
remote control system
which collects the data and, depending on the energy model, generates the initial reports.
Enel X also offers a dedicated monitoring platform called Energy Management System. What benefits does access to this digital instrument provide? EMS solution:
collects and analyses energy consumption and/or production
provides consumption transparency by intuitive display, so that you can take informed decisions
it recommends specific measures in order to increase energy efficiency.
Your advantages
Transparency of the efficiency level
If you engage together with Enel X in the process of energy diagnosis for the company/production units, you open the way to increased energy efficiency.
Technology leadership
You enjoy the advantages of collaborating with an organization counting ten years of experience in this area and with a dedicated team of professionals.
