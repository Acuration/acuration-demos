What is an electricity futures curve?
Understand the electricity futures curve and how it empowers businesses to take control of their energy costs.
Video
Wholesale energy has a futures market, where businesses can contract a price today, for energy that will be used in the future.

A futures curve is a visual representation of future wholesale electricity contract pricing, and how this has changed over time.

We analyse and act on the ASX Australian electricity futures market every day to give our clients a competitive edge when it comes to energy purchasing.

Futures curves are extremely useful for budgeting and planning for future energy costs, and making decisions about when to lock in supply contracts for an organisation’s energy load.

The transparency of the futures curve allows for excellent risk management processes to be put in place, and rigour around purchasing decisions.

For a more in-depth understanding of how to use futures curves,
