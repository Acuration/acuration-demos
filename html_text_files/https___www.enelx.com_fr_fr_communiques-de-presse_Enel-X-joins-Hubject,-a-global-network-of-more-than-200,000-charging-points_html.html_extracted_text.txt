By becoming a 12.5% shareholder in e-mobility joint venture Hubject, Enel X can extend the charging network accessible to its customers to the overall Hubject network
Enel X will contribute with its technological expertise to further expand and strengthen Hubject, with the aim to boost worldwide electric mobility penetration
Rome, September 25th, 2019
- Enel X has become a 12.5% shareholder in Hubject, an e-mobility joint venture which includes leading players across the technology, automotive and utility sectors. Hubject has developed an interoperable platform that enables electric vehicle (“EV”) drivers to charge their cars across a network of over 200,000 public charging points worldwide, without having to sign new contracts on top of the ones with their e-mobility Service Providers that use Hubject’s eRoaming services.
By entering the joint venture, Enel X can extend the interoperability of its European network beyond the 8,000 public charging points already available to its customers, with the possibility to access the joint venture’s overall network.
Enel X will also work within the partnership to expand Hubject’s charging network and further improve its technological features, with the aim to boost the penetration of electric mobility worldwide.
Francesco Venturini
, Global Head of Enel X, said: “
By joining Hubject, we are taking electric mobility to the next level. We are expanding Enel X’s role of global e-mobility Service Provider, by increasingly supplying charging services beyond our network. The overall aim is to offer electric vehicle drivers the possibility to fill up their batteries without having to worry about who their provider is, or about being abroad
.
The necessary precondition to the spread of electric mobility is simplifying the lives of those who want to join this revolution, and we are fully committed to the challenge.
”
Enel X, a leading provider of smart charging solutions, has been rolling out its own public charging networks in Italy, Spain and Romania for a total of around 8,000 charging points, in line with its announced targets that also include the installation of private charging points. Overall, Enel X is expected to increase its number of public and private charging points worldwide to 455,000 by 2021 from around 60,000 today, with the aim to support the uptake of EVs and the decarbonisation of the transport sector. Towards this aim, Enel X has also closed several interoperability agreements to broaden the public charging network available to its customers throughout Europe, expanding its reach as e-mobility Service Provider into Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
Interoperability, or eRoaming, is a structural component of the Enel X mission to create charging solutions for all types of use (home, office, transit) that are accessible through a single point of access, namely Enel X’s JuicePass app. This app is the single interface for Enel X customers to charge at home and the office as well as to access Enel X’s and its partners’ public charging point network and, eventually, the overall Hubject network.
The Hubject e-mobility joint venture was founded in 2012. Its shareholders are BMW Group, Bosch, Daimler, EnBW, Innogy, Siemens, the Volkswagen Group and now Enel X. The joint venture boasts over 600 business partners as well as 200,000 interoperable charging points in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Hubject’s headquarters are located in Berlin, with business units in the United States (Los Angeles) and China (Shanghai).
Enel X is Enel’s global business line dedicated to developing innovative products and digital solutions in sectors in which energy is showing the greatest potential for transformation: cities, homes, industries and electric mobility. Enel X holds the leading position in demand response programmes globally, with over 6 GW of demand response capacity currently managed and assigned in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania.
