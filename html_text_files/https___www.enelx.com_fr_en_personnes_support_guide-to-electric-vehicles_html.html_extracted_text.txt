What is electric mobility
A guide to electric vehicles
It’s time to make the move to sustainable motoring.
Driving the future
Did you know that globally there are over 10.9 million electric vehicles in circulation, of which 3.24 million were sold in 2020 alone (source: EV Volumes). While they still represent a small percentage of the overall number of cars, there are 55 times more EVs on the road now than there were seven years go.

In France, sales of new electric cars increased by 180% in 2020 compared to 2019 and the best-selling car was the Renault Zoe. Car manufacturers are not only releasing more EV models, with ever greater range and at increasingly affordable prices but many also pledging to make all their models electric within the next decade.

Incentives
The French government offers grants to encourage you to choose a new electric car:

New car grant (Bonus Ecologique)

This is a government grant towards the purchase or lease of a new or second-hand electric or a hybrid car or small van. The grant amount varies according to the price and type of vehicle and is deducted from the price of the vehicle by the dealer or reimbursed on application by you after the purchase of the vehicle.

The grant for the purchase of a new electric/hybrid vehicle for less than €45,000 with a maximum CO2 level of 20 g/km, is 27% of the vehicle's acquisition cost including tax, up to a maximum of €6,000. For vehicles costing €45,000 to €60,000 the grant reduces to €2,000. The amount for a second-hand vehicle is €1,000.

Performance
When it comes to acceleration, EVs are quick off the mark thanks to the direct transmission of power to the wheels with no lag. As a result, even less powerful electric cars perform better than their traditional counterparts. EVs are also more adept at braking, slowing down consistently as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator. The braking process recharges the battery which EVs are well suited to city traffic.

Sustainability
Electric cars outperform all the alternatives, both in terms of CO2 emissions and pollutants, being the only technology that allows the total elimination of local oxide emissions, nitrogen (NO x) and fine dust (Pm x). EVs also reduce noise pollution as they are almost silent which significantly improves your local environment.

Low maintenance
An EV’s electric drivetrain, means the motor requires minimal maintenance and potentially a battery replacement at around 300,000 km. Compare that to a conventional car which needs regular maintenance for oil changes, fuel filters, spark plugs - and emission checks.

Before you buy
Vehicle type: BEV or PHEV?
There are two types of electric vehicles. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are self-powered exclusively by the energy generated by a pack of rechargeable batteries from the mains. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) have both battery and petrol-powered engines.
Battery range and capacity
Modern EVs have much improved range often reaching 300 km plus. An EVs range depends on the vehicle’s battery capacity expressed in kilowatt hours (kWh). The higher the number the further you can travel on one charge. Factors which can affect an EV’s actual range include personal driving style, road conditions, the external temperature, and the heating or air conditioning of the car’s interior.
Battery charger output
Expressed in kW this will determine how quickly the vehicle’s battery will be recharged. The higher the output the quicker the charge. Home charging is generally slower starting at 2.3 kW and is ideal for charging vehicles overnight. Fast charging, found at service stations can be as high as 150 kW and can charge a vehicle in around 30 minutes.
