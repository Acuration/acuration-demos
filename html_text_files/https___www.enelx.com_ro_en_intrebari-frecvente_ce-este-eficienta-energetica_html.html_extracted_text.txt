FAQ
What is energy efficiency?
The definition of
energy efficiency
is simply to
use less energy
to perform the
same task
or produce the
same result
. The goal is to
eliminate wasted energy
. When a home or
business is energy efficient
, it uses less energy to heat, cool, and run appliances and electronics. An
energy-efficient factory
uses less energy to produce goods. When it comes to
fighting climate change
, energy efficiency is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to achieve Net Zero emissions of carbon dioxide through decarbonization. And since it aims to eliminate wasted energy,
energy efficiency reduces costs
.

The energy efficiency definition can involve calculating
the ratio of output of performance
(say, heating a building),
a service
(such as public transport),
or goods
(textiles, for example) in relation to
the input of energy
. For an economy-wide definition of energy efficiency, GDP is often compared to energy use, to measure what economists and governments call „energy intensity”.
