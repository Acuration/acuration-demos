Enel X Japan relocates its Tokyo headquarters
Enel X Japan will relocate with additional floor space to Nihonbashi to accommodate the expansion of its business scale.
The new office will begin operations today, Monday, August 14, 2023.

Tokyo, 14 August 2023
– Enel X Japan (headquarters: Chuo-ku, Tokyo; Country manager: Hiromitsu Miyamoto), a provider of Demand Response and decarbonization solutions centered on decarbonization and digitalization as a partner for corporate sustainability strategies, announced today that it has relocated its headquarters from 4-chome Nihonbashi Muromachi, Chuo-ku to 2-chome Nihonbashi Muromachi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, and started operation today, Monday, August 14, to accommodate an increase in personnel due to business expansion and to facilitate communication with business partners.

At the center of the office, we have created a new area where all Demand Responses around the world can be executed, managed, and monitored in real-time, allowing sales, business development, and operations departments to work together to further improve service quality.

For the five conference rooms, "great names in the field of power and historical inventions" were selected through employee voting in honor of past achievements, including James Watt (steam engine, units), Thomas Edison (light bulb, direct current), Gennai Hiraga (electric light bulb, first domestic electric generator), Nikola Tesla (alternating current), and others.

Hiromitsu Miyamoto
, country manager of Enel X Japan, stated:
"This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Enel X Japan office. In 10 years, we grew to handle more than 1 GW of capacity per year in the capacity market, which is more than 25% of the total capacity in the Japanese market. We would like to express our deepest gratitude once again to all of you for your support that enabled us to reach this milestone. As we look ahead to the next decade, we are reminded of our mission "to be a leading company providing sustainable, innovative, and simple solutions to drive the energy transition," and we are all committed to working even harder to live up to your expectations. We are determined to meet your expectations.”
