Leggett & Platt is North America’s largest independent manufacturer of a variety of consumer and industrial products, including office furniture, drawn steel wire, and automotive seat support. With 20 business units, 160 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries, and 20,000 employee-partners, Leggett & Platt generated sales of more than $1B in 2019.

A Sustainable Solution
Leggett & Platt first explored demand response (DR) as part of its energy conservation efforts. They chose Enel X as a DR partner because of its national scope, DR expertise, and responsive on-site support. Enel X worked with Leggett & Platt to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of implementing DR at various facilities. Two facilities in Texas decided they would temporarily shut down elements of their production lines, while its large Sterling, Illinois, facility temporarily stops production in a rod mill, delivering more than 11 megawatts (MW) of energy reduction—one of the largest DR reductions in the region.

A Tailored Approach
Enel X helped Leggett & Platt find the best approach for each of its diverse facilities, according to their needs and the benefits of the program. During the temporary shutdown in its Illinois facility, Leggett & Platt performs maintenance and other work that it cannot complete while the mill is operating.

Expertise Across Programs
DR programs vary in details like response time and dispatch length, so Leggett & Platt needed a partner with experience in a variety of programs. “Enel X was well-versed on all of the nuances in various markets,” said Steve Elsea, director of energy services at Leggett & Platt. “When we needed detailed information to make decisions, we knew we could get it from Enel X.”

Significant Revenue
In all, Leggett & Platt delivers more than 12 MW through its participation in DR and receives payments of approximately $400,000 annually from Enel X.

Simple Participation
According to Leggett & Platt, participating in DR with Enel X was a simple process—from enrollment to implementation to testing. “The paperwork, planning, and all other elements of the process were seamless for us,” said Elsea.
