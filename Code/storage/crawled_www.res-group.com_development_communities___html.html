            It means a lot to me to have an area so close to me, here in Alingsas, where you can ride a bike or you can hike and run without problems.

Rödene Wind Farm is just one example of how we listen to communities and build projects which bring a range of benefits. It is located in Southern Sweden, in the municipalities of Alingsås and Vårgårda. Surrounded by picturesque lakes and forests, the community enjoys access to hike, run and mountain bike on the paths surrounding the wind farm.


A total of 13 wind turbines produce enough to power the equivalent of 40,000 Swedish homes every year, which equates to the entire population of the Alingsås municipality. It also avoids the equivalent of an estimated 230,000 tonnes CO2 emission per annum.


The new footpaths and tracks across the wind farm have enabled greater access to the countryside which are frequently used by locals for a variety of outdoor activities.


By working closely with local communities RES bring the benefits of clean, affordable energy to local residents whilst being sensitive to the local environment and the social needs of the people who live there.
