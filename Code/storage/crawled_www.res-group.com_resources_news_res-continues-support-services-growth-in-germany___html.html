Asset Management






Wind


























RES, the world’s largest independent renewable energy company, is continuing its growth in Germany following the signing of a second asset management contract with Octopus Energy Generation.


The contract, which was secured following a competitive tender process, will see RES provide technical, financial and commercial asset management for the Gaishecke Wind Farm, located in the State of Hesse once it becomes fully operational. The project, which consists of 10 Vestas V126 3.45 MW turbines, is currently under construction and is expected to be operational by the end of 2023.


This appointment contributes to RES’ ambition to grow its support services business – providing high value asset management and O&M services to clients. RES has seen exceptional growth in its support services (asset management, operations and maintenance) business over the last few years and now supports over 12 GW of operational wind, solar and storage projects assets across the globe.


The 35 MW project is capable of powering the equivalent of 40,000 homes with green energy. Projects like these are helping contribute towards Germany’s goal becoming climate neutral by 2045. Germany is seeing a step change in the volume of renewables being deployed, with 2.4 GW of new onshore wind coming to market in the past year alone. RES customers benefit from local market knowledge and experience as well as efficiencies created through economies of scale.


Philip Thiemann, Support Services Director at RES in Germany said, “We are delighted to continue working      with Octopus Energy Generation,      contributing      towards achieving a net zero future. This new asset management contract contributes to our overall growth strategy to partner with asset owners who share the same vision of ensuring longevity and efficiency of their plant, thereby allowing us to show the full potential of the services that RES offers. We are excited to build on the foundations of a strong relationship.”
