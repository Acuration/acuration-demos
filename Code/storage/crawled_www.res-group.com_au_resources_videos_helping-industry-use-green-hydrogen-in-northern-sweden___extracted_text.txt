Powering a clean energy future for communities in Sweden
The Ånge Municipality is nestled in the rolling hills and forests of central Sweden, with beautiful scenery and rich in natural resources. But, over recent years it’s people have struggled from the loss of local industry, vital to maintaining a thriving population and community. The people of Ånge are passionate about working with their natural resources to create a clean energy future that will help the community thrive once more.
They have partnered with RES to help transform their municipality into a green energy hub by starting the development of a green hydrogen plant which will utilise electricity produced from local wind farms. This innovative and sustainable use of local resources in collaboration with local communities is a demonstration of the RES vision in action, creating a future where everyone has access to affordable zero carbon energy.
A green hub for growth
Once completed the plant will become a catalyst for industrial growth in the community and the heart of an emerging green industrial cluster.  The project is already generating great interest from companies in manufacturing, battery storage and fuel where share they significant electricity needs, from tens to hundreds of megawatts. 
500 MW
Installed capacity once complete and operational.
82,000 tonnes
Up to 82,000 tonnes of hydrogen gas produced each year.
300 jobs
Up to 300 jobs expected to be directly and indirectly created through the the project and positive impact to the community.
145 hectares
145 hectare site planned with the possibility of expansion in the future.
            The demand for green hydrogen is constantly increasing because the requirements are generally strengthened for all businesses to become more environmentally sustainable. Conditions such as available land, good access to transport, locally produced green electricity in a price area with low electricity price, process water and green hydrogen, makes Alby a very attractive area for new industries.
