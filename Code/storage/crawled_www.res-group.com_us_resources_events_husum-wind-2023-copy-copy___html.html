The UK has built a world leading reputation in the Operations and Maintenance of offshore wind assets – innovating and developing technologies, techniques and knowhow that are in high demand as other countries invest heavily in building their own offshore wind assets. The growth in this segment is already huge, as are the opportunities for UK companies to grow in this market. RenewableUK’s & ORE Catapult’s O&M Conference is about delivering on these opportunities while overcoming challenges. Focussed on feedback and lessons learned from companies and people that are delivering practical growth – making things happen and willing to share their experiences.


As headline sponsor of the event, our O&M team will be attending and be on hand to answer any of your questions. We look forward to seeing you there.
