What is
 
solar
 
technology
?
Solar power
 
is the conversion of sunlight
 
into
 
power
. Energy from the sun can be used to 
generate
 
electricity
 
or heat
.
Photovoltaics (PV) is used to generate electricity, and utility scale PV systems are typically located in 
solar farms.
 
Using a ‘homegrown’ energy source, such as the sun, makes use of our
 
abundant natural 
resources to generate clean energy and reduces our reliance on harmful fossil fuels.
