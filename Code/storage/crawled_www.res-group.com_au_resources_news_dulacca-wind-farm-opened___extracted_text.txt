Queensland’s latest renewable success, Dulacca Wind Farm on the Western Downs, was officially opened on October 18th 2023 by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.  Co-existing on agricultural land, the project actively contributes to the Queensland Government’s target of 50% renewables by 2030 and provides much needed generation diversity on the electricity network.  As well as delivering significant economic benefits locally, the project will power the equivalent of 124,000 homes every year.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk commented:
 
“The Dulacca Wind Farm represents a significant moment in Queensland’s energy transformation, twelve months on from the establishment of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, and highlights our commitment to cleaner, cheaper energy for Queenslanders. 
We’re not just powering Queensland, we’re contributing to a global shift toward decarbonisation, and CleanCo, Queensland’s publicly owned clean energy generator is at the forefront.
This is a part of the Palaszczuk Government’s Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan which is all about a future of cheaper, cleaner, and secure energy for Queenslanders, powering good jobs across the state. Companies such as RES and Octopus will continue to play in an important role in supporting our energy transition.”
Matt Rebbeck, RES CEO Australia commented:
 
“The official opening of the Dulacca Wind Farm is a significant milestone in our mission to create a future where everyone has access to affordable zero carbon energy.  We are proud to contribute to Queensland’s renewable energy goals as well as driving local investment and employment.
 
We look forward to powering the homes and businesses around the state with clean, affordable and reliable energy from this state-of-the-art wind farm.”
We acknowledge and thank the Barunggam people, the traditional custodians of the land on which Dulacca Wind Farm stands, for their continuing engagement. The contribution of Australia’s First Nations people, to the health and wellbeing of Country, is everlasting.
Sustainable practices
The team at Dulacca Wind Farm went above and beyond in their sustainable practices, recycling 95% of steel waste and 90% of timber waste from turbine packaging as well as 15,000 cans used by workers over construction. 
Dulacca Wind Farm has demonstrated that community engagement and contribution can go further than traditional funding. While financial contributions in the form of community funds is highly valued by communities, there are other opportunities to create immediate benefits locally. Over $25,000 of steel and timber fixings were donated to the trade program in the local High School in Miles with more being picked up by businesses and locals for use on their farms and properties. Watch our community testimonial video below.
About Dulacca Wind Farm
The 180MW project houses 43 of Australia’s tallest wind turbines, standing at 230m in height (taller than the Sydney Harbour Bridge).
Dulacca Wind Farm is owned by Octopus Investments Australia. 
PPA offtaker, CleanCo Queensland has committed renewable energy from DWF to many of its largest commercial and industrial customers, including Scentre Group (Owner and Operator of Westfield in Aus and NZ), to power the iconic Westfield Shopping Centres in Queensland.
During peak construction, up to 150 workers were active on the project site with over 1,000 people providing services during the two-year construction period. 
The project additionally created further jobs through supply chain and the provision of local goods and services. 
8 permanent jobs have been created to manage the ongoing operations of the wind farm during its 30 year lifetime.
