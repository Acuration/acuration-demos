Arun Narayanan, RES CDO commented:
 “Renewable energy presents the biggest hope for us to tackle climate change and I am thrilled to be joining the innovative leader in this space. Digital transformation has the potential to improve the effectiveness and reach of renewable energy”
The news follows RES’ recent announcement of its planned acquisition of Ingeteam Service division, which upon completion will make RES the largest renewable energy support services provider in the world with £30bn (~$38bn) of assets under management.  In 2022, RES acquired Anemo Analytics to further diversify the types of services and solutions it offers its customers, complementing its existing in-house technical team and leading data-driven software solutions.
ENDS
