Gender
Together, we’re working to build the best working environment for all genders.
              Collective care             
Our supportive community provides a safe space for all gender identities and expressions.  We’re always looking for fresh ideas on how to educate and inform our colleagues and communities.
Here are some of our recent initiatives.
                    Transparency                  
                    Comprehensive gender pay and bonus gap reporting that’s available for all to see.                  
                    Parental leave                  
                    Gender neutral parental leave supports the primary caregiver regardless of gender.                   
                    Suitable PPE                  
                    People are not one-size fits all, so we provide well-fitting PPE for everyone.                   
                    STEM                  
                    Proud ambassadors of Women in STEM, empowering female representation and equality.                  
            “Acting as Chair of the Gender Affinity Network has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career so far. Seeing the hard work that my colleagues put in is truly inspiring and the changes that we have enacted as a group have been really exciting. I have met some great people, developed my skills (and self) and, hopefully, we have changed RES for the better!”
