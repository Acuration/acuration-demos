Woodland and habitat creation to boost local biodiversity by 44% forms part of the plans


RES, the world’s largest independent renewable energy company, has submitted a planning application for Kingston Solar Farm, a project with an installed capacity of 49.9 MW. The project, located near East Leake in Nottinghamshire, has been refined through several design iterations based on feedback received during the public consultation process and information gathered during detailed site survey work. The site, positioned on a gentle southern facing slope, was chosen due to its good solar irradiation levels as well as the natural screening provided by existing woodland and hedgerows.




If consented, the project will bring a number of benefits to the local community and economy, including the creation of a new path, adding to the local network of Public Rights of Way. It would also support Rushcliffe Borough Council’s goal to be carbon neutral by 2030.




Enhancing local biodiversity is important to RES and at Kingston Solar Farm a management plan will be implemented during the construction and operation to ensure new habitats are created that will offer food and shelter to wildlife. This will include the planting of new woodland covering 3.2 acres. As a result, the proposed Kingston Solar Farm is projected to have a net gain in biodiversity of 44%.




Claire Chamberlain, Development Project Manager at RES, said: 
“With the ever-growing threat of climate change and the catastrophic impacts that it could have, it is imperative that we deliver more low-cost renewable electricity as quickly as possible.


 


“Not only will Kingston help tackle climate change and support the UK’s target of net zero by 2050, but it will also deliver an estimated £164,000 in business rates annually to Rushcliffe Borough Council, supporting vital local services.”


 


If consented, Kingston Solar Farm would be capable of producing clean, green electricity for approximately 15,200 homes every year.


 


RES is active in onshore and offshore wind, solar, energy storage, transmission and distribution. In its 40-year history, RES has delivered more than 22GW of renewable energy projects across the globe.
