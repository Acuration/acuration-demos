            Safety leadership and processes are overseen at the highest level, supported by the global Safety Leadership Team (SLT).          



            We continually measure our safety performance to assess how we’re performing, advocating the reporting of ‘good catches’ and ‘near misses’ to help identify issues and prevent incidents and accidents.          









            Taking time to host quarterly safety focus events reinforces our safety commitment and provides our teams with the knowledge and understanding to do their jobs safely.
