With more 
turbines
 being 
commissioned
 than ever before
, 
maintaining turbine
 
quality 
is a critical
 element of
 
sustaining the
 expansion o
f wind power.
 
 
In this latest edition of Team Renewables, we speak to Andrew Sweenie, Quality Manage
r for Turbine Operations and Maintenance in the UK&I.
 
 
After joining RES in April 2021, Andrew 
has been involved in implementing
 ways of working across the 
team such as creating procedures and monitoring compliance, executing audits and anything else that comes his way!
 
 
Read more about Andrew in the latest #TeamRenewables:
 
 
Career Journey
 
I started off my career working in the railway industry where I developed control systems for trains. I then moved into the renewables industry working for a wind turbine manufacturer where I looked after all things electrical and SCADA for turbines in service across Northern Europe. Following that, I worked for a company managing the delivery and upgrade of software used by Distribution Network Operators to monitor and manage their networks.
 
 
What attracted you to work in the renewables industry?
 
I studied a multidisciplinary degree in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and had enjoyed working across various systems in the railway industry. I was initially attracted to working in the wind industry from a technical perspective considering the diverse technical work I was able to get involved with. I also wanted to work in an industry where I would be doing something meaningful and making a positive contribution to the environment.
 
 
What are you most proud of at RES?
 
During my time at RES the O&M team has continued to grow, successfully taking on 
several
 challenging new projects and I’m proud to have played a part in the success of that. 
There are
 always opportunities to learn and improve, and the team embraces that culture.
 
 
I enjoy seeing something I’ve worked on out in the real world, be that sitting on a train that I helped design or passing by operational wind farms that I’ve worked on. Friends and family are maybe a little less enthused when I’m pointing out some of the finer nuances of a train or wind turbine, but that’s their loss!
 
 
Where do you see your career in 5 years’ time? 
 
There are a lot of wind farms consented, under construction, and already in operation that need looking after for many years to come. The O&M business has an impressive multi-platform service offering which is continuing to grow. My role involves ensuring that we continue to deliver to the same high standards that we have done up until now. With the growth in this area of the business, I expect that I will be kept busy for some years to come!
 
 
A day in the 
life
? 
 
Every day is different. I could be carrying out an audit on one of our wind
 
farms, creating or updating procedures, tracking compliance to our processes, implementing and monitoring process improvements and 
standardisation
, supporting the onboarding of new wind
 
farms, meeting with clients, or working with colleagues from across the RES business on various projects.
 
 
What do you enjoy most about your job? 
 
I enjoy the variety 
of the role
 and getting to work with a lot of talented people with a diverse range of experience. Collaboration is so important and there’s a lot to be gained from sharing knowledge and experience. I’ve had unexpected discussions on site that subsequently led to process changes that then benefit the whole team. 
Similarly,
 when I find myself with a particular challenge, there’s always plenty of colleagues that are willing to 
help out
, or at least point me the direction of someone who can. There’s a 
really positive
 culture at RES and that is a big part of job satisfaction for me.  
 
 
 
How do you see your role and the industry evolving over the next few years with the growth in the renewables industry?
 
Quality affects everything we do and is one of RES’
 strategic objectives. Ensuring that we meet our quality objectives helps ensure that the turbines keep spinning,
 
compliance
 is upheld
 and 
ultimately,
 we
 
provide
 a 
professional
 and valuable
 
service to our c
lients
. 
 
 
The importance of quality only increases with the growth of the business as we ensure that we meet the same standards and 
deliver
 the same high level of service across 
all of our wind farms.
 
 
Do you have any h
obbie
s or in
terests
?
 
I’m a keen musician and play clarinet with 
a number of
 orchestras and chamber music groups
 around Scotland
.
 
A few years ago
,
 I w
ent on tour to Germany with an orchestra
,
 where I w
as fortunate enough to 
be the soloist in Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto
 – that was 
definitely 
a
 musical highlight for me!
