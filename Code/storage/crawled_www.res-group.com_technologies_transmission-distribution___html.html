Transmission & distribution


We’re supporting energy production from the ground up – offering a range of comprehensive services from new installations to maintenance and emergency restoration for a safer, more reliable grid.






















What is
 
transmission & distribution
?


Transmission & distribution networks move electricity to the grid and then on to end 
consumers.


This infrastructure is crucial: it powers local homes and businesses,
 
ensures energy is continually 
available, and creates a stable, reliable network.






































Why RES?


Our broad range of solutions deliver energy when and where it’s needed for a safer, more reliable grid.  We install, maintain, and restore projects in locations all over the US.  We’re committed to reducing grid congestion and in turn, cutting down on risk and improving safe and efficient distribution of energy.




























US emergency restoration


Supporting storm and emergency needs throughout the country.




























Substation expertise


Applying wealth of experience in substation EPC and construction.




























Technical expertise


Experience across complex projects gives us the expertise to deliver successful projects.




























Reliable and knowledgeable


Highly skilled, dedicated people prioritise safety and quality.
