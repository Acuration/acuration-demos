Modern Slavery
		            Modern Slavery		          
			            RES GROUP WEBSITE			          
Modern Slavery Act 2015 – Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
We are a global company developing, constructing and operating utility-scale renewable energy projects and infrastructure. We are the parent company of RES Group (“RES”). The company is headquartered in the UK and operates in 14 countries, with each country being led by a country manager with input from RES Group senior management.
The founding principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “MSA”) align with our organisation’s values and our board of directors support the principles of the MSA within our business practices. RES procurement policies take account of the principles behind relevant global initiatives including the UN Global Compact and Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code. This statement will act as the baseline of our commitment to try to ensure that modern slavery does not exist in our supply chain.
RES recently joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) to strengthen its commitment to sustainable business practices.
RES works with a broad supply chain including specialist equipment manufacturers. We believe that our suppliers should be working to ensure modern slavery does not occur. This includes our suppliers’ subcontractors, who may use temporary and agency employees.
RES periodically reviews risks in relation to modern slavery and has focused on major suppliers with a global manufacturing footprint, such as suppliers of wind turbines and electrical equipment to our projects. We have reviewed the modern slavery issue with some of our closest partners in this sector and examples of measures taken by some of them include:
Membership of UN Global Compact
Publication of human rights policies
Establishment of sustainability committees, codes of conduct and communication routes for staff specifically relating to business ethics
Performance of social and environmental due diligence of projects
Implementation of a responsible supply chain management system, which includes code of conduct to suppliers, monitoring of their suppliers, audits and follow-up.
In assessing the risk in relation to modern slavery we are working with suppliers of major equipment to identify any component manufacturing or sourcing from countries that could be considered higher risk (by reference to the latest edition of The Global Slavery Index). We have identified that the vast majority of RES’ project development, construction and operation activities are all taking place in countries considered relatively low-risk and take the steps set out above in relation to the activities of our supply chain.
RES has published guidance to staff in relation to raising concerns regarding business ethics and whistleblowing and commits to addressing these effectively. Policies relating to sustainable procurement and modern slavery are also available to all staff on the company intranet.
This statement is approved by the board of Renewable Energy Systems Limited (on behalf of all other companies within RES). The content of this statement has also been shared with other relevant internal stakeholders.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the MSA and constitutes RES slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31st October 2022.
This statement remains largely unchanged from the previous year as RES has not identified any additional measures or necessary changes in the intervening period.
