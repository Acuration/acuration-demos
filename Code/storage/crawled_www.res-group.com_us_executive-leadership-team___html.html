                    About                  


While at university in the late 80s, Dominic studied the then-emerging field of environmental law, and started his private practice legal career with a particular focus on pollution control in the UK and the USA. Moving from the environmental field into the low-carbon energy sector was a natural step, after gaining experience in the European industry. Dominic joined RES nearly 20 years ago, starting out as RES’ sole in-house lawyer.


Now, Dominic is responsible for legal matters across the company. He also helps implement the Group’s compliance programmes and risk management processes. He is most proud of the team he has helped build at RES, and has thoroughly enjoyed spending two decades working with passionate, gifted and motivated colleagues to drive the future of the renewables sector forward.
