Watch RES Apprenticeship Program Administer talk about her passion for the program and the success of the people in it.
              Not all industries are vital to people’s daily lives. Those who work in renewable energy know they’re part of something bigger. The safe, reliable production and delivery of electricity is crucial to communities, and qualified, dedicated workers are in high demand.            
Long before the Inflation Reduction Act, we recognized the value of apprenticeships to the growth and development of our people and to the future of our RES and to clean energy. Since our program began nearly a decade ago, it has grown and expanded to meet the growing demands of the company and the industry.
            We’ve done all we can to make our program military-friendly…to build a place that gives our military veterans their next opportunity in the private sector while respecting and appreciating what they bring to the table from their military experience.
