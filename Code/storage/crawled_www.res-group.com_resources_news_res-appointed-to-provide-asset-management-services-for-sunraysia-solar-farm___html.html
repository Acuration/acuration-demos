Asset Management






Solar
























 
RES has secured the Management Services Agreement for Sunraysia Solar Farm, a 200MW solar farm in New South Wales, Australia. The project was delivered into full operations earlier this month and RES’ Asset Management team will continue operations, supporting the asset owners in maximising value from the plant.  


Lead by their experienced Asset Management team, RES’ 24×7 Control Centre will manage the NEM market activities while providing operational communications with AEMO and plant monitoring. RES’s local plant performance specialists will explore further optimisation opportunities to improve the plant’s performance and maximise return on investment for the asset owners, drawing on extensive knowledge of the Australian market and a history of global experience.


Grant Harris, RES’ Director of Asset Management, Asia Pacific commented:


“
We are privileged to have the opportunity to partner with Sunraysia Solar Farm 
and congratulate them for reaching substantial completion of Sunraysia Solar Farm. Our dedicated team will work closely with the asset owners to get the best from this project. RES’ strong, in-house optimisation expertise will ensure we respond to the challenges and opportunities to be found across the Australian electricity market, as they emerge.” 


“This management services contract is a sign of the continued growth of the RES construction and asset management team in Australia, as well as our ambition to further strengthen RES’ relationships with global and local investors to improve the performance and value of their Australian wind, solar and storage projects.”


RES, the largest 3
rd
 party asset manager in the Australian market, now manages over 3GW of renewable assets in the Australian market whilst also supporting over 9GW of operational wind, solar and storage assets globally.


In Australia, RES employs over 100 people and has offices in Sydney and Melbourne and multiple regional locations. RES is engaged in all technologies: wind, solar and storage and offer development plus construction and asset management services across Australia. To date, RES has managed a portfolio of 3GW of wind and solar assets in Australia.
