The RES team is excited to announce that it has secured the Management Services Agreement for Merredin Solar Farm, a 100MW solar farm in Western Australia. Alongside the 3GW of assets RES is managing across the National Electricity Market, the Merredin asset management agreement re-enforces RES’ growing presence in the Wholesale Electricity Market. 
Merredin Solar Farm is the first Australian project to be acquired by Indonesian company SUN Energy, a commercial and industrial-focused solar developer. To date, SUN Energy has recorded the ownership of over 280 MWp of solar energy projects in Asia Pacific, including Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, and Australia. SUN Energy has engaged the RES team to provide full-scope asset management services, leveraging the company’s extensive experience and established Australian team, including 20 technical/engineering specialists. 
Grant Harris, Director of RES Asset Management for Asia Pacific commented: “RES is the ideal partner for SUN Energy and new investors in the Australian market. Our 35-strong Australian Asset Management team combines a wealth of experience, knowledge and established connections with industry, with a relentless focus on improving the performance of renewable energy projects, given the unique challenges Australian projects face.” 
50% of energy from Merredin Solar Farm has been purchased by multi-national mining, metals and gas company, BHP, to reduce the emissions of their smelters. Chief Executive Officer of SUN Energy, Phillip Lee states, “Aligning with our extensive business growth these past years, SUN Energy needs to ensure operations run smoothly by choosing the right partner to benefit the performance and generation of Merredin Solar Farm. Accordingly, this partnership will support SUN Energy in becoming a trusted global partner and provider of solar energy.”
