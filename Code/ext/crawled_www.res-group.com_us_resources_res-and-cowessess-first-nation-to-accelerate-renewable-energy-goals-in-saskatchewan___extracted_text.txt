Bekevar Wind L.P. Partnership secures 200 MW Wind Power Purchase Agreement with SaskPower
RES (
Renewable Energy Systems
) and partner Cowessess First Nation are pleased to announce a tender award with SaskPower for a 200 MW wind project located south of Kipling, in southeastern Saskatchewan.
The 200 MW Bekevar Wind Energy Project will consist of approximately 40 turbines, underground medium-voltage electrical collector system, access roads, a substation, two permanent meteorological towers, and an operations and maintenance building.  SaskPower is expected to build a 10km long transmission line to connect the project to the provincial grid. The turbines are planned on a 20,000 acre area that overlaps with the RMs of Hazelwood and Kingsley, and about 500 acres of reserve land.
The project will produce enough electricity to power approximately 100,000 homes and plays a significant part in de-carbonizing the Saskatchewan power generation fleet by displacing coal power dispatched by SaskPower.  Bekevar Wind Energy Project will help the province achieve the federal target of phasing out conventional coal generation by 2030 and help SaskPower meet its target of 50% reduction of emissions from 2005 levels by 2030.
The project benefits of the Bekevar Wind Energy Project include:
Providing affordable, zero-carbon electricity to Saskatchewan for 
25
 
years
Annual property and school tax revenues
Annual lease payments and/or royalties to participating landowners
Construction and operational jobs and support services during construction and throughout the life of the project
Contracting opportunities for local businesses
Increased local spending on goods and services during project development, construction, and operational phases
Indigenous ownership, in addition to commitment to Indigenous employment and subcontracting
The project is owned by Bekevar Wind L.P. a partnership between Renewable Energy Systems Canada Inc. (RES) and Awasis Nehiyawewini Energy Development, a wholly owned Cowessess First Nation entity. Construction on the project is expected to begin in the summer of 2022 and is slated for completion by the end of 2023.
“Saskatchewan is an ideal place to build some of the most cost-effective wind power in the world.  With many world-class renewables companies qualified to bid, the tender was highly competitive and RES and its partner, Cowessess First Nation, strove to deliver best value to SaskPower,” said Peter Clibbon, RES Senior VP of Development. 
“W
e are committed to delivering a quality project on schedule and deliver significant economic benefits to the host communities.”
“Cowessess First Nation has been pursuing utility scale wind energy development since the incorporation of ANEDC in 2010.  This is the third Request for Proposal in nine years Cowessess has bid into SaskPower with our partners.  To be awarded the Bekevar project in collaboration with RES is a milestone for our First Nation, which helps continue to lead Indigenous renewable energy development in Saskatchewan.” Said Chief Cadmus Delorme.  “We look forward to utilizing what Mother Earth has granted us with, while working with RES to help Saskatchewan achieve the desired carbon reduction targets.”
