sustainability demand response saves energy while minimizing the impact on manufacturing activities the need the solution the benefits location 25 production sites at ontario canada customer linamar corporation sector manufacture customer information this linamar corporation case study is based on a project developed in enel x north america linamar corporation linamar corporation based in ontario canada has grown from a small machining company to a global supplier of vehicle mobility and industrial equipment with 37 manufacturing facilities worldwide the company designs and manufactures highprecision metal components for the vehicle and power market worldwide as well as elevating vehicles and equipment for the industrial sector the need as linamar has grown so has its yearly energy usage  this dynamic presented a paradox for the environmentallyconscious company linamar was eager to minimize its energy usage as much as possible but did not want to impede its manufacturing operations linamar was keen to reduce energy usage wherever possible but with 25 separate facilities across ontario knowing where to begin was an intimidating challenge linamars plan to reduce plant utilization was based on two requirements 1 employee safety at all times and 2 no disruption to the manufacturing process  the solution to solve linamars needs and participate in the demand response enel x worked with each plant manager to determine the appropriate level of commitment for each plant and proposed an energy conservation plan customized for each site therefore when a demand response dispatch occurs linamar practices nonoperational curtailment measures such as reducing air conditioning in the plants front offices dimming lights and reducing the air cycle schedule in the plants the benefits for most manufacturing companies the financial incentives from demand response prompt them to pursue a full or partial shutdown of manufacturing processes while the crews are deployed to other activities like equipment maintenance for linamar though enel x was able to identify substantial energy reductions outside of core manufacturing processes so linamar enjoys the financial rewards of demand response without disruption to its business linamars facilities can now provide 24 mw of energy reduction to earn the company hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual payments a lot of our decisionmaking processes are greenconscious said tony luis linamars director of purchasing the demand response program is just another element of how we do things here we appreciate the financial benefits but we also learn about our business effect on our electricity usage often individual plants will challenge themselves to continue curtailment even longer than the official dispatch period we take certain measures to reduce electricity during curtailment but now plants are asking themselves can we do these things over longer periods 24 mw of energy reduction 25 facilities note in japan
