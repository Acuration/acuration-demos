benefits of distributed energy resources surya panditi april 4 2022 surya panditi is the president and ceo of enel x north america today he is sharing his thoughts on how revisions to ferc order 2222 could increase the benefits from distributed energy resources participating in wholesale energy markets in september 2020 when the federal energy regulatory commission ferc released ferc order no 2222 our team at enel x was in full celebration mode the order requires system operators to remove barriers for distributed energy resources ders like rooftop solar panels and onsite batteries to participate in wholesale energy markets its a win for fair competition and energy costs a win for sustainability and above all  a win for grid reliability but now that system operators have officially begun submitting their compliance filings its clear there is still some work to be done if were going to truly level the playing field for ders and unlock their full value thats not to discredit the hard work of those system operators but i dont want to see the opportunity of order 2222 pass us by what are ders and whats the benefit of them fully participating in the wholesale market ders give grid operators flexible resources to tap into to meet our electricity needs especially during peak demand hours like in the evening when solar production stops and households ramp up their energy use ders such as demand response energy storage rooftop solar and electric vehicles can contribute energy to stabilize the grid quickly cleanly and costeffectively an example we often use at enel x is a fleet of electric school buses thats enrolled in virtual power plant services when those buses are charged a grid operator could tap into the fleets batteries to provide energy for a neighboring community in this scenario where ders are fully integrated into the wholesale market the school district earns revenue for its contribution to the grid and overall energy costs go down since we avoided the need for expensive and highemitting backup power plants so what comes next for ferc order 2222 as more grid operators submit their order 2222 compliance filings and ferc reviews the proposals i strongly urge the commission to push for the following revisions in its response 1 open participation at the submeter level some system operators are proposing that wholesale settlements only be allowed at customers main meters  those installed on the side of a house or building however the meters needed for settlement purposes are expensive and many customers dont have them installed this raises the barrier to entry especially for residential households where the proper meter would cost hundreds of dollars if system operators would allow ders with embedded metering such as ev smart chargers and smart thermostats to be used for settlement it would open opportunities for many more residential and commercial customers to participate in the wholesale market 2 embrace der aggregation across multiple transmission nodes when we bundle together hundreds or thousands of smallscale ders across a large area it allows us to bid that aggregated capacity into wholesale markets there are two major benefits to aggregation  it mitigates risk for each individual customer who participates in the group and it allows aggregators to meet the minimum size thresholds for wholesale participation however with system operators proposing to limit that aggregation to a single transmission node read small geographic area instead of allowing multinodal aggregation we wont be able to tap into the full potential of ders 3 roll back sweeping restrictions on netmetered customers residential and commercial customers with solar panels can enroll in netmetering programs which compensate them for supplying power back into the grid pjm and caiso both want to restrict these customers from receiving additional credit for their grid injections that come from other ders like energy storage or demand response this leaves critical capacity on the table while also discouraging netmetered customers from combining their solar with other flexibility solutions again this type of sweeping prohibition is limiting market participation for ders and holding us back from realizing their full benefits and value the approval of ferc order 2222 was a landmark moment in energy regulation and an enormous step forward for the prospect of a 100 clean and reliable grid but without taking these three final steps the growth and competition of ders will remain severely hindered related stories
