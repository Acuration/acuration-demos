according to the hawaii state energy office with the highest rooftop solar penetration in the country hawaii is a fantastic match for our smart charging platform to dynamically balance electricity loads said preston roper  head of enel x emobility north america through our partnership with hawaiian electric companies and the elemental excelerator we are reinforcing the critical role that smart charging has towards scaling renewable energy in a sustainable and economical way this project will focus on maximizing charging in the middle of the day when solar generation is highest and reducing charging on days of high electricity demand in the evening hours via enel xs awardwinning juicenet platform the juicenet platform matches drivers historical charging patterns realtime input and signals from utility grid operators to aggregate and manage charging station demand allowing ev drivers to contribute by charging at times when electricity costs are lower and renewable energy is most available for residents and businesses with hawaiian electrics timeofuse rate plan smart charging could result in lower overall charging costs for ev owners and an option to charge with the cleanest power available  electric vehicles renewable energy resources and our electricity grid are all key members of an ensemble like in an orchestra all three of these technologies must play in concert to rapidly transition to clean local energy  dawn lippert ceo at elemental excelerator  this project deploys the software and connectivity backbone to help unlock that future which is why in 2017
