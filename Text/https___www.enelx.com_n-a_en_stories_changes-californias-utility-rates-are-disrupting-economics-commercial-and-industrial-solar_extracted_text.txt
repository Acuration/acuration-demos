excerpt from the new whitepaper published by microgrid knowledge and enel x north america californias changing timeofuse rates calculating the impact on behindthemeter solar pv and energy storage for utilities electricity is generally more expensive and complex to deliver when demand is high to help cover these costs californias utilities have traditionally imposed timeofuse tou rates which created a daily schedule that applies different prices for power based on demand trends on the grid when demand is highest prices are highest under tou rates in the past daily grid demand ramped up in the morning peaked from noon into the early afternoon as temperatures and air conditioning usage increased and then gradually decreased as the day progressed though there is some additional nuance to the scheduling californias utilities have long scheduled onpeak hours during which rates were the highestfrom around 11 am to about 6 pm offpeak hours meanwhile were generally applied through the other hours of the day for utilities tou rates helped increase revenue to cover the high costs of delivering power when demand was high for energy consumers this created an incentive to minimize reliance on the grid for power during onpeak hours this has long been a significant part of the value of onsite solar photovoltaics pv for the states large energy consumers the hours when solar generation is at its highest levels happen to coincide with the onpeak hours enabling large energy users to rely on their onsite solar power and avoid exposure to several hours of high onpeak rates every day however the rise of solar power generation in the state both behindthemeter and at the utility scalehas disrupted the dynamics of the supply mix supporting californias electric grid utilities are adapting to these new realities with changes to their tou rate schedules which will have a significant impact on the business case for behindthemeter solar pv and energy storage systems californias utilities respond to the duck curve from 2007 to 2017 utilityscale solar power generation in california grew from 557 gwh to 24353 gwh according to the us energy information administration eia this rapid increase has created a number of serious challenges for the states utilities which rely largely on natural gas generation to supply the majority of power on the grid solar production increases in the late morning hours and peaks around noon before tailing off in the late afternoon and early evening this reduces demand for natural gas during the midday hours when utilities traditionally imposed higher onpeak tou rates then as solar power generation diminishes in the late afternoon hours utilities face a spike in demand for power from natural gas californias independent system operator caiso illustrated this trend in the graph below which is now commonly known as the duck curve the duck curve creates several challenges for utilities the first is accommodating the lateafternoon spike in demand this often requires a reliance on natural gas peaker plants which can generate power quickly but are expensive to operate on a regular basis compounding the cost problem is that much of this early evening spike in demand falls outside of the traditional onpeak hours when utilities could expect to make up the high cost of delivering power in addition to the high costs the reduction in midday demand has depressed a traditional source of revenue for natural gas generators while high levels of solar production have decreased electricity prices sometimes leading to negative prices in response californias utilities have begun adjusting their tou rate schedules to account for the duck curve san diego gas  electric sdge shifted onpeak hours for its summer season to 4 pm9 pm from its previous schedule of 11 am6 pm pacific gas  electric pge and southern california edison sce are expected to implement the same schedule for onpeak hours in 2019 under these new schedules the utilities apply onpeak rates when demand for natural gas spikes in the late afternoon to early evening hours helping them adapt to the economic realities of the duck curve for the states large energy consumers meanwhile the shift disrupts the economics of behindthemeter solar pv and energy storage for additional insight into how these changes affect the business case for standalone
