coowner and cfo of hunt imaging michael stanek is always looking for ways to earn more revenue when he was introduced to demand response he instantly knew this was a straightforward opportunity to impact the bottomline for his company in pjm demand response large energy users are paid when they agree to reduce their energy demand during times of grid stress true grid emergencies are rare in pjm the energy region hunt is located independing on the area these events occur a handful of times a year or less why hunt needed a better provider stanek immediately saw that dr was a good decisionbut that hunt had chosen the wrong partner to enroll their facility in the program stanek was disappointed by nearly every aspect of his first demand response provider almost everything was terrible stanek said the communication was horrible the transparency was nonexistentthere was a secretive backroom feeling and i never felt i was getting the full story the reporting they gave me on my performance was absolutely abhorrent essentially every aspect with them was poor other than the fact that they did get me my payments on a timely basis the benefits of the enel x experience eventually stanek decided hed had enough and started looking for other demand response providers hes involved in a wide variety of different community boards and organizations and one of those organizations is the council of small enterprises cose the small business expert organization of northeast ohio the vice president of energy services at cose suggested to stanek he explore enel x one of the oldest demand response providers in the world from the start stanek said enel x and hunt imaging was a much better partnership anyone who knows me knows ill tell you if somethings not right but i give praise where its due he said with enel x its been night and day compared to our previous provider from start to finish enel x has delivered stanek said hes been happy with nearly every step of the process with enel x right from the beginning sales the sales process was great from the startthe enel x salesperson was extremely thorough explained things well and made them very clear she provided comparisons and was very transparent so that i was very comfortable with what enel x was offering onboarding the onboarding was amazingly thoroughit took us through all parts of the website which is a fabulous tool and offers us so much information at our fingertips meter installation the thirdparty that came out and did the installation was super to work with dr preparedness the information i received prior to the demand response audit this year was timely and thorough and the reminders and tips that were sent in emails beforehand were helpful i was also astounded at how quickly performance data was relayed back to methe information was given to me as it occurred almost in real time customer service it was fabulous to have all that information we felt that we were being treated as a valued customer and that enel x was a true partner with us in the program participating in demand response has been simple for hunt thus far the company is well prepared for audits and when they shut down it has no major effect on operations the impact of the shutdowns for audits stanek says has been nominal changing the way they think about energy stanek says not only has enel x come through on delivering a valuable demand response experience there have been unforeseen benefits too enel x provides realtime energy use data as part of its demand response program and stanek says they intend to leverage that more in the future weve had the opportunity to utilize the online reporting that enel x provides us to monitor our usage every day not just in relation to demand response but for regular production challenges he said were still getting used to how to make the best use of that information but we do value having it there so we can continue to use it for the benefit of
