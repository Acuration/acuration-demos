grant to unlock flexible demand in the commercial refrigeration sector enel x australia is the recipient of arena grant funding to support flexible demand projects in small commercial refrigeration melbourne 18 july 2023  enel x australia enel x has been awarded a 37 million grant from the australian renewable energy agency arena to support flexible demand solutions in the small commercial and industrial refrigeration sectors commercial and industrial refrigeration provide an ideal source of flexible demand on a large scale with an estimated 500 mw of potential flexible demand in refrigeration across australias national electricity market enel x is recruiting 440 commercial refrigeration facilities across supermarket grocery beverage convenience and last mile logistics to deliver much needed flexible demand capacity to support australias renewable energy transition enel xs unlocking flexible demand in the commercial refrigeration sector program will aggregate more than 20 mw of flexible demand from businesses across the national electricity market the sites will participate in enel xs virtual power plant vpp and provide services to support australias electricity system the businesses involved will support the safe and reliable supply of electricity to all consumers and be financially rewarded for doing so via enel xs vpp flexible demand is the coordinated orchestration of electrical load to ease pressure on the grid as variable renewable sources like wind and solar produce a greater share of australias electricity generation solutions are required to help match up supply and demand energy storage is one part of the equation but shifting demand away from peak times and reducing demand at critical times can complement this and reduce the overall cost of energy refrigeration like other forms of heating and cooling offers a valuable source of flexible demand due to the thermal mass of facilities maintaining temperature even when refrigerators and chillers are ramped down small changes to power usage can have a large impact when aggregated at scale with no noticeable change for users or impact to product quality enel x has engaged a tier 1 grocery chain as an initial supermarket customer for this project with a 20store pilot with potential to extend to up to 250 stores participating in the vpp lineage logistics refrigerated warehouses will also take part in the project at 13 refrigerated warehouse sites enel x is actively sourcing other businesses with varied refrigeration applications to participate in the program arena established by the australian government has the purpose to support the transition to net zero emissions by accelerating the pace of precommercial innovation to the benefit of australian consumers businesses and workers arena ceo darren miller said the project can pave the way for further investment in flexible demand  our electricity grid is changing and a more variable supply requires more flexible demand  mr miller said  commercial refrigeration can unlock this on a greater scale than the household level so were excited to see the enel x project rolled out across australian supermarkets and other businesses with refrigeration we want to see projects like this demonstrate to the market the benefits of flexible demand  to electricity users and the grid by demonstrating and proving the technology to prospective users were hoping to see more and more electricity users look to it as an attractive option  enel x operates australias largest virtual power plant which aggregates flexible demand battery storage backup generation and electric mobility resources to support the grid and firm the supply of renewable power jeff renaud managing director of enel x apac  noted that  the energy market needs new ways to balance renewables and businesses need new ways to reduce energy costs with arenas support we will prove that smallscale refrigeration systems when plugged into a virtual power plant can make a largescale contribution to the renewable energy transition  demand response media release 3 related content enel x continues to lead wholesale electricity
