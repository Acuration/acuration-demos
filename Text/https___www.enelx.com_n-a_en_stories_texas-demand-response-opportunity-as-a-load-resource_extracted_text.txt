businesses an easy way to earn money for their facilities while protecting the local energy grid from disruptions in texass energyonly market businesses have many options for participating in demand response but ercot  the texas energy grid operator  offers two primary programs for commercial and industrial customers the emergency response service ers program provides grid relief in 10 or 30minutes and load resource lr ancillary services programs which provide immediate support to the ercot grid while earnings in ers are determined by a triannual auction lr earnings are determined by dayahead ancillary services prices yeartoyear lr earnings vary but are consistently around 100000mwyear most lrs in ercot participate in the responsive reserves rrs market lr participants maximize earnings while protecting onsite equipment a healthy grid in the united states operates at 60 hz when frequency drops below 60hz facilities are exposed to a frequency imbalance that could potentially damage valuable equipment and could cause sudden grid blackouts lrs on the ercot system are calibrated to automatically respond if the ercot system reaches 597 hz enel x provides lr customers with underfrequency relays ufrs that protect and insulate facilities from dangerous drops in frequency on the grid by enrolling as a load resource participants are paid not only to help support the grid by resolving local frequency imbalances but to protect their own facility lr events happen at most a few times a year but because lr is a localized resource  ercot may dispatch only a small number of localized facilities to alleviate grid imbalances in a specific area  many participants experience no events even without an lr event participants earn payments as a standby resource load resources are an important tool in texass changing energy landscape lr programs provide critical and fastacting energy reductions in the face of extreme grid instability and as a result are often the most lucrative demand response programs for texas businesses lr payments in texas increased 172 between 2017 and 2019 driven in part by extreme heat waves in the summer of 2019 and although payments increased no lr event actually occurred to understand why lr is so valuable its important to understand the unique energy landscape in texas unlike other regional grids texass grid is essentially an island energy is rarely imported from or exported to other grids that structure coupled with two key energy trends below make fastresponse resources like lr more important than ever growing peak demand  peak demand levels are growing in texas and while many other states rely on energy imports at times of peak demand ercot meets peak demand with local generation and demand response resources in august 2019 a severe heat wave caused peak demand to spike to a record 74153 mw  driving realtime energy prices above 9000mwh growth in renewable energy another feature of the ercot system is the growing penetration of renewable energy  especially wind power  as a generation source in texas wind powers intermittent generation compounds the challenges of meeting record high peak demand and reinforces the importance of local demand response resources the two ers 30 demand response dispatch events that occurred in 2019 coincided with a dropoff in wind generation which caused a large volume of supply to become suddenly unavailable for more details on texas load resources including who can participate how your business benefits and the dispatch process check out our faq or contact
