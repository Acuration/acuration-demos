spend for the district michael smith director of operations for the ritenour school district is in charge of facilities including their maintenance security operations and construction he is always looking for ways to help the district save money on operations the solution enel x introduced missouris business demand response bdr programs it provides payments to large energy users who agree to reduce their energy demand during grid stress when enel x explained it the benefits were clear right away and he knew it was a great opportunity the enel x team has been very supportivetheyve called me personally several times and they provide excellent service theyve always been polite and explained exactly what they need and why its a really great partnership that we have ive recommended enel x demand response to other school districts and mentioned it to other directors of operations the benefits significant payments receiving payments is always a plus smith said its important for us to be good stewards of the financial resources that our community provides for the school district so receiving a rebate for saving electricity is a win for the school district responsible energy use the benefits are not only financialsmith said the school district tries to be a model of responsible energy use for environmental reasons too and demand response helps in a variety of ways including contributing to a more reliable local electric grid in a district with so many young people the school wants to ensure they set a positive example we want to use our natural resources responsibly smith said we have solar panels on our schools we do our best to set good examples for students and saving on electricity and using less electricity is a simple way to start no interruptions to operations smith said that enrolling in dr was a simple process and he has seen little disruption on the few occasions the schools have participated in a demand response event  demand response doesnt affect our normal operations much smith said when we receive a call to participate its usually near the end of our school day and since its usually during a time of year when were using cooling systems all we have to do is make adjustments to the settings on our hvac and make sure lights are turned off although we turn them on when we clean classrooms that evening just those two simple things have been enough for us to see energy savings you can spend a lot of money on energy and electricity every month so every little bit helps reinvesting the savings for repairs smith said theyre able to use their demand response payments to help make important upgrades to energy efficiency elsewhere in their facilities our utility payments all come out of the operations budget so when we save money on electricity it allows us to spend a little bit more on general repairs for instance if we had a failing hvac system we can use the money we save and the money from rebates to replace it and that increases our hvac efficiency even more note this ritenour school district case study is based on work with enel x and ritenour school district in usa in japan enel x supports global and local
