companys energy management challenges many of the beal companies tenants are leading life sciences firms telecommunications firms and data centers with very specific energy needs these tenants pose a dual challengethey require uninterrupted electricity and steady temperatures and they are demanding about the price of energy in 2007 the beal companies partnered with enel x to identify a new energy purchasing strategy its goals were to eliminate spikes in energy costs since rising costs also raise the risk of losing tenants it was also interested in engaging in new more advantageous and longerterm energy contracts enel x began with a buildingbybuilding review of the beal companies portfolio which took into account the energy usage patterns and unique needs of each property it

market expertise careful market monitoring and competitive bidding enel x delivers more than 1 million in annual savings to the beal companiesprotecting tenants and keeping the company competitive the tenant is king for the beal companies energy management and tenant satisfaction go hand in hand since energy costs are passed on to tenants one of the first questions potential tenants ask is about the cost of electricity says dean leventman director of financial analysis for the beal companies if they can find a better deal elsewhere youve lost a new tenant and when you give a tenant an electricity budget it has to be good if you go way over budget you lose tenants and get a very bad reputation within the beal companies the responsibility for managing energy falls to leventman who put his training as a cpa and financial analyst to work on analyzing and managing energy costs for the companys portfolio he knows the risks of higher energy costs well im the one who bills tenants for utilities so i know what happens when there are energy spikes he says and it isnt pretty for example in 2005 energy prices doubled for many tenants we vowed that this would never happen again says leventman for years the beal companieslike many commercial energy buyerssimply purchased energy from its utility at market rates we knew we were paying too much but we didnt really know what the alternatives were says leventman who soon became the companys unofficial energy czar i had all these crazy spreadsheets that helped me try to figure out better ways of managing energy since i was the guy who got most of the unhappy calls when prices went up but our energy management was fairly limited in 2007 driven by the need to reduce risk and manage energy more carefully the beal companies partnered with enel x to manage purchasing options and associated risks enel x began by taking a careful look at the beal companies portfolio of real estate holdings examining the specific use patterns and needs of each building as well as assessing risk across the portfolio much like financial planning energy management requires diversification and risk management to ensure success during

services team explored and explained the options that were available to the beal companies including rates and term lengths and the team made proactive recommendations designed to reduce energy costs

an ongoing basis and enel x was our trusted advisor throughout the whole process ultimately leventman and the beal companies see energy as a critical element of its business strategyas important as mortgage rates budgets and other purely financial decisions after all energy costs have a direct impact on the bottom line the results enel xs energy purchasing strategy for the beal companies combines fixed pricing and fixed price energy with pass thrutwo approaches that limit exposure to volatile energy prices after competitive bidding and contract negotiations were complete enel x delivered annual savings of more than 1 million across the beal companies portfolio it also reduced risk with longterm contracts these results were good news for the beal companies and its tenants our tenants are very pleased at the energy prices that enel x was able to get for us says leventman and in this economy if youre a landlord and your tenants are happy thats great the benefits the 1 million in annual savings enel x achieves for the beal companies is significant since stable lower energy costs are extremely attractive to the companys highprofile tenants ultimately these savings are passed on directly to its tenants helping ensure their ongoing satisfaction other benefits include a customized strategy enel x worked closely with the beal companies to develop a customized energy strategy that reflected the unique needs of its portfolio of properties enel x learned the nuances of each property and its energy needs and responded with an encompassing strategy that met the beal companies overall needsless risk and lower energy costs more control everyone in our industry is nervous about energy prices says leventman theres a lot of uncertainty now and the last thing we
