solar panels for a total installed capacity of 21 kwp 1  mounted in the charging area thanks to this overall system encompassing storage alongside photovoltaics the power input requested from the grid during charging is limited to 45 kw under normal operating conditions the mu is a moveable 10 kw dc charger powered by the smu and equipped with a 6 kwh embedded storage system that enables the unit to top up the bikes while in the pit lane and starting grid specifically the mu enables a sevenminute final charge on the starting grid allowing the bikes to cover a greater distance than in previous seasons during the charging session in the epaddock the juiceroll race edition can supply the bikes with up to as much as 1 mw spread across 20 chargers requesting only 100 kw from the solar panels and the grid under normal operating conditions thanks to the chargers embedded storage system if needed the batteries allow the chargers to work without grid connection as they are able to compensate any power drops or blackouts from the grid and still safely charge the bikes other new distinctive features of the juiceroll race edition include the following the mu can power electric tire warmers while in the epaddock pit lane and starting grid as well as during transfers between these areas as keeping tires warm is key for optimal bike performance the overall system is remotely monitored and
