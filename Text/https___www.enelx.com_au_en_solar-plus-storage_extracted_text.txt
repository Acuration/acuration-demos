power by pairing it with battery storage watch video what is solarstorage save money maximise renewables boost resiliency flexible financing what is solarplusstorage solarplusstorage is the integration of a battery energy storage system with a solar photovoltaic pv power system by adding a battery businesses can see far greater benefits than with solar alone solarplusstorage will reduce energy costs improve renewable energy use and will provide greater resilience in case of a power outage increase the value of your solar system when a battery is paired with a new or existing solar system it significantly increases the value of the system as a whole while solar offers inexpensive energy from a renewable source without the assistance of a battery its usefulness can be limited at night or during cloudy days a battery can optimise when solar or grid energy is used and allows excess solar power to be stored for future use when peak demand charges are high or when the grid is down solarplusstorage offers both economic and environmental benefits how solarplusstorage saves money businesses that adopt onsite solar photovoltaic pv technology experience a decrease in their overall energy costs relative to what they were paying their utility adding battery storage to a solar system creates a far greater margin of savings businesses can store excess solar energy and then consume that electricity during periods of peak demand utilities charge a premium for energy consumption during peak demand times and these charges make up the majority of the bill for some businesses a battery helps to limit grid consumption during these periods flattening a facilitys load curve enel x deros software transforms solar projects into intelligent strategic solarplusstorage assets combining machine learning with advanced prediction capabilities deros provides the intelligence and precisiondispatching needed to participate in demand response and other revenuegenerating programs that maximise value via our marketleading vpp maximise your renewable energy consumption with battery storage businesses can maximise their energy consumption from renewables this helps to decarbonise operations for organisations with explicit greenhouse gas emission targets or clean energy initiatives a solarplusstorage system will help meet your goals batteries can supply stored solar energy on cloudy days stored solar energy is a resilient sustainable option during power outages boost resiliency without sacrificing sustainability solarplusstorage helps to prevent power loss if the grid goes down the national electricity market nem has seen increasingly challenging market conditions including generation outages interconnector trips and extreme weather events all which can lead to power outages solarplusstorage is one of the strongest resiliency solutions in the market and can provide backup power ranging from several hours to several days often solarplusstorage can provide enough energy for operation while still allowing organisations to achieve their sustainability goals flexible financing options many companies may be drawn to the resiliency and sustainability value of solarplusstorage but hesitate at the capex necessary to start a project we are part of one of the worlds largest and most sustainable energy utilities and can provide a variety of funding options hybrid power purchase agreement hppa allin power purchase agreement ppa direct purchase customer pays a flat rate for solar power created battery savings are passed through a benefit share agreement benefits discount to utility rates for solar power incentives aligned on energy storage performance customer pays a flat rate for the power created and consumed via the solarplusstorage system benefits simple payment structure discount to utility rates customer buys the system and pays for ongoing om and enrolment in energy market programs benefit customer keeps 100 of the financial value
