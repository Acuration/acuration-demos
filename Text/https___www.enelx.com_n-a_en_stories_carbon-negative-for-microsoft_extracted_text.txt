of its commitment microsoft promised to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere until it had accounted for all emissions created by the company since its inception in 1975 a feat it expected to accomplish by 2050 the move undoubtedly raised the stakes for businessled climate goals but what exactly does going carbon negative mean and how does microsoft plan to do it what is carbonnegative for a business to call itself carbon negative it must go beyond netzero and actually begin removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it is emitting first it is important to understand what emissions microsoft considers itself responsible for as defined by the ghg protocol  emissions fall into three major classifications known as scopes scope 1 and 2 emissions are direct emissions from company assets as well as indirect emissions from electricity generation to power companyowned facilities microsoft estimates an annual production of approximately 41 million metric tons of scope 1 and 2 emissions note that microsoft has claimed carbonneutrality in scope 1 and 2 since 2012 the complexity of scope 3 emissions scope 3 emissions however encompass all emissions in the business valuechain from vendor emissions to emissions caused by the use of company products for any organization scope 3 emissions pose the most daunting challenge because these are emissions which occur outside of the organizations direct control for microsoft scope 3 emissions make up roughly 75 of total emissions or three times the amount of scope 1 and 2 emissions combined nevertheless microsoft expects to cut them in half over the next 10 years in order to drive down emissions across its supply chain microsoft will expand a carbon price program that it currently employs to incentivize emissions reductions from internal operations the price of carbon set at 15metricton will be phased in across its supply chain at lower amounts increasing over time and will impact profitability based on vendor operations this may be the most impactful move of microsofts pledge as it will not only require that suppliers understand their own carbon footprints but it will also aim to influence its suppliers choices while a move like this may not be realistic for companies without microsofts resources every business is capable of significant progress in energy sustainability as we recently covered in our guide to sustainable energy strategy  the impact of consumer behavior while supplier behavior presents one challenge on the other end of the value chain microsoft will be grappling with consumer behavior and use of its devices the microsoft surface and xbox one gamingconsole both have intensive energy requirements and while microsoft can try to improve the efficiency of these products quantifying and subsequently reducing their impact once their products leave their factories will be a complex endeavor active co2 removal vs avoided emissions although microsoft does expect to make significant reductions in all emissions across its value chain there will still be a large chunk of emissions it will look to account for through carbon offset projects in its pledge microsoft focuses on the idea of active co2 removal as opposed to avoided emissions for example afforestation removes carbon from the atmosphere whereas preventing deforestation avoids emissions that would have otherwise occurred both projects create types of carbon offsets which most organizations rely on to meet their climate goals but microsoft will be favoring the former going forward climate innovation fund and the future of carbon negative at the outset microsoft will rely primarily on available biological sinks for carbon but acknowledges that the technologies required to achieve its goal of becoming carbon negative do not yet exist for its part microsoft has unveiled a 1 billion climate innovation fund in support of new technology as major advancements in the realm of carbon capture and sequestration will be necessary it is important to recognize that although microsoft has identified a pathway for reducing company associated emissions there are many unknowns and the success of its pledge will hinge on its ability to influence the behavior of others despite these uncertainties in first accounting for all associated emissions and then following a mixed strategy of investing in carbon removal technology securing renewable power purchase agreements and deploying a carbon pricing scheme microsoft has taken a significant step toward meeting its lofty ambitions while the microsoft example does not present a onesizefitsall solution the aspirational nature of its pledge will likely further the importance of environmental social and governance esg initiatives and climate stewardship as a prominent feature among them related stories explore other recent stories within this category energy market insights for june 2023 energy market insights for june 2023 find out more
