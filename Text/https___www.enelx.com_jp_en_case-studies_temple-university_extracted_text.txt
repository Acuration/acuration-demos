solution the benefits location philadelphia the usa customer temple university sector educational institutes customer information this temple university case study is based on a project developed in enel x north america temple university temple university is an american state university founded in 1884 the university offers bachelors masters and doctoral degrees in several fields of study through its multiple campuses in pennsylvania as well as branch campuses in rome and tokyo the need temple university is a role model for strategic energy management with onsite natural gas generation resources a strong push towards renewable energy and a staff focused on sustainability and conservation as part of its energy management and sustainability efforts they have prioritized opportunities to offset its energy costs and improve the resilience of its campus while contributing to the local community in pennsylvania the largest electric grid operator in north america pjm provides various different services services include multiple demand response dr programs however while access to these programs represents an opportunity for temple university to increase its dr earnings capitalizing on this opportunity can be complex participating in multiple dr programs requires indepth visibility into both gridlevel demand activity and facilitylevel energy performance and needs as well as the ability to reduce demand at the right times for each program without disrupting operations in the schools facilities the solution for more than 10 years temple university has partnered with the enel x team to maximize performance in all available dr programs while minimizing disruption in its facilities it is possible to participate in several different dr programs available and maximize revenue while minimizing the impact on school operations enel x notifies temple university of these events across all requested channels of communication email text phone and remotely toggles its facilities energy consumption via a remote dashboard allowing university staff to streamline the process and cost of its participation synchronized reserve marketsrm the program requires fastresponse participation during brief power systems disruptions such as transmission line or power plant outages these preplanned reductions last only 10 minutes in some cases srm is costeffective and beneficial in others it is not enel x provides support in deciding whether to participate or not for each dispatch emergency load response program elrp the elrp is intended to reduce the risk of power outages by rewarding large electricity consumers for voluntarily reducing their consumption temporarily when electricity demand exceeds supply to the point of emergency it is ideal for organizations like temple university which also uses energy reduction plans to manage its capacity charges and provide a source of revenue when it cannot reduce consumption during peak periods economic demand response this dr program which is also offered in japan is triggered in response to high wholesale electricity prices and is a mechanism for supplying demandside resources owned by large electricity users through retail electric utilities or the wholesale electricity market economic dr allows participants to choose whether they want to participate in response to a dispatch as part of its campuswide energy strategy temple university boasts onsite natural gas and solar power generation resources central chilled water plant optimization and direct digital control of all hvac systems the university has decided to use this unique infrastructure to participate in economic dr as well during economic dr dispatches temple university reduces grid demand by shifting energyintensive machinery such as chillers to operate during offpeak hours as well as leveraging its onsite power generation assets to power other energyintensive equipment while removing capacity from the grid peco act 129 demand response this turn down dr program is designed to improve energy efficiency and reduce peak demand in pennsylvania with 24hour advance notice temple university participates in the program by lowering consumption and activating its onsite power generation facilities note in japan enel x does not control electricity consumption but instead turns equipment power on and off the benefits in just over a decade temple universitys demand response participation has earned nearly 41m in gross revenue as of q1 2018 in addition to approximately 15m in cost savings through strategic energy supply management and over 9m in avoided capacity costs through targeted demand management practices in addition to the financial benefits the temple university team has also improved the efficiency of the campus maintaining a consistent electric load of 300000 mwh despite a surge in student population and the construction of new facilities kurt bresser director of utilities and energy management at temple university commented this program has not only resulted in increased income potential for the university but has allowed me the freedom to deliver on temples commitment to conservation sustainability and efficiency  with an approach that maximizes all available energy opportunities temple university has demonstrated the full benefits of a comprehensive energy strategy across supply consumption and demand note in japan enel x supports global and local customers to help them to save on energy costs earn a new revenue stream and achieve carbon neutral targets with customized products and services
