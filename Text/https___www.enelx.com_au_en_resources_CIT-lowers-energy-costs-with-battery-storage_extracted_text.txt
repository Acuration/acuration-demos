with battery storage cit partners with enel x on one of australias largest onsite battery storage projects download pdf location riverland region south australia challenge reduce electricity bills including peak demand charges solution fully financed battery energy storage system with deros optimisation software financial benefit energy savings through lower demand charges and participation in demand response programs the customer central irrigation trust cit is an irrigation infrastructure operator that pumps water from the murray river to 1500 family and corporate farms and 3000 households community and industrial customers in the riverland region of south australia cit operates 13 pressurised pipeline water delivery systems that provide irrigation to 14000 hectares of high value agriculture and horticulture in the region the challenge reducing electricity costs cits 13 large water pumping stations are energyintensive and recently the trust has found electricity to be an increasing portion of its costs greg mccarron chief executive officer of cit explained energy makes up around 40 of our total operational costs about 5 million annually as energy is our single largest operating cost weve been looking for ways to reduce it where possible both for cit and to minimise cost increases to our customer charges to reduce these costs we explored many options such as onsite generation different retail models and more however we struggled to find anything well suited because of our unique power usage profile we have limited ability to change our demand profile particularly in peak irrigation seasons when our customers have limited flexibility when water is needed we quickly learnt that a solution required significant skills in energy and energy markets skills our team does not have thats how we became involved with enel x who suggested battery storage as a solution they provided us with comfort that the battery infrastructure operation would be undertaken expertly and would be sustainable for our business now and into the future he said the solution cit engaged enel x australia to install manage and optimise over 14mwh of batteries across five sites in the riverland region the batteries will intelligently manage cits energy use generate bill savings and earn a new revenue stream from energy market participation cit is the host for the batteries and enel x manages everything from endtoend project delivery optimisation through its own proprietary software deros 1  integration with its marketleading virtual power plant vpp and ongoing maintenance and support deros has machinelearning and ai algorithms that analyse unlimited data including site energy demand weather forecast inputs grid conditions pricing and more to determine the optimal charge and discharge strategy by fully integrating with enel xs vpp platform can take advantage of multiple grid support programs such as frequency support fcas 2  and participating directly in the electricity spot market a unique element of enel xs approach is its shared savings investment model enel x funds the entire project and passes on a share of total revenues cit does not pay for any upfront or ongoing costs ever it was really important that in this partnership enel x provided the ability to take on no additional risk for us and our customers the total cost of the project is over 15m and the outlay for cit has been none mccarron said it was really important that in this partnership enel x provided the ability to take on no additional risk for us and our customers the total cost of the project is over 15m and the outlay for cit has been none greg mccarron chief executive officer of cit the benefits lower utility bills and earn new revenue batteries enable the reduction of electricity bills with demand charge management by lowering peak electricity grid demand levels in addition batteries unlock energy market opportunities by storing lowcost power when renewables are abundant and using that same power during high spot prices when renewable power is low mccarron explained one of the primary benefits of the batteries is the ability to manage our demand on the network as a significant energy user our demand costs are high and are impacted when our demand increases during summer heatwave periods the batteries provide us the ability to manage that demand to limit the usage of grid energy at highcost times and reduce our overall cost with enel xs vpp integration the batteries can participate in the wholesale and frequency control electricity markets to support grid stability and yield financial gains cit and our customers benefit from those revenue streams as the income increases our bottom line and allows us to minimise charges to our customers joining the renewable energy transition batteries provide the instant dispatchable capacity the electricity grid desperately needs to balance intermittent renewable energy sources this helps to make the grid more reliable and sustainable batteries are important for the renewable energy transition away from fossil fuels batteries can store energy from the sun and wind when available to release back into the grid when the suns gone down and the winds not blowing this provides the ability to have a stable power market mccarron said as cit is a critical infrastructure operator in our region its important that we have a sustainable future and energy supply another advantage of the battery project is that it allows cit to become part of the renewable energy transition of south australia and australia the batteries result in a reduction of australias overall carbon footprint facilitate increased renewable energy use and the ability in a small way for fossil fuel power plants to be replaced by battery storage simple process with enel xs expetise enel x is a global leader in distributed energy storage and demand response projects with 751mw of battery storage installed capacity btm ftm enel plants and 82gw of demand response capacity worldwide in australia with cit enel x is developing australias largest onsite battery storage project to date and operates australias largest vpp bnef 3  1 distributed energy resources optimisation software 2 frequency control ancillary services 3 bloomberg new energy finance 2019 mccarron explained the battery is unique for our region it is one of the largest behindthemeter batteries in australia were proud of the work weve done with enel x and happy with the support theyve provided us throughout this project it has been a seamless project to work on our operational team has found the process simple and the level of input required from side has been low energy storage case study 3 speak with
