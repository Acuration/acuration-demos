become 90 green by 2030 its most populous province ontario has emerged as a frontrunner in the adoption of clean energy leading the shift away from coal purchasing renewable energy as well as long standing demand response dr participation while this is in part due to sustainability goals mutually agreed upon between businesses and the government another driving force comes from large energy users implementing innovation solutions to lower their energy bills demandbased charges known as the global adjustment ga account for as much as twothirds of electricity bills for large ontario ci customers these charges are linked to a ci customers consumption during the grids top five peak demand hours each year essentially the more energy consumed by a business during these five onehour intervals the higher the ga charges they must pay for over a decade enel x has been helping ontariobased companies with heavy energy footprints reduce these costly fees or earn revenue for reducing energy usage during peak demand periods through clean energy solutions like demand response as technology has evolved new clean energy solutions like battery storage have entered the market paving the way for existing dr customers to extract more value and enabling new customers who are unable to reduce demand because of operational impact the opportunity to benefit from dr participation ontarios expanding battery storage market with battery storage systems customers can maintain full operations and still benefit from significant electricity bill savings as well as earn revenue from demand response participation when businesses are looking to reduce electricity charges the first step is to predict when the grid operator is most likely to experience peak demand this is all done within the battery system using cuttingedge machine learning techniques and enel xs software deros when the software identifies a peak demand event it can automatically transition a customers load onto its battery system this allows the business to rely on stored energy as opposed to energy provided through the electrical grid by tapping into stored energy during these periods of high demand the financial savings can be significant a reduction in demand of one megawatt across the hours that set ga charges will lower energy expenditures by more than a half a million dollars the following year from plastics manufacturers like berry global to food packagers such as amhil north america and familyowned commercial apple orchards like algoma orchards  enel xs systems have enabled customers in ontario to reduce energy costs without disrupting production or compromising the quality of its products as the business appetite for clean energy solutions in ontario continues to grow enel x is positioning itself to meet that demand at an even faster pace the company is currently constructing two 10 mw  20mwh storage projects  and in light of the opportunity it sees for further scale  recently paired its industry expertise with the financial strength of private equity firm ardian infrastructure to deliver even more value for customers that will further accelerate the deployment of battery storage in ontario maximizing the value of storage through demand response the battery projects enel x deploys in ontario do far more than just peak demand management leveraging our role as the largest demand response aggregator in the province and our proprietary deros technology platform enel x storage projects also optimize energy consumption based on customer electricity tariffs and participate in demand response programs and markets demand response programs pay business for reductions in consumption when dispatched that enable utilities and system operators to maintain a resilient and reliable electrical grid a multitude of contributing factors this summer have further demonstrated the critical role of demand response in supporting the grid to help commercial and industrial energy customers return to full operations during the pandemic the ministry of energy froze ga charges for most large ci customers this year essentially eliminating the need for those customers to reduce peak load during peak demand periods during this summer when a heat wave rolled through the province in july demand was higher than usual in part because many large energy users who would normally reduce demand to avoid high ga charges continued to operate at full capacity this led the system to issue its first systemwide emergency in five years status twice this summer resulting in the need for the system operator the ieso to issue emergency actions for demand response enel x worked with its customers to dispatch 180 mw of critical demand response resources across more than 350 sites to minimize the strain on the grid including our battery storage projects across the province in addition to battery storage and demand response electric vehicle smart charging offers the potential to further support the ontario grid while charging evs have the potential to serve as distributed energy resources in the us enel x partners with more than 30 utilities on ev charging programs that will provide critical insight into charging behavior for each utility as ev adoption grows in california enel x has deployed a 70mw highly distributed virtual battery which is essentially the aggregate capacity of our juicebox home charging stations which participate in wholesale dayahead and realtime markets all while helping to balance grid demand we also just wrapped up a smart charging program with hawaiian electric where we saw an average demand response participation rate of over 90 which is consistent with other utility programs even without battery storage systems businesses are able to qualify for demand response programs for example global tissue manufacturer kimberlyclark  operates a mill in huntsville ontario 24 hours per day the mill works with enel x to evaluate how it can maximize payments from ieso by reducing energy usage during demand response dispatches today the mill has identified a system to perform standard equipment maintenance while simultaneously conserving energy through these events helping it save more than 23 million since 2011 as an early adopter of energy management technologies and services businesses in ontario are addressing the systemic change required for widespread clean energy adoption these technologies are priming the city to become a successful energy ecosystem with the potential to set precedent
