security affordability and sustainability demand response and the energy trilemma the energy trilemma is not an easy equation to balance but virtual power plants vpp providing demand response ticks all three of those boxes  energy security affordability and sustainability business owners who are waking up to the economic proposition of demand response should also count on its legitimate corporate social responsibility credentials in this interview managing director of enel x asia and oceania jeff renaud  shares the benefits of demand response and insights into useful applications that are benefiting enel x customers its more about energy flexibility than load with demand response youre looking for flexible capacity the ability to effectively change the amount of power a facility is using from the electricity grid which could come from turning certain equipment down for a short period or some form of energy storage  chilled water or battery  or from utilising backup generation depending on what the customer has the answer would be different the flexibility in proportion to their total energy usage will vary by industry to be economically viable youre looking for about a few hundred kilowatts or greater of flexible capacity to enroll in a vpp different sectors qualify for different reasons vpp participation is broadly available to a lot of industry sectors in different ways sectors that are very well suited include food from agriculture to food production to logistics and refrigerated warehouses  all for different reasons the water sector is well suited as are some of the new technologydriven sectors such as data centres certain types of commercial buildings can be good hospitals and the healthcare sector more broadly universities shopping centres airports youre looking for industries that have processes that are well suited to vpp participation or anyone who has backup generation can also be a good fit food and beverage manufacturers are well suited to demand response learn more in our article here  yes hospitals are well suited and heres why what we focus on is utilising their backup generation infrastructure which is critical for protecting patients in the case of a grid emergency what we do is typically augment that backup infrastructure and test it more frequently through vpp participation so they get more active more often realworld validation that their backup infrastructure is working well  and they get paid for their troubles its a financial and an operational benefit its still a change in perspective for many of these organisations to think about utilising this infrastructure when they still have grid power and there are operational considerations to work through to make sure this is done in a safe and effective way but it can be done and thats the reason they do it learn more about our work with hospitals in this echuca regional health case study here  business managers understand revenue so sell that the basic proposition is saying that theres an opportunity to effectively create a new revenue stream for your business by utilising the assets and the infrastructure you already have  meaning no capex  and that revenue stream given the way the australian energy market is changing can be quite significant it could amount to a 3 to 5 to 10 reduction in your energy cost thats relatively compelling but then there are the details how do we do that how does it impact our operation are we sure we can implement the controls and the engineering to make that a reality thats where the hard work comes in know the different types of demand response you see use cases for demand response on the grid that are quite different at one end of the spectrum we participate in the frequency control market that aemo runs which is designed to protect the grid from sudden outages in large plants or transmission lines we are delivering a resource to the market that can respond in a few hundred milliseconds in that case we have endtoend automation with local intelligence installed at the customers site that might immediately shutdown some equipment or turn on backup power generation at the other extreme you have emergency resources that either a network utility or aemo would procure to protect themselves on extreme days of very high demand such as multiple days of 40degree weather in that case it can be more of a manual process because we typically get one two or three hours advanced notice when called upon we can support a lot of processes at the customer facility which can involve manual operator action third using demand response directly in the wholesale energy market  which is maybe the most interesting type of case in the long run thats providing dr to the energy market and being paid the spot price of energy when you do that it wont spoil your other energy relationship thats the nice thing about vpp participation as a business you can join completely independently of your retail purchasing arrangement if youre happy with how youre buying power today and youre happy with the structure of the tariff with the price youre getting from the retailer and you like them great  you dont need to change a thing about that you can do demand response in addition to and completely separate from your retail arrangement some events are random and some are almost predictable frequency control is technically a 247 market those events can happen at any time because they are not correlated to anything other than maintenance issues at power generating plants which can occur at any time there is no discernible pattern to when those disturbances occur but in that market customers have flexibility to choose when they are participating the other two cases are much more predictable and pretty correlated to each other emergency events such as 40degree days which would typically occur in the midtolate afternoon into the early evening hours and using demand response directly in the wholesale energy market the most attractive times for doing that will be the midtolate afternoon into the early evening hours and also the possibility in the early morning hours around 7am to 10am thats an economic opportunity versus an emergency reliability commitment australia is crying out for demand response what makes australia unique is the pace of renewable deployment and what thats doing to the energy market here australia is at the leading edge of what any market around the world is seeing in terms of renewable disruption and therefore the need for innovative new forms of capacity its wreaking havoc on the energy market in the long run the transition to renewables is what everyone wants  its important and critical  but in the near term its creating volatility in the energy market and challenges for grid management in that sense the australian market is one of the best in the world for demand response in terms of the contribution it can make and therefore the revenue streams businesses can access this feature originally appeared in ecogeneration magazine article demand response 3 speak with an expert today to learn how enel x can
