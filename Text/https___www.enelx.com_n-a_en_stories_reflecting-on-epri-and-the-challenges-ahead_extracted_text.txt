for customers by developing new business models that combine different technologies and solutions in creative ways in todays blog post he reflects on his time at the epris electrification 2022 conference and how that experience fits into the future of the industry i had the pleasure of attending the epris electrification 2022 conference at the end of june and i noticed a recurring concern in the venue about one specific topic our industrys collective ability to secure the energy infrastructure necessary for a massive ev rollout by the end of this decade need a new transformer for your ev charging infrastructure project developers manufacturers oems and anyone else you ask will tell you that lead times will be at least a year should we have started strengthening the grid years ago in order to support the type of scaleup needed for the 50 ev sales by 2030 target at the conference i had a chance to hold a megawatt charging system mcs plug this single plug and cable has enough capacity to deliver 1 mw to 375 mw enough to power hundreds of homes driving home the transformative impact that the electrification of heavyduty vehicles will have on the grid as the director of innovation at enel x i know this challenge all too well on one hand we hear from organizations and businesses eager for zerocarbon strategies  they feel that things are not moving fast enough on the other hand current regulatory and planning frameworks dont yet account for and compensate distributed energy resources ders like energy storage for the multitude of flexibility benefits they provide which stalls progress for both grid strengthening and energy flexibility efforts in a way its a chickenandegg problem we need the charging infrastructure to enable ev scaleups but we need evs on the road to justify the investments in the infrastructure we cant build electrical infrastructure ahead of time because utilities cant do that without regulatory approval most utilities will say that its not really practical for them to buy a stock of transformers before they receive the interconnection requests but by the time they receive all the interconnectionnewservice requests it might be too late utilities cant pursue a capitalized emergency to release funds for investments because there are there are concerns about the legitimacy of such an approach and about investing too early in technology that may become obsolete soon moving forward demand for evs is expected to almost double so the question is how do we reach that milestone smoothly do we really need to double our grid infrastructure to meet ev roll out requirements or could we instead utilize our existing grid infrastructure more efficiently in his plenary address at epri jigar shah of the department of energy and formerly generate capital focused on one approach to the problem smart grid and grid flexibility solutions including load flexibility ders storage etc these behindthemeter solutions can improve the utilization of the grid and enable transmission and distribution investment deferral or nonwire alternatives wherever it makes sense and because this method can rely on existing load flexibility it doesnt face the same issues with long capital investment timelines as traditional grid expansion solutions would the enel xs formerly enernoc of the world have been doing it for decades said jigar and indeed enel x has pioneered demand response aggregation in the us and canada for over 20 years  now enhancing that flexibility with distributed generation and storage solutions like standalone storage solar  storage and storage  microgrid solutions all of these solutions are built around the idea that a negative mwh of demand is just as valuable as a positive mwh of supply despite the challenges ahead i walked away from epri with a renewed sense of belief in our collective ability to find creative solutions to enable ev growth in the coming years and shahs speech reconfirmed the importance of
