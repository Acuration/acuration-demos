hanawa aniket marathe cheri tse cathy wang and quinn weber while none of us were particularly well versed in circularity we brought with us expertise in electrification clean energy corporate

in the community for this work although we did not win a representative from nycedc expressed interest in the use of prefabricated panels for lessdisruptive building retrofits saying that it merits further discussion said cathy winning teams proposal for angie hanawa energy markets enel x participating in a new yorkfocused initiative was a no brainer as she regularly works with the ny demand response market im someone who thinks energy energy energy 247 so coming up with a more integrated approach to community engagement and implementation of sustainability principles that were not totally dependent on energy was hard at first but i had the chance to learn from my teammates from sap and 3m that come from totally different backgrounds and were able to see sustainability from a different perspective that ended up being more based on material flows and community inclusion than just energy efficiency and energy flows said angie in fact it was those different backgrounds that were essential to the success of her teams proposal because we had some teammates based in europe and that specialized in material flow sustainability we ended up borrowing a lot of concepts from the sharing economy in cities such as london to pilot in nyc and came up with a productasaservice proposal to implement a library of things at the brooklyn army terminal paired with an entrepreneurship residency focused on circular economy products explained angie the proposal impressed the judges winning first place in the challenge whats next this is potentially just the beginning of this
