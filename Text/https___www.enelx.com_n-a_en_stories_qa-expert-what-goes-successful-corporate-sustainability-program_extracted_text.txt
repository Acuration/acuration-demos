expectations from customers and investors todays businesses are feeling rising pressure to show progress in sustainability however every organization operates differently with unique operational processes and challenges and needs to take a unique approach to improving sustainability to get an idea of what goes into a successful corporate sustainability program i caught up with one of enel xs resident experts peter perrault is enel xs sustainability practice lead and solutions architect prior to joining enel x peter worked for several large multinational technology and sustainability consulting firms before that he helped to build and lead the sustainability program for fortune 500 technology firm netapp which earned the company recognition as one of newsweeks top 100 green companies in the us additionally peter has been heavily involved in the sustainability community on a volunteer basis having held chair and board positions with several industry organizations including the silicon valley leadership group un global compact and sustainability management association colin neagle how has your experience on both sides of the tablefrom developing an inhouse sustainability program to supporting those efforts as a consultantshaped your perspective in your current role peter perrault when i worked on the inhouse side of the tableand im sure most people who lead inhouse sustainability programs are in the same positioni was responsible for everything that would touch sustainability from it to operations to transportation programs to sales marketing and communications anything that had to do with sustainability within the organization more or less flowed through me which made it a very crossfunctional role where you get to understand how all of these departments operate once i moved into the world of consulting i was able to apply what i had learned both through my education and my experience on the internal side of the house to help a broader set of stakeholders in my current role i essentially work with customers to develop and deliver solutions that address energy or sustainability pain points that are unique to their business a lot of organizations face similar challenges when it comes to sustainability performance and i think theres value in providing an outside perspective and insight on how other organizations have addressed those challenges personally working as a consultant also means that i get to work with a larger number of organizations which to me means that what i do has an even greater positive impact not just in terms of corporate sustainability performance but the environmental and social integrity of our communities and society as a whole too colin you mentioned that many organizations face similar challenges in sustainability what would you say are the most common challenges peter data management is often a struggle for all customers to some extent no matter where you are in terms of maturity particularly with large corporations and multinationals of that nature getting your arms around the data is a critical component of effective program management because as we all know you cant manage what you dont measure this even applies to organizations with a mature sustainability program with a number of systems in placei dont think anyone would say managing the data is the easiest part of my job additionally i would say stakeholder support and stakeholder buyin is another big challenge working across various siloes within an organization can be challenging because you dont know who owns the budget oftentimes if its a sustainability manager or energy manager behind these efforts budget is owned elsewhere so taking on any new initiative can be challenging where we can help in this area is by helping these groups sell sustainability to internal stakeholders which means helping them understand and communicate the business case to make it clear internally that they need to make budget available for sustainability and energy programs colin speaking of the maturity of a sustainability program how does that affect how an organization you work with approaches sustainability peter more mature customers tend to have a pretty defined strategy and vision at times they probably have better data management and at other times they still have to connect the dots to get from a to b so to speak less mature companies dont necessarily know what a or b is a lot of times someone at the clevel within an organization might set renewable energy goals or emissions reduction goals for their organization but then it is left to other individuals or teams to figure out how they will actually achieve those goals if youre not mature in terms of energy procurement processes regulations and energy markets or the data and technology to drive your decision making you may not know what your current renewable options are let alone how you can achieve your emissions goals so in my work with these customers i look at a number of ways to drive efficiency and achieve their goalswhether they relate to renewables targets energy reduction or ghg reductionsand help customers understand where theyre at and what they need to do to reach the goal line those that are just starting out with sustainability initiatives often dont know what options are available to them sometimes an organization needs to look at their processes first other times they just need some guidance or expertise around a particular reporting scheme it all depends on their maturity and line of business more mature organizations are often aware of all these things but may not necessarily be capable of understanding whats going to be best for them given their specific conditions colin can you give me an example of an organization that has shown strong progress in sustainability whether they started from a mature or lessmature starting point peter last year a company with a large retail presence nationwide asked us to evaluate what their sustainability strategy looked like what i received was a list of energy efficiency projects such as led retrofits and installing bms systems at various sites while this list of projects was promising the strategy behind it was unclear so we sat down with the customer and uncovered that they had this topdown support and a mandate for a sustainability program but ultimately they did not have a strategy goals or the subject matter expertise to help them fulfill that mandate they lacked an understanding of what a holistic sustainability program looks like and they sort of lacked the vision of why its something they should do from a corporate perspective beyond potential financial benefits so we looked at the data for their sites to understand how they performed against standard best practices for example they lacked policies and procedures they didnt have data as evidence to support that what people said was being done was being done and they were missing a way to track how they were performing against the goals that were set based on our assessment we determined that they were at a limited to developing stage of maturity which validated where our customer thought they were but it also provided a benchmark for their performance against several wellrecognized best practices such as ashreae well leed etc once we were able to present this to them in a meaningful way they were able to further validate their business case by understanding their gaps and what needed to be addressed following the assessment we set up a strategy meeting with a crossfunctional group including hr it communications operations procurement and so on the main objective was to define what they would consider success to look like for them in the next five years and with that clearly defined we established a number of corporatelevel goals across many different categories of sustainability performance looking at energy water waste operations employee engagement etc from there we worked with the core sustainability team to develop a multiyear roadmap for what needed to be done by each business unit and in what time frame in order to achieve these goals the foundation of that was a sound data management platform to work from the development or refinement of their policies processes procedures and training with that were working on a multiyear implementation of energy intelligence software with remote building control tools so they can start to implement efficiency measures and track and further improve performance over time the actual plan is just about to be rolled out companywide everyone is very excited and we are excited to move ahead on this journey with them colin and finally since youve worked in this space from so many different perspectives what would you say is the most common misconception about sustainability peter regardless of what level of the organization someone is atwhether theyre directly responsible or theres a topdown directive and theyre going to delegateone of the most common misunderstandings is that sustainability exists within its own space or that it is only related to electricity or fuel management the lack of ability to connect all the dots all the interrelated parts of their business and organization with a common thread of sustainability is a common misconception and challenge across the board the way you design and make your products the way you source and distribute your productsall of these have an impact on sustainability performance sustainability truly cuts across all aspects of an organization its the crossroads or nexus of a lot of things in the company far too often people tend to think of it as a silo or only being within the facilities teams or operations and they dont see the big picture of the decisions that need to be made and who needs to be involved to execute you can literally touch on any aspect of your business and one way or another it impacts your sustainability efforts and in turn your sustainability efforts can impact every part of your business related stories explore other recent stories within this category energy market insights for june
