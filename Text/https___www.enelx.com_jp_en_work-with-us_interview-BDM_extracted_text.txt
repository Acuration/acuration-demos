the local community he is responsible for managing existing demand response customers and exploring new customers who are willing to participate in the enel x japan demand response programs what was your major at university and what did you do before joining enel x i majored in code of criminal procedure in the faculty of law i was influenced by a drama about a prosecutor that was popular at the time i took the university entrance exam i like interacting with people and wanted to work in a job where i could involve myself with people so i have been in sales ever since i graduated from college in my last job i was selling safety equipment as my current job is intangible product sales it is very important to confirm various terms and conditions in contracts i feel that the knowledge i gained in my law major has been very useful what motivated you to change jobs and why did you choose enel x japan i only learned about the demand response solution when i saw enel xs job description i was very interested in it because i thought it was an innovative solution that would greatly contribute to the environment and society i was also very sympathetic to the companys commitment to protecting the stable supply of electricity which is so important to peoples lives during the interviews i was told that individuals have a certain amount of discretion in their work and that there are many opportunities to actively participate in what they are interested in and i thought that the corporate culture would fit my style as well after joining the company i am actually able to manage what to do and when to do it and this leads to job satisfaction at enel x the family first philosophy is widely adopted and we can be flexible in our daily work to accommodate each family members circumstances i am happy that i can pick up and drop off my children at school i feel that i have a very good worklife balance what are the challenges you have faced since joining enel x japan since the industry is completely different from the ones i have worked in before it was difficult for me to first learn the basics of the power industry however enel x has a culture where everyone is open and easy to communicate with i am able to get advice when necessary and i have gradually been able to fill in the gaps in my basic knowledge of electric power which i initially thought would be difficult what is your favorite part of your job at enel x i like working with people and i have always wanted to work in a way that benefits all the people i interact with many new consumers who have not participated in demand response before are not aware of the program when i tell them that they will be compensated for participating in the program and that they will also be able to make a social contribution they are grateful and i feel very happy i feel rewarded when i receive a new contract from such a customer it is a winwinwin for everyone not only myself but also the consumers and others can you tell what has changed or grown since you joined enel x my knowledge of power and the environment has grown much more than before and i think i have improved i read materials on power and the environment published by public agencies even if they are not directly related to my work nowadays as decarbonization and sustainability are becoming essential i want to be able to contribute to society by explaining the power and the environment more clearly as well as demand response what are your career plans at enel x i believe i have built up my knowledge of energy and sales skills so i would like to pass these skills on to subordinates proactively and give support since this is an industry that is constantly evolving i would like to propose a wide range of energyrelated solutions not only demand response but also carbon pricing and storage batteries please explain your working style i usually go to the fukuoka office 23 times a week when my visits to customers overlap i go directly to the customer and return home the company provides good support for working remotely so i have not had any particular problems there is an allhands meeting at the tokyo headquarters once every six months and i go to the headquarters every three to six months we use an online chat tool for internal communication and i feel like my colleagues are close by even if they are not sitting next to me i believe that if i encounter any difficulties in the future i will be able to solve them easily because i can reach out to my coworkers for advice what do you enjoy outside of work i like saunas so i am a member of the sauna club at the company whenever i go to tokyo we all get together and go to the sauna there are many saunas in fukuoka so when my colleagues come to kyushu on business we enjoy them together the company has various club activities such as bouldering darts and golf it is fun to join any message for future enel x members i think that being flexible in our work style and being able to design a worklife balance is because every employee at enel x values independent initiative very highly it is also important that we are passionate about what we do knowledge can be gained even if coming from a different industry i would like to work with people who first understand the services such as demand response and virtual power plant that lead to the decarbonized society that enel x aims for and who find them interesting want to join us  see our positions  enel x japan who we are circular economy contact us media resources press releases case
