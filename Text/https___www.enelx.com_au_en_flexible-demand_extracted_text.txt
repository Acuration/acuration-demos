solar power generation on australias power grid the energy transition flexible demand virtual power plants vpps demand response the growing need the energy transition as we build more wind and solar power each year the retirement of many of our largest coalfired power stations is on the horizon to make this transition work we need to build new forms of power capacity that ensure the reliability of the power grid while balancing the natural variability of renewables with a cluster of five announced coalfired generator retirements within the next decade the investment need is pressing and widespread to support the energy transition underway aemo australian energy market operator flexible demand flexible demand can take many forms some of which are complex however the general principle is simple it involves making temporary adjustments to a facilitys power consumption based on conditions on the power grid or opportunities in the wholesale power market manufacturing  industrial process equipment commercial hvac  refrigeration systems backup power assets battery energy storage electric vehicle charging infrastructure virtual power plants vpps a virtual power plant is a technology platform that connects flexible demand assets to opportunities to offer demand response to the wholesale power market this demand response provides an important new source of support to the power grid during critical times demand response businesses that offer demand response through a vpp earn a new source of revenue for the support that their flexible demand provides to the power grid this revenue typically includes both a standby payment for being available to respond and a utilisation payment that is earned each time the market calls upon the demand response businesses can tailor their vpp participation based on their operational capabilities and priorities further vpp revenue can be earned independently from the retail power supply contract meaning businesses retain the freedom to buy power from whichever retailer offers the best commodity price learn more the growing need the market opportunities for demand response have expanded dramatically in recent years as regulators and market operators urgently seek new ways to balance the renewable energy transition new programs continue to be introduced and the market value of these programs continues to increase as the renewable transition results in larger intraday price spreads and a greater concentration of high pricing in fewer hours because it primarily comes from existing assets demand response is possibly the most costeffective option for balancing renewable energy this means that vpp participation offers businesses a unique opportunity to improve their bottom line while also supporting the community as more renewables power the grid batteries offer a great supply side solution but we also need to make investments and changes to the way we use energy to help ease pressure and lower emissions jenny
