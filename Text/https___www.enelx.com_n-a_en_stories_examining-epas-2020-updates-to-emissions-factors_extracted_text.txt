two years by the united states environmental protection agency epa is the most commonly accepted dataset for emissions factors in the united states the epa recently released its 2020 egrid updates reflecting changes in emissions factors through 2018 its an important moment both for companies that already track their greenhouse gas emissions and for those that are looking to start tracking what are emissions factors the greenhouse gas protocol published in 2001 by the wri and wbcsd is the most broadly accepted way to track and disclose greenhouse gas ghg emissions as part of the ghg protocol businesses must determine the emissions produced by the electricity they purchased the most common approach to this is a locationbased methodology where in simplified terms a businesss electricity consumption in mwhs is multiplied by a local emissions factor to calculate emissions emissions factors are determined by the egrid subregion where a business is located and are based upon the average generation mix of the subregions grids subregions with higher percentages of fossilfuel intensive sources have higher emissions factors note that while egrid data is published for all three of the most common greenhouse gases co2 n20 and ch4 this article focuses on the single carbon equivalentor co2eemission factor for each egrid subregion co2e is a standard unit of measure created for the purpose of an applestoapples comparisonit uses the global warming potential gwp of each greenhouse gas to convert emissions into carbon dioxide equivalent what changed in the latest update because the generation powering the grid in any given region changes over time updated emissions factors must be issued periodically of the 26 egrid subregions in the update  18 reported reduced emissions from electricity production they accomplished this either through the addition of cleaner sources in the grid generation mix or improved generation efficiency two subregions reported no changes and 6 reported an increased emission factors though each of the increases are less than 5 a deeper look into one regions changes as an illustration consider the case of spno which includes all of kansas and a portion of missouri in the latest updates spnos co2e emission factor went down 21 the largest decrease of any subregion the change is primarily due to a 64 increase over the period in kansas wind power generation spno produces 36 of its electricity through wind the highest share for any state with wind power development ongoing throughout the state and favorable economics in renewables one can anticipate further reductions to spnos emissions factors in the coming years how emissions factors affect your business organizations that calculate emissions using the locationbased method must ensure theyre applying the latest emission factors to their consumption to calculate an accurate footprint and understand the variance in emissions due to the changing nature of the grid a manufacturing site in spno for example will now have 21 reduction in emissions all else being equal while a site in the akms subregion will report 4 higher emissions by considering the generation mix and state and local climate action when deciding where to locate energy intensive operations customers can make meaningful impacts on their overall emissions find out how enel x helps customers drive
