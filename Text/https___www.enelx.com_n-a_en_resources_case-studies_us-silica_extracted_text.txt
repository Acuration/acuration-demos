authority the plant views dr as integral to reducing energy costs demonstrating the companys commitment to the environment and supporting the local community annual dr payments of more than 30000 to a single facility provide a strong bottomline benefit to the company helping it lower high energy costs that are one of the facilitys largest operating expenses taking advantage of excess capacity the process for mining and processing silica is energyintensive and involves highhorsepower equipment such as dryers fans and mills enel x worked closely with managers at the jackson facility to integrate demand response into its operation when a demand response dispatch begins the jackson facility temporarily shuts down its silica processing operation and reschedules production this temporary shutdown which can last between two and eight hours reduces us silicas electricity usage during periods of peak demand mining continues unaffected we continue processing whatever material we have running at
