taiwans energy transition with integration of virtual power plant and 2500 battery swapping stations the first commercial deployment of this technology in the world the companies have deployed nearly 1300 gostations for virtual power plant vpp participation this month and plan to activate more than 1200 additional gostations by mid2023 gogoros participation in enel xs taiwan vpp includes the dynamic pausing of gogoro network energy grid usage as well as sending energy to the grid as needed taipei april 19 2023  gogoro inc nasdaq ggr a global technology leader in battery swapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities and enel x a global leader in innovative energy services such as virtual power plants vpp today announced the commercial deployment of 2500 gogoro battery swapping stations across 1000 locations in enel xs virtual power plant vpp to support taiwans renewable energy transition the rollout follows the completion of a successful pilot program in 2022 and is the first commercial deployment of this technology in the world  we are entering a new era of smart energy infrastructure and by integrating the gogoro network with the enel x virtual power plant vpp in taiwan we are providing a new energy resource it is the first time this technology has been deployed this way in the world and it creates a new gogoro revenue stream beyond mobility  said horace luke founder and ceo of gogoro   we have always believed that timeshifting energy was key to enabling the sustainable transformation of energy and transportation and gogoro continues to be a key part of these advancements together the gogoro community is contributing to taiwans netzero targets by helping to integrate more variable power generation resources onto the grid today when the energy grid begins to max out we can dynamically pause our energy usage or provide energy back to the grid while continuing to operate our battery swapping service independently as needed  in 2022 gogoro and enel xs vpp pilot in taiwan demonstrated that the gogoro network could safely pause charging if there was a grid imbalance or provide energy back to the grid as demand required once the demand subsided enel xs vpp sent a signal to the gogoro network to safely restore grid consumption the gogoro network performed these services without causing any interruptions to gogoro network battery swapping customers demonstrating that the network is an ideal resource to support taiwans energy transition integrating gogoro network battery swapping energy into the enel x vpp in taiwan has the same effect as bringing new energy generation online to meet energy demand the companies have deployed nearly 1300 gostations across more than 500 locations this month and plan to deploy more than 2500 gostations in total across 1000 locations by mid2023 to support grid efficiency and stability the commercial expansion of the gogoro and enel x pilot program to more than 1000 battery swapping locations highlights a significant step in our ancillary service to increase energy use efficiency it is also an essential element in the development of large uptakes of renewable energy in the global electricity industry and a positive demonstration of how businesses like gogoro can proactively participate in taiwans energy market at scale  said president of taiwan power company tpc yaoting wang  enel xs vpp aggregates gogoros battery swapping energy load to contribute to tpcs energy trading platform for ancillary service our energy trading platform allows organizations like gogoro to be active contributors of energy in taiwan and we encourage more businesses to participate through professional aggregators like enel x to work together towards taiwans renewable energy future   our work with gogoro showcases the vital role that vpps will play in the transition to renewable energy as new distributed resources are built to electrify and decarbonize our energy use vpps will unlock greater sustainability impacts and improved financial returns by connecting these assets to the broader energy system our platform does this by aggregating thousands of these new energy assets into a resource that can help balance the intermittency of largescale renewable power stations we believe our work with gogoro is a worldleading demonstration of what vpps can do and we are honored and excited to continue growing our collaboration with them  said jeff renaud head of enel x asia and oceania  taiwan power corporation has forecast that the future business opportunity in the electricitysharing economy in taiwan is predicted to be tens of billions of new taiwan dollars 1  enel x taiwan has the largest vpp in taiwans energy market today managing the
