contracting options have emerged renewable energy purchasing has become less of a risk for businesses through aggregation and virtual power purchase agreements vppas customers can enjoy new flexibility when procuring utilityscale renewable energy the cost of utilityscale solar power fell nearly 30 in 2017 alone and has decreased nearly 80 since 2010 according to the national renewable energy laboratory nrel similarly the international renewable energy agency irena has reported that costs for onshore wind power have fallen 45 since 2010 plummeting renewable generation costs have made utilityscale renewable energy more competitiveand in many cases less expensive than electricity generated from nuclear coal and natural gas resources until very recently however the favorable economics behind utilityscale renewables had only been available to organizations that use 50000 mwh annually and can tolerate 15 or 20year commitments the companies that have made utilityscale renewable energy purchases over the past five years for example is limited to about 50 of the fortune 500 we expect that dynamic to change today there are a number of ways for customers to purchase smaller portions of a larger project for shorter periods customers can make commitments for as few as 5 8 or 10 years and for as little as 2mw 5mw or 10mw while still capturing the price advantages that come from projects that are up to and above 50mw through aggregation utilityscale renewable energy is now available for the midmarket where are the biggest opportunities for aggregated ppas community choice aggregation cca has been around since cape cod and marthas vineyard formed the cape light compact in massachusetts in 1997 nearly 20 years later however community aggregation reached a second milestone in 2016 when the massachusetts institute of technology boston medical center and a parking facility owned by post office square redevelopment corporation collaborated on the first multiparty aggregated ppa community choice aggregation is now available in seven us states  including california illinois ohio new york new jersey and rhode island we are also seeing significant cca momentum in delaware virginia minnesota utah oregon nevada and washington moreover through virtual power purchase agreementsfinancial agreements that do not involve any exchange of physical energycustomers can participate in a variety of new aggregated purchasing options to achieve their budgetary and sustainability objectives regardless of state or local energy laws though the market for renewable aggregation market is still nascent the rocky mountain institute has said that they anticipate that more schools hospitals and small to midsize businesses will be able to collaborate within their communities to complete mutually beneficial transactions in the renewables market based on the success of the agreement between mit boston medical center and post office square in its article responding to that deal rmi breaks down the four types of organizations that are developing these aggregated agreements here is our perspective on where the biggest opportunities are emerging in this market and how they affect customers 1 developer aggregation many organizations have renewable energy ambitions that outpace their available onsite capacity in these instances wholesale renewable energy developers can act as intermediaries by developing utilityscale projects and distributing both the generation and environmental attributes across a collection of offtakers 2 investor aggregation in addition to developersupported aggregation we are seeing significant momentum behind investorfacilitated aggregation investor banks and power traders have historically been the most active renewable aggregators in this model but we are seeing more and more private companies act as renewable intermediaries by financing utilityscale renewable projects these organizations are able to break out the generation and environmental attributes into smaller blocks with custom term lengths for multiple offtakers 3 buyside aggregation as seen in the mit boston medical center and post office square example offtakers can work together in a multilateral negotiation in this example the offtakers networked through a better city  a member organization committed to economic sustainability and quality of life issues takeaways as the demand for renewable energy outpaces the current supply renewable energy developers are looking for innovative ways to lower barriers to entry through aggregation we are seeing a paradigm shift in the way renewable energy is marketed buyers are now able to contract for portions of utilityscale projects for customizable amounts and tenors if you are interested in learning more about these new renewable energy options or are looking to participate in renewable energy aggregation contact us today  related stories explore other
