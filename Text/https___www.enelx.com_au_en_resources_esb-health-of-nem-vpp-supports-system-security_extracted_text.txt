providing system security with instant dispatchable capacity the energy security board esb has given a damning assessment of the security of australias electricity system the esb which oversees energy reliability security and affordability in the national electricity market nem says that urgent action is needed to keep the lights on as the generation mix transitions from coal to renewables according to the esbs health of the nem report security remains the most concerning issue in the nem maintaining the electricity system within the required parameters for frequency voltage inertia and system strength becomes harder as variable renewable generation increases its presence in the nem 1 quick action is needed to minimise disruptions the australian energy market operator aemo has been managing these issues by intervening in the market giving directions to power generators to increase or decrease their output to firm up electricity supply however this approach distorts efficient market operations and is not sustainable esb chairman kerry schott said what we have in place now is no longer fit for purpose for the energy transition and beyond the health of the nem clearly shows the repercussions of rapid change in our electricity system and highlights the absolute urgency of addressing them 2 the esb says that aemo will need to ensure there is adequate system flexibility to cover increased variability across all times with the scheduled retirement of 16 gw of thermal power plants 61 of the current coal fleet in the nem and up to 50gw of large scale variable renewable energy forecast to come online an additional 6 to 19 gw of flexible and dispatchable resources is needed to support this transition 3  quick action is needed to minimise disruptions there are different forms of system flexibility that help to balance the intermittency of renewable power sources and avoid widespread blackouts one ideal solution is the use of virtual power plants vpps a vpp is made up of distributed energy resources generators batteries energy intensive equipment at commercial and industrial sites across multiple locations that work together to provide instant dispatchable capacity that the grid needs acting as a virtual power plant enel x operates australias largest vpp 4 with more than 100 commercial and industrial sites across the nem that provide 250 mw of system flexibility when called upon our customers temporarily power down site equipment or switch from grid power to a battery system or backup generator to take their load off the grid jeff renaud  head of enel x asia and oceania said  with flailing system security and disruptions to power supply businesses can take matters into their own hands to ensure site reliability and in doing so can become part of the broader solution by participating in our vpp businesses provide the flexibility the grid needs while enhancing site reliability and receive regular payments which can offset electricity costs or be reinvested into operations or other sustainability initiatives  the esbs proposed solution represents new opportunities for businesses the esb has proposed a range of reforms to address the shortcomings of the existing market design 5  this includes the creation of new markets for the security services the system needs which represent new opportunities for vpp participation  we are seeing significant growth in opportunities for the demand side to further contribute to grid reliability and enable the growth of renewable energy in australia by participating in our vpp and providing the dispatchable capacity the grid so desperately needs we are currently advocating for vpps to participate in the proposed new markets and programs such as operating reserves fastfrequency response and primary frequency control and are optimistic that they will soon open to demand side participation with the upcoming market reforms there has been no better time for a business to consider joining our vpp  renaud added for more information on how you can join enel xs vpp get in touch with our team references energy security board 2020 health of the nem report 5
