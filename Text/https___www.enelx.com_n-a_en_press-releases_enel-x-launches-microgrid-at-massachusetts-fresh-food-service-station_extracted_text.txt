construction of an innovative microgrid that leverages solar energy and battery storage to support the facility and ev charging at global partners lps alltown fresh service station in ayer massachusetts the project is the first to be completed through innovatemass resilient service stations challenge  which seeks to ensure continuous power for service stations near evacuation routes across the state the project is expected to be the first commercial deployment of a microgrid that integrates power supply for the station facility and the dc fast charger colocated behind the same meter alltown fresh is a convenience marketplace that offers made to order healthy food options wifi  workspaces amenities that continue to make ev charging a seamless comfortable and convenient

all designed built operated and financed by enel x to support ev drivers enel x installed a universally compatible juicepump 50kw which can charge vehicles up to 80 battery capacity in 30 to 60 minutes the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events underscore the need for far more sustainable and resilient power especially for critical infrastructure says surya panditi head of enel x north america  however solar energy paired with battery storage is not only valuable during emergencies the alltown fresh microgrid is attractive to ev drivers who want to power their vehicles with renewable energy and its valuable to businesses to support the local grid by decreasing overall demand and reducing emissions while reducing costs the microgrid is the first project to be completed under innovatemass resilient service stations challenge which seeks to ensure continuous power for service stations near evacuation routes across the state enel x also partnered with national grid under the ev make ready program to upgrade the grid to support ev charging power for the service station and interconnection of the distributed energy resources colocated behind the same meter this is expected to be the first commercial deployment of its kind demonstrating the efficient use of utility incentives national grid is proud to support the first location to combine dcfc with solar panels and a battery storage system in massachusetts says john isberg vp of customer sales and solutions at national grid our partnership with enel x will help national grid prepare for increased demand from electric vehicle charging stations by using innovative system design to mitigate the impacts of dcfc charging on the grid and maximize the benefits of increased electric vehicle adoption we are proud to support this initiative and look forward to the future learnings from the launch of this project gas stations and convenience stores provide critical refueling water food wifi connection and other services for the general public first responders and utility crews during emergencies yet these stations are subject to the same grid power losses as other buildings like the one at alltown fresh ayer microgrids can change that by providing backup power and resilience while increasing the adoption of clean energy and electric mobility solutions more than a fueling station alltown fresh ayer the location of the microgrid offers fresh beantocup coffee wifi and workspaces to connect laptops additionally fresh food from a locally sourced scratch kitchen provides guests with an array of made to order offerings and fresh food choices these amenities make ev charging a seamless enjoyable and convenient experience supporting more drivers in their transition to electric
