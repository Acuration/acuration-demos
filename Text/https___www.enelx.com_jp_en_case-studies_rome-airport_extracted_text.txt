solution the benefits location italy client aeroporti di roma adr sector aviation enel x focus on developing new technologies for liion solutions batteries and for their application when batteries reach the end of their automotive life cycle they still have a residual capacity of about 7080 and can be applied for different usage after their initial lifecycle has come to an end they can be used in stationary systems in combination with renewable energy generation such as wind and solar andor to supply services to the electricity network this case study is based on a project developed in enel x italy customer information aeroporti di roma adr aeroporti di roma adr operates the italian capitals two airports making it the leading air travel hub in the country fiumicino airport also called leonardo da vinci international airport  the larger of romes two airports with two passenger terminals that cater to international and intercontinental travelers  is the first and only airport in italy to have been awarded a 5star skytrax rating for excellence standards in service quality ciampino airport is mainly used by lowcost airlines express couriers and for general aviation activities sustainability is a key driver of adrs mission a dedication recognized  among others  by the uns world tourism organization wto which is 2020 recognized the airport operator for leadership in sustainability and commitment to responsible travel the need adr has embarked on a journey to attain net zero emissions by 2030  ahead of the targets set by the european airport sector as part of its efforts to reach its sustainability goals adr requires an energy efficiency solution for its fiumicino international hub that will enable it to cut co₂ emissions  speak with an expert today to learn how enel x can help you achieve your energy goals contact us the solution enel x supports adr with two projects create an innovative battery energy storage system using secondlife ev batteries used ev batteries were combined to create an energy storage system with a capacity of 10 mwh these secondlife batteries store the excess energy produced by the solar plant this project is named pioneer airport sustainability second life battery storage and has been awarded a grant of more than 3 million euros from the innovation fund the eus climate innovation fund this is the firstofitskind project that uses only secondlife batteries from multiple car manufacturers build selfconsumption photovoltaic system this system will be completed in 2024 once the facility is fully operational it will be the largest of its kind in europe comprising approximately 55000 solar panels and covering a surface area of 340000 square meters it will have a maximum capacity of 22 mwp and produce 32 gwh of renewable electricity each year eliminating 11000 tons of co₂ emissions annually  this is equivalent to the amount absorbed annually by planting 100000 trees by integrating this system with a 10 mwh second life ev battery energy storage system  the airport will store the excess energy produced by the solar plant and cover any evening energy demand peaks at the airport the benefits our projects have several benefits for adr and society reduce co ２ emission using electric vehicles reduces co 2 emissions co 2 emissions can be further reduced by using the same batteries for other purposes reduce amount of waste the use of secondlife batteries is a crucial step in the battery production chain before their actual end of life where they are recycled to ensure those valuable materials are available again to produce new batteries with a circular and sustainable production vision social contribution secondlife batteries promote environmental community and business wellbeing and sustainability promote renewable energy extending the life of batteries means increasing the amount of renewable energy on the grid encourage circular economy recycling materials batteries contain at the end of their life is an effective application of the circular economy accerelate electric mobility having an intermediate step or second life between using them for electric mobility and recycling optimizes costs along the supply chain and makes electric cars cheaper to buy 32 gwh renewable power producedyr 11000 tons of co₂ emissions avoided annually 55000 solar panels comprising the pv plant this pioneering project is added to the other important innovation activities we are carrying out within the framework of the european commissions ipcei calls for proposals to make the battery and electric vehicle supply chain increasingly sustainable and once again confirms our commitment to combine innovation and sustainability francesco venturini ceo of enel x renewable energy battery
