energy you may be interested in demand response learn more faq what is net zero and how to achieve zero emissions net zero refers to a balance between the amount of greenhouse gases ghg released into the atmosphere and the amount of greenhouse gases removed  this means that in addition to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide one of the greenhouse gases net zero can also be achieved by carbon offsetting carbon offsetting is carried out by companies or individuals when they neutralize their carbon emissions by buying credits from projects that remove ghg emissions from the atmosphere or taking actions such as planting trees why is net zero important reaching net zero carbon emissions is important because it is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising more than 15  c above preindustrial levels by mid century which is what the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sees as the limit needed to prevent serious damage to the planets ecosystems and to limit the most disruptive effects of global warming the 15c target and the goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions was set in 2015 by the paris agreement  a legally binding treaty signed by 196 countries to limit global warming to no more than 15c emissions need to be reduced by 45 by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 how to reach net zero emissions reaching net zero requires businesses and individuals to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide or co₂ they emit or else offset their co₂ emissions reducing or removing carbon emissions or decarbonization takes place through an energy transition away from fossil fuels and switching to renewable energy sources like wind or solar this switch does not take place overnight for businesses and countries the journey to achieving net zero emissions starts with a long term strategy that involves setting gradual reduction targets many countries or businesses decide to partner with an organization specialized in this process that can help achieve these goals reaching net zero emissions starts with data collection and monitoring to assess the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions ghg and how much is produced once a business or a country has a clear picture of its carbon footprint it can set ambitious but realistic emissions reduction targets  grounded in climate science these targets allow the creation of a strategic roadmap to achieve their goal of reaching net zero emissions how many countries have committed to net zero commitments by governments to reach net zero fall far short of what is required according to the united nations  according to the climate action tracker an independent scientific analysis that measures government climate action against the paris agreement goals around 140 countries have announced or are considering net zero targets a ukbased non profit organization net zero tracker  estimated that 139 countries either had passed laws policy documents pledges or had held discussions to achieve net zero targets of these only 17 have passed laws enshrining the 2050 net zero target including the eu net zero refers to a balance between the amount of greenhouse gases ghg released into the atmosphere and the amount of greenhouse gases removed  this means that in addition to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide one of the greenhouse gases net zero can also be achieved by carbon offsetting what does net zero by 2050 mean to meet the 15c global warming target in the paris agreement signed by 196 countries in 2015 global carbon emissions should fall to net zero around 2050 the united nations defines net zero as cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible with any remaining emissions reabsorbed from the atmosphere by oceans and forests reaching net zero by 2050 would mean keeping the increase in global warming to 15c above which climate change threatens to make parts of the planet unlivable the world is not currently on track to meet the 15c target what is the difference between net zero zero carbon and carbon neutrality net zero can be achieved by either cutting the amount of greenhouse gases ghg or by offsetting them  in contrast to net zero zero carbon stands for releasing no carbon dioxide into the atmosphere carbon dioxide co₂ is only one of several greenhouse gases and is produced by burning fossil fuels zero carbon energy is energy procured by a 100 renewable source like wind or solar carbonneutral refers to a process whereby any carbon emissions that are released into the atmosphere are balanced by an equivalent amount absorbed from the atmosphere via carbon sinks like forests since the term net zero refers to all greenhouse gases and not just co₂ it is larger in scale than carbon neutrality sustainability 1 related questions what is
