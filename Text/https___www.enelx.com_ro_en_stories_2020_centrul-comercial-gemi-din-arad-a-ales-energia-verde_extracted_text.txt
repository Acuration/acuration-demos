vehicles the photovoltaic system consists of 318 highefficiency canadian solar photovoltaic panels  with polycrystallinetype cells 1 power inverter of 100 kw  manufacturer abb metal support structure for ballastmounting with concrete tiles on the roof communication and monitoring system each juicepole electrical vehicle charging station can charge two vehicles at the same time 22 kw for each socket can be accessed via the juicepass mobile application or a rfid card is compatible with all available electric vehicles with selflocking type 2type 3a sockets available in europe the equipment and technologies used by enel x in the project have high performance and reliability and are sourced from traditional producers on the global photovoltaic system market benefits reduction of annuall consumption the system installed by enel on the gemi center building in arad will contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 486 tonsyear  it has an installed capacity of 10335 kw reduction of costs gemi center will achieve a reduction in annual costs with the help of renewable energy and in the long run will allow the centers contractors to reduce their energy bills too digitalization of processes applying the ecodesign logic and architecture for both photovoltaic panels and the juicepole charging stations enel x has available smart hardware and software to optimize
