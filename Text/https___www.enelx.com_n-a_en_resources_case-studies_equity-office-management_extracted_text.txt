of class a office space throughout the united states over its 25 years of operation its holdings have included some of the countrys most recognizable buildings including the iconic san francisco ferry building equity office is dedicated to responsible investment and ownership and energy efficiency plays a significant role in maintaining that standard currently equity office uses enel x to collect and analyze realtime energy data from more than 40 properties in california colorado nevada and florida many of which are leed certified the challenge with 45 million square feet of property under management establishing best practices for energy management and ensuring those practices are upheld can be daunting many different variables including the cost of electricity varying utility contract structures and big temperature swings region by region add further complexity the equity office team works diligently to keep their buildings operating optimally but like most building managers they often find their time and resources weighted towards reactive fixes not proactive energy management in addition the team was expending valuable resources entering data into the governmentrun energy star database the solution equity office began using realtime energy data to better manage their energy spend in 2005 they enrolled several new york and new england properties in local demand response dr programs giving them access to streaming usage data at each site although the dr payments were a muchwelcomed revenue stream they realized the potential for far greater savings in 2012 they deployed enel xs full energy intelligence software eis package across 40 sites enabling them to zero in on operational best practices and find and correct unnecessary waste after initial success equity office and enel x are now deploying utility bill management software at 45 facilities in southern california having a utility bill management system will dramatically streamline energy star reporting practices by centralizing utility invoices and automatically pushing new bill data to the companys energy star portfolio manager accounts the results to date enel x has identified energy efficiency measures eems that will total more than 800000 in annual savings across equity offices portfolio equity offices team has already implemented an impressive 300000 of these identified savings recognizing that they maximize return on investment roi by maximizing operational efficiency more than 300000 of the total savings opportunities identified can be traced back to unnecessary nighttime usage by optimizing their overnight consumption see graph on next page equity office derived immediate lasting savings without incurring any capital expense optimizing startup protocolsensuring that facilities are meeting their contractual heating and cooling obligations without starting up too earlyaccounts for another 250000 in identified savings similarly starting shutdown earlier in the day while still maintaining occupant comfort also led to over 150000 in identified savings although weekend waste represents the smallest portion of the overall savings the team was quick to act realizing approximately 30000 in annual savings simply by ensuring that buildings were properly shut down over unoccupied weekends in addition to direct cost savings energy intelligence software has helped equity office develop a competitive advantage in several key ways preventing waste before it occurs equity office actively uses the alerting feature in the enel x platform to get notified of waste before it occurs equity office presets alerts to be pushed via email or text any time a buildings consumption exceeds its baseload during an unoccupied period allowing the facilities staff to address the problem before costs are incurred this feature is especially useful during holidays and other periods where buildings are scheduled to be unoccupied and staff wouldnt necessarily be doing building walkthroughs guarding against drift as equity office implements new eems they want to make sure each generates maximum returns and none are inadvertently overridden or reversed eis allows them to easily guard against buildings drifting back towards preinvestment consumption levels with a portfolio of over 40 sites and energy efficiency projects constantly being carried out across the portfolio eis makes an otherwise cumbersome task extremely simple rather than inputting utility bills into a spreadsheet and comparing them to previous months sitebysite eis delivers periodical reports comparing energy consumption for each site to consumption in previous periods equity office can specify the comparison period to make sure theyre seeing how much energy a building used prior to a specific energy efficiency measure and how much less its using now better yet equity office can set alerts to be sent automatically if a building exceeds its expected baseload postimplementation when a building is shut down the baseload should reflect the influence of an eem if not or if the baseload jumps back to preeem levels they receive an immediate alert they can act on if consumption levels have remained the same or gone up equity office can use the software to scrutinize whether factors like weather might be masking the actual effects of the eem more nuanced tenant pricing with eis equity offices portfolio manager can assess the costs of running a building beyond standard hours of operation this helps them determine how much to quote tenants who need fully serviced offices after hours as well equity office uses the software to calculate how many kwh an occupied building is over its baseline during afterhours use enel x then calculates how much that overage is costing equity office using the companys blended tariff rate this proves invaluable for accurately calculating revenue generation at each property and ensuring profitability seasonality adjustment equity office maintains a sizeable building maintenance and operations staff across their portfolio the staff rotates among buildings and regularly make new hires so maintaining consistent operations across their portfolio can be a challenge from season to season new facilities staff dont necessarily know how a particular building should be optimally operating they often need clarification or reminders from someone who understands the buildings operations inside out enel xs energy analysts provide equity office with that expertise persistently advising equity offices team on how to keep energy consumption at its ideal for each building as weather conditions and occupancy change incentivizing energy efficiency the executives at equity office understand that operational changes require buy in from up and down the organization eis gives them the ability to compare and rank a portfolio of facilities based on the percent of daytime demand reduced during the night likewise individual building managers with the greatest reduction levels are rewarded for running the tightest ship enel xs software gives managers the ability to track and report on performance in real time at a high level of granularity monitoring how theyre doing and simplifying reporting incentivizing energy efficiency equity office and enel x just completed an energy supply management analysis for a group of sites in california unearthing significant savings opportunities enel xs energy supply management advisors carefully reviewed tariff data and utility bills from several years back searching for general savings opportunities and statespecific nuances that may have been overlooked the advisors discovered that these properties had inadvertently fallen back to their default tariff between contract terms and as a consequence were being overcharged nearly 50 on peak demand charges and 20 on energy supply management charges when their energy supply management contract is next up for renewal equity office will
