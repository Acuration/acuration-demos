complicated which is why we work closely with pjm to ensure demand response remains a viable program while its true that there are other options in pjm the emergency load response program elrp continues to be the most attractive program for most of our customers elrp demand response remains the most financially attractive program in pjm elrp is the largest demand response program in pjm

capacity payments under the new capacity performance program than the previous base capacity program by 22 on average source 2019 demand response operations market activity report january 2020 pjm
