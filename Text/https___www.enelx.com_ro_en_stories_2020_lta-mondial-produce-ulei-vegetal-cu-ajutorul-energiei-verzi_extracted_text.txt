food producers with romanian shareholding the company intends to adopt a modern system of green energy generation in order to significantly diminish its annual consumption and emission of glasshouse gases photovoltaic system simulator choose the green energy of a photovoltaic system to power your business begin simulation  at lta mondial we are set to get as close to nature as possible and to respect the environment that is why we have decided to invest in the photovoltaic panels system designed and installed by enel x romania in our factory in baia this system enabling us to reduce the costs of the electric power we consume  adam liuță general manager of lta mondial solution enel x romania proposed the turnkey implementation of a pv system installed on the roof of the workshop in baia tulcea county as follows 432 highefficiency photovoltaic panels  with polycrystallinetype cells 2 inverters one supporting metallic structure one monitoring system panels canadian solar have been installed on the roof supported with specifically designed metallic structures and two inverters one of 100kw and the second of 50 kw  abb manufacture have been installed at ground level on metallic support the system is designed for selfconsumption the customer being a prosumator who does not inject electric power in the grid the equipment and technologies used by enel x for this project have high levels of performance and reliability these being sourced from acknowledged manufacturers benefits reduction of costs lta mondial will manage to decrease the annual costs by the use of green energy the estimation being that it will recover the investment in the pv system in six years and four months reduction of annual consumption the project of enel x romania will help the company to decrease its annual power consumption from the network by almost 8 and also to prevent the emissions of glasshouse gases of about 86 tons per year  the pv system has an installed capacity of 15552 kw  capable of producing energy in a quantity of about 188 mwh per year digitalization of processes by using the ecodesign logic and architecture in order to find an ideal ratio between cost and benefit enel x romania supplies equipment and software applications specialized in the optimization and monitoring of the proposed pv systems thus lta mondial benefits from the most advanced technologies in order to maximize the energy production and the performance with a minimum impact on the environment  the project we have just completed together with lta mondial is a model to be followed also by
