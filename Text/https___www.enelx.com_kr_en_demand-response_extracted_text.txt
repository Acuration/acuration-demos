peak demand and finedust demand response which can be done without a request for demand reduction by the kpx economic  businesses who participate in the reliability program can also participate in voluntary bidding to compete with the generation price from power generation plants peak businesses can curtail their load when power supply is expected to exceed the standard level of demand due to winter and summer peak usages and earn revenue finedust businesses can curtail their load due to the emission of finedust caused by coal generation and be rewarded if your business is enrolled in
