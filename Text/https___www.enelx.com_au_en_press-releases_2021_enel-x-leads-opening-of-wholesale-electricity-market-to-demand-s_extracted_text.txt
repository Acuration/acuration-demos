demandside participation wholesale demand response mechanism wdrm launched in the national electricity market nem melbourne 25 october 2021  in a major reform to australias energy market the wholesale demand response mechanism wdrm commenced trading today with enel x leading the charge as the first to offer demandside energy resources into the wholesale electricity market the wdrm allows demand response to be sold directly into the electricity market to help balance supply and demand at critical times enel x is the operator of australias largest virtual power plant vpp 1 and a pioneer in the countrys demand response markets enel x was registered as the markets first demand response service provider last thursday enabling it to offer its commercial and industrial customers energy flexibility to the market at critical times participating customers will compete alongside traditional power stations in the spot market and be paid to reduce their power consumption when called upon

australias most affordable path to decarbonisation progressive organisations recognise the importance of developing demand response capabilities to support their sustainability objectives and are seizing this opportunity the market urgently needs new flexible resources to balance renewables and replace retiring coal generation demand response is the most costeffective resource available and we are working to maximise its use to ensure affordability and reliability of power during the renewable energy transition  the wdrm also has an important role to play in australias renewable energy transition as it is a longterm market mechanism that will incentivise the development of new demand response resources the australian energy market operator aemo estimates that we will need to build up to 19gw of new dispatchable resources by 2040 to balance renewable power and replace retiring coalfired power stations 2  each mw of demand response in the wdrm will lessen the need for investment into other more expensive resources supporting australias shift to a low carbon energy future enel xs entry into the wdrm expands on the companys longstanding experience helping businesses to provide
