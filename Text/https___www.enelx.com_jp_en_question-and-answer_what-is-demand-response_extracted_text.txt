operators relied completely on traditional power stations to meet fluctuations in demand when demand increases in order to avoid the risk of a blackout utilities and grid operators must boost their energy supply by acquiring it on the market or firing up a spare power plant built to meet these demand peaks however the climate crisis and the resulting need to decarbonize the economy means that by 2050 79 of the energy produced is expected to come from renewables which by their very nature produce an unpredictable energy supply that cannot be turned on and off on top of that global electricity demand will rise an estimated 60 by 2040 therefore demand response is becoming more important because programs allow utilities and grid operators to adapt to this new energy scenario by enabling them to offer incentives to companies to be more flexible in their energy demands in other words demand response programs which provide financial payments to companies who agree to modulate their energy consumption in response to grid signals are the tool used to improve grid stability while making it possible to integrate renewable energy into the grid  its a winwin solution for companies looking to boost their bottom line and for grid operators seeking to avoid significant capital expenditures on new capacity what is the benefit to participate demand response why demand response there are many demand response benefits for companies and several types of demand response programs are available these programs offer an opportunity for companies schools offices factories commercial property and
