most substantial resiliency challenges of the 21st century in uncertain times it is imperative that organizations have sound preset contingency strategies that enable them to react to change quickly and effectively in order to mitigate disruption and economic losses caused by extreme events businesses must start thinking strategically about the value of resiliency in recent years resiliency has been imperative as climate change has made extreme weather events Ô¨Åercer and more frequent causing pressure on the outdated electrical grid that resulted in widespread power outages this season the unprecedented covid19 pandemic could exacerbate these challenges predictions of an especially active hurricane season as well as reports noting an above average chance that a single storm could knock out power to 1 million or more people along the eastern seaboard  is cause for concern as covid19 social distancing requirements impact the time it takes for utilities to address electricity issues similarly while californians are still reeling from the effects of last years wildfires social distancing parameters have already poised challenges as authorities try to take preemptive measures  like trimming trees near power lines  to avoid similar destruction this year in fact california just experienced its driest month on record and with fewer prescribed burns due to covid19 there could be elevated wildfire risk this season shifts in energy usage due to covid19 may result in additional pressure on the grid although a remote workforce will ultimately save energy in buildings daily residential energy use across the country is estimated to increase by 68 and critical facilities are using high volumes of power more frequently  which could increase peakdemand periods and lead to widespread blackouts at enel x we leverage innovative alternative energy technologies to help businesses sustain operations during these uncertain times in a sustainable and costefficient way combining renewables with storage coupling onsite renewables with battery storage systems allows facilities to generate and store lowcost clean electricity with ample sunlight solarplusstorage systems can provide several days of backup power in the event of an outage this electricity can be used during extreme weather events to alleviate pressure from the grid and save money at umass boston the system pairs 1 mw solar array with 05 mw lithiumion battery system to reduce the universitys overall grid dependency while delivering significant cost savings in addition to solarplusstorage systems microgrids deliver even greater resiliency by enabling the system to island off the grid for extended periods sometimes indefinitely in 2017 costa rica experienced a nationwide blackout that cut 14 million homes and businesses from the grid for several hours with a microgrid establishment labs a global leader in the production of high tech medical and aesthetic equipment with operations in costa rica was able to continue powering critical equipment in its clean room and survived the crisis without sustaining any financial setback controlling consumption demandresponse programs provide financial incentives for businesses to lower their energy use during highcost peakdemand periods  thus freeing up energy to meet the increased demand when the grid is stressed organizations that can reduce their energy usage can earn payments while helping to keep the lights on and energy costs low for the community existing demand response programs with utilities like ameren missouri and salt river project in arizona provide significant economic benefits to commercial and industrial customers while delivering a more flexible and resilient grid expanding digitalization digitalization through distributed energy resources der optimization software allows customers and electricity system operators to control where when and how electricity is used it also increases realtime situational awareness and preparedness enabling site controllers to make control decisions throughout the day based on factors such as realtime demand time of use and solar production the iot technology to balance the grid in real time already exists but utilities and energy users must implement it in order to revolutionize the entire energy system this technology can be applied to both utilities and small local networks like microgrids that can sustainably manage the energy mix adopting alternative energy options like these will not only help boost the reliability of our countrys energy supply but also allow facilities to store lowcost clean electricity and use it during peak demand periods and emergency situations in the years ahead these offerings are scalable so companies of all sizes and across all industries  from manufacturing and technology to financial service institutions universities and pharmaceutical companies  have the opportunity to improve their energy practices and pave the way for a greener tomorrow related stories explore other recent stories within this category energy market insights for june 2023 energy market insights for june 2023 find out
