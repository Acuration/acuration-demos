using python and other programming languages what are the challenges you have faced since joining enel x japan i had no knowledge of the power industry so it took me a while to get used to a large amount of terminology i also had a hard time grasping the overall picture of the industry such as how related organizations like power transmission and distribution companies retailers jepx japan electric power exchange and occto organization for crossregional coordination of transmission operators interacted with each other and what roles each had i was able to overcome these challenges by learning the basics through onthejob training ojt and by asking senior members enel x has a culture of asking anything to anyone i have never encountered a senior employee who told me to ask anything and then gave me a sour look when i tried to ask a question it was really helpful and i am grateful for that how would you describe the interpersonal relationships there is a relaxed atmosphere here regardless of age or company background on the other hand naturally i feel that everyone treats each other with respect and uses polite language i feel it is very wellbalanced i think that people at enel x tend to communicate on a factual basis without emotional arguments it is because each employee first understands the current situation that they are able to think logically and build a flat relationship where they can ask anyone anything what is your favorite part of your job at enel x i enjoy the time when i am creating tools to predict electricity data using python because the knowledge i acquired in graduate school comes in handy i also enjoy creating work automation tools i find it rewarding when i am able to improve the efficiency of work for the team through these tools because i can see visible results and contribute to improvement i am very happy to receive recognition when people tell me that my work is helpful or great what are your career plans at enel x in the

think i am maintaining a good worklife balance without any decrease in work efficiency or productivity what do you enjoy outside of work on my days off i sometimes look for nearby gourmet restaurants and go out to eat our office is located in nihonbashi muromachi where there are many wellestablished restaurants and gourmet food making it a great place to have lunch on weekdays sometimes the entire
