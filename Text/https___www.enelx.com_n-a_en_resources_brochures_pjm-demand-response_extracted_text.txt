the grid require participating sites reduce their demand from the grid within minutes of being notifiedeither by shifting load to an onsite generator or by curtailing energy use in return participants can earn significant payments for helping to stabilize the grid during these critical periods economic demand response earn additional revenue by responding to price signals in the energy market pjms economic demand response program pays you to reduce electricity demand during highpriced hours demand can be reduced by curtailing load or switching to permitted onsite generation as a participant in the program you earn the same rate for capacity delivered as traditional generators and also realize savings on your electricity bills for using less energy when prices are at their highest unlike other forms of dr where dispatches are initiated by the utility or grid operator in economic markets you control if and when you participatethink of it as schedule your own dr program faqs elrp economic dr srm 1 how does it work how does it work when pjm interconnection determines there is not enough supply to meet demand and there is a risk of a blackout a dispatch is transmitted to enel xs dr network and participating businesses reduce their energy usage for a short period of time participants earn recurring capacity payments for agreeing to curtail electricity consumption in response to abnormally high demand and additional energy payments based on their performance during dispatches 2 how does my business benefit how does my business benefit maximize payments to your bottom line enel x manages your participation from start to finish ensuring you earn the highest possible financial reward since 2003 our customers have earned more than 1b in payments protect your operations dr

what is the dr opportunity in pjm what is the dr opportunity in pjm as those who were impacted by 2014s extreme weather event known as the polar vortex experienced firsthand gridrelated emergencies are not isolated to summer months pjm has since implemented measures to ensure greater reliability of generation resources during winter months but also recognizes the need to have a more dynamic resource in their energy supply stack throughout the year dr offers clean reliable and direct relief to the grid that would otherwise require the use of high investment resources eg peaking power plants participation in dr not only prevents rolling blackouts but keeps consumers informed of important grid conditions and reduces energy costs for ratepayers as of june 2020 capacity performance cp will be the one yearround product offered in the emergency load response program elrp 4 how do i participate how do i participate enel x makes participation easy we take care of the complex details so you can stay focused on running your business 1 our local experts work with you to identify your energy reduction potential and create a strategy that delivers maximum value with minimum impact on

center noc so we can monitor your energy consumption levels in realtime 3 your site is then enrolled and ready to respond if and when a dispatch begins at any time during a dispatch you can log in to view your performance in realtime throughout the process we fully manage enrollment measurement verification and payments on your behalf 5 what can i expect during a dispatch what can i expect during a dispatch notification when pjm anticipates the need for support it dispatches the enel x network into action enel x notifies you via email and sms informing you when the dispatch will begin response

during and after a dispatch the noc remains in communication with your facility our team is available to answer questions and help ensure that you achieve the highest possible levels of performance and payments 6 what types of reductions can i make what types of reductions can i make enel x has extensive experience creating reduction strategies that work within the operational limitations of a wide variety of unique facilities including cold storage manufacturers food processors universities malls office buildings and more common reduction examples include reduce nonessential lighting modify manufacturing processes adjust hvac equipment dial back pumps change settings in industrial freezers our customers find that many energyintensive processes can simply be shifted by a few hours to facilitate dispatch participation and if you have a generator set we can help ensure its compliance for use in dr ask us about our experience working with customers like you 7 what triggers an emergency dispatch what triggers an emergency dispatch emergency dispatches occur when demand for electricity threatens to outstrip supply creating a reliability issue this situation often occurs on extremely hot days in the summer when increased hvac usage causes demand to reach unusually high levels typically resulting in transmission congestion in other cases dr dispatches can be caused by a reduction in available supply from for example a generator or power plant tripping offline or running out of fuel in either case very specific reliability conditions have to be met in order for pjm to dispatch its dr network when dispatched you are responding to a very real grid emergency your participation is critical for ensuring that the lights stay on in your community 8 how often will i be dispatched how often will i be dispatched your pjm zone seasonal weather grid congestion and other local factors will influence how often you are dispatched historically pjm has called 12 dispatches per year in any given zone if an emergency dispatch is not called pjm will schedule a twohour audit for demand response participants to demonstrate performance capabilities 9 when were recent emergencies declared when were recent emergencies declared since 2007 pjm has called a total of 17 emergency dispatches on summer afternoons during times of unseasonably warm weather and 7 in the winter all during the 2014 polar vortex there have been no emergency dispatches since 2015 which is largely attributable to pjms healthy reserve margin and stricter nonperformance penalties for traditional generators 10 how are capacity and energy baselines calculated how are capacity and energy baselines calculated pjm uses different methodologies to calculate capacity and energy baselines for participants enel xs software includes individual performance targets based on the pjmdefined baselines summer baseline for capacity payments equal to the peak load contribution plc the plc value is determined based on the participants average demand during the 5 highest peak hours of the 5 highest peak days on the entire pjm grid during the previous summer winter baseline for capacity payments equal to the winter peak load wpl the wpl value is similar to the plc however it is based on an individual participants peak demand between the hours of 6am and 9pm est on the 5 highest peak days from the previous winter baseline for energy payments all seasons based on a participants average demand during the dispatch hours on the preceding days participants are compensated for any realtime reductions below the energy baseline view the pdf 1 how do i participate in the program how do i participate in the program 1 enel x works with you to develop a dispatch participation plan
