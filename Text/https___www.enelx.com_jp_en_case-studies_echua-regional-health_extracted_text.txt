equipment increases site resilience and earns revenue with demand response summary of conversation with mark hooper echuca regional health location australia customer echuca regional health sector hospital customer information this echuca regional health case study is based on a project developed in enel x australia echuca regional health echuca regional health is a fullservice hospital in australia providing a comprehensive range of 24hour emergency room acute medical surgical and subacute services plus residential aged care and a broad range of community healthcare services background of echuca regional health participating vpp echuca regional health is widely recognized throughout the region for its holistic and progressive approach to energy management and sustainability with a proven innovation track record echuca regional health features one of the largest solar thermal arrays in australia providing not only heating but also absorption cooling to the hospitals highefficiency hvac system 12mw of thermal energy storage which is utilized for peak demand management and a new 500kw solar photovoltaic array that is currently underway in addition the hospital has been utilizing its backup generators to participate in a virtual power plant vpp vpp is a collection of distributed energy assets including backup generators batteries and flexible loads that work together to provide additional dispatchable capacity to the grid vpps are called into operation for short durations when large power stations suddenly fail when demand outweighs supply or when climatic events threaten grid stability mark hooper executive project manager at echuca regional health said vpp participation is a natural fit for the hospital participation helps us enhance site resilience in the face of a weakening grid and earn significant new revenue which can be reinvested into backup power infrastructure to further enhance system reliability what is vpp explains about vpp how it works and the future of vpp read faq protection from unplanned grid disruptions in australia the rapid uptake of renewable energy and the retirement of coal thermal power plants is impacting grid reliability the grid needs additional flexible capacity from alternate sources such as vpps to help stabilize the grid reduce power prices and prevent broader power outages  vpp participation provides a unique benefit of advanced notification of potential grid disruptions hooper said we expect the grid to be reliable and clearly its not we need to ensure our facility is available for its core purpose of providing primary healthcare 247365 with participation we get advanced warning of grid instability which is advantageous as we can prepare for a grid event and dont have to experience a break in power if an outage occurs we view vpp participation as another way of keeping our patients safe if we know theres a response request coming it allows us to fire up our generator and get off the grid preventing interruption to powerwe have full site generator backup for the hospital and can synchronize with the grid to take ourselves offline this means a seamless transition where the site doesnt experience unscheduled interruptions during events the fact that joining the vpp allows us to also get paid to respond to these events its a winwin scenario  he added achieving a new standard of emergency preparation by participating in a vpp echuca regional health can regularly test its backup power capabilities at times and in conditions when grid emergencies are most likely to occur providing the truest test of emergency preparedness and resilience to grid disruptions hooper said a benefit is that you run your generators during a time youre likely running a hefty load the key is youre being asked to run your generator when the grid still has power its an excellent tool for testing and ironing out any assumptions made around reliability at a time when you wouldnt normally run your generator the reality is that if the grid fails its probably going to be on a hot summer day right when you dont want it to vpp participation gives us the strength of conviction to know on a hot day where were running a high load that our generators can do the job there have been events where through this program weve found some issues we didnt know existed and the consequence has been far less than had it occurred at a time when wed lost power so ironing out those problems means that when you lose power and need to run your generator sets you know the resilience is there because all those issues are sorted were required to run our generators on load anyway so if were doing it already as part of vpp participation then we can then defer our weekly test because weve already met the requirements of the australian standards to test them on load he added protecting sensitive equipment vpps respond quickly to deviations in the grids frequency when a large power station or transmission network suddenly fail to prevent cascading grid failures echuca regional health participates in this program which also helps the hospital to protect its sensitive equipment hooper said when theres a frequency event the vpp automatically switches the site over to our generator we have electronic equipment thats sensitive to voltage spikes and frequency deviations if the grid doesnt meet its required parameters then we trip off this helps us because we dont have groups of interruptions that destroy our sensitive electronic equipment by short sharp interruptions to power we were already doing something similar so it made sense to join this program and get paid for it a new revenue stream to further enhance reliability hooper said that vpp participation became a handinglove approach for the hospital where they could be paid for something they were already doing which could be reinvested into ensuring they have bestinclass redundancy systems our business model is based on continual improvement and one element we always run short of is cash we generate revenue and engineering departments are not generally revenue generators its nice to get revenue out of assets we already have in use participation allows us to meet all elements of continuous improvement and generate cash in a really nicely rounded program hooper said demand response discover our local program and benefits for your businesses learn more vpps are a winwin for hospitals and our transforming grid echuca regional health is providing what the australian energy market operator aemo has stated is an urgent need for new forms of capacity on the power grid echuca regional health is providing what the australian energy market operator aemo has stated is an urgent need for new forms of capacity on the power grid hooper said were a small user the vpp is about a lot of one percenter coming together to help out ive been encouraging my colleagues to participate because most of our sites have generators and have to test them anyway so we might as well run them and get paid for it i know some have used the income to increase the size of their fuel supply others have used it to install automatic switching or upgrade their plcs its a winwin because the reliable capacity that we can provide to the grid is improved by putting the money back into
