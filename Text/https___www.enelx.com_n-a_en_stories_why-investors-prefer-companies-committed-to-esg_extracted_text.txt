about the financial benefits of sustainability this was in some ways a part of the socially responsible investing sri philosophythat sustainability in business was a matter of acting ethically which sometimes came at the cost of financial performance but its now clear that idea is no longer the common or mainstream view in finance more and more investment firms including the largest in the world believe that a focus on environmental social and governance esg and increased sustainability will in fact improve your financial valuation blackrock goes all in on esg in his recent 2020 letter to ceos larry fink chairman and ceo of blackrock said that the investment firm will begin to consider esg issues as a core investment criteria it was a major moment for sustainability in finance blackrock the largest asset manager in the world had generally avoided taking outright stances on sustainability previously though fink had perhaps built up to this point in previous letters to ceos in 2018 for instance he said that without a sense of purpose no company either public or private can achieve its full potential yet in the years following that letter blackrock still faced mounting criticism and protests by environmental activists fink framed the 2020 announcement as a financial one rather than a political one climate change has become a defining factor in companies longterm prospects fink wrote last september when millions of people took to the streets to demand action on climate change many of them emphasized the significant and lasting impact that it will have on economic growth and prosperity  a risk that markets to date have been slower to reflect but awareness is rapidly changing and i believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance the broader investor movement toward esg finks announcement is a major step in the industry but its part of a much larger change in finance last year robert g eccles and svetlana klimenko interviewed 70 senior executives at 43 global investing firms for an article in harvard business review they found that  esg was almost universally top of mind for these executives  there are a variety of reasons for one as investment firms grow in size there is no hedge against the global economy yet of all the reasons cited  higher returns growing demand and more  they are nearly all fiduciary none of the reasoning stems from purely environmental concerns how companies can get started with esg many companies have ambitions to begin a sustainability plan but dont know where to begin enel x covered the process in our sustainable energy strategy guide  which suggests the world business council for sustainable developments guidelines for an integrated energy strategy as a starting point blackrock suggests the uns sustainable development goals sdgs as well and also encourages companies to adhere to the kpis in the guidelines of the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd and the sustainability accounting standards board sasb whom we also discuss in our guide the process is difficult without an integrated strategy so make sure you have a clear approach and full buyin before beginning a focus on esg produces better returns these decisions are not merely ethical but instead reflect a growing belief that companies will not thrive without esg commitments in the harvard business review survey they noted that financial returns are one of the main reasons for the change in investment practices many corporate managers still equate sustainable investing with its predecessor socially responsible investing sri and believe that adhering to its principles entails sacrificing some financial return in order to make the world a better place eccles and klimenko write that view is outdated they cite several largescale studies in the article to support the notion that a company that is committed to esg will outperform those that are not even rigorously controlling for these companies size indeed the energy companies in the sp 500 which features traditional energy giants like exxon mobil and chevron was the sp 500s worst performing sector in 2014 2015 2018 and 2019  as the wall street journal notes and bloomberg notes that energy was the worst performing sector in the 2010s by a wide margin  related stories explore other recent stories within this category
