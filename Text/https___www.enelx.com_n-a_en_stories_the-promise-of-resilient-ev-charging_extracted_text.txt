video takeaways resiliency in transport electrification is a key consideration in energy transition plans for businesses enel x has recently completed a resilient service station in massachusetts demonstrating a working model for reducing emissions while ensuring resiliency at an ev charging station enel x has experience navigating the challenges of unlocking financial and sustainability benefits for solar  storage  ev charging for customers as seen from its umass boston and vta partnerships  pilot resilient service station in ma on may 9 2022 enel x announced the launch of a microgrid at global partners lps alltown fresh service station in ayer massachusetts the project was partially funded through innovatemass resilient service stations challenge which sought to ensure continuous power for service stations near evacuation routes across the state during emergencies the microgrid will offer onsite generated power to alltown fresh ayer by integrating solar panels on the canopy a battery storage unit and integration of a portable generator connection all designed built operated and financed by enel x to support electric vehicle ev drivers enel x also installed a universally compatible juicepump 50kw which can charge vehicles up to 80 battery capacity in 30 to 60 minutes the project served to prove the concept demonstrating enel xs ability to develop deliver on and finance an integrated solar  storage  ev charging project and do so at leastcost to the customer the promise of resilient ev charging 27 of us ghg emissions 2020 come from transportation making transport electrification a significant step toward decarbonizing the economy while many ev drivers are motivated by sustainability their practical daytoday need is the constant availability of energy for their vehicles they may prefer to help the energy transition by seeking out green generation sources to charge their ev but typical solar  storage systems cannot achieve full resiliency and as a result even the most sustainabilitymotivated ev drivers cannot solely rely on solar  storage for alwaysavailable charging during grid emergencies microgrids  a group of ders with the ability to operate as an aggregated asset and to function in islanded mode  offer the promise of clean and resilient ev charging by orchestrating multiple supply and demand resources and optimizing them as a single asset microgrids can enable ev drivers to power their vehicles with clean energy maximize selfconsumption of solar and reduce demand charges from the local utility by disconnecting from the grid in cases of emergencies microgrids can provide added energy resilience in power outage events and support the local grid by decreasing overall system load valuing and investing in resiliency currently the biggest challenge to widespread adoption of clean and resilient microgrids is financial yet while businesses may think the price tag is too high this is typically because they do not fully account for the value of resiliency in their decisionmaking augmenting resiliency controls for a simple backup system can cost 50200k while adding a fullon microgrid can be upwards of a half a million dollars in additional islanding hardware and controls but the additional costs can be justified if benefits of avoided outages outweigh the costs of added resiliency to help businesses understand the costs of losing power and on the flip side the value of resiliency we can make a simple attempt at quantifying the costs of lost business  first estimate costs associated with delays in the delivery of goods or transportation of personnel who are completing critical missions next multiply that by the expected number and duration of outages each year set to increase in both frequency and magnitude with climate change by quantifying the costs businesses can better understand the urgency of building up a resilient energy solution partner expertise can improve economics the alltown fresh service station was able to make the project pencil out from a combination of incentives market revenues and savings the innovatemass grant federal state and local incentive programs eg federal ss investment tax credit massachusetts solar  storage smart incentives national grids ev made ready incentives unlocking market access to earn revenues for added energy flexibility utility bill savings through demand charge management and energy arbitrage whereas ev made ready incentives grid upgrade incentives to support ev charging can be found in most utilities the innovatemass funding and smart incentives are only available on a casebycase basis applying for and obtaining these incentives was made possible with enel xs extensive market experience and tight project management earning and maximizing market revenues for energy flexibility likewise requires extensive market expertise inhouse network operations center experience and an established presence in the region enel x demonstrates all of these capabilities by managing the microgrids participation in installed capacity tag icap mitigation isone energy markets demand response with local distribution utilities and clean peak as well as optimizing onbill savings and performance through demand charge management and backup power during grid outages this variety of values streams maximizes the microgrids value to the business and system scaling solar  storage  ev charging what makes a good candidate looking at the fundamentals a resilient energy solution makes most sense in subindustries where there is highly peaky demand and large energy consumption we have seen significant ev and electrification demand from transit agencies schools and large commercial and industrial fleet operators like pepsico  more than 70000 vehicles  according to transport dive and fedex  more than 200000 vehicles  these businesses need energy resilience and peakshaving at their depots and tractoryards as they electrify at a massive scale the microgrid system architecture requested by these businesses is essentially a scaleup of the resilient service station microgrid they want resiliency solutions for ev charging and building loads using a solar  storage system with additional controls to connect portable gensets that could support more extended grid outages outside of these highvalue subsegments such a solution can also make sense in instances where outages significantly affect a businesss bottom line if an organizations quantified losses from grid outages are high enough those losses can justify the additional costs of resilient hardware and controls whether that is a simple backup or a more complex microgrid for example the table below shows an illustrative pro forma associated with a solar  storage project for a packaging facility accounting for the resiliency benefits increases annual benefits or avoided losses from 310k to 856k a year it can decrease the payback period for the combined system from 42 years to 17 years again this is only an illustrative example  the specific costs and benefits will depend on how the businesses think about valuing resiliency scenarios net capex after incentives avg ann benefits savings  revenue payback irr solar  storage 1800000 310000 40 21 solar  storage  simple backup 1950000 310000 42 20 solar  storage  simple backup  quantified resiliency benefits 1950000 856000 17 49 bottom line factoring the value of resiliency into a microgrid evaluation can seem like a daunting task but companies will be better off if they proactively invest in resiliency to protect their businesses as energy uncertainty grows organizations now face the adverse impacts of climate change such as more frequent and severe power outages an aging grid and the
