participation the university of queensland uq recently installed the states largest behindthemeter battery a 11mw  215mwh tesla powerpack to support its objective of becoming the worlds first university to offset 100 of its electricity needs with renewables in 2020 the 205 million asset is currently on track to pay for itself within eight years by enrolling the battery in clever energy management initiatives the university has secured a range of new revenue streams saving 74000 in its first quarter it earned 46000 from participating in frequency control ancillary services fcas with enel x 8500 from arbitrage and 19500 from its virtual cap program q1 performance of uqs 11mw tesla battery report what fcas participation looks like for uq by joining enel xs virtual power plant vpp uqs battery joins a collection of distributed energy resources including generators and equipment that provide critical grid services through demand response and flexibility programs enel x pays uq for being on standby to provide instant dispatchable capacity to the grid when large power stations or transmission lines suddenly fail this helps to keep the grids frequency in balance and reduces the threat of cascading power failures uq energy and sustainability manager andrew wilson said the high number of fcas events in q1 correlated to unprecedented network conditions across the nem with the summer bushfires and other extreme weather events with enel x we were able to provide instant capacity to support the grids frequency throughout this challenging period one of the key characteristics typical of batteries versus other forms of energy storage is their incredibly fast response times during commissioning tests our battery has responded from zero to full discharge at as fast as 200 milliseconds it can swap from full charge to full discharge in around 400 milliseconds this makes it an ideal technology for participation in the nems various fcas markets our capacity is available to respond in less than one second to a drop in system frequency below the threshold of 4985 hz until frequency is restored to the normal operating range wilson said fcas performance in action one performance example in uqs report shows an event that occurred on friday 6 march in the afternoon when unit 4 of the loy yang a brown coal power station in victoria unexpectedly tripped offline resulting in the sudden loss of 558 mw of generation and causing the mainland nem frequency to dip as low as 4975 hz  well below the contingency fcas trigger point of 4985 hz enel xs onsite meter sensed this frequency deviation and immediately signalled to the battery to switch from charging at a rate of 919 kw to discharging at a sustained rate of 1099 kw  providing the equivalent of 202 mw of instantaneous reserve generation into the network to help arrest the fall in frequency this event lasted five minutes in which the battery resumed normal operation after frequency was restored to within its safe operating range we are pleased with the q1 results which builds on our relationship with enel x that dates back to february 2018 our 600 kw pilot lithium ion battery at the gatton campus was the first behindthemeter battery in australia to participate in the fcas market joining the grid only two months after the hornsdale power reserve commenced operation wilson said fcas with enel x three years ago nearly all of fcas came from traditional fossil fuel power stations following a 2017 rule change that opened the market to other players enel x was the first new entrant to register a vpp in the fcas market enel xs vpp is the biggest in australia bloomberg new energy finance 2019 its built from a network of distributed energy resources across nearly 100 commercial and industrial sites around australia that respond in realtime when needed by the power grid we have unmatched market access to a number of flexibility programs and by enrolling our customers in multiple programs they can maximise their revenue earned renewable energy case study demand response 4 vpps are becoming an increasingly important resource to the electricity grid and market operators the australian energy market operator has stated energy markets must be redesigned to allow for the greatest amount of participation by both demand and supply resources as soon as possible and begin to pay more accurately for the firming capability and other services we need to keep the system intact vpps utilise existing assets so they are built quickly and with a low capital investment per mw of capacity as australia accelerates its transition to renewable power largescale vpps are critical to achieving a costeffective renewable future access uqs the business case for
