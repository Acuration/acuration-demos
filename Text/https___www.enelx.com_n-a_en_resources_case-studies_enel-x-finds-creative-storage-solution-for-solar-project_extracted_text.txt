powered 100 by renewable energy download pdf location mauna loa manufacturing plant in keaau hawaii challenge capture excess onsite solar generation for later use solution battery energy storage system with deros optimization software benefit site powered by 100 renewable energy avoiding 1000 tons of co2eyear the partner dsd renewables dsd renewables dsd is a renewable energy company that pushes the potential for solar forward by making it more accessible to forwardthinking commercial industrial and municipal organizations they work on largescale custom solar pv energy storage and electric vehicle charging infrastructure solutions the challenge capture benefits of excess solar generation in 2019 dsd began developing a large solar project with hawaiian host group for mauna loa a leading macadamia nut brand mauna loa wanted a cleaner way to power its manufacturing plant in keaau hawaii we chose enel x because they pair their hardware solutions with industryleading software their software platform creates flexibility for any typical asset integration but this project showed the power of that software and it was unique in that enel x is also able to help control existing generators at the site that needed a response platform matt kaufmann vp of energy storage and ev charging dsd but hawaii is a unique energy market and that created complications the state ended netmetering in 2015 a process by which grid operators reward customers for exporting excess generation back to the grid because of this at times mauna loas large solar generation would exceed their energy demands and they would have to curtail solar without capturing value from that excess solar generation they would not be unlocking the full benefits of their solar installation the solution adding storage with enel x finding creative solutions for unique problems enel x has extensive experience in energy markets across north america having pioneered demand response aggregation in the early 2000s and enrolled electric customers in wholesale markets for the past two decades this experience allows enel x to find creative solutions for partners with unique problems in hawaii enel x partnered with dsd to ensure mauna loa could maximize the benefits of their system enel x customized a storage and optimization software solution that easily integrated with mauna loas existing electric infrastructure and the new solar asset because the project required longterm monitoring enel x also provided continued monitoring and operating services to maximize the benefits of the solarplusstorage package we chose enel x because they pair their hardware solutions with industryleading software said matt kaufmann vp of energy storage and ev charging dsd their software platform creates flexibility for any typical asset integration but this project showed the power of that software and it was unique in that enel x is also able to help control existing generators at the site that needed a response platform storage for a larger renewable offset dsd first looked to enel x to add storage to the solar system by adding energy storage instead of needing to curtail excess generation mauna loa could store that solar energy for later use to further reduce emissions with affordable clean energy the customer would have a greater renewable energy offset enel x has extensive experience in energy storageas of march 2022 enel x has completed over 130 storage projects in north america the enel x solution hardwaresoftware easily integrated with dsd renewables solar system making this a winning partnership longterm ongoing optimization with deros enel xs intelligent storage solution deros leverages bestinclass forecasting and optimization to automate storage operations deros learns consumption behaviors and uses information like customer tariffs available value streams and battery degradation costs to determine the best strategy for employing the storage asset enel x works with partners and customers to tailor the optimization criteria to achieve the customers primary objectives for mauna loa the battery system will maximize selfconsumption of solar and create bill savings for the customer through demand charge management and energy arbitrage adding existing assets to deros mauna loa already had generators at their facility to ensure resiliency in the face of any grid disruption the company wanted to be sure that these would be able to be smoothly integrated with the solar and storage additions with deros the generators solar and storage are now all controlled in one place the operations of these assets are automated but if the customer wants to manually toggle between the solar and their generator they have the flexibility to do that the result powered 100 by renewable energy as a result mauna loas processing plant in keaau will now be powered by 100 renewable energy by using this solarplusstorage system mauna loa will avoid over 1000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year this project was a great opportunity for dsd and enel x to apply our expertise in solar and storage development its exciting to be a part of this momentous project and enel x was a great partner to help mauna loa more effectively leverage solar and further reduce its environmental footprint eric pollock chief commercial officer at dsd related resources
