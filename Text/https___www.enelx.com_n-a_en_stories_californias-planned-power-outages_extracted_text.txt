week as a result of the ongoing fallout from the states recordbreaking wildfires in recent years amid heightened wildfire risk in the region the electric utility pacific gas  electric pge announced on tuesday that it would cut off power supply to about 800000 customers across central and northern california as a proactive measure shortly afterward southern california edison sce warned that it may need to shut off power to more than 173000 customers in the area surrounding los angeles the decision comes amid ongoing debate regarding liabilities for wildfires in 2017 and 2018 the latter of which was caused when strong winds forced pge transmission lines to come within close contact resulting in electric current igniting the dry vegetation nearby to help prevent a similar outcome pge has been actively removing vegetation from the area around its electric lines but has deemed the planned outages necessary with strong winds and low humidity levels increasing the risk this week the outage however may last longer than the strong winds themselves speaking to the new york times  a pge executive pointed out that the utilitys technicians will need to inspect every inch of line before restoring power which could potentially take five days to complete a separate bloomberg report cited estimates that if pges outage lasts for just two days the economic impact could reach 26 billion while this weeks planned outage is the largest to date it is not pges first proactive shutoff amid heightened wildfire risk given the conditions that led to it many do not expect it to be the last speaking to bloomberg michael wara director of the climate and energy policy program at stanford university said we have a grid that was built to manage a set of circumstances that dont exist anymore we are having to adapt to new circumstances brought about by climate change he added as californians prepare to withstand the outage businesses everywhere are thinking about these implications californias wildfires are just one example of the kind of external threat that could disrupt the electric grid infrastructure in a way that affects large energy consumers directly as these kinds of events become more common and more intense businesses will need to think strategically about how valuable resilience is to themand how they can address it in a costefficient way in environment  energy leaders new ebook ci solar plus storage challenges and opportunities  jason burwen vice president of policy for the energy storage association lays out the key questions that businesses need to ask when evaluating resilience including do you have critical loads that cant be interrupted without significant damages to your business how much would you have to pay for electricity interruption do you have materials or equipment that requires constant power whether the facilities leverage solarplusstorage more traditional backup generators or microgrid systems combining several distributed energy assets these are key considerations equally important are the costs to implementing these projects facing the alltoocommon struggles to secure meaningful capital for energyrelated projects many businesses are leveraging incentive programs energy market revenues and longterm return on investment to establish power purchase agreements and other creative financing mechanisms that remove the cost and risk of these investments as california has shown this week these challenges are immense and they are real however the solutions are real too and they are becoming more important every day
