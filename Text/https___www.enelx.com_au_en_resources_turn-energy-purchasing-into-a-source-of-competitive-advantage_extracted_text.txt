ahead of the game there has been extreme volatility in the australian  new zealand electricity markets over the last few years with this comes significant up to 50 variation in your retail electricity rate solely based on the time you resign your energy contract for many organisations reducing business costs can and should start with a better energy procurement strategy here are three tips on how to leverage energy procurement to your advantage 1 engage the market when prices offer good value not when your contract is about to expire when it comes to energy procurement waiting for contract renewal is the biggest mistake businesses make contract renewal should be treated as a risk management exercise we want businesses to engage the market when the market price is at optimal value not when an agreement is about to expire businesses shouldnt wait to buy electricity three or six months out from renewal if the market has good pricing 18 months before thats when you should lock in pricing equally one shouldnt lock away a three year deal just because the pressure is on as your current contract is about to expire its important to understand your business needs and to develop your risk tolerance now so you can negotiate an energy contract with the prices terms and conditions that deliver the best value for you there are now many products offered by retailers that allow you to actively purchase energy into the future so when the markets show value be in a position to secure it 2 dont get distracted by competitive tension between retailers the timing of market activity is much more important than the competitive tension in the request for proposal rfp process heres why if your business is tendering for the supply of electricity youll likely have three or more retailers competing to be your provider as they are all pricing from the same wholesale market the difference you would likely see on the current market price offered from different retailers may only be around 12 this difference comes down to how much they want your business at the time they may have just lost a big customer be the incumbent or be looking to grow their book thats not a lot of savings right the wholesale market moves around a lot if you engaged the market at a different time prices could be significantly higher or lower than today dont rely on the small percentage advantages of competitive tension between retailers  timing is everything 3 understand what your retailer is really doing for you a universal role of energy retailers is to provide businesses with a billing and customer service function but they often provide a wide range of additional services too you need to evaluate what these services are worth and enter an agreement with a retailer who meets your business needs one retailer may offer a comprehensive service package while a second may not provide any additional servicing its important to understand the value of the additional services are they a business necessity or just a nice to have large businesses may want the lowest cost without the bells and whistles its important to ensure your retailers offering aligns with your business goals and
