and extremely costly to alleviate this pressure ameren missouria utility serving about 12m electricity customers across 64 counties in central and eastern missouriis launching a new demand response dr program that will provide incentives for large customers to reduce consumption from the grid during these periods to get some background on the program and details for the utilitys large customers we spoke with andy lescynski enel x north america program manager who will oversee the implementation and success of the program q can you describe your background in demand response ive worked as an associate program manager on the energy markets team at enel x north america for two years i primarily help vertically integrated utilities manage their demand during their most congested or expensive times this is typically achieved by providing energy reductions from their commercial and industrial ci customers and in turn provides relief to the grid q so what does this program require from ameren missouris customers what do they need to do to receive payments essentially ameren missouris large ci customers need to reduce their demand from the grid for a brief period when the utility needs it the most enel x north america works directly with these customers to find ways to make their electric load more flexible this could mean rescheduling equipment maintenance that requires downtime at industrial and manufacturing facilities or identifying nonessential equipment that can be shut down temporarily without disrupting operations in commercial buildings or cold storage facilities these events occur only a few times a year and we find that customers can make these changes with little impact to production at scale these measures add up and provide significant relief to the grid q what motivated ameren missouri to launch a demand response program the state of missouri passed legislation in 2009 aimed at improving energy efficiency by creating incentives for energy consumers specifically dr provides an alternative to ramping supply when demand spikes and potentially building more power plants just to serve demand during a small number of brief periods throughout the year and its important to remember that an increase in costs to deliver power is ultimately passed onto customers so dr has an impact on energy consumers beyond the payments for its participants what were seeing in missouri is similar to what were seeing in the electricity industry at largean emphasis on improving how electricity is delivered across the grid dr is not the only program to accomplish that goal but it is playing an important role q who is eligible to participate all ameren missouri businessclass customers are eligible to participate typically we see that dr is an attractive option for ci customers with peak demands above 1 mw in the summer months q how does the program work during these events the enel x north america team will evaluate potential participants and develop custom energy reduction plans to maximize their earnings we also take on the responsibility of enrolling qualified customers into the program and protect all of our customers from penalties for underperformance when ameren missouris realtime operations team forecasts demand within 1 of the entire system peak they will call on enel x to dispatch our network of customers to provide system relief by curtailing energy usage for a brief period our network operations center ensures our customers are notified at least one hour before any event and that they are able to maximize their participation and earnings through the program while every market is different its important to point out that enel x has done this before we actually provide access to more demand response programs worldwide than any other provider including several similar utility programs across north america the dr program is an exciting opportunity both for ameren missouri and their ci customers and were excited to partner with them and help make this happen related stories explore other recent stories within this category energy market insights for june 2023 energy market insights
