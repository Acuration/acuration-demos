businesses can protect the grid earn revenue and enhance sustainability with demand response enel x successfully completed a threeyear emergency demand response dr program in partnership with the australian renewable energy agency arena and the australian energy market operator aemo the enel x demand response project ran under arenas advancing renewables program from december 2017 to 2020 and was designed to trial how dr can help to stabilise the grid during extreme demand peaks enel xs virtual power plant vpp delivered 50mw of commercial and industrial ci flexible energy load as a reserve resource to support the grid with 30mw in victoria and another 20mw in new south wales the vpp is virtual because it combines the loads of customers who power down which has the same effect on the grid as turning new power generation online participating ci energy users were on standby to safely reduce their electricity consumption during dispatch events called by aemo cold storage and logistics facilities water utilities agriculture and food processing facilities industrial gas and manufacturing sites tertiary education and retail locations were called to respond when there was extreme weather over the past three summers carl hutchinson  head of operations at enel x asia pacific said  we are extremely pleased with the results of the trial which further demonstrated that dr can play an crucial role in maintaining a stable electricity grid our vpp provides a critical resource for times when the grid is under immense stress including the peak of summer when electricity demand outweighs supply when called on by aemo our vpp reduced the possibility and impact of power outages over the past three years proving dr is an effective demand management technology in providing much needed emergency reserves   through the program we invested in our customers dr capability who over the trial period received 45 million in availability and event payments we installed our own metering technology onsite allowing us to monitor customer loads and potential dr performance to ensure they could respond when needed either automatically or manually we are proud that our vpp exceeded its performance targets across 12 dispatch events during the trial  enel xs vpp offers multiple dr programs to support the grid as well as battery storage projects with unmatched market
