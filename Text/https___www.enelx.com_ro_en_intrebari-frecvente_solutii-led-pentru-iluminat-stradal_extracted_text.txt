efficient energy efficiency of led street lights leds are energy efficient because they emit very little heat  so they require far less power to emit the same amount of light as their conventional equivalents in comparison incandescent bulbs release 90 of their energy as heat and fluorescent lights release about 80 of their energy as heat led lights are 40 to 60 more energy efficient than traditional lighting technologies fewer emissions one of the main advantages of led street lights is the lower energy consumption  led street lights generate fewer emissions than their conventional equivalents in the us alone replacing outdoor lighting with led lighting can reduce carbon emissions by the equivalent of taking 85 million cars off the road for a year according to the world bank longer lifespan another benefit of led street lights is the longer lifespan  led lighting products last longer than conventional lights for example led bulbs can last three to five times longer than fluorescent lights and 30 times longer than incandescent ones  high color rendering the high color rendering of led street lights is close to natural light and presents colors more realistically this helps drivers and pedestrians better identify objects at night improving traffic safety and road conditions  quick start incandescent lamps take about 01 to 02 seconds to light up  gas discharge lamps such as highpressure sodium lamps and metal halide lamps take anywhere from tens of seconds to 10 minutes to reach a stable light output after being turned off they take 36 minutes to cool down before restarting in contrast led lights only take tens of nanoseconds to start up  there is no waiting time to restart and they can work normally in a continuous onoff state enel x is accelerating the
