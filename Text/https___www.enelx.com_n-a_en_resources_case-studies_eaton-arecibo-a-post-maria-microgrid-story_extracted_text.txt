location arecibo puerto rico solution 5 mw solar pv array  11 mw battery storage microgrid capacity 13 mw of available load including sites existing 8 mw backup generation sustainability 4500 mt annual ghg emissions reduction the challenge resilient energy for a puerto rico facility in 2017 hurricane maria devastated puerto rico causing 90 billion in damage and leaving much of the island without power among the affected was eaton a global power management solutions and services provider with 1500 employees across four manufacturing facilities on the island while eaton was fortunate that the facilitiesmainly manufacturing low and mediumvoltage circuit protection componentsexperienced only modest damage the experience prompted a deeper look into how to bolster their critical operations in puerto rico and similar severe weatherimpacted locations in the years since eaton has refocused on investing in business continuity and reducing demand on local energy infrastructure all while committing to reduce carbon emissions from its operations by at least 50 percent by 2030 the solution solar  storage microgrid with enel x and eaton eaton and enel x partnered to develop and finance a solar  storage microgrid at eatons arecibo manufacturing site by leveraging their respective intelligent power management capabilities eaton as a global power management solutions and services provider will design and build the project as well as contribute electrical equipment including its intelligent microgrid controller enel x as a leader in decarbonization solutions will leverage its market expertise to unlock additional revenue streams for the energy assets and provide project financing without any upfront capital together they will step up to the challenge of delivering resilient clean energy on the island grid  a postcard from the future for islands and other centralized grid systems transitioning toward more distributed resources isaac mazerothstein wood mackenzie analyst commenting on the microgrid project in greentech media the benefits large resilient microgrid the microgrid which includes enel x distributed energy resources optimization software deros and eatons power xpert microgrid controller will be one of the largest microgrids on the island providing 13 mw of available power the microgrid will ensure the power stays on for the manufacturers strategic island site even during periods of local grid instability or damaging hurricanes turnkey solution and nocapex financing the microgridfinanced owned and managed by enel xincorporates a turnkey energy storage and solar photovoltaic system that will interconnect to the sites electrical infrastructure the system supplements eatons existing 8 mw of backup generation and is designed to withstand category 5 hurricanes reduced greenhouse gas emissions using its 5 mw solar array and 11 mw battery storage the project is projected to reduce 4500 mt of ghg emissions annually and provide renewable energy for over half of the sites annual consumption helping the community with the microgrid eaton will be positioned to provide excess power back to the grid which benefits the local community and reduces demand on the islands electric utility in the future eaton and enel x will seek opportunities to expand their clean microgrid solution across the island helping puerto rico rebuild its electric grid on the bedrock of renewable and resilient energy already they have teamed up to jointly develop a second microgrid at eatons las piedras manufacturing
