taiwans ministry of transportation and communications as of october 2021 for every 100 citizens there are 963 scooters most of taiwans scooters are powered by gasoline and air pollution is the price that the citizens bear taiwans president tsai ingwen has stressed on multiple occasions that taiwan is determined to join the world in working toward the goal of netzero emissions by 2050 as one step towards netzero the government has encouraged people to purchase electric scooters escooters the national development council reports that today there are around 520000 escooters in taiwan with

interview with gogoros founder and ceo horace luke  he stated that gogoro is a platform company  integrating electric scooters charging infrastructure and technology enel x is also a platform company that brings together distributed power resources with its virtual power plant vpp platform to support the local power grid and create new value for energy users gogoros battery swapping stations gostations are one of the power resources that can be aggregated into enel xs vpp to participate in taiwans energy trading platform established by taiwan power company through this collaboration the two companies are supporting the integration of more renewable power onto taiwans grid how does a virtual power plant work heres how it works when taiwan power company recognizes and upcoming supply demand imbalance it sends a dispatch notification to the energy trading market enel x then activates its vpp to respond to the grid need including gogoros gostations gogoro responds by temporarily powering down or exporting energy from its gostations during the designated period this power capacity is used to keep the grid stable and to keep the lights on when the grid need has passed enel x notifies gogoro and the gostations energy consumption restores to regular usage by being flexible with when grid power is used the battery swapping stations help to protect the grid and maintain stable electricity supply for everyone vpp participation is a key part of the energy transition because it supports the grid to balance more renewable power sources with existing assets rather than building new expensive and emissions intensive power plants currently in taiwan gogoro has more than 2100 gostations using nearly 13 gwh of power if the entire gostation network was called on it could power the city of taipei for 45 minutes welcoming taiwans clean energy future v2g technology is proven to be feasible and with the right platforms our cities can be smarter and greener gogoro is leading the way as the first electric mobility company to join enel xs vpp in taiwan demonstrating how mobility companies can join the energy transition and become part of taiwans clean energy future in an electrified and decarbonized world  with the right kind of technology allowing innovative use of energy  we will see a better environment for all living creatures with less air pollution and much cleaner more sustainable cities and communities this article is originally published in common wealth magazines ecct lci x sdgs coloumn how vehicletogrid v2g could accelerate taiwans
