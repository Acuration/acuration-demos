a success curtailment  the act of reducing electricity consumption energy reduction plan  a facilitys predetermined strategy for reducing electricity consumption during a demand response dispatch sample energy reduction measures for a commercial property facility may include dimming lights adjusting hvac set points etc for an industrial facility  measures may include temporarily halting production or cycling off certain energyintensive pieces of equipment some facilities like hospitals or data centers can also curtail by relying on a backup generator for a short period of time in certain regions only baseline currently according to taiwan power companys calculation the baseline is the average energy consumption in the five minutes before the dispatch notification nominated amount the predetermined amount of energy a facility is expected to reduce during a dispatch from its baseline ie the reduction target nominated amounts are estimated by past dispatch performance or in the case of new program participants an energy reduction test test or audit a dispatch scheduled in some markets held in order to establish nomination amounts for participating facilities they are usually called in the absence of an emergency dispatch performance during tests and audits is taken as reference to future demand response payment estimationss demand response dispatch  the period of time in which a grid operator or utility in taiwan it is the taiwan power company calls upon its participants to reduce electricity consumption dispatch notifications the notifications sent to program participants via phoneemailsms alerting them to the details of an upcoming demand response dispatch dispatch performance  the amount of energy reduction as measured by the baseline compared to the nominated amount see above performance dashboard  the realtime view of your overall performance during a demand response dispatch as seen in enel xs software application the performance dashboard provides realtime energy reduction information and performance capacity payment  the payment received in exchange for being on call to reduce energy when needed capacity payment rates vary from program to program energy payment the payment received in exchange for the actual amount of energy reduced during a dispatch energy payments are only available in certain programs demand response
