york independent system operator nyiso released system forecast information for the upcoming summer 2021 season the information includes finalized peak load forecasts transmission security limit tsl and locational minimum installed capacity lcr numbers these new numbers reflect a significant decrease from 2020 levels for the new york city nyc zone the peak load forecast for nyc decreased around 2 the tsl 16 and the lcr decreased 63 while a variety of factors can influence nyisos forecasts  including changes to the overall economy energy efficiency efforts etc  one notable cause influencing this latest forecast comes from nycs demographic shifts from the covid19 pandemic 2020 2021 peak load 11477 gws 11199 gws transmission security limit 802 787 locational minimum installed capacity 866 803 in combination these new market fundamentals point toward a likely decrease in capacity pricing for the nyc zone this upcoming summer season  which impacts demand response customers participating in the scr program the basics of nyiso auctions the nyiso procures its capacity in three types of auctions the strip auction taking place this upcoming march 29 th  occurs once a season and secures capacity for the entirety of the season the monthly and spot auctions happen on a monthly basis and are subject to shortterm supply and demand changes each of these three auctions clear at independent price points enel xs auction strategy enel x has a proprietary blended auction strategy achieved through active portfolio management and realtime capacity allocation across all three auctions month by month because this approach to auction participation allows for greater flexibility enel x can take advantage of any midseason price increases that may materialize potential covid impacts as mentioned earlier the likely culprit of the lower capacity needs for nyc is the effect of covid restrictions and behavioral changes as nyc became one of the worsthit cities going into summer 2020 electricity demand patterns shifted significantly and by april of 2020 demand was already 16 lower than initially predicted by the nyiso it is possible that once covid restrictions are lifted  perhaps in the upcoming months  nyc loads and capacity pricing could return to previous levels enel x is wellpositioned to capture any potential price increase due to our blended auction strategy  in the interim with prices lower demand response participants located in nyc could see a reduction in earnings for the 2021 summer season enel x will continue to evaluate the situation as more information becomes available and actively manage our auction strategy to deliver the highest possible pricing to our customers contact enel x if you would like to discuss your energy strategy or learn more about how you
