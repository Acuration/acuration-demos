progressive purchasing contracts including misconceptions around risk budgeting and workload what is progressive purchasing progressive purchasing lets you purchase blocks of electricity at different times rather than purchasing all your electricity needs at once at a single price this flexible purchasing approach means you can lock in future pricing at a time that suits you or when market conditions are right these lockins can also be tailored depending on need for example it might work best for your business to purchase individual quarters in the future or a proportion of an annual load  like 50 of calendar 2022 load  today despite a significant increase in businesses adopting flexible purchasing contracts over the last few years many are still unaware of the benefits and let perceived myths sway decisions while this is a move away from traditional purchasing many of the misconceptions are either nonexistent or easy to overcome to set the record straight weve dispelled four commonly held myths about progressive purchasing myth its too risky as soon as we start talking about locking in pricing in small chunks people tend to get nervous the most common comment we get is oh but that sounds too risky yet this is what you do every time you sign a fixed price contract for the term remember under the traditional fixed price model youre securing a price on any given day for a future term regardless of market movements in the future theres absolutely no more risk in splitting these purchases into bitesized chunks  in fact risk management principles will tell you that diversifying your decision making is a much more effective method of managing risk of course as with any sophisticated product it needs to be managed but as long as you have robust risk management processes in place you can enjoy budget certainty while also taking advantage of future market movements myth im not big or sophisticated enough to do it once only available for the big players progressive purchasing is now being adopted by businesses of all shapes and sizes customers with usage as low as 10 gwh per year are now on these sort of agreements and are getting good results myth you cant have budget certainty as long as you have robust management of the product in place budget certainty is all but guaranteed heres why you can set up a maximum spend for the year plus manage your lockin activity to make sure this isnt exceeded and you can also work your budget cycle timing into your overall purchasing plan for example if you budget for the subsequent calendar year in august you only need to make sure your lockins for that financial year are completed by the end of that month this means that when its time to do your budget that following calendar years rates are secured and you can budget as you would do with a traditional fixed price contract purchasing progressively actually allows you to have a constant rolling budget up to three years in advance which is made up of pricing youve locked away combined with the current futures market pricing for periods you havent yet locked away so if youve chosen a fixed price model for budget certainty you may want to reassess especially if your current contract is expiring in the next 612 months this is because therell be at least a portion of your next financial year that youve either estimated or havent quite locked down the budget for yet myth its too much work to set up this is an easy myth to debunk first youll either have an inhouse expert or third party managing the contract daytoday for you secondly its relatively quick to set up with a significant portion of the work done upfront this involves setting out your business risk tolerances and buying plan and triggers after that the only time needed is to authorise transactions lock ins and even this can be delegated many of the management services are it based systems which take in huge amounts of market data each day and youll only ever hear from someone when theres a need to transact once everything is set up and running our clients typically spend a couple of hours per month managing the contract which is a small amount of time for a large cost item with increasing volatility in the electricity market its never been a better time to invest in a more innovative way of purchasing electricity to learn more get in touch with one of
