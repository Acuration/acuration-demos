the economic value of an energy storage system deros enables users to monitor communicate with and control their energy network the system interfaces with battery energy storage and other distributed energy resources to monitor energy usage and production in real time it is comprised of two components one cloudbased and one sitebased that interface with other software systems and hardware devices in a holistic energy management ecosphere enel xs deros user interface displays customer savings by recreating bills before and after solarplusstorage deros provides customers and solar partners with value stacking operations enablement and flexible hardware integration value stacking deros determines the optimal battery dispatch strategy using sophisticated machine learning forecasts while factoring in various revenue streams tariffs and incentives bill savings  tariff management solar selfconsumption grid revenue generation incentive capture operations enablement through detailed databased monitoring of assets the deros platform contains comprehensive customerfacing financial reporting and realtime alerting of operational issues financial reporting asset management monitoring alerting hardware platform enel x provides both the battery energy storage system bess hardware and the enel x site controller the evolving approved vendor list avl includes industryleading bess models revenue grade metering multiple pv inverter models and flexible communications network compatibility ess hardware and site controller metering pv inverter compatibility network requirements value stacking bill savingstariff management deros operates continuously to minimize the overall system cost and maximize the systems economic value the software accomplishes this objective using highly accurate machinelearning forecasting algorithms that incorporate both recent historical demand data and weather forecast inputs to predict the future building load and solar generation with this data deros can create an optimal bess discharge and charge strategy the software primarily aims to decrease demand charges and capitalize on energy arbitrage opportunities while also accounting for solar selfconsumption battery degradation and other operational constraints grid revenue generation deros enables storage systems to capture revenue from many different grid services programs such as demand response operating reserves and other market opportunities deros typically operates using fully automated dispatches but can also be controlled through manual dispatches if necessary enel xs experienced operations team monitors battery performance 247 in its network operations center noc in the event that a manual dispatch is required when dispatched deros cooptimizes grid service opportunities with the other value streams such as bill savings and incentive compliance federal incentives projects that receive federal incentives such as the investment tax credit itc are required to be charged 100 from solar generation to receive the maximum possible itc inventive deros can be configured to charge 100 from solar and has redundant systems to ensure compliance through load weather and solar forecasts as shown below deros continuously optimizes the control of the ders to maximize delivery of the itc incentive state incentives deros also has the ability to layer state incentive programs into the value stack where applicable for example deros ensures that systems in massachusetts enrolled in the solar massachusetts renewable target smart program or systems in california enrolled in the self generation incentive program sgip properly comply with yearly cycling requirements in addition deros is flexibly designed to ensure any incremental program benefits and requirements will be captured such as the sgip greenhouse gas ghg emission reduction and performancebased incentive deros dispatch management tool deros forecasting and itc compliance operations enablement financial reporting deros uses tariff information and 5minute interval data collected from site bess and pv meters to calculate the bill savings in a before and after bill comparison including showing any savings realized by having a lower energy charge via a cheaper solar power purchase agreement ppa deros disaggregates the savings by source including rate switch savings solar savings and storage savings additional customized reports can be discussed with enel xs asset management team to meet customer needs alerting deros has an evolving list of alerting capabilities to notify the enel x operations teams of issues example alerts include any abnormal changes in savings bess malfunction alarms data gaps and solar itc violations enel x network operations center is remotely capable of diagnosing and troubleshooting any warnings and alarms and if necessary can send a technician to the site monitoring  asset management deros includes a suite of tools that enel xs operations teams use internally to efficiently monitor and manage the system including detailed tariff and configuration management interfaces and data visualization of load data the system is also capable of performing basic solar monitoring and reporting of photovoltaic pv meter data deros collects this meter data for control optimization and performance reporting and is available for visualization on the deros user interface ui the required deros metering is typically installed in addition to a dedicated pv monitoring system for example where additional monitoring is required for tax equity purposes or for investor reporting data accessibility data collected by the enel x site controller are stored locally for control and redundancy as well as sent to the cloud for continued accessibility and lifetime data storage deros stores 5 minute data for all configured parameters for each device stored data points can be exported to csv files for use outside of the deros platform

properly a revenue grade meter must be installed to monitor the power flow of each energy asset as a result all deros solarplus storage projects require an enel x approved meter on both the pv and bess systems enel x has a current approved vendor list avl and continues to work with partners on expanding this list pv inverter compatibility deros must be used with compatible devices when communication or control of the devices is required for a solarplusstorage project deros requires the site meter bess and pv meter to be sourced from the enel x avl in addition if pv curtailment is required then the pv inverter also must be from the enel x avl network requirements deros requires an internet connection to connect the site devices to the deros cloud internet communication requirements are flexible to meet project needs including options for enel x supplied internet or customer supplied internet the standard option is for enel x to supply an internet modem if a customer prefers to supply their own internet enel xs project engineers can work with the customer to create a custom solution interconnection approach interconnection requirements vary by project and by region the enel x field engineering team has extensive experience in interconnection and can recommend the most effective approach to achieving interconnection success enel x will review partners bess interconnection applications and provide feed back for the most efficient and effective process ongoing om enel x operations and maintenance services include 247 monitoring from the network operations center noc deros saas optimization software network support and operations services communication services warranty services and preventative and corrective maintenance plans in accordance with original equipment manufacturer oem requirements enel x consistently syncs operational data locally and through the cloud platform so that customers can view realtime operational data in the web based deros platform various om reports and communications are available to customers tracking uptime performance and maintenance activity sites with existing nonenel x owned solar on site enel x supports a wide variety of configurations including compatibility with existing solar and other assets fuel cells generators etc metering andor direct connection to the solar controls will allow the deros system to monitor and if needed control or curtail solar operation the ease of integration depends on whether the existing systems components are currently included in enel xs avl or compatible with other relevant specifications even in cases where the itc does not pose a constraint on system operations enel x prefers to monitor the sites existing solar production so that deros can better optimize system performance and take into account the solar impact on site load in addition visibility into the pv performance improves the ability of deros to accurately forecast site load which is a critical
