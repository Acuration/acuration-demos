watch video algoma orchards a familyowned commercial orchard in the durham region of ontario is dedicated to serving its community with quality produce and products with a stateoftheart apple cider facility processing thousands of gallons of cider and juice and an applepacking center shipping products to grocery stores and its own retail locations across canada the company needs to ensure that any effort to reduce energy costs does not disrupt production or compromise the quality of its products the challenge businesses in ontario face some of the highest electricity costs in north america thanks largely to the global adjustment ga charge which energy providers pass onto customers electricity bills to cover their costs of generating capacity and conservation programs ga charges have risen in recent years and are now the largest item on most ontario customers electricity billsup to 70 for some in 2017 ontarios independent electricity system operator ieso expanded eligibility for the industrial conservation initiative ici a program through which customers pay monthly ga charges based on their facilitys demand at the five intervals throughout the year when grid demand is at its highest as a result of the expansion all customers with an average peak demand of 1 mw or higheras well as those in select industries whose average peak demand is 500 kw or higherare eligible to opt into the ici for algoma orchards participating in the ici created an opportunity to reduce annual electricity costs significantly if they could predict when the grid is at peak demand and reduce their demand at the right time they could reduce their ga charges significantly for the entire following year since 2010 algoma orchards has partnered with enel x to earn payments through demand response dr programswhich provide financial incentives to large energy users that voluntarily reduce their demand when called upon by grid operators as a result the company is keenly aware of both the financial opportunity of strategic demand management and the positive impact it can have on grid reliability while algoma orchards receives payments for its participation the company has long seen dr as a way to help support the local economy and environment by reducing demand at the times when the grid needs it the most the company helps to support the grids reliability and reduces its reliance on fossil fuels expanding its demandside management practices to address ga charges would enable algoma orchards to have a greater impact on the community while also significantly reducing its annual energy costs however any effort to accomplish this would need to prevent disruption to production in its facilities or the quality of the companys products the solution predicting system peak events the first step to reducing ga charges is predicting when the ieso is most likely to experience peak demand to accomplish this algoma orchards participates in enel xs system peak predictor program which uses a complex predictive model to assess the daily likelihood of a system peak event on the grid based on an analysis of weather information and market data through the program which currently provides insight to more than 1100 sites located in different markets across north america enel x develops a custom demand reduction plan for each customer and delivers daily notifications of the likelihood of a system peak event in their region on the occasions when the likelihood is high customers enact their load curtailment plan to reduce their ga charges enel x customers in ontario saved a combined 15m on ga charges alone last year through enel xs system peak predictor program leveraging energy storage to reduce demand maintain facility uptime to maximize the potential savings through this program enel x worked with algoma orchards to select finance and install an energy storage system that could further reduce the companys grid demand while still powering key equipment in its facilities the system consists of 520 kw1040 kwh of capacity in tesla lithiumion batteries and is equipped with enel xs der optimization software the software analyzes all relevant energy information for the facility and the energy storage systemincluding operational schedules tariffs demand response programs incentives ga and other demand charges and battery lifeand automatically shifts the buildings load on and off the grid to deliver the most value possible for algoma orchards the system automatically charges the battery system when electricity prices are the lowest on the market and then seamlessly transitions the buildings load onto the battery system when system peak events are most likelyas well as when the sites are called upon to curtail load as part of dr programs additionally the agreement with enel x enabled algoma orchards to install the energy storage system with no upfront costs and without taking on any risk in the investment the future going forward the solution will enable algoma orchards to reduce ga costs and other demand charges significantly while also earning dr payments without shutting down key equipment in its facilities in addition to the financial impact this approach equips algoma orchards to take a stronger role in supporting its community if demand on the grid outpaces supplywhich could create the risk of a blackout or other interruption to power supply in the provincethe iesos only options are to ramp up production from power generators that rely on fossil fuels or turn to its large energy users to curtail their load from the grid by reducing its reliance on the grid when demand is at its highest algoma orchards simultaneously contributes to efforts to maintain grid reliability in its community and helps the ieso reduce its reliance on emissionsheavy infrastructureall without impacting product quality or production at its sites related resources explore other resources within this category eaton arecibo a
