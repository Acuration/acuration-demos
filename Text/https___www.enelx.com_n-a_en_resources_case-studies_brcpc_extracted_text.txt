cooperative purchasing committee brcpc serves as a centralized purchasing group for more than 21 regional public schools community colleges county agencies cities and towns and other organizations its a standing committee of the baltimore metropolitan council an organization comprised of elected executives from the central maryland region since 2000 brcpc has helped local governmental agencies address one of the biggest drivers for total energy spend how you buy it together brcpc enables businesses to combine their purchasing power and procure more advantageous contracts for electricity in 2005 brcpc began to explore new ways to reduce its energy costs by adopting innovative purchasing options enel x helped brcpc combine its purchasing power and buy electricity directly from the wholesale market rather than via traditional retail markets this program saves brcpc membersand their communitiesmore than 11 million annually combining purchasing power to achieve new cost savings managing and reducing energy costs are a critical responsibility of state governments and agencies volatile prices make procuring energy at the lowest cost even more challenging navigating the different market rules and getting retail providers to compete against each other is timeintensive and confusing and rising energy costs can decimate budgets creating shortfalls that delay other critical projects and programs such as capital improvements or tax relief many state and municipal agencies focus on energy efficiency which provides a visible impact and incremental savings as well as associated environmental benefits but more agencies like brcpc are also taking a careful look at how they purchase energy and are looking for innovative energy supply management strategies that take advantage of competitive energy markets brcpc is dedicated to getting the best price possible for energy saving money and serving taxpayers the more we learned about the energy markets the more we understood the potential cost savings we could achieve by doing things differently says stephen myer chair of the brcpc energy subcommittee however when brcpc began to explore its options it found a strong need for outside experience and insights into the often mystifying rules that govern the electric markets we couldnt do much better in terms of pricing and suspected that wed be better off buying from the wholesale market recalls myer but we needed expertise to come up with a strategy enel x helped brcpc develop a formal energy supply management strategy that took advantage of competitive marketsand that moved the agency away from the higher rates of the retail electricity markets as part of this new risk management strategy participating agencies combine purchasing power creating a large significant energy buyer that qualifies for wholesale purchases brcpc buys electricity directly from the wholesale market via a competitively selected retail suppler pepco energy services for a fee pepco serves as brcpcs licensed buyer in the wholesale electricity markets enel x worked closely with brcpc to create a new way of purchasing energyhelping it consolidate its purchasing power and purchase directly from the wholesale markets enel x created and developed an innovative wholesale portfolio program that identified and defined roles and responsibilities enel x also helped brcpc interview and evaluate suppliers and negotiate its final contract with pepco enel x serves as a longterm partner to brcpc implementing brcpcs approved risk management strategy and providing ongoing insights and ideas that help the agency save money and manage energy more efficiently during implementation enel x installed monitoring equipment and enabled its energy intelligence software eis at each facility during dr dispatches enel xs energy intelligence software gives versacold facilities personnel the ability to track their energy reductions in real time they can go to the application look at their baseline and current use and determine whether they need to make any other adjustments says royals each facility retains control of how it achieves its energy reductions a key element of the success of the program the results throughout the process brcpc remained committed to learning about everchanging energy markets and to making changes in the way it purchased energy enel x provided the knowledge expertise and experience necessary to create a winning strategy this partnership generated impressive resultssignificant annual savings of more than 11 million enel x helped brcpc achieve these impressive savings by unbundling electric supply thereby reducing supplier margins and supplier risk premiums associated with traditional retailbased fixedrate contracts by purchasing blocks of power from the wholesale markets brcpc can achieve better yeartoyear price stability by dollarcost averaging its purchases over time rather than purchasing at one point obtain lower block pricing by getting bids from multiple wholesale providers purchase blocks at different delivery points reducing congestion premiums and managing congestion risk purchase blocks below full requirements avoiding risk premiums by assuming the volumetric risk which retail suppliers pass along to cover potential price differences on quantities above or below contracted amounts enel x has enabled savings of 75 to 9 percent over a traditional retail approach these savings are passed directly on to brcpcs many agenciesfrom county governments to public schools to museums the benefits energy savings savings of 11 million each year is the primary benefit enel xs energy supply management services bring to brcpcalong with a range of other powerful benefits a

the group on how and when to buy blocks of power it also provides clear communications about energy costs and issues to all brcpc agencies eliminating retail middlemen the new enel x energy supply management strategy enables brcpc to purchase electricity right off the grid reducing energy costs and simplifying energy procurement the unbundled wholesale portfolio devised by enel x is significantly more costeffective than a fully bundled retail approach better management and control brcpc has significantly reduced exposure to the inherent ups and downs of the retail electricity market with the enel x strategy it connects directly to more cost effective wholesale markets and in a way that offers the agency more control over its costs and risk it gains a professionally managed portfolio of energyone that benefits from enel xs experience and expertise a new role for the energy buyer with enel xs energy supply management strategy brcpc redefined the role played by its energy buyer pepco energy services pepco buys energy and earns a fee for this service but it doesnt have the broader responsibilities that a more traditional approach would entail this reduced role for pepco results in cost savings for brcpc an award winning approach in 2006 the national institute of governmental purchasing nigp awarded its innovations in public procurement award to brcpc this award
