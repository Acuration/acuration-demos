weather events and resource variability demand response dr programs play a key role in enabling a more flexible and sustainable energy grid discover how dr helps the grid remain in balance during times of grid stress to ensure continuity of energy supply key takeaways resiliency and flexibility are more important than ever for our energy grid infrastructure infrastructure is aging and facing a variety of challenges  from an increase in extreme weather events to integrating new technologies including renewables into the grid this situation has made demand response and future investment in distributed energy resources ders and flexible resources like demand response essential to ensuring grid reliability as we saw events across multiple days in california in september how demand response provides stability the grid must always remain in balance  meaning that energy supply must match energy demand  to avoid grid disruptions however ensuring grid reliability is becoming more difficult and complex the grid is coping with an increase in extreme weather events from hurricanes to extreme heat and beyond and ensuring continuity of energy supply is essential in addition our increasingly decentralized energy grid is integrating and accommodating an increase of energy sources like wind and solar into the energy mix in turn this increases pressure on aging power networks to ensure the grid remains in balance demand response dr is a valuable resource in facing these challenges dr was created to help balance supply and demand on the grid it allows participating commercial and industrial organizations to earn revenue by reducing their energy usage during periods of grid stress in addition these participants gain insight into optimizing their energy usage throughout the year september case study demand response in california this summer brought several examples of dr aiding a grid by providing relief one notable recent instance was during the extreme heat waves that battered the california grid in early september throughout the week of september 5 2022 the state of california saw sustained temperatures above 100f and even as high as 110f due to this heat demand on the grid skyrocketed eventually surpassing 52 gw a new record demand for the california independent system operator caiso the previous record of 50 gw was set in 2006 if demand outpaces supply  which is often a threat during extreme heatwaves like these  that can lead to brownouts or even blackouts throughout the region to help balance the grid caiso dispatched dr providers like enel and our 100 mw portfolio across pge sce and sdge to help mitigate any potential grid emergencies dr events occurred over 4 days and our customers were dispatched for over 63 hours about 2 and a half days the strong dr performance of our customers led to relief and stability for the grid we want to thank our customers for their crucial contributions  their efforts helped allow power to continue flowing to their communities its also worth noting the decarbonization benefits of dr as well in this instance removing 100 mw load from the grid is equivalent to the electricity consumption of 50000 average homes dr not only helps keep power flowing  it helps to support the decarbonization goals of our customers and communities reach out to our team of experts to learn more about earning revenue by participating in dr programs that support a more sustainable grid and discover how much you can earn with our dr calculator  related stories explore other recent stories within this category energy
