2020 award for mission critical tech innovation for its work with digital realty a leading global provider of data center colocation and interconnection solutions in deploying a virtual power solution that provides flexible capacity to the australian power grid to address peaks in electricity demand the award honors enel xs vpp program as an innovation making the most positive difference to data center design operations and management practices digital realty has enrolled two of its australian sites in enel xs vpp allowing the company to innovate how it consumes energy to support the australian electricity grids security and reliability the initiative supports digital realtys continued focus on driving operational efficiency and bringing innovative solutions to market on platformdigital a purposebuilt data center platform that enables the everchanging data control and networking demands of global enterprises as part of the initiative digital realtys sites can be made available to reduce load on the grid at peak times by switching over to ups and backup power generation the sites reduce the strain on the power grid at peak times which aids grid resilience as an early participant in enel xs vpp program digital realty benefits from more efficient use of equipment robust testing practices and new revenue that reduces the total cost of ownership jeff renaud  head of asia and oceania at enel x said  we are delighted to have won this award for mission critical tech innovation being on call to use less energy from the grid at critical times is fundamental to enabling more power generation from intermittent renewables like solar and wind which reduce carbon emissions and the cost of energy for all consumers participation also helps to prevent larger power outages and reduces the need to build more carbonemitting power plants we are thankful to digital realty and their supportive customers for leading the way in this space  jon curry  vice president of operations asia pacific at digital realty said  we are thrilled to be recognised alongside enel x for our innovation in australia by participating in enel xs vpp we have improved our mission critical infrastructure to ensure the highest standard of preparation in case of a power grid failure vpp participation gives a true test of mission critical equipment including ups and backup generation assets with the safety net of grid power to switch back to if required our team is also skilled and ready to respond to a grid emergency if needed by altering our grid power use we also directly help australias grid to be more reliable efficient and sustainable both now and into the future  enel x works with digital realty and many other commercial and industrial businesses to deliver the aggregated virtual capacity from all participants to the grid digital realty did not require capital expenditure investment in additional equipment to participate in the vpp but uses existing assets and receives availability payments for being on call which provides a forecastable revenue stream data centers more broadly are well suited to vpp participation because they use a large volume of electricity that is relatively consistent providing a predictable amount of load to support the grid when needed they can transfer to their reliable backup power sources quickly and completely in case of a grid outage data centers of any size at any location whether colocation or fully owned can participate regardless of onsite technology employed or energy provider in addition no new risks are introduced to the site as a result of participation as existing load transfer methods are used in all cases media release demand response speak with an expert today to learn how enel x can help you
