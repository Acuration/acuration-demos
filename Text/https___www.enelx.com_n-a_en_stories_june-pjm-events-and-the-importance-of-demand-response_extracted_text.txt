events august 10 2022 key takeaways on june 14 15 and 16 pjm declared a series of emergency actions and called demand response events for approximately 20 hours demand response events have been growing in recent years and this event was notable because of the rarity of demand response events in pjm demand response events have increased in recent years and demand response participants can earn revenue while helping the stability of their local grid  contact us to find out more demand response has long been a critical part of helping grid operators ensure a stable grid and in recent years that importance has been growing last year we saw a significant increase in demand response events and with expectations for another busy summer ahead june saw a notable event  a rare demand response event in the pjm interconnection pjm is still investigating the event but its already clear important contributions from enel x customers and other participants helped to prevent a worse emergency in a hearing with the public utilities commission of ohio michael bryson senior vice president  operations for pjm said that without demand response i think its likely that we would have had to interrupt more customer load on pjm facilities the background on june 14 15 and 16 pjm the regional transmission organization for a variety of states in the midatlantic and midwest declared a series of emergency actions in the aepmarion subregion which is in and around columbus ohio temperatures in the columbus area reached 95 degrees on june 14 and 15 conditions that typically put stress on the grid the emergency began when thunderstorms knocked out multiple 136kv transmission lines near columbus and then high temperatures and the accompanying high loads from cooling demand caused issues with power flows ultimately pjm instructed aep to shed load through limited service interruptions to prevent other transmission lines overloading and causing a cascading issue how enel x customers helped through demand response enel x customers delivered during the event and provided significant curtailment on all three days in total the demand response events lasted approximately 20 hours  the longest emergency in pjm in years because the problem occurred in a partially suburban area few other resources were available to the localized grid making demand response especially crucial in this situation we applaud our customers for their effort  it made a real difference as bryson testified to the public utilities commission of ohio any response that we could get from demand response could offset either overloads or customer interruptions on almost a onetoone basis so it gave us a tool to at least help reduce the impact whats ahead this summer as were now in the hottest days of summer many more demand response events lie ahead many regions of the country are at high risk due of grid instability as the north american electric reliability corp pointed out in its 2022 summer reliability report  most notably miso has potential for significant reliability risks and accompanying demand response events while the report also placed nearly the entire western united states including california and texas at elevated risk demand response not only creates significant payments for participating organizations but it also helps make a serious contribution to the
