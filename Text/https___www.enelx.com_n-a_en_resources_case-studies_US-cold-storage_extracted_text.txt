cold storage facilities located throughout the continental united states as a large energy user us cold storage is a great candidate for demand response dr mike lynch vice president of engineering at united states cold storage first started working with enel x to enroll in demand response programs 15 years ago and the relationship has expanded to include more than 20 sites enrolled in 7 demand response programs nationwide id definitely recommend enel x lynch said i have a good relationship with my enel x team weve set a goal of generating 1 million dollars in demand response revenue and were knocking on the doorim hoping well hit it in the next year or two how dr works demand response programs provide payments to energy users that agree to reduce their energy demand during times of grid stress there are a wide variety of programs available across america with different requirementssome for instance require faster response times when energy users are asked to curtail energy use us cold storage participates in a number of different programs in regions across america why us cold storage quickly bought into dr when lynch first started enrolling us cold storage facilities in demand response 15 years ago he had a specific goal in mind our big motivator was the opportunity to turn engineeringwhich has always been a cost centerinto a profit center there were clear opportunities to earn revenue through participating in dr programs lynch remembers when he first discussed with facility managers that theyd be participating in demand response there was some hesitation at first but the managers were quickly won over selling demand response is easy because it helps a warehouses bottom line lynch said in the beginning it might have been a challenge because they didnt quite understand it and the benefitsbut when they saw the checks roll in they said how can i do more they wanted to find out how they could maximize those benefits how dr supports sustainability us cold storage is a sustainabilityfocused company with a current goal of reaching zerocarbon by 2050 their sustainability efforts inform every aspect of their business and lynch said that they consider demand response within their sustainability program we tie demand response into our sustainability strategy lynch said anything we can do to reduce on peak demand use has multiple benefitstheres a financial benefit but theres also an environmental benefit by reducing our load during high peak times our interest in dr is multifacetedit encompasses both our sustainability efforts and our energy efforts why its easy to respond to a dr event when an event occurs and us cold storage is asked to turn down their usage they focus primarily on reducing the connected load of refrigeration equipment which lynch notes is about 70 of their energy usage while continuously monitoring room temperatures because there are so many frozen products in the freezers there is large thermal inertiaa decrease in refrigeration for the length of an event has no significant effect on the temperature in the freezers for many of the us cold storage facilities that participate in demand response the process is as easy as clicking a button our control system during demand response scenarios is to just click a button and the system is programmed to respond a certain way warehouses can do things like defer defrosting or starting a compressor or can raise room temperature slightly the button has everything preprogrammed so its pretty easy for folks to respond quickly to a demand response signal that we get moving forward with dr after such a long relationship lynch noted that us cold storage is approaching its impressive 1 million earnings milestone and that hes appreciated the role enel x has played in getting there our relationship with enel x has been great lynch said enel x has always been very responsive to our questions theyve served the account well over the years
