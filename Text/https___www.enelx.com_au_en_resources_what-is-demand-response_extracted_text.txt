dsr or demand management is an energy flexibility program used globally as a costeffective way to maintain grid reliability and security this program extends its reach to a diverse spectrum of energy users including businesses government agencies and households participating in demand response means that energy users can actively contribute to grid stability and in return enjoy financial incentives  they achieve this by either reducing their electricity consumption or activating an onsite generator in response to a signal in simple terms demand side response empowers electricity customers to proactively and voluntarily adjust their electricity consumption patterns to gain financial benefits our virtual power plant vpp is the largest in australia bnef and is made up of organisations distributed energy resources onsite equipment backup generation and battery energy storage systems that reduce energy usage in response to conditions of electricity grid stress we manage the endtoend process for our clients and always ensure participation suits your operational needs program participants earn regular payments  enhance resilience and support the grid and local community by helping to keep the lights on demand response join our virtual power plant and support the energy transition learn more what are the four types of demand response speak with an expert today to learn how enel x can help you achieve your energy goals contact us there are 4 types of demand response programs in australia emergency response peaking response frequency control load shifting emergency response emergency response is used when there is not enough electricity supply to meet consumers needs this is usually called on if major generators break down during summer peaks when demand is unusually high or some combination of these factors energy users can reduce their demand for electricity in return for incentive payments to keep the grid stable and avoid power outages in new south wales the government has introduced new incentive schemessuch as the peak demand reduction schemedue to the critical risk of supply shortfalls in the coming years in western australia emergency response is incentivised through schemes that reward participants for being on standby for the australian energy market operator aemo to call upon when traditional generation is insufficient to keep the lights on in the remaining states of australia emergency response is largely provided through the reliability and emergency reserve trader rert aemo calls on electricity users to reduce grid power when demand outstrips supply enel x participates in each of these programs by offering our clients energy load during grid emergencies who are paid for their contribution peaking response peaking response involves energy users reducing demand or increasing generation based on the wholesale electricity price which fluctuates in response to supply and demand in todays volatile electricity market power prices can spike to 16600  mwh not only does this contribute to supporting grid reliability it also helps reduce power prices for all users which is a critical services in this time of rising electricity prices with enel x energy users are alerted to periods in which prices are high and there is a valuable opportunity to earn spot market revenue users then respond by curtailing their equipment or using their onsite generation assets in a preagreed manner frequency control protect the grids frequency with instantaneous response learn more peaking response earn revenue in todays volatile energy market whilst supporting reliability and lower power prices learn more ancillary services ancillary services demand response is used to keep the frequency of the electricity system stable energy users are paid to provide frequency control ancillary services fcas  by reducing demand to keep the grid operating within its usual frequency range of around 50 hertz enel x provides 30 of the total frequency reserves today we directly contributed to reducing australias fcas prices when we entered this market aemo 2018 our portfolio responds to an event by immediately dropping the majority of client consumption this brings the grid back into the normal frequency range by balancing demand against supply load shifting demand response loads with high levels of flexible demand can participate in regular load shifting demand response  this means increasing demand during times of low prices usually during the middle of the day and decreasing a corresponding amount of demand during times of high prices usually the evening peak period the value this provides is particularly important as the grid becomes more and more powered by solar with high levels of generation during the day and a steep drop in solar generation levels during the evening if you have an asset with high levels of flexible demand such as chillers that power refrigerated spaces or battery energy storage systems enel x can support your participation we can do this as your electricity retailer or through other mechanisms that allow you to provide demand response without impacting your retail arrangements what are the benefits of demand response maximise payments to your bottom line  enel x manages your participation from start to finish ensuring you earn the highest possible financial reward improve your facilities resilience  demand response participants receive advanced notification of grid stability issues  enabling them to proactively protect their facilities from potential power outages in addition if you enrol your backup generation assets in our vpp participation leads to more regular testing and helps to iron out any assumptions around reliability with the safety net of grid power to switch back to support your community  your participation helps maintain reliable electricity in your community and helps to keep the lights on allow for the integration of more renewables  a clean grid powered by wind and solar generation requires they kinds of support demand response can bring to balance out the periods when the sun is not shining or wind levels are low demand response calculator see how much revenue you can earn for reducing your energy consumption with demand response start simulation how to participate in demand
