this cannot cause any disruption to daytoday operations at the data center the three data centers that we have are very critical to our nationwide network the supervisor at the data center said if any one of the three were to go down it would cause significant network disruption across the country a simple process because of the importance of uptime it was crucial that an or directive not cause any disruption to the data center directives are the times when enel x instructs customers to lower their energy use and these only happen a handful of days each yearmost days the data center is paid simply for their willingness to turn down their energy but with enel x responding to directives is easy its a simple process it takes one person you basically just hit two buttons and we can go totally islanded from the grid within two minutes no disruption by using a closed circuit transfer switch the data center experiences no disruption in power theres no bump in service whatsoever its a very smooth transition same with going back onto the grid because of their importance the data center is manned 247 when they are notified of an event whoever is on duty at that time simply walks over to the generator and transfers all load onto their backup system businesses have ten minutes to respond to a directive but switching to backup generation simplifies the process how or helps them stay prepared the data center uses the generators often even outside of an or event this allows them to be sure the generators are working in case of an emergency enel x customers frequently tout this as a
