schools managed their demand response dr participation and energy purchasing strategy optimizing seasonal aggregation and peak demand management the first tenet of wcpss energy management program is to provide a quality environment for students to achieve their highest academic potential enel x worked with wcps to design demand response energy reduction strategies that would go mostly unnoticed by students and staff such as slight adjustments in hvac system settings and turning off nonessential lighting now that pjm has shifted to a yearround program a new component of the wcps energy strategy is managing peak demand charges in the summer months and enrolling more mw in demand response in the winter enel xs large portfolio of pjm customers makes that kind of seasonal variation
