services fcas markets what is frequency grid support keeping the electricity grids frequency stable is a complex balancing act for generators to safely run australias grid frequency needs to stay as close as possible to 50hz any deviation away from this can have catastrophic consequences like the statewide power outages in south australia in 2016 to help the national electricity market nem maintain system security and keep the grid balanced the australian energy market operator aemo runs ancillary services markets to procure energy reserves capable of rebalancing the system when it deviates from 50hz these are known as the frequency control ancillary services fcas markets or what we call frequency control when power plants or network lines unexpectedly fail fcas brings the grid back into the safe frequency range by balancing demand and supply which helps to prevent widespread blackouts and outages how businesses can participate in the frequency control market businesses who join our virtual power plant vpp have the opportunity to receive regular payments for being available to reduce power consumption when the grid is unbalanced frequency control is just one of our vpp programs alongside other demand response or flexibility programs  which has proven critical in helping balance the grid quickly and reliably when needed how it works we set up our customers so that they can respond when the grid is unbalanced they do this by curtailing energy use of noncritical equipment or seamlessly switching to their onsite backup generator our marketleading technology means our customers can respond to deviations in the grids frequency in less than one second the grid receives immediate support and the markets response helps to stop the fall in frequency bring it back up to the normal operating range and ensure the grid is stabilised moving forward our customers are financially rewarded for helping to keep the grid stable by participating in the fcas markets last year we helped a midsize cold storage site earn aud 50000 from providing frequency control services as part of our vpp our other demand response programs run in parallel so you can maximise your total annual value by optimising your flexibility assets across multiple programs our global demonstrated experience weve had a long history working in demand response and frequency control services we entered new zealands interruptible load il market in 2008 their equivalent to fcas today were one of the biggest nzil market participants representing on average 65 of the interruptible load in the market our experience and expertise offshore enabled us to become the first thirdparty aggregator in the nem today we represent up to 30 of the market offering our customers flexible energy load our participation has directly contributed to a reduction in fcas prices aemo 2021 a benefit that flows on to all electricity users we can help you get the most out of the fcas market as the only independent aggregator in the market were uniquely positioned to maximise the earnings for every megawatt available our global experience and marketleading technology maximises your sites market participation every day there can sometimes be barriers to entry which we can help you overcome businesses with lower energy loads need an aggregator to participate in the market due to minimum bidding rules there can also be high initial equipment costs and technical requirements for participating which we can also help you navigate in addition to the support of our local team we have a dedicated 247365 team in dublin that operates our market portfolio so you earn revenue at all times want to know more about participating in the fcas markets get in touch with our team article demand
