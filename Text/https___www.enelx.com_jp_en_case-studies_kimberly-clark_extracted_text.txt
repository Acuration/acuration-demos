on a project developed in enel x north america kimberlyclark kimberlyclark is an indispensable part of life for people in more than 175 countries with brands such as kleenex and huggies kimberlyclark holds the top share position in more than 80 countries the need kimberlyclarks canadian huntsville mill in the muskoka tourism region of ontario makes kleenex facial tissue the kleenex pocket pack and scott 1000 bath tissue the huntsville ontario mill is a 247 operation that manufactures large rolls of tissue and has several conversion operations that fold facial tissue wind bath tissue and package the products in 2010 huntsville management entertained the idea of a 500 kw reduction in energy use at the plant in order to participate in demand response huntsvilles mill managers faced questions at first on whether the facilitys curtailment plan would conflict with its primary goal of making paper products  some employees were at first skeptical as well the solution enel x visited the site to evaluate its energy use and determined that the 7 mw facility could reduce up to 5 mw during a demand response dispatc h to maximize payments after two successful dispatches the huntsville mill found that 5 mw was actually a conservative estimation and that the entire tissue machine could be shut down during a 4hour dispatch to take a total of 53 mw off the grid  because the huntsville mill operates with inprocess inventory on hand the packaging operations can continue uninterrupted even while the tissue machine is down to convince the doubting plant managers magistrale displayed the facilitys electricity usage and greenhouse gas ghg emission s on a 42inch lcd monitor installed at the plant entrance the screen also shows the potential load reduction and payments to be received during a demand response dispatch while some employees were at first skeptical the proof was in the numbers  when i look at the numbers its pretty easy said magistrale the benefits there are several benefits for kimberlyclark to participate in demand response from receiving regular payments that can be fed back into the mills infrastructure to organizing the workflow of maintenance activities to gaining an awareness of the status of ontarios power grid demand response helps huntsville remain competitive in energy efficiency and costsavings relative to kimberlyclarks other global operations regular facility maintenance lead to capital expenditures reduction huntsville utilizes the 4 hours of downtime during a dispatch to perform standard required maintenance on the tissue machine regular maintenance on the machine is essential to prolonging its lifespan and critical to avoid having to replace it by performing maintenance during the dispatch periods kimberlyclark not only prolongs the lifespan of its expensive equipment but also earns capacity payments at the same time being able to take advantage of downtime has really helped us internally to get our maintenance act together said anthony magistrale electrical engineer tissue manufacturing at the hunstville mill and we didnt have to invest in capital to make our operations more efficient business intelligence ive learned a lot about the electricity market said magistrale knowing the status of the ontario grid is really useful and is something wed never looked at before this is especially important for anticipating power interruptions and understanding the pricing and supply of electricity huntsvilles success with demand response has magistrale thinking about what else he can do to optimize energy use at the plant enel xs demand response application has given him and his team insights into how the facility utilizes energy and magistrale knows more changes can be made were looking at options for energy auditing and were looking for efficiency improvements that would come out of those audits he said social contributions to the community the huntsville feels that by participating in demand response it is helping to maintain the stability of ontarios electricity grid by taking over 5 mw of load off the grid during peak usage periods huntsville can assist in balancing the supply and demand of electricity enabling the grid to function smoothly without interruptions in service comprehensive approach to sustainability kimberlyclarks corporate headquarters is committed to sustainability standards and now recognizes the huntsville facility as a direct contributor to those goals by participating in demand response huntsville has distinguished itself within the kc portfolio as a leading energyefficient facility introduce to other countries and plants kimberlyclark has expanded its demand response participation to other countries its operations in ingleburn new south wales execute its
