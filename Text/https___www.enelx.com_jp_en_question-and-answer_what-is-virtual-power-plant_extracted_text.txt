what is a virtual power plant vpp what is vpp asset types benefit evolution of vpp what is a virtual power plant vpp a vpp is a portfolio of distributed energy resources der including electricity consumers smallscale renewable energy power plants storage batteries onsite battery storage and fuel cells which are controlled in an integrated manner to function as if they were a single real power plant it is also called a virtual power plant for practical purposes vpps act like and have the same effect as a traditional centralized large power plant their ultimate goals are the same  ensuring that energy demand on the grid is met by the available energy supply and that the grid remains stable traditional power plants operate out of one physical location and work only on the supply side of the grid equation  as demand increases the centralized physical power plants ramp up to supply more energy a virtual power plant by contrast uses its many decentralized assets in different ways with iot to help supply meet demand decreasing demand has the same effect as a traditional power plant increasing supply  ensuring that supply and demand stay balanced but this is not all that vpps can do some of the ders in a vpp can also supply energy to the grid eg onsite generators storage technologies a trend that we see increasing in the future adoption of ders is growing as they enable organizations to be more flexible in how they consume energy advance their sustainability goals and boost resilience across their operations variety of assets to help supply meet demand a wide variety of different energy assets can be aggregated into a vpp some examples of assets in vpps include 1 flexible load 1  flexible load refers to the management of electricity demand consumption to match the supply of electricity the most common demandside flexibility is demand curtailment which can be incentivized through utility or market operator demand response programs under these programs large electricity consumers are rewarded for curtailing demand during system peak hours case study about echuca regional health in australia is an example of this demand response learn more 2 battery storage  battery storage systems can enable organizations to allow consumers to use energy stored during periods of low electricity prices or energy stored by renewable energy sources batteries can contribute stored energy directly to the grid as part of a vpp 3 onsite solar  onsite solar can help reduce the volume of electricity purchased from the grid depending on the contract program excess solar can be exported back to the grid 4 electric vehicles  much like a battery smart ev charging can respond to grid signals and allow ev owners to shift their charging time from high electricity prices periods to low electricity prices a case study with gogoro and enel x taiwan is an example of this benefit of a vpp by optimizing usage of ders vpps offer many benefits over the traditional centralized power plant model this is because alternative thermal power plants are often expensive to operate in addition grid operators spend a lot of money maintaining these plants so they can be ready to start up at times of peak demand quickly ders in a vpp by contrast have much lower marginal costs and are typically using much cleaner energy  like onsite solar storage or controllable flexibility gogoro and enel x taiwan partnership learn more the evolution of the vpp the energy industry is rapidly evolving what was once considered a moonshot has become commonplace  renewable resources becoming costcompetitive with fossilbased dispatchable generation while smart appliances and vehicles can quickly respond to price signals however these changes have made maintaining a balance between supply and demand more complex for example wind and solar power are intermittent resources meaning there is no power if there is no sun or wind and their increasing prevalence highlights the flexibility challenges and capacity needed to bridge times of high and low intermittent generation for example what is seen in the california duck curve is that as the introduction of renewable energy expands the way electricity is used by the hour changes and at the neck of the duck evening time zone demand is sharply higher and the balance between supply and demand can easily become unbalanced this phenomenon is not only seen in california but is also starting to occur in various areas in japan so areas like kyusyu solar power generation volume is high compared to the other countries need to think about countermeasures the leaders declaration adopted at the g20 summit  which closed on september 10 2023 announced an agreement to pursue and encourage efforts to triple renewable energy capacity globally 2 by 2030  so it is necessary to think about effective countermeasures soon this is where demandside energy resources such as flexibility and storage batteries come into play balancing the supply and demand of electricity through the optimal use of vpps is a trend that is likely to increase in the future drvpp operations engineer hiromasa kondo participating in vpp has many advantages for companies enel x has extensive experience integrating der various demand response programs solar pv and storage batteries into vpps creating a valuable revenue stream please also read  how to participate in demand response  1 flexibility in the power industry refers to the ability to adjust and adapt generation consumption and grid operations in response to changing supply and demand conditions this includes not only coping with fluctuations in electricity demand but also managing the variability and uncertainty associated with the
