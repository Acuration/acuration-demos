the first step towards an energy efficient company play video photovoltaic panel systems are increasingly sought after in romania by both individuals and companies or public institutions already from 2018 people can install photovoltaic panels in their yard or at home for their own consumption which makes them prosumers if home use photovoltaic plants have a capacity of less than 100 kw the systems that companies can install on the ground or on the rooftops of industrial buildings exceed this capacity and they can be called industrial photovoltaic systems romania is one of the countries committed to upgrading its economy to the parameters of carbon neutrality and 2050 the deadline set by the paris agreement is not far off industrial photovoltaic systems installed by enel x use the most advanced products  panels that efficiently transform the suns energy into electricity  and the most experienced teams who will provide you with advice from the concept and design phase to the actual realization and commissioning enel x installs modular systems that can be resized at any time by adding additional elements such as inverters and panels if the energy needs of the unit have increased advantages of energy efficiency renewable solar energy helps small and large businesses in romania to become energy efficient companies  to reduce their electricity consumption and thus their electricity costs photovoltaic systems are one of the solutions that contribute to increasing energy efficiency and can be easily integrated with energy storage solutions to create energy efficient buildings  energy generation needs to become smarter but so need building lighting or heating cooling ventilation systems both energy generation and consumption can be monitored and optimized remotely automatically with the help of a monitoring platform which is also part of enel xs portfolio of innovative solutions another advantage that attracts companies is the potential energy independence brought by a photovoltaic system instead of depending on the electricity from the electricity grid companies can use their own power source renewable energy provided by the sun if the system also integrates energy storage solutions in the form of batteries then the building can consume the stored energy during the night otherwise it uses grid energy but it is much less than before the installation of photovoltaic solar panels the more energy efficient companies are the lower their carbon footprint and the more sustainable they become from small family businesses to large industrial producers all businesses face the challenge of adapting to the demands of the energy transition in order to obtain competitive advantages romanian companies are increasingly prioritizing investments in a new energy infrastructure one that will bring them financial benefits and ensure their compliance with the new sustainability paradigm and dont forget these investments guarantee sustainability the photovoltaic modules installed by enel x have an estimated lifespan of 25 years in your company what are the most attractive benefits of photovoltaic systems in romania enel x already has a solid portfolio of pioneering business customers as expected the companies that have collaborated with enel x are very diverse in terms of field of activity and geographical location representatives of the food industry wood processing shopping centers large retailers or industrial producers take the example of the latter a customer particularly interested in sustainability for which enel x recently installed a photovoltaic system amiblu is a company whose industrial products sustainably meet water and sewerage needs in many countries of the world with production units in romania and in other countries around the world how did our customer know what photovoltaic system they needed the first step was taken right on the enel x website without any commitment through the photovoltaic system simulator  we used the simulator in the early days of our plan to install a photovoltaic system it helped me get an idea of what to expect from such a system later we chose enel x we installed the photovoltaic system to use as many renewable resources as possible for us the decrease in the electricity bill was only a consequence of the installation of the system not an end in itself the main objective was one of sustainability given that amiblu wants to become neutral in terms of carbon footprint and it is clear that the installation of a photovoltaic system is a step towards this goal at the moment the energy generated by the photovoltaic system installed by enel x covers the electricity needs of our office building alin teodorescu  plant manager amiblu românia here is how for romanian companies the installation of a photovoltaic system with enel x can be the first step towards green energy efficiency and decarbonization or it can be another step on a path already started as is the case of the quoted customer a company with ambitious plans for energy transformation how can a photovoltaic simulator be of help based on the information you enter the application will estimate the size of the photovoltaic system that meets your needs to get the most realistic estimate your initial investment is only 5 minutes at the end of the 5 minutes you can choose to get in touch with a team of b2b consultants from enel x who will make you an actual proposal following detailed discussions on your energy efficiency goals the only information you need is the location of the business you will select it on the map the available space you have identified for installation you will draw a perimeter on the map and indicate whether the installation surface is flat or sloping the amount of current expenses with electricity and current energy consumption as well as its share  more in the morning in the evening during the week solar panel savings calculator estimate how much your business could save with a solar photovoltaic plant in terms of energy costs and co2 emissions find out more other resources read more about enel x projects kaufland
