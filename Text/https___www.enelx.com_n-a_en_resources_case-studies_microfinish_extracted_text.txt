missouris business demand response bdr program provides payments to large energy users that agree to reduce their energy demand during times of grid stress ameren partners with enel x a leading energy solutions and demand response provider to manage the demand response program and make it simple for ameren missouri customers to earn payments when a representative from enel x first spoke to stock about the program he thought such a simple riskfree way of making new revenue sounded too good to be true but he quickly found out it was for real i didnt believe it could be that good so i wanted to check some references stock said i called two names the salesperson gave me and i left a message for both of them they both called me back to tell me what a great experience theyd had they sold me on the product right awaythey were so enthusiastic the benefits of demand response stock signed three of the microfinish facilities up for the demand response program in ameren the experience has more than lived up to his expectations stock said hes seen a variety of benefits from demand response significant new revenue there was tremendous payback in the rebate we got at the end of the year it was as promised and it was very helpful especially with how many things have changed during covid the extra check at this time was very helpful helping the community with grid reliability as a metal finishing company we often have a reputation of not really caring about the environment so our employees really thought this was a positive thing they wondered why they were stopping work and we told them about demand response and how it helps conserve energy on the gridso that on a day with high energy demand their home will still have air conditioning at night when their kids come home they thought it was a neat thing for the company to be participating in great service from enel x team it seemed like it was going to be difficult to try to schedule around downtime but there was so much communication it was just phenomenal we were given almost a week warning that it was a possibility we may need to reduce energy at a certain time and they reminded us again the monday before an event was expected there were also emails and followup phone calls so everyone knew what was going on the communication could not have been better minimal disruption to operations in some ways shutting down has been a benefit to uswhen theres a high demand for energy its usually a very hot day and that means our facility is hot so people get to go home and get away from that heat so it hasnt been detrimental to our operations at all a recommendation for enel x id absolutely recommend it ive told several other people even customers about the program and the benefit it has been to us im as enthusiastic as the gentlemen i originally talked to about their facilities i think its good for our community and beneficial to our company related resources explore other resources within this
