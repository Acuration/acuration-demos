why agp  north america switched to enel x for better energy savings agp  north america had facilities across the country already participating in demand response when its facility in california decided they wanted to switch demand response partners according to ted moser manager oeg energy for agp  north america that facility switched to enel x and soon additional agp  north america facilities were signing up for enel x by now agp  north america has recognized significant energy savings at its participating sites in the us i like the metering the website and the financial arrangements that enel x provides said moser how agp  north america reduces energy with minimal disruption to ensure a smooth process when curtailing energy enel x helped agp  north america craft a

with no penalties for underperformance other than reduced payments sometimes riskaverse company leadership can hesitate at the thought of changing operations in any way but moser explains the program quickly sold itself because this involves the major piece of equipment for glass production our leadership team needed assurance that we wouldnt be putting our facilities at risk moser said as soon as agpnorth america implemented a plan to operate safely and without an impact on quality and we achieved the energy savings they realized the benefit how dr ties in with their sustainability efforts agp  north america has ambitious longterm sustainability plans in place focused on supporting its communities and customers in everything they do demand response ties into these values kristofic noted we
