financial calendar as the chairman and ceo of blackrock the largest asset manager in the world fink is one of the most important and influential people in finance so his views command attention and thats why his recent statements on sustainability esg and more are generating so much discussion even beyond the world of finance finks 2022 letter to ceos over the past several years larry finks annual letter to ceos has increasingly stressed his belief in the importance of climate action for corporate success for instance two years ago in his 2020 letter fink noted that climate change has become a defining factor in companies longterm prospects and that the market had not yet fully reflected this fact his statements were only part of a broader trend that we noted at the time  investors increasingly preferred companies that were involved in esg  in this years letter fink touched on a wide range of subjects  including a major emphasis on the changing relationship between employers and employees workers demanding more from their employers is an essential feature of effective capitalism fink noted later adding that companies not adjusting to this new reality and responding to their workers do so at their own peril why sustainability is crucial for corporations and investors when it comes to sustainability and sustainable energy strategy  fink noted that its not just employees who demand it of organizations in fact fink noted most stakeholders  from shareholders to employees to customers to communities and regulators  now expect companies to play a role in decarbonizing the global economy its a recurring theme not just for fink but for everyone from activists to sustainable investors climate risk is significant and thus a companys longterm value is dictated in part by how it adapts to the coming energy transition for companies to do this properly theyll need help from renewable energy consultants and experts every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world fink writes the question is will you lead or will you be led how corporations are taking action these ideas are being supported by action capital is shifting into
