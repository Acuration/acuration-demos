download pdf largest btm bess largest behindthemeter battery energy storage system bess in north america at 20 mw40 mwh improve ghg emissions energy storage to relieve system stress at times of peak demand and improve systemlevel ghg emissions fully financed fully financed enel x solution under a benefitsharing model expected to deliver significant annual energy savings for imperial successful partnership builds on successful partnership with enel x in demand response the customer challenge decreasing peak demand charges imperial oil was looking to address peak demand charges known in its jurisdiction as global adjustment and sought cuttingedge energy technology to minimize these charges to do so imperial wanted to incorporate an onsite battery storage system the solution battery storage with enel x already a participant in demand response programs with enel x imperial saw an opportunity to expand the partnership after a competitive process imperial selected enel x as its energy storage partner embarking on a largescale behindthemeter storage system for its sarnia ontario petrochemical operation we chose enel x as our energy storage partner because of its large existing fleet of energy storage assets across north america and its broad tip to tail expertise and involvement in all aspects of the energy markets and services industry greg thomas site business analyst at imperial the benefits decreased energy spend all energy use is not the same on a bill  organizations can create significant savings by shifting the time they use energy from the grid at its simplest battery storage creates energy bill savings by allowing facilities to store energy when it is cheapest then use that energy later when prices on the grid are high in ontario global adjustment ga is a particularly important bill component  timeofuse rates have ga costs embedded within them imperial oil will use this battery energy storage system to significantly decrease global adjustment costs by using energy from the battery instead of the grid at times that would lead to high global adjustment charges the bess will help reduce the plants reliance on the grid at times of peak demand resulting in cost savings for the company the energy storage system will enable imperial to be more agile in its energy use leveraging primarily clean stored power from the grid to lower its global adjustment costs saving the sarnia operation every year through a benefitshare model with enel x automated system optimization enel x will manage maintain and optimize the system to maximize energy savings enel xs distributed energy resource optimization software deros uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to forecast future energy needs and prices and adjusts battery operations accordingly enel x also has extensive market participation experience further unlocking potential revenue streams for imperial simple process with enel xs expertise upon completion in 2022 this system sized at 20 mw40 mwh is believed to be the largest behindthemeter bess in north america based on publicly available data we chose enel x as our energy storage partner because of its large existing fleet of energy storage assets across north america and its broad tip to tail expertise and involvement in all aspects of the energy markets and services industry said greg thomas site business analyst at imperial add to that enels global scale balance sheet and the successes we had already achieved together in demand response and we believe were working with the right company for this strategic project innovative solutions for decarbonization more importantly imperial knew this energy storage project would be right for the environment providing multiple benefits to the local grid and community as well as reducing operational costs at the sarnia plant energy storage has a very compelling value proposition added thomas we see it as an effective way to reduce our emissions charging the batteries at night when the grid is often running close to 100 renewables and dispatching the batteries during the day to offset our sarnia operations use of the grids natural gas
