also known as dsm is a set of strategies used by electricity utilities to reduce or shift energy demand by encouraging customers to modify their level or pattern of electricity use the most common strategies concern pricing  by changing the price of energy for instance by offering timeofuse rates or peakload pricing utilities can encourage consumers to shift their energy usage offpeak hours or use less energy overall incentives  consumers can be offered monetary incentives both to buy energyefficient equipment or lower prices if they agree to reduce usage during peak times of demand it is exactly in this second category of strategies that we find demand side response what is demand side response demand side response  also known as dsr demand response dr or demand management  is one of the strategies to balance electricity supply and demand falling under the umbrella term of demand side management it is a tool used by grid operators financially compensating companies who agree to modulate their energy consumption if a business can be flexible with its energy usage it can take part in a demand side response programme and turn its flexibility into a new revenue stream  as well as from access lower energy costs when it uses the grid during offpeak hours demand side response transforming energy from a cost to an opportunity learn more how does demand side response work by offering participants financial incentives to temporarily reduce their energy consumption  demand side response programmes free up grid capacity when electricity demand outstrips the supply it also helps participants to reduce their energy costs by minimising usage while energy is more expensive there is no onesize method of reducing demand as individual businesses will adjust their consumption based on their operational requirements available assets and the type of organisation they are though common reduction steps include switching off and reducing equipment use to decrease electricity usage for example turning off nonessential lighting or adjusting thermostat levels moving to backup energy generation  for example backup generators or onsite renewable sources using an onsite uninterruptible power source ups and battery storage options organisations with the ability to reduce electricity consumption or revert to 1 mw or more of onsite capacity can earn direct revenue from taking part to demand response programmes  there are two revenue streams open to organisations either from direct participation in dsr events or from simply being on standby participation can be manual or automated but all participants retain total control over their energy use  enel x works in close partnership with its customers to create reduction plans and safeguard core business operations from being affected by participation depending on operational requirements customers can nominate specific timeframes when they want to be available to participate in dsr events what are the benefits of demand side response demand response calculator find out how much you can earn by reducing energy consumption through demand response start simulation a new stream of revenue depending on the number of mws organisations can make available participants can earn substantial new revenue how often it can be freed up and the current market price also determine the size of payments working with enel x commercial and industrial participants in ireland and northern ireland can earn up to 16k per mw per year over the next 4 years energy cost savings reducing usage at peak times means organisations are using less energy when it is more expensive this leads to longterm reductions in energy costs costfree and riskfree by taking part in dsr events with enel x organisations face no upfront costs or risks if organisations cant temporarily reduce their consumption there are no penalties theyre simply not paid for that event contributing to grid stability all electricity users in ireland and northern ireland benefit from participation in demand side response as it is crucial for managing the continued security and supply of energy by taking part organisations are helping to stop power outages while generating revenue sustainability and decarbonisation by helping to balance energy supply and demand participants make room for more variable renewable energy vre sources such as wind and solar to be introduced onto the grid this helps to decarbonise the economy and meet net zero emission targets too improved business resilience often used and maintained assets are more reliable organisations that use battery and generation assets in dsr events are more likely to be able to use these assets in cases of unpredicted outages protect operations with advance notice of outages if grid instability and outages are predicted demand side response participants receive advance warning giving them the opportunity to prepare this can give companies like manufacturers the opportunity to schedule downtime and maintenance to coincide with outages overall demand side response can help organisations to support a flexible grid increase profitability reduce emissions and enhance operational resilience read this white paper to find out more how to access demand side response programmes with help from enel x organisations can easily access demand side response programmes when ready to take part enel x will inspect organisations halfhourly electricity data to determine the potential benefits once assessed enel x will process all the paperwork on behalf of organisations participants will start receiving income for the dsr events they participate in as soon as the agreements are in place to schedule a call with an enel x team member click here   enel x
