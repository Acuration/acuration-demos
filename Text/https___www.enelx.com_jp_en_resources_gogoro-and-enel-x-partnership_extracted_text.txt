energy transition with integration of virtual power plant and 2500 battery swapping stations background of gogoro and enel x taiwan partnership gogoro inc nasdaq ggr is a global technology leader in batteryswapping ecosystems that enable sustainable mobility solutions for cities it offers battery swapping stations throughout taiwan that allows pbgn powered by gogoro network electric scooter riders to easily swap out dead or dying batteries for fully charged one within seconds gogoro and enel x taiwans partnership started in 2021 in october 2021 collaboration with gogoro was announced and gogoro became the first electric mobility provider in taiwan to participate in a virtual power plant vpp in 2022 gogoro and enel x taiwans vpp pilot demonstrated that the gogoro network could safely pause charging if there was a grid imbalance or provide energy back to the grid as demand required the gogoro network performed these services without causing any interruptions to gogoro network batteryswapping customers demonstrating that the network is an ideal resource to support taiwans energy transition now in 2023 gogoro is enrolling up to 2500 battery swapping stations across 1000 locations into enel x taiwans vpp how does gogoro and enel x taiwan partnership work in face of the increasing proportion of renewable energy and electric vehicles virtual power plantsvpp are an excellent solution to cope with the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy and the sudden increase in electricity demand gogoros battery swapping stations gostation serve as one of the energy resources in our vpp the gogoro network when integrated with the enel x vpp could safely pause charging if there was a grid imbalance or provide energy back to the grid when needed this has the same effect as bringing new energy generation online to meet demand once the grid needs passes enel xs vpp sends a signal to the gogoro network to safely restore to normal grid consumption benefits in joining virtual power plant with enel x with gogoro joining enel x taiwans virtual power plant we can aggregate gogoros energy assets in this case the battery swapping stations into our vpp and offer them as an energy resource to taiwan power companys ancillary service market this creates a new revenue stream for gogoro while supporting the energy transition in taiwan aggregating 1000 sites is not easy enel x has a network operations center that operates 247 that can manage all these facilities without any problems all demand response programs are implemented managed and monitored in realtime what is vpp learn about virtual power plants read faq what does it mean for the gogoro riders gogoros participation in enel x taiwans vpp has no impact on the riders the only impact is that now riders have an even better reason to choose electric scooters because the batteryswapping stations support the energy transition and a cleaner environment for us and the next generation it means a better reason to adopt electric scooters comments from parties involved we are entering a new era of smart energy infrastructure and by integrating the gogoro network with the enel x virtual power plant vpp in taiwan we are providing a new energy resource it is the first time this technology has been deployed this way in the world and it creates a new gogoro revenue stream beyond mobility said horace luke founder and ceo of gogoro  we have always believed that timeshifting energy was key to enabling the sustainable transformation of energy and transportation and gogoro continues to be a key part of these advancements together the gogoro community is contributing to taiwans netzero targets by helping to integrate more variable power generation resources onto the grid today when the energy grid begins to max out we can dynamically pause our energy usage or provide energy back to the grid while continuing to operate our battery swapping service independently as needed the commercial expansion of the gogoro and enel x pilot program to more than 1000 battery swapping locations highlights a significant step in our ancillary service to increase energy use efficiency it is also an essential element in the development of large uptakes of renewable energy in the global electricity industry and a positive demonstration of how businesses like gogoro can proactively participate in taiwans energy market at scale said the president of taiwan power company tpc yaoting wang we believe our work with gogoro is a worldleading demonstration of what vpps can do and we are honored and excited to continue growing our collaboration with them jeff renaud head of enel x asia and oceania battery storage demand response 2 related content circular economy case studies have been selected for the g7
