photovoltaic systems with monocrystallinetype cells and an annual output of more than 2350 mwh benefits estimated annual savings of eur 200000 carbon footprint reduced by more than 500 tonsyear enel x customer nimet romania is one of the top european manufacturers of chromeplated steel bars and pipes present in more than 90 countries initially nimet was a startup by a mechanical engineer with only 10 employees and a facility for production of piston rods and tubes for hydraulic lifting loading and handling systems shortly after the austrian company palfinger a global leader in the cranes market entered into a joint venture with the romanian company in less than 10 years the small eastern european manufacturer became one of the most respected leaders of the industry with 650 employees and a monthly production capacity in excess of 5000 tons of chromeplated steel bars and pipes the challenge for nimet energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction are part of the companys sustainability strategy the organization aims to attain energy efficiency for the two facilities through energy cost optimization and protection against price fluctuations  the solution enel x romania proposed the turnkey implementation of two photovoltaic plants with an aggregate capacity of 2 mw by placing the following on the roofs of the factories 4100 highefficiency photovoltaic panels  with monocrystallinetype cells placed on the roof of both nimet factories târgoviște and lazuri 3 electric car charging points in the two nimet factories solar panel savings calculator estimate how much your business could save with a solar photovoltaic plant in terms of energy costs and co2 emissions discover the photovoltaic systems installed on the roof of the nimet factories shall ensure an annual electricity production of approximately 2350 mwh the project developed with enel x romania adds more sustainability in the activity of the nimet factories the equipment and technologies used in the project have high performance and reliability and are sourced from important suppliers on the global photovoltaic system market this makes niment the only sustainable manufacturer of chromeplated bars and pipes across the country benefits lower energy costs the manufacturer shall be able to make full use of the electricity produced in the photovoltaic plants and thus become selfsufficient from an energy point of view and cutdown its related costs by eur 200000 per year  reduced carbon footprint for two centuries already the industrial sector has played an important part in terms of climate change now businesses have the responsibility the means and the capacity to support the efforts employed to address the effects of climate change with the aid of photovoltaic power plants nimet reduces its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 500 tons every year enel x combines the expertise with innovation of the partners developing the panels to obtain a 100 operational photovoltaic system the electricity produced by the photovoltaic panels is all renewable and covers for a big part of the companys local electricity demand pollution control and a rational use of energy are among the pillars of our environmental policy we found in enel x romania a reliable partner that can help us attain these goals and ensure including the muchwanted predictability for any business by securing the electricity costs and providing protection against any potential rise in the price of electricity of the market the two photovoltaic power plants are a first step taken by niment one of the top manufacturers of chromeplated bars and pipes in europe to achieved an installed photovoltaic capacity of 6 mw by 2023 samy numan  managing director nimet our experience and the talks we had with the customer have helped us identify the most suitable pieces of equipment to provide an effective control on the annual energy consumption installation was done precisely as planned we are delighted with each and every element of the process and with the performance too we were happy that we could go again beyond our role of supplier and act as a reliable partner in terms of both the
