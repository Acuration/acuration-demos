that energy is largely determined by a capacity auction most of us have no idea what a capacity auction is let alone how it works there are loads of hairy politics involved in the auction process but ill avoid them for this guide and focus on explaining the process plain and simple to that end this guide uses the example of the pjm capacity auction and features two fictional power generators called powerone and powertwo and two fictional demand response providers called demandone and demandtwo facts and assumptions for this example powerone owns about 18000 mw of generation across the east coast powerone operates in the pjm grid operator area pjm is organized by zone this is important to note because thats how pjm procures megawatts pjm says i need 100000 mw across the entire service territory but then it says i need 10000 mw in zone a 12000 mw in zone b 250000 in zone c and so on lets use the zone atsi for this example atsi comprises northeast ohio with a peak load of about 12000 mw and almost all of it is powerone territory the big auction for pjm where it procures megawatts for a given delivery year is called a base residual auction bra it happens every may pjms bra is a forward capacity auction because its planning future capacity the bra works three years in advance for the purposes of this example lets say its may 2015 and the rules are all the same as last year were looking to see how pjm runs an auction to procure 12000 mw for the atsi zone capacity auction mechanics 1 think of the pjm capacity auction as building blocks different resources bid in at different prices the bids are then organized from lowest to highest price wherever supply and demand meet on the quantity axis see graph at right thats the clearing price and every megawatt below that clearing price gets that set dollar amount per megawattyear mwy this uniform clearing price is intended to keep the market more competitive and has been proven to keep prices lower for end users 2 the auction is regulated by a third party market monitor every auction hires an independent market monitor to set ground rules for the auction they ensure certain resources clear specifically resources like nuclear plants if you dont know conceptually how clearing works heres one diagram from the energy collective that i found helpful by governmental regulation nuclear plants must make it into the pool of resources used to provide power so they get bid in at a price of 1 per mwy 3 generators decide what resources to bid at which prices powerone for example looks at its portfolio of 18000 mw understands that about 12000 of those are in the atsi zone and determines how it wants to bid in its various nuclear coal natural gas or other assets and how many mw it wants to bid in for each plant powerone looks at its plants both baseload and peaking plants that only fire up when demand across the grid is dangerously high and thinks about prices per mwy for each one the idea is to bid in cheaper baseload resources first and then bid in more costly peaking plants at higher prices powerone likely starts with its nuclear facility which has about 5000 mw of capacity as i said nuclear has to clearits too expensive a resource not to be fully utilized which is why it bids in at 1mwy but youll see below how they get paid far more than 1mwy this plant is known as a price taker alternative energy and demandside sources like demandone also simultaneously look at their portfolios their energy markets team does the math on how many mw they can rely on customers to curtail when called uponand what it will cost them to secure and manage those customers 4 and then the auction happens note bids arent visible to auction participants as the auction is happening but for our purposes im outlining them from lowest to highest bid as if the process were transparent powerones nuclear plant bids in 5000 mw for 1mwy the first 5000 mw has been procured then powerone bids in a few baseload plants togetherlets say 3000 mw at 1000 so they can recoup some operating costs now were at 8000 mw of a total 12000 mw needed powertwo another generator in ohio comes in next bidding in 2000 mw its generating those from its expensive peakers so those get bid in at 5000mwy were now at 10000 mw procured next demandone enters the auction with 1000 mw at 15000mwy the auction now has 11000 of the 12000 mw it needs the auction is getting close to procuring all of the resources it needs so the next few bids are critical to determining what the price will be demandtwo another demand response provider is at bat now demandtwo bids in 1000 mw of its own dr resources at a higherpriced 20000mwy other much more expensive resources are also bidding into the market at higher pricestake that second 50000 bid from powerone for examplebut the auction is completed and pjm gets the resources it said it needed all at a much lower price with dr as a participant 12000 mw at 20000mwy is the clearing price this means that every megawatt in the auction at this point is now paid 20000mwyeven that nuclear plant that bid into the auction at 1mwy demandtwos dr bid set the price as they say
