short partial charges most electric cars allow partial charging in short bursts the charging time in these cases can even be very short how can i remotely monitor whether my car is charging you can monitor your charging status with the operators app you have chosen for charging if available is it possible to book a charging station yes some operators offer a booking service via the app to ensure that the charging station is available when a user arrives or you can go directly to a charging station to see if its free and charge the car in many cases stations can be used by several cars at the same time where can i find a map of available charging stations charging services on public land are offered by different operators mobility service providers each operator allows customers to view the charging infrastructure of their network on their website or on a dedicated app it is usually possible to check the status of the columns ie whether they are occupied reserved available or under repair view the map of enel x charging stations  how long it will take to finish a charging session the charging time depends on the charging power power in kwh of the socket at the charging station the maximum power accepted by the vehicles onboard charger the type of cable used and of course the battery storage capacity and the level of charge typically an average car with a 25 kwh battery needs 8 charging hours at home with an average power of 3 kwh 2 charging hours at faster charging stations between 74 and 22 kwh 30minute charging at even faster charging stations 43 kwh to 50 kwh charging at home which is better a dedicated charging station or a wall outlet a dedicated charging station ensures maximum safety and offers customers additional features compared to a simple outlet such as tracking consumption and cost of tariffs the possibility to regulate the charging power used eg by reducing the power to ensure that other household appliances can be used at the same time the ability to schedule remote charging based on hourly electricity costs or other needs where the regulatory system allows this realtime information on charging status optimizing coordinated charging with electricity generated by the users own photovoltaic installation if any find out more about juicebox electric car charging station that you can install in your garage charging at home do you need a new meter or more power there is no need for a new meter when connecting to your home electricity system if the meters power supply is limited to a certain power eg to 3 kwh smart charging stations can be used to regulate the current or you can charge at night when other energyintensive devices are usually not in operation if you have different needs you will have to request a power supplementation how many types of cables are there the cable delivered with your electric car will have a connector that allows connection to the power socket or car socket and a connector of the given type that allows the customer to connect to the charging station socket in alternating current for connection to the chargers infrastructure sockets mode 1 and mode 2  shuko plug module 3  type 2 and type 3 plugs type 2 plug cable also called mennekes is now widely used in europe except in france it charges vehicles with singlephase or threephase ac current up to 22 kw at the charging socket and up to 43 kw via the connector on the cable attached to the charging infrastructure the socalled scame 3a plug and cord are now only used for light vehicles such as scooters and micro vehicles and can be charged in singlephase mode to a maximum power of 37 kw in the united states and japan ac charging is done via cables attached to the charging infrastructure the cable will therefore have a connector that the customer will plug into the machines inlet the connector is a type 1 so called yazaki and charges the vehicle in singlephase alternating current at a maximum charging power of 74 kw for dc charging cables are attached to the charging infrastructure and their connectors are as follows mode 4  chademo connector mode 4  combo1 and ccs combo2 ccs connectors combined charging system the chademo connector cable is the most common standard for dc fast charging and is used for example in nissan mitsubishi peugeot and citroen vehicles it currently charges on the international fast charging infrastructure at a maximum power of 50 kw but could charge at even higher power rates the ccs combo2 cable is used by some european car manufacturers such as bmw and volkswagen while the ccs combo1 cable is mainly used by japanese and american car manufacturers the ccs combo 2 cable allows both dc fast charging and ac slow charging and is currently installed on the international dc fast charging infrastructure at a maximum power of 50 kw but can charge at even higher power levels it charges ac at the same power levels as described above for the type 2 standard car manufacturers choose the power limit to be applied in addition there is an adhoc standard used only by tesla with a single type 2 connector for both ac and dc charging when used in dc it charges exclusively with tesla superchargers based on a proprietary protocol public charging how do you know where to charge your car depending on the connector the first step is to check the compatibility of the car socket with the standard of the charging station when buying a car each manufacturer supplies one or two cables which can be used for the corresponding sockets at the charging stations public charging where to buy a charging cable the purchased or rented electric car is always equipped with a charging cable if the driver wants to buy a different cable compatible with other sockets he can buy it online or from the dealer costs vary depending on the power other frequently asked questions about electric transport read more about electric cars guide to electric cars the advantages of driving an electric
