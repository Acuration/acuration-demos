2018 one of the largest increases in dispatch frequency has been in our ancillary demand response programs these programs can be very financially lucrative for organizations and provide the utilities immense value due to their fast response to help balance the immediate needs of the grid ancillary demand response programs are growing in importance because of the increased flexibility they provide and changing grid conditions its clear that demand response is growing in importance for a wide variety of reasons part of it is the increased flexibility offered by demand response as the grid changes and part of it is a growing variety of programs and the participation of ders but increasing extreme weather is a notable part of it as well summer weather and the electric grid summer hasnt yet officially begun but there have already been notable early highs  southern california for instance saw a heatwave in late april  and texas has already seen unseasonably hot weather during which ercot asked residents to  conserve power when they can  while its impossible to say with certainty what weather lies ahead this summer there are reasons to think demand response will be as helpful as ever this year the north american electric reliability corporation nerc for instance said in its december 2021 longterm reliability assessment that the rapid change of the grid could create challenges  in tandem with the growth of extreme weather the report notes that there is a high probability of insufficient resources and energy to service electricity demand as early as summer 2022 in many parts of the western interconnection adding that all interconnections will face increasing reliability issues over the next 10 years john moura director of reliability assessment and performance analysis for nerc summed up the report by saying that when we look at events over the last several years it is clear that the bulk power system is impacted by extreme weather and that is happening more often there have been a variety of significant weather events in recent years both in summer and winter  for instance californias 2020 wildfires or texass winter storm uri in february 2021 and demand response has been a helpful tool in responding to these emergencies after the texas winter storm ercots study of the performance of emergency response service a demand response program in texas found that as a fleet in aggregate ers emergency response service loads generally overprovided relative to their combined obligation during the winter event on average fleetlevel ers load reduction was 3035 above the combined fleetlevel obligation during the first 12 hours after the first deployment demand response customers make an important contribution demand response customers are paid for their efforts but the benefits go beyond those payments organizations that participate are contributing to a more stable grid at times when the grid may be stressed as summer approaches we want to take a
