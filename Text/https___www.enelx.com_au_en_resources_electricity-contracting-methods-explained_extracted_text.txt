are many different options when it comes to contracting your electricity supply there are several different ways your organisation can contract with electricity suppliers each has its pros and cons and its important to choose an option that not only helps your business achieve its goals but also lets you take advantage of opportunities in a rapidly changing market heres what you need to know fixed price variable volume fpvv often referred to as a traditional electricity contract this is when a retailer supplies your electricity at a given price this fixed price is often broken into different peak and offpeak pricing pros cons its a familiar option which means youre unlikely to face any challenges getting this method signedoff you get price certainty for a given period which means you can budget confidently with the only variable being your usage theres no ongoing management once signed this is set and forget youve taken the price on offer that day and locked in a price for the term which could reduce or increase between now and the end of your contract period youll get charged risk premiums this is because the retailer has committed a price to you and they understandably have to add risk premiums to it these are related to the volume you may or may not use as well as market risk the retailer is taking because of the above points its unlikely this will be the lowest cost option for you unless of course the market increases significantly for the entire period of your contract at which point youll pay a high price for your next contract level of riskreward lowlow progressive electricity purchasing rather than entering into a fixed price contract progressive purchasing lets you buy blocks of electricity at different times throughout the year this flexible approach means you can lock in future pricing at a time that suits you or when market conditions are looking favourable for example you may want to purchase individual quarters in the future or a proportion of the load  like 25 of your q2 2022 load  today pros cons by actively managing your purchasing you can take advantage of short term dips in the market this helps you save money over time purchasing your electricity in multiple transactions helps you spread and mitigate risk you can mix and match the beneficial elements of other product types like fixed price spot financial instruments cfds or hedging to save money for example you can still execute a cfd with another third party if you feel its good value and then manage your progressive agreement accordingly you can maintain budget certainty by setting up triggers and maximum spends this is a relatively new method so your organisation may need some internal education before they feel comfortable making the switch it can be ineffective without correct management level of riskreward lowhigh assumes theres a robust governance model in place spot market or pool passthrough in this type of contract you pay the retailer the actual market price during the given period and at the location at which its consumed this sort of contract will have a markup from the retailer on the spot price pros cons this offers you the lowest cost outcome in the long run 10 year horizon because theres no risk premiums from retailers you pay the intrinsic price of electricity the actual price of generating the electricity in each time period which is formulated based on the generators dynamic bids and offers theres no budget certainty and its impossible to predict what the market pricing will be youll likely see large monthly cash flow fluctuations which may negatively impact your business outages or unexpected weather can lead to spot prices being held at levels that you didnt budget for level of riskreward highhigh spot market or pool passthrough combined with financial instruments cfds or hedges this is a physical contract where the customer pays the actual price plus a retailer markup that the market settles for in that given period and at the location where its consumed to manage some of the volatility in the spot market you can choose to overlay a financial hedge to create some certainty around the price outcome pros cons the hedge results in a fixed portion of the load being consumed at a known rate so you get an element of budget certainty the cfds will include risk premiums because the provider has taken market risk onboard and will therefore price it in financial instruments may need prudential to be posted as well as special accounting treatment its unlikely youll be fully hedged which will result in exposure to spot prices the cfd is a financial instrument and not linked to physical supply so if your usage is significantly reduced the cfd will still need to be settled at the original volume which would result in significant market risk level of riskreward medmed as you can see theres benefits and risks associated with all contracting methods and you should make a decision
