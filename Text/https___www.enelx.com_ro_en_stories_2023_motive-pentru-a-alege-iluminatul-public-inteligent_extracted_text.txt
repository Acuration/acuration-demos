lighting makes a difference smart street lighting  also referred to as adaptive lighting  encompasses intelligent solutions that utilize efficiency  remote control  and led technology  this innovative approach responds to usage patterns by adjusting the brightness of the lights when motion sensors detect no movement and intensifying the illumination when activity is detected within the designated area furthermore smart street lighting systems can be customized to adapt to road traffic conditions or integrated with monitoring systems that consider factors such as vehicle flow weather conditions and the natural light available street lighting has become widespread and more effective distinguishing modern metropolises from cities of the past prior to the 19th century while todays public street lighting has significantly advanced from the oil lamps of ancient rome a considerable portion of the current infrastructure relies on outdated technology consequently the result is subpar illumination frequent malfunctions environmental pollution and inefficient energy usage lighting alone accounts for approximately 25 of energy expenditure in urban areas smart street lighting saves energy and costs through the replacement of outdated public lighting infrastructure with cuttingedge technology  local governments can achieve significant energy and cost savings  implementing a highperformance street lighting system tailored for smart cities allows for efficient energy usage by utilizing cameras and various sensors that enable realtime management and control of public spaces the new infrastructure offers several advantages including swift identification of faults and errors  proactively preventing breakdowns and streamlining maintenance processes  additionally it provides the flexibility to integrate new features as they emerge leveraging the existing sensor network a broader impact of smart street lighting is its contribution to the entire city ecosystem  encompassing the
