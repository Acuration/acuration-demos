obtaining the best possible characteristics with the resources available the resulted photovoltaic system consists ofa 410 photovoltaic panels  with polycrystallinetype cells each with a power of 325wp 2 inverters that ensure high efficiency monitoring operation and maintenance system om metalic structure  especially designed to be fixed onto corrugated sheet metal following the approx 5 gradient of the roof the system was designed for selfconsumption considering that the customer is a prosumer that does not inflow any energy into the system the equipment and technologies used by enel x in the project have high performance and reliability and are sourced from tier 1 traditional producers on the global photovoltaic system market canadian solar schneider eaton abb benefits reduction of annual consumption the solution proposed by enel x has an installed capacity of 13325 kw and will help the facility reduce the co2 emissions by 6176 tons per year remote monitoring the operation and maintenance system used for the photovoltaic panels aims to maximize energy production by analyzing the short medium and longterm historical data of the operations onsite adjusting the processes accordingly and extending their lifetime digitalization of processes using highefficiency equipment to find the ideal costbenefit ratio enel x romania supplies specialized software to optimize and monitor the proposed photovoltaic systems masofma is provided with such ecodesign  with a focus on modularity performance and reliability in order to minimize the impact on the environment the energy
