order no 2222  which requires system operators to remove barriers to the participation of distributed energy resources ders in all wholesale energy markets across the country the major takeaway the order paves the way for enel xs customers to participate in wholesale markets with all forms of distributed energy resources including but not limited to demand response energy storage and electric vehicles in a manner that is not possible today in much of the country if implemented properly by grid operators the order will enable the transition to a more clean affordable and resilient electric grid what does this order mean regional grid operators oversee wholesale markets to ensure resource adequacy and efficient market pricing these objectives are often achieved through marketbased mechanisms including annual auctions in these wholesale auctions largescale electric generators including nuclear gas and coal power plants have traditionally supplied the overwhelming majority of mw in recent years demand resources and renewable resources have supplied an increasing share of total power but newer forms of distributed energy resources have faced considerable barriers to wholesale market participation now as a result of the commissions ruling every independent system operator iso and regional transmission organization rto across the country will have to create a new participation framework for distributed energy resources or update an existing framework what are der aggregators der aggregators bundle together a variety of smallscale energy resourcesincluding energy storage distributed generation demand response energy efficiency and electric vehiclesto create a bottomup portfolio of energy assets with this aggregated portfolio der service providers can bid that portfolios capacity into wholesale markets similar to how a traditional supply resource like a natural gas power plant bids its capacity into the market new opportunities for enel x customers enel x was a pioneer in demand response aggregation back in the early 2000s and has been enrolling electricity consumers into wholesale markets for the past two decades over the past several years enel x has expanded its breadth of services to cover additional ders including energy storage distributed generation solar electric vehicles and others with the passing of this order enel x can extend its der aggregation experience to more markets and more resources for our customers the specific market changes resulting from the order will transpire over many months to come but were excited about what this new future could mean for our customers creating a more stable more sustainable grid at enel x we believe encouraging der participation in wholesale markets is a major step forward for both grid reliability and sustainability enel is advocating on behalf of customers across the country to ensure they can maximize their participation and revenue from ders and to provide grid operators with the flexible resources that are crucially needed weve often worked in tandem with our partners at advanced energy economy and advanced energy management alliance who both played a crucial role coordinating responses from der providers and spent years making the policy and legal case for this decision because the electricity provided by ders is on average far less fossilfuel based than the marginal power plant this is a major win for sustainability as the fight against climate change ramps up and der technology costs continue to decrease this order marks a major milestone in the widespread adoption of innovative solutions like der aggregation which are furthering the evolution and energy transition of todays grid related stories explore other recent stories within this
