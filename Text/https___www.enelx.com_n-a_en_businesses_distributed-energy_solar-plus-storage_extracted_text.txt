learn how enel x can help you achieve your energy goals contact us what is solarstorage save money maximize renewables boost resiliency flexible financing what is solarplusstorage solarplusstorage is the integration of a battery with solar energy using this battery storage system businesses can see greater benefits than with solar alone increase the value of your solar system when a battery is paired with a new or existing solar system it increases the value of the system as a whole while solar offers inexpensive energy from a renewable source without the assistance of a battery its usefulness can be limited at night or during cloudy days with a battery excess solar power can be stored for future usewhether that need occurs when the sun isnt shining when peak demand charges are high or when the grid is down solarplusstorage is the perfect combination of renewable energy and battery storage and offers economic and environmental benefits how solarplusstorage saves money in many areas businesses that adopt onsite solar photovoltaic pv technology experience a decrease in their overall energy costs relative to what they were paying their utility adding battery storage to a solar system creates a greater margin of savings businesses can store excess solar energy and then consume that electricity during periods of peak demand utilities charge a premium for energy consumption during peak demand timesand these charges make up the majority of the bill for some businesses a battery helps to limit grid consumption during these periods effectively flattening a facilitys load curve in many areas a battery allows companies to participate in demand response  this market program in conjunction with other energy solar incentives offers payments to facilities willing to decrease electricity usage at times when the grid is under extreme stress with a battery organizations can earn demand response payments by shifting power from the grid to the battery resulting in little to no operational disruption maximize your consumption from renewables because solar power requires no fossil fuels solar systems are a renewable energy pillar but on cloudy days a solar system without storage may require a business to consume energy from the grid using power derived from fossil fuel generation plants with battery storage businesses can maximize their energy consumption from renewables for organizations with explicit greenhouse gas emission targets or clean energy initiatives a solarplusstorage system will meet and often exceed corporate goals batteries can supply stored solar energy on cloudy days stored solar energy is a resilient sustainable option during power outages boost resiliency without sacrificing sustainability solar battery storage helps prevent power loss if the grid goes down power outages have increased over the past several decades and as extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent outages may only get worse solarplusstorage is one of the strongest resiliency solutions on the market and can provide backup power ranging from several hours to several days often solarplusstorage can provide enough energy for
