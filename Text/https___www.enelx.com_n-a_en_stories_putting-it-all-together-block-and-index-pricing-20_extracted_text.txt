for energy procurement theres no onesizefitsall solution when it comes to tackling the blocks of this approach so as a followup to our previous post were diving a little deeper on the different ways to address the block portion of a block and index strategy for many large energy consumers having roughly 80 of their electricity supply hedged or fixed about a year into the future is a smart approach the remaining 20 or whatever that leftover amount may be is bought hourly on the spot market index where the price is tied to market fluctuations note the block and index strategy can also be applied to the purchase of natural gas the hedged portion of your portfolio doesnt have to be just one block  in fact it can consist of multiple blocks depending on your load profile facilities with predictable yearround load such as data centers often have only one block whereas facilities with loads that vary daily or seasonally such as manufacturers with 24x5 operations or a commercial real estate facility respectively tend to have the hedged portion of their energy supply comprised of several blocks which approaches your facility should select depends on your energy consumption and your risk tolerance not sure of the options for the energy you want to purchase in blocks read on for an overview of the most common kinds of blocks as well as the types of facilities generally best suited for each type annual blocks based on time of year seasonal buying energy in seasonal blocks is just what it suggests meaning that you secure a block of energy for a given season usually a 34 month period this approach is a good option for those organizations whose energy use varies seasonally such as some k12 school districts commercial real estate facilities or manufacturers with seasonal production schedules seasonal hedging also allows customers to minimize their budget risk during the more volatile winter and summer months providing an opportunity to purchase energy on the spot market during the generally less volatile shoulder months monthly monthly energy blocks are bought for specific months which allows for a bit more granularity compared to the seasonal approach we just discussed this is a good fit for those facilities in zones with low volatility in prices making it favorable to stay on straight index pricing for all but a few months here and there not sure if youre in one of these zones contact our team today and wed be happy to help you figure it out blocks based on operating schedule aroundtheclock aroundtheclock blocks of energy are increments of constant energy use over time this type of block is helpful for those facilities that operate aroundtheclock such as manufacturers with 24x7 schedules or hospitals or data centers which depend on a constant and consistent energy supply aroundtheclock blocks are also useful as a baseload block to hedge a facilitys minimum hourly use onpeak onpeak blocks are those that cover the onpeak hours typically around 7am11pm monday through friday holidays excluded this hedging method is ideal for buildings with traditional weekday operating schedules such as an office building offpeak the offpeak hedging approach entails purchasing blocks of energy for the offpeak hours typically over the weekend national holidays and from 11pm7am during the week offpeak blocks are usually good for those facilities with high loads off hours on weekends or on holidays such as manufacturers that have a heavy emphasis on the third shift offpeak blocks and onpeak blocks can often supplement aroundtheclock blocks to more closely follow a facilitys load if youre thinking my facilitys energy usage is more complex than any one type of block can accommodate not to worry you can create a combination of blocks to fit your organizations unique energy needs for example if you operate a commercial real estate facility with peak demand of 25 mw during onpeak operating hours monday through friday and 1 mw of baseload demand overnight during holidays and on the weekends you could purchase a 1 mw aroundtheclock block and layer on an additional 1 mw onpeak block to satisfy your electricity needs the unhedged portion of the load  approximately 500kw  would be purchased on the spot market one thing to be cautious of the more you slice up the load into smallersized blocks ie less than 1mw the higher the price premium from the supplier why the smaller the block size the greater the cost the supplier incurs to purchase an odd lot or a portion of a wholesale block because they have to liquidate the remainder of the block not purchased by the customer and try to sell it on the spot market this cost is then passed along to the customer energy managers are often strapped for time and energy supply purchasing can be an extremely nuanced process companies do undertake this effort inhouse but its helpful to have a neutral third party on your side that doesnt have a stake in the game for which supplier you choose navigating the energy procurement process with a trusted partner not only can save time but it can also save you money by partnering with enel x boston properties saved approximately 5m on their energy procurement and had the time to focus on other priorities related stories explore other recent stories within this category energy market insights for june 2023 energy market insights for
