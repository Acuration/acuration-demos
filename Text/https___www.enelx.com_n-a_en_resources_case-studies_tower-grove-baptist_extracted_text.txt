location st louis missouri program ameren missouris business demand response program benefit funds to reinvest in the facility and community michael gregory is senior pastor at tower grove baptist church in st louis missouri and in that position he oversees quite a bit of activity on the churchs large campus from monday to friday the school on campus teaches classes from preschool to 8th gradeas gregory puts it that means weve got kiddos all over the place from 630 in the morning to about 6 pm then on weekends the church holds one service on saturdays and four on sundays all of this activity leads to a lot of energy use and that made tower grove baptist church a good candidate for participation in demand response ameren missouris business demand response bdr program provides payments to large energy users that agree to reduce their energy demand during times of grid stress ameren partners with enel x a leading energy solutions and demand response provider to manage the demand response program and make it simple for ameren missouri customers to earn payments the payments are a major benefit for gregory and tower grove baptist church but as a pastor he also had other reasons for deciding to enroll in demand response the benefits of demand response payments for reducing energy like so many organizations gregory said tower grove baptist church is always keeping a close eye on their budget demand response has helped not only by creating new revenue but also by inspiring them to rethink their energy use generally we have a budget every year and were always looking to reduce costs he said so if we can cut back on our energy and get paid that allows money to be used elsewhere funds for reinvesting businesses can use the funds from demand response for any number of purposesand like many other businesses tower grove baptist church used some to reinvest in their facility and repairs but theyve also used them to help support their community too we took those funds from demand response and just put them elsewhere gregory said some on repairs some on helping out people within the community we were happy to use those funds on something other than paying a bill great service from enel x gregory said his experience with enel x has been goodthe enel x team has been clear and helpful during the enrollment process they were very informative gregory said i met with the team along with my facility manager and they gave us some insight on how to participate it really wasnt complicated it was basic things we could do that would reduce energy
