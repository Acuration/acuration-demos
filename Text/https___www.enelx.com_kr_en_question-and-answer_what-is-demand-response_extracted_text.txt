faq what is demand response demand response programs are management measures used by power companies to guide electricity users to adjust their electricity consumption habits it is done by reducing peak demand or shifting it to offpeak periods by providing incentives such as price or tariff reductions this is a common practice in the electricity industry worldwide to suppress peak demand similar to buying insurance for power supply and unrelated to power rationing  when the electricity demand on the consumer side is too high or there is an excess of supply on the supplier side it will lead to an imbalance between supply and demand affecting the stability of the power system generally speaking what often happens is that the electricity demand from the consumers side exceeds the supply leading to blackouts at this point if energy users can temporarily reduce their energy consumption the power grid will be able to get back into a balance between supply and demand and maintain power stability in response to netzero carbon emissions and energy transition properly implementing demand response can avoid the high cost of building additional power plants  making it an increasingly important resource in the power system demand response join our virtual power plant and support the energy transition learn more according to a report by the international energy agency  the milestone for netzero scenarios has 500gw of demand response brought onto the market by 2030 corresponding to a tenfold increase in deployment levels in 2020 therefore we need more flexible power resources for demand response demand response provides a brand new opportunity for commercial institutional and industrial organizations in face of the energy transition businesses can earn a brand new revenue stream by using flexible energy resources to support the grid and maintain reliable electricity effectively utilizing existing assets while improving energy efficiency is a practical action toward
