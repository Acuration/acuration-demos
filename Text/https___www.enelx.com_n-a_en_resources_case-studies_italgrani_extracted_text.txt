elevator services in north dakota and fullservice grain merchandising in minnesota how esg efforts led to demand response italgrani usa recently began a serious effort to take action on environmental social and governance commonly referred to as esg issues they quickly realized that demand response would fit in well with this new effort ameren missouris business demand response bdr program provides payments to large energy users that agree to reduce their energy demand during times of grid stress ameren partners with enel x a leading energy solutions and demand response provider to manage the demand response program and help ameren missouri customers receive these simple payments the payments are a benefit meyer said but the potential esg benefits were what really stood out to the company reinvesting dr earnings for more esg initiatives the money that theyve earned from the program meyer said has been helpful and that extra revenue has in some ways indirectly allowed them to pursue other esg initiatives the business has installed automatic lights throughout their campus to minimize wasted electric use and theyve also created a new program to recycle food material that is left over after deliveries a lot of our product is shipped in rail cars and when an empty rail car comes back to the facility there may be residual product at the bottom of the car meyer said we have to remove that material and previously it would go to a landfill now we recycle that material its been part of our esg initiatives being part of the enel x program makes us more aware and more focused you could say proceeds from enel x made that opportunity to make this investment in this new program minimal disruption to operations the program meyer said has not been a major disruptor to normal operations because the company is typically aware of when an event is a possibility one of the keys has been advance notice meyer said and were also completely aware that demand on the grid will be highest when temperatures are highest so we can to an extent anticipate when we might get the call about an upcoming event its typically a few hours during a weekday and we can handle that a recommendation for enel x meyer said hes had a very positive experience with enel xs service team who have worked closely with him and been responsive anytime questions have come up everyone weve interacted with has been extremely professional if we have questions we get clear answers right away communication has been greatenel x is a great partner to be working with i have recommended enel x
