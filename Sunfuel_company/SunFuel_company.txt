	What is the market share of the Bifacial module?
		Energy yield comparison between monofacial photovoltaic modules ...
		Bifacial modules are the same size as monofacial modules but have more power because of their front and rear irradiance. The market share of bifacial cells was over 60% in 2022 and is expected to exceed 80% in 2032 (Uematsu et al., 2003, VDMA, 2022, Guo et al., 2013).
		A study compared the energy yield of monofacial and bifacial photovoltaic modules in a carport system on the Korean Peninsula during all four seasons. Monofacial modules had a 65.3% reduction in rear aluminum paste consumption and a 0.5 cent/wafer cost reduction for M4 size wafers. Bifacial cells had a 5.8 kWh/kWp energy yield, which was 0.53% higher than that of the non-monofacial module. The study shows a strong linear correlation between irradiance and energy yield exhibited by both types of modules. This study suggests that monofacacial modules may be used in the PV industry to reduce cell production costs and levelized cost of electricity while enhancing energy yields and overall product performance.

	What is the market share of rooftop solar in India?
		The rooftop solar commercial & industrial market in India - IEEFA
		According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), as of July 2023, the cumulative installed capacity of rooftop solar in India was 10.9 gigawatts (GW). This represents a share of around 15% of the total solar installations in India.
		The report on the rooftop solar commercial and industrial market in India discusses recent market trends, regulatory updates, financing trends, and innovative business opportunities that can spur activity in the sector. The report estimates that fiscal year 2024 will see the largest installations of rooftop solar to date of about 4 GW, with 2GW already installed between April and July 2023. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) remain largely untapped for their rooftop solar potential, while regulators are exploring innovative business models such as virtual net metering and peer-to-peer trading. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has launched a program to achieve the government's goal of installing 40 GW of solar capacity by 2022. The rooftop solar market has consistently grown by around 1.9-2.2GW annually, with Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and the union territory of Delhi having the most favourable ecosystems for setting up rooftop solar projects. Rooftop solar is an important market segment of India’s solar sector, providing buyers with a viable option to green their electricity consumption by procuring on-site cheaper and cleaner renewable energy. JMK Research and IEEFA provide details about the evolution of this sector.
