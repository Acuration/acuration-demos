This cumulative power generationcapacity has the potential to light up four million homes annually; thereby accentuating thekey role that Suzlon continues to play in the electrification of India.Suzlon has cumulatively added over 5,000 MW of wind power capacity for over 1,500customers in India across 40 sites in eight States. Suzlon accounts for nearly half of thecountrys total wind installations. In the key states of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat,Suzlons installation base is over 1,000 MW each. Leading corporates such as the BajajGroup, the Birla Group, MSPL, DLF, the Tata Group, the Reliance Group, the ITC Group,L&T, as well as public sector companies like GSPL, HPCL, Indian Railways, Rajasthan Mines& Minerals, GACL, GSPC, GSFC, Indian Oil, ONGC and State Bank of India (SBI), amongstothers, have chosen Suzlon for their wind power projects.Suzlon is India's largest wind turbine manufacturer and has been leading the wind energymarket in India for the past 12 years with nearly 50 percent YoY market share. Thecompany has a workforce of 9,000 employees in India, and eight manufacturing facilitiesacross the country.Commenting on this achievement, Mr. Tulsi R Tanti, Chairman and Managing Director Suzlon Energy Limited, said: In just over a decade, Indias wind market has grownfrom just around 50 MW per year to nearly 2,000 MW per year, and we at Suzlon are proudto have led this. The 5000 MW milestone for us is a testimony of trust invested in us by allour stakeholders, including our customers, policymakers, regulatory commissions, nodalagencies, utilities, banks, vendors, shareholders and our employees. We thank them all andlook forward to their continued support in building countrys backbone for sustainable lowcarbon economy, and at the same time, bringing energy security, rural development andalso mitigating the impact of climate change."This achievement is significant, not only for Suzlon, but for India. In our 63rd year ofindependence, India is on an accelerated growth path with a demonstrated commitment tofight climate change. Under the Prime Ministers National Action Plan for Climate Change,India has a target to source 15 per cent of electrical power from renewables by 2020. Wehave already secured one fourth of our target, and wind is the highest contributor at ~70per cent of the countrys total grid connected renewable power capacity; this is a testamentto Suzlons accomplishment, and marks an important milestone in Indias commitment tobuilding a low carbon economy. Currently, Suzlon installations in India help in mitigating~8.5 million metric tons of harmful CO2 emissions.India is the worlds fifth biggest wind market with a cumulative installed base of over12,000 MW. The total estimated onshore wind power potential in India, as per data from theMinistry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is over 48,000 MW. The sector is poised foraccelerated growth driven by demand for power, strong support for renewables by theGovernment, a sound policy framework and a positive investment outlook for ourcustomers.
