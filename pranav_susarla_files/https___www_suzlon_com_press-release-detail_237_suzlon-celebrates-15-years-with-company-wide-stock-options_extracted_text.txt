Tanti, founder, Chairman and Managing Director, said: "April 10, 2010 marked15 years in the history of our Company, and we are very pleased to take that opportunity toroll out this exciting initiative.What makes this ESOP initiative unique and important is its scale and reach. At Suzlon weknow our greatest strength is our employees. We have created a highly skilled, diverse andmulticultural workforce which has become a part of the Suzlon global family. I have alwaysbelieved that those instrumental in creating wealth for the business should share in thatwealth. This initiative is making that dream a reality."It is hard to believe that 15 years ago we started the Company with just three people.Today, Suzlon Energy Limited and its subsidiaries have almost 11,000* employees and amajority of them will be granted 1,500 share options each  totaling approximately 14million shares, and about one percent of the capital.. We hope and trust that this initiativeof ours will not only make our employees true stakeholders and drive greater engagement -but also that this is something which the broader corporate community will now consideradopting too."I would like to thank everyone who has worked so hard to build Suzlon up to where we aretoday - and look forward to celebrating our next milestones with the entire Suzlon family."This special ESOP scheme is far reaching  with a focus on inclusivity. The scheme is opento all permanent employees of SEL and its subsidiaries (excluding REpower and Hansen)who have completed six months with the Company, and have not been granted ESOP underany other scheme. In effect, the scheme reaches over 9,400 employees in 21 countriesacross five continents.
