IMMEDIATE ATTENTION - ALERT ON FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES

               This is to bring to the notice of public at large that a person or a company, by the name of Mr. Sunny
Mangalani has created/published a fraudulent and unauthorized Post/Advertisement for the alleged sale of red and silver copper wires in the name of Suzlon Energy Limited.
               
               It has come to our attention that the said Mr. Sunny Mangalani, with the help of the Advertisement on the Facebook page namely “Scrap Bazaar” is attempting to defraud public at large, mostly local businessmen, by falsely claiming that Suzlon Energy Limited intends to sell red and silver copper wires, from its Rotor Blade Unit located in Dhule, Maharashtra. The fraudster has inserted pictures of the said Unit of Suzlon in the advertisement to make it appear genuine.

               This is to alert and caution the public at large that Suzlon Energy Limited, including its affiliates, has no relation or knowledge of this Advertisement on the Facebook page “Scrap Bazaar” and we disassociate ourselves from any activities undertaken by Mr. Sunny Mangalani or any other person or company which claims to sell red and silver copper wires or any other raw material on Facebook or any of the social media platforms.
               We are in process of taking appropriate legal action for these fraudulent and illegal activities and we remain committed to protect the interest of our shareholders.

               For any communication with Suzlon Energy Limited, please visit the official website www.suzlon.com or call on 020-67022000.
