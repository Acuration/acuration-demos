            Building value, creating wealth
         

            The Suzlon Group is one of the leading renewable energy solutions providers, Suzlon is emerging as the ‘foremost flag-bearer’ of the green energy sector.
         

            The Union Government of India has accorded top priority to the generation of renewable energy, and this has led to a favourable policy environment at the centre as well as at the state-level. Suzlon, as a leader in the sector, is perfectly poised to tap the huge potential for new business – and create immense shareholder value.
         

            Globally too, there is an aggressive thrust to reduce the carbon footprint and make the switch to clean, renewable energy, which augurs well for the company for decades to come.
         

            A series of initiatives over the past couple of years, involving a restructuring of capital, exploration of new opportunities and creative innovations, has given a big boost to the performance of the company.
