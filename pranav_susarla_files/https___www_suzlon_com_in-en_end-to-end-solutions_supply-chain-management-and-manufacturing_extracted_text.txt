 Suzlon is among the most vertically integrated wind turbine makers in the world, with manufacturing capabilities for all key components of a wind turbine generator.

                            While a wind turbine consists of various components, Suzlon is one of the few players in the market that has manufacturing facilities for most components of a wind turbine. This ensures consistency and reliability of the turbine. With production facilities in India, Suzlon has the wherewithal to cater to global markets. Suzlon ensures that it has manufacturing capabilities for almost all the constituents of a wind turbine in-house like blades, nacelles, control panels, hubs, and tubular towers. The company has 4,500* MW of annual manufacturing capacity.
                             

*Suzlon has a ramp up/ramp down capacity. Capacity of 3,150 MW is for 2.1 MW WTGs. When Suzlon manufactures 3+ MW WTGs, capacity can be ramped up to 4,500 MW in phased manner.

Supply chain management


                          Suzlon’s integrated manufacturing strategy is ably supported by its efficient supply chain management processes. 
                        


                        Suzlon’s supply chain management is a robust system of independent functions working together in an interrelated process. This ensures that the process functions independently of any particular aspect of the operation. Each function complements the other and hence proves to be an advantage as timelines of service delivery are always fulfilled. There is no time lag due to delay in delivery by a particular function, which ensures profitability for the customer.
                    

                        The functions of the supply chain are either carried out in-house or outsourced to vendors. Suzlon aims at consistency in practices and quality in products, both of which are ensured through a rigorous vendor development process. 
                    

                        All vendors and subsidiaries are required to meet the quality standards, strategic goals and vision of the organisation. They are carefully screened and analysed on numerous criteria related to materials, processes, quality and environment by a dedicated unit that comprises members of senior management, among other experts.
                    







Vendors are also required and recommended to obtain industry certifications to verify their practices including:






Quality Management System standard of ISO 9001:2015 for quality and excellence in production
Occupational Health and Safety Management System standard of OHSAS 18001:2007 for maintaining a high standard of employee health and safety
 Environmental Management System standard of ISO 14001:2015 for maintaining the Suzlon promise of a minimised carbon footprint

Suzlon’s supply chain management process contributes towards helping the customers earn profits in a sustainable manner while promoting a green environment.
