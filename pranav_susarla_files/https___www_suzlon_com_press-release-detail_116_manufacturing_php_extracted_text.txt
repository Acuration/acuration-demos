We regained some of our lost momentum and beganto see results from the Groups ongoing focus on key priorities. This is reflected inthe uptick in performance at the Suzlon Wind level, and REpower continuing todeliver a respectable performance despite a very challenging marketplace.Looking at the markets, India continues to regain momentum, returning from a 50per cent drop in the last fiscal. In other key emerging as well as developed markets,for example Australia, Canada, Europe, South Africa, we continue to see positivemovement.While we expect this year to continue to be challenging, we are confident that ourmid-to-long-term outlook remains strong.Mr Kirti Vagadia, Group Head of Finance, said: On the operational front I ampleased to note that real progress has been achieved. While our financialperformance was impacted by the exceptional depreciation of the Rupee, and weincurred one-time costs related to restructuring at REpower, we achieved steadyprogress on key operating indicators.With a total focus on execution we delivered near-normal volumes, compared tohistoric performance, at the Suzlon Wind-level. However, as Q1 is also the lowestvolume quarter in a fiscal for our business, resulting in an under-absorption of fixedcosts having a negative impact on the bottom-line.It is important to note that we continue to bring down fixed costs, and therefore our break-even point. We have achieved a 31 per cent reduction in our operatingexpenses as compared to the last quarter, we continue to bring down the workingcapital-to-sales ratio to 11.4 per cent at the end of Q1, from 13.6 per cent in the lastquarter. Our non-critical asset divestment program continues to be on track.There remains a lot of work to be done but this performance gives us the confidencethat, with the continuing support of our lenders, customers, suppliers and keystakeholders, we are on the right road to business normalization.Key updates? Suzlon Wind delivered an improved performance, with 219 MW sold over thefirst quarter of FY14, a 46 per cent increase over volumes in Q1 of the lastfiscal and a full 88 per cent of total volumes achieved in FY13.

REpower completed key projects over the quarter including the 122 MWZuidlob windfarm, REpowers largest onshore project till date, and the 325MW Thornton Bank offshore windfarm. The successful completion of theThornton Bank offshore project, one of the worlds largest offshorewindfarms, underscores REpowers leadership position in the offshore space.The Company maintained its focus on cost reduction and improving efficiencythrough right-sizing, improving production efficiency, eliminating costredundancies and maximizing synergies.?
