We are confident this momentum will continue. The transition from FiT to competitive bidding has created temporary volatility in terms of volume and margins. In the long-term, all stakeholders will benefit from higher volumes. We have commissioned our next generation turbine, the S111-140 meters which will establish new performance benchmarks. Our presence across the value chain, end-to-end solutions and best-in-class services gives us a competitive edge. The future of wind energy is brighter than yesterday. Wind as a source of energy will remain cost competitive, affordable and reliable."Kirti Vagadia, Group CFO, said, "We remain focused on a profitability and sustainable volume growth. Delivering 412 MW in Q1, which is seasonally a low volume quarter, is a testament of the same. Our continued focus on cost optimization has helped us to secure a healthy bottom line and gives us operating leverage. We continue to maintain disciplined working capital level. In order to cope with the temporary uncertainties in the domestic market we have further strengthened our risk management in order to maintain our margins."Suzlon Group Q1 FY18 financial performance at a glance (consolidated):
