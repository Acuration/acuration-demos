                        Suzlon's HSE (Occupational Health, Safety and Environment) is a global initiative that establishes a
            company-wide practice of setting up and maintaining the highest HSE standards with a dedicated
            approach and organisational commitment. Suzlon's HSE initiatives are intended to keep its employees safe
            while ensuring that its customers, suppliers, and contractors are assured of their projects being completed
            as planned and with a clear focus on attaining HSE excellence.
            

                           Suzlon ceaselessly works with its employees to comply with all applicable laws and as per industry
               standards. Suzlon believes the alignment of its people, decisions, innovations, and process improvements
               will enable the organisation to overcome the process obstacles and address the dependencies to reach the
               desired state.
            

                        Suzlon's HSE initiative helps the customer be part of a project embracing environment, health, and  safety culture, which renders less regulatory hassles as all the
            regulations are followed. Furthermore, the HSE initiative ensures that the safety of the environment and
            the people working on the project is given utmost importance. Toward this objective, Suzlon has deployed
            an HSE management strategy.

            

                           All the stakeholders, including employees and customers, are assured of complete adherence to the
               industry standards and safety regulations, thus laying the foundation for a successful and accident-free
               project. The HSE management strategy works towards the attainment of the organization's vision to assure
               the complete safety of its various stakeholders without compromising on its sustainability principles.
