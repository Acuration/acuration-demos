                     To maintain the best quality standards, Suzlon has always been dedicated to Quality Management in an
                     Organisation (QMO). The QMO implements and oversees the various practices involved in meeting the

                     and Supplier Quality Management (SQM), to ensure that the quality standards are maintained at the
                     optimum levels with improved yields. This allows the organisation to maintain continuous monitoring
                     and ensure a high & sustained quality of products and services. The ultimate objective of
                     the QMO is to ensure that the activities and initiatives implemented for quality are aligned with the vision
                     of Suzlon to be a quality leader with satisfied stakeholders.
