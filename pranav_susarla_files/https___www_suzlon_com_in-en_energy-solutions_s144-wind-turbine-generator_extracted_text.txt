The S144 Advantage
Suzlon introduced the new 3 MW series to unlock unviable sites and to deliver improved energy yield suitable for all wind regimes.
          The S144 wind turbine generator is one of the largest in India, extendable up to 3.15 MW, depending on site wind conditions, available at a hub height of 140 meters going up to 160 meters by its serial launch.
          At 160 meters hub height the S144 will also be India’s tallest wind turbine. Suzlon's S144 fleet will deliver a remarkable 40-43% higher generation over Suzlon’s current model, the S120 – 2.1 MW wind turbine,
          showcasing its ability to optimize wind resources at higher altitudes and make low-wind sites viable.
