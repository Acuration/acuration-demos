Revenues from overseas sales stood atINR 1,299 crores, around 67% of total sales during the quarter. EBIDTA stood at INR 140 cr., and thecompany reported profit after tax of INR 20 cr., at the consolidated level.Order Book:The company reported a continuing strong order book position with a combined order book of 2882 MW (INR13,500 cr.), as on 23rd July 2007 - 315.20 MW (INR 1,710 cr.) in domestic orders and 2,567 MW (INR 11,790 cr.) in international orders.The quarter saw Suzlon securing some of the largest orders in till date, with a 630 MW repeatorder from Edison Mission Group in USA, and a 700 MW order from PPM Energy; the largest everfor Suzlon and in the history of the US wind energy market.Commenting on the results, Mr. Tulsi R. Tanti, Chairman and Managing Director ofSuzlon Energy Ltd., said: The quarter has been a challenging stepping-stone towards makingour Vision a reality. We registered strong volumes and revenues growth over Q1 of last year. Ithas been an eventful quarter with the successful acquisition REpower Systems AG of Germany.Capacity expansion at Suzlon and Hansen, vertical integration and R&D development have alsocontinued on track.Historically, the first quarter only forms 10-15% share of the annual revenues for Suzlon andHansen. Additionally, with the global wind industry oversold, supply chain bottlenecks were amajor challenge for the industry.Inorganic Growth: REpower-edDuring the quarter, Suzlon successfully completed the bid for REpower, a promising wind turbinemanufacturer based in Germany. Suzlon currently controls 86.5% of total voting rights throughbinding agreements with Martifer and Areva, two major shareholders of REpower, as well as ourown direct holding. The bid has valued REpower at Euro 1.34 billion (USD 1.8 billion).The acquisition will help Suzlon accelerate growth in the European market in the on-shore andoff-shore technology space. And with Suzlons vertically integrated supply chain, be able toincrease volumes at REpower while reducing input costs and improving margins.The acquisition has created a strong product portfolio to meet the needs of different geographiesand markets across the globe.The deal was financed through a mix of internal accruals and debt, including a zero coupon FCCBissue of USD 300 million.Social Commitments:Our quest towards higher levels of corporate social responsibility continues. The main thrust inthe previous quarter was to bring much needed health care and educational facilities to theunderprivileged sections of the society in different parts of rural India.We organized free medical camps attended by expert doctors from various fields wherein morethan 1,400 locals were benefited. We are also providing essential school supplies to around8,700 children through 48 schools in these areas.
