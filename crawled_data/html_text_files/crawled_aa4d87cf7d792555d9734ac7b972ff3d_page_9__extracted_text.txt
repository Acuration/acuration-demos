electric vehicles and half of the 300000 charging points carbon capture and storage sufficient storage capacity has been identified for global ccs rollout to meet climate targets but largescale co 2 capture only exists in 6 countries worldwide 5 kg of co 2 can be captured per person per year the planned pipeline of ccs facilities will double this but much greater scaleup is needed as this represents only onethousandth of the global average persons carbon footprint of 5 tonnes per year efficiency global progress on energy intensity is mixed as some countries improve efficiency while others increase consumption as their population become wealthier residential and transport changes over the last decade are mostly linked to the global recession and technological improvements rather than behavioural shift brics countries consume the most energy per  of output from industry this is linked to the composition of their industry sectors ie greater manufacturing and mining activity

and so it should be decarbonisation is crucial to keeping global warming below 2 o c and avoiding or at least mitigating potentially dire consequences for our planet its people and biodiversity however centuries of pumping out carbon dioxide co 2  from factories vehicles and power plants means its not enough just to reduce output countries must also work on co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere implemented at scale whats also known as greenhouse gas removal ggr could mean a country or facility removing more co 2 than it emits  effectively giving it negative emissions achieving this is not only advantageous to combating climate change its essential a new report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc explores 116 scenarios in which global warming is kept to 15 o c of preindustrial levels more ambitious than the paris agreements 2 o c of these scenarios 101 use negative emissions technologies nets at a scale of between 100 to 1000 gigatonnes  over the 21st century given the scale of the ambition the task of capturing enough carbon to be truly negative will need to rely on many sources here are some of the techniques technologies and innovations aiming to push the world towards negative emissions forests weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama cdr doesnt have to utilise complex tech and chemistry the planets natural carbon cycle already removes and stores huge amounts of carbon from the atmosphere  primarily through trees the worlds forests have absorbed as much as 30 of annual global humangenerated co 2 emissions over the last few decades regenerating depleted forests reforestation planting new forests afforestation and protecting and helping existing forests thrive through active management can all contribute to offsetting emissions the ipcc report estimates that reforestations and afforestation could potentially capture 05 and 36 billion tonnes of co 2 a year at a cost of usd5 to 50 390 to 39 per metric tonne there are potential drawbacks of extensive afforestation it could compete with food crops as well as reducing the reflection of heat and light back into space that arid lands currently offer to prevent global warming bioenergy with carbon capture and storage europes first beccs pilot project at drax power station biomass on its own is an important fuel source in lowering emissions from industries such as power generation on one hand its created by organic material which during its lifetime absorbs carbon from the atmosphere often enough to offset emissions from transportation and combustion on another it creates a sustainable market for forestry products encouraging landowners to responsibly manage forests which in turn can lead to growing forests and increased co 2 absorption but when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs or ccus technology it becomes a negative carbon emissions process known as beccs drax is partnering with carbon capture company ccapture in a 400000 pilot to develop ccs technology which will remove a tonne of carbon from its operations a day combined with the carbon removed by the forests supplying the biomass it could turn drax into the worlds first negative emissions power station  beyond just storing the captured carbon underground however it can be used to create a range of products  locking in and making use of the carbon for much longer the ipcc report estimates between 05 and 5 billion metric tonnes of carbon could be captured globally this way at a cost of 100 to 200 80160 per metric tonne increased blue carbon mangrove roots its not only forests of fastgrowing pines or eucalyptus that remove co 2 from the atmosphere in fact coastal vegetation such as mangroves salt marshes and sea grasses suck in and store carbon in soil at a greater rate than plants on land  the carbon stored in these waterside ecosystems is known as blue carbon human encroachment and development on coastlines has depleted these environments however efforts are underway to regenerate and expand these hyperabsorbent ecosystems turning them into carbon sinks that can remove more emissions from the atmosphere than conventional forests apple is currently throwing its financial weight behind a mangrove expansion project in colombia to try and offset its global operations boosting ocean plants productivity beyond costal mangroves the ocean is full of plants that use co 2 to photosynthesise  in fact the oceans are thought to be one of the worlds largest carbon sinks but there are some people who think we could enhance marine plants absorption abilities eelgrass bed one such approach involves injecting iron nutrients into the ocean to prompt a bloom in microscopic plants called phytoplankton which float in the upper part of the ocean absorbing the co 2 absorbed from the atmosphere when the plants eventually die they then sink trapping the absorbed carbon on the seabed an additional positive effect would be an increase in dimethyl sulphide which marine plants emit this could alter the reflectivity of clouds that absorb water from the ocean and further act to cool the earth enhanced rock weathering plants absorbing co 2 through photosynthesis is the mostcommonly known part of the carbon cycle however rocks also absorb co 2 as they weather and erode the co 2 usually reaches the rock in the form of rain which absorbs co 2 from the atmosphere as it falls it then reacts with the rocks very slowly breaking them down and forming a bicarbonate that is eventually washed into the ocean locking the carbon on the seabed the problem is it takes a long time one idea that seeks to use this natural process more effectively is to speed it up by pulverising rocks and spreading the resulting powder over a larger area to absorb more co 2 from rain and air natural rock weathering currently absorbs around 03 of global fossil fuel emissions annually but the ipcc estimates at scale it could capture 2 and 4 billion metric tons at a cost of between 50 and 200 39160 per metric ton this approach also requires extensive land use and has not been trialled at scale sequestering carbon in soil soil is another major carbon sink plants and grasses that die and rot store carbon in the soil for long periods however modern farming techniques such as intensive ploughing and fertilisation causes carbon to be released and oxidised to form co 2  adjustments in farming methods could change this and at scale make agriculture carbon neutral  straightforward techniques such as minimising soil disturbance crop rotation and grassland regeneration could sequester as much as 5 billion tonnes of carbon into the soil annually according to the ipcc at potential zero cost a challenge to this method is that once soil is saturated it cant hold any more carbon that material would also be easily released if methods are not maintained in the future increasing soil carbon with biochar a way to supercharge how much carbon soil can store is to add a substance called biochar to the earth a type of charcoal made by burning biomass  such as wood or farm waste in the absence of oxygen biochar can increase the amount of carbon locked into the soil for hundreds or thousands of years it also helps soil retain water and reduce methane and nitrogen emissions biochar has only been trialled at a small scale but the ipcc estimates that between 05 and 2 billion metric tonnes could be captured annually through this means however it predicts a cost of between 30 and 120 2394 per metric tonne additionally producing biochar at scale would require large amounts of biomass that must be sustainably sourced direct air capture co 2 is in the air all around us and so removing it from the atmosphere can effectively take place anywhere direct air capture dac or daccs proposes that the carbon capture and storage technology many power stations are now trialling can be carried out almost anywhere direct air capture of co2 by a climaworks startup kezo involving garbage incineration in switzerland swiss startup climeworks is one company attempting to make dac viable  its technology works by passing air through a surface that reacts with co 2 to form a compound but releases the remaining air the newly formed compound is then heated so the reactive chemical agent can be separated and reused the co 2 is then stored underground with gas and water where it reacts with basalt and turns to stone in less than two years the main challenge for this technique is the cost  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne  and that it requires large amounts of energy creating further demand for electricity one hundred million tonnes wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the primary challenge for negative emission technology as a whole is that so few have actually been implemented at a global scale however trials are in motion around in the world including at drax to remove emissions and help limit the effects

will gardiner a price worth paying why the treasury should maintain a higher carbon price 25 october 2018 power generation last week it was green gb week  a nationwide campaign supported by the uk government showcasing the countrys green credentials and progress in transitioning towards a low carbon world it is therefore timely that ahead of the autumn budget the energy industry should be speaking about measures such as the carbon price support mechanism which are within the power of government to help keep great britain on track in meeting its decarbonisation goals aurora energy research a leading energy research and analytics firm has produced fresh analysis that suggests that maintaining a higher carbon price is key to phasing out coal power generation and decarbonising the uk electricity sector in a timely costeffective manner  is the carbon price at risk in april 2013 hm treasury introduced the carbon price support  a tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain in part this was a response to low costs in the european emissions trading system which requires generators to buy certificates against their emissions at the time the uk government felt that these certificates were too cheap and wanted to impose a higher carbon price to drive a more modern lowcarbon energy mix this carbon price support has had a huge impact particularly on coal prior to its introduction coal represented 50 of power generation but since it has fallen to record lows 2017 saw the first day without any coal on the power system since the industrial revolution records continue to be broken throughout 2018 with coal generation falling to 1 during summer months  however 2018 has also seen prices within the emissions trading system surge prices started this year at 8tonne and now seem to be steadying at roughly 20tonne this has created uncertainty over the future of the uk carbon price support scheme many in energy from power generators to environmental campaign groups are worried that the treasury might respond to rising european prices by slashing the carbon price support in this years autumn budget which could threaten to undo the success the uk has had in decarbonising its energy mix the carbon price is needed to keep coal at bay aurora has tested the impacts of different trajectories for the carbon price going forward to 2040 and the implications are significant particularly for coal auroras analysis shows that if government maintains the current carbon price support rate of 18tonne then at current eu ets futures levels coal should come off the gb power system in 202122 by contrast the same analysis suggests that if chancellor philip hammond were to reduce the carbon price support to 7tonne then coal power stations would stay on the system until 2025 and increase generation during that time as illustrated below source aurora energy research this would make it difficult for the uk to meet its carbon targets  the uk government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with 5yearly carbon budgets cutting the carbon price support rate to 7tonne would result in 29 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide co 2  during the 4 th carbon budget period which runs from 202327 this is an increase of almost 20 on total power sector emissions  against a carbon budget that the uk is currently on track to miss  the cost of the carbon price a higher carbon price raises electricity prices slightly but the mechanics of this are complex and the rising price of electricity is somewhat offset by lower subsidy payments to low carbon generators comparing a status quo scenario to one where the carbon price support falls to 7tonne raises annual power system costs by 700 million average over 202140 which translates to roughly 9 a year on the average households electricity bill source aurora energy research decarbonisation affects not just the future of gbs power system but also its international reputation and progress in meeting climate change targets  the carbon price support has helped to make gbs power system a success story in reducing carbon emissions while keeping costs reasonable there are always tradeoffs to be made in policy but cutting the carbon price would threaten the progress great britain has made in decarbonising its energy mix making it harder to meet emissions targets download the

the aurora report report tags carbon pricing  coal  decarbonisation  energy policy beyond the bottom line  why businesses need a purpose jonathan kini ceo customers 18 october 2018 opinion electricity like so many industries today is changing at a rapid pace technology and data are transforming both the industry itself and its relationship with consumers while renewables are shifting where electricity comes from and how the system operates  in eras of transition when few have clear views of the future its crucial that businesses remain focused on their goals and values beyond just revenue to steer them through times of disruption and change this is often referred to as a companys purpose and it acts as a guiding north star for businesses in meeting challenges or opportunities in any industry draxs purpose is helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future this strong sense of purpose was one of the key factors for me personally in moving into the electricity industry we have an unprecedented chance to be a part of the zero carbon future and the purpose we share across the business is key to grasping that but for drax purpose is not just about what drives us as the largest supplier of renewable electricity to uk businesses  we are in the unique position of being able to help other companies follow their purpose and meet their own sustainable business goals why purpose pays off business today is about more than just the bottom line  there is a growing recognition in the role companies play in the lives of their employees and consumers in wider society and the wellbeing of the planet the hardnosed business people of the past might ask why does this matters how does a companys stance on social issues for example impact revenue or value to shareholders however evidence shows that businesses with a strong sense of purpose foster more engaged employees are more innovative retain more customers and even make more money and it starts with people  a sense of being a part of something bigger than yourself is a strong influence on people it attracts the best talent and enables them to deliver with passion this not only inspires a greater level of engagement in employees but drives them to go further for clients as well as fostering creativity and innovation at a time when innovation and ability to adapt to changes are more and more valued by businesses purpose unites workforces and enables companies to implement new ideas and transform themselves more quickly it was the desire for a strong guiding purpose that brought me into the electricity industry the paris climate agreement brought greenhouse gas emissions into the forefront of global thinking and the opportunity to be a part of meeting this monumental challenge and creating a netzero future still plays a strong role in what drives me every day of course sustainability is not just part of draxs purpose more people than ever around the world care deeply about our planet many believe climate change is our biggest threat as a result sustainable business is now an important part of many different types of companies purpose helping others follow their purpose drax is in a position to not only help move the uk towards much lower carbon electricity generation  but to also enable other businesses to meet their own sustainability goals an increasing number of businesses are generating their own electricity from renewable sources these socalled prosumers can also sell electricity back to the grid when they have excess power offering an opportunity for new revenue  one such business is a farm outside of solihull in the west midlands where since 2014 it has generated its own electricity from solar panels this is now the site of drax retails first power purchase agreement ppa batteries it means that rather than just selling electricity back to the grid via opus energy in real time the farm can store electricity and sell it to grid when it needs it most and the price is higher it is just one example of a commercial benefit for a business that make sustainability a part of its purpose and research by haven power found that 78 of small businesses want to use energy efficiency as a means of saving money having a purpose inspires the people who make businesses successful and gives the business direction our purpose of helping to decarbonise the uk allows us to help other businesses follow their purposes too tags decarbonisation acquisition of flexible lowcarbon and renewable uk power generation from iberdrola 16 october 2018

provider of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility increased earnings potential aligned with generation strategy and uk

acquisition the following is a summary of the principal terms of the acquisition agreement acquisition agreement parties and consideration the acquisition agreement was entered into on 16 october 2018 between drax smart generation and the seller pursuant to the acquisition agreement the seller has agreed to sell and drax smart generation has agreed to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of spgen for 702 million subject to certain customary adjustments in respect of cash debt and working capital drax group holdings limited has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of drax smart generation under the acquisition agreement scottish power uk plc has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of the seller under the acquisition agreement conditions to completion the acquisition is conditional on the approval of the acquisition by drax shareholders which is required as the acquisition constitutes a class 1 transaction under the listing rules the shareholder approval condition and the cma having indicated that it has no further questions at that stage in response to precompletion engagement by drax or the cma having provided a decision that the acquisition will not be subject to a reference under the uk merger control regime completion is currently expected to occur on 31 december 2018 assuming that the conditions are satisfied by that date termination for material reduction in available generation capacity drax smart generation has the right to terminate the acquisition agreement upon the occurrence of a material reduction in available generation capacity at any of the cruachan galloway and lanark or damhead creek facilities which subsists or is reasonably likely to subsist for a continuous period of three months the right of drax smart generation to terminate in these circumstances is subject to the sellers right to defer completion if the relevant material reduction in available generation capacity can be resolved by end of the month following the anticipated date of completion break fee a break fee of 146 million equal to 1 of draxs market capitalisation at close of business on the day before announcement is payable if the shareholder approval condition is not met save where this is as a result of a material reduction in available generation capacity as described above precompletion covenants the seller has given certain customary covenants in relation to the period between signing of the acquisition agreement and completion including to carry on the spgen business in the ordinary and usual course the seller will carry out certain reorganisation steps prior to completion pension liabilities drax smart generation has agreed to assume the accrued defined benefit pension liabilities associated with the employees of the spgen group as at the date of signing the acquisition agreement following completion the spgen group will continue to participate in the sellers group defined benefit pension scheme known as the scottishpower pension scheme spps for an interim period of 12 months unless agreed otherwise the interim period while a new pension scheme is set up by the spgen group for the benefit of its employees the new scheme at the end of the interim period the spps trustees will be requested to transfer from the spps to the new scheme an amount of liabilities and corresponding share of assets agreed between the seller and drax smart generation or failing agreement an amount determined by an independent actuary in respect of the past service liabilities relating to the spgen group employees if the amount of assets transferred to the new scheme does not match the amount agreed or independently determined there will be a trueup between the seller and drax smart generation if the spps trustees do not make any transfer to the new scheme within the period of 18 months following the interim period unless this was caused by a breach of the acquisition agreement by the seller drax smart generation has agreed to pay 16 million plus base rate interest to the seller as compensation for the spps liabilities not taken on by the new scheme sellers warranties indemnities and tax covenant the seller has provided customary warranties in the acquisition agreement the seller also has provided drax smart generation with indemnities in respect of certain specific matters including for any losses associated with the reorganisation referred to above a customary tax covenant is also provided in the acquisition agreement transitional services agreement the seller and spgen will enter into a transitional services agreement effective at completion the specific nature terms and charges relating to the services to be provided will be agreed between the seller and spgen prior to completion the seller will also provide assistance in relation to the extraction and separation of the spgen group from the systems of the seller and integration of the spgen group onto the systems of the drax group appendix 2 profit forecast profit forecast for the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 including bases and assumptions the portfolio is expected based on recent power and commodity prices to generate ebitda in a range of 90110 million profit forecast and gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs pumped storage and hydro activities represent a significant proportion of the earnings associated with the portfolio for the purpose of the profit forecast ebitda is stated before any allocation of group overheads as these will be an allocation of the existing drax group cost base which is not expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the portfolio basis of preparation the profit forecast has been compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and on the basis of the accounting policies of the drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to change the ebitda results of the portfolio it also does not reflect the impact of ifrs16 which would apply in respect of the 2019 annual report and accounts the profit forecast has been prepared with reference to unaudited 2017 financial statements based on the audited financial statements of scottish power generation limited and smw limited adjusted to exclude results of assets that do not form part of the portfolio and restated in accordance with drax accounting policies the audited financial statements of the entities forming the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2017 the unaudited management accounts of the portfolio for the nine months ending 30 september 2018 and on the basis of the projected financial performance of the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 the profit forecast is a best estimate of the ebitda that the portfolio will generate for a future period of a year in respect of assets and operations that are not yet under the control of drax accordingly the degree of uncertainty relating to the assumptions underpinning the profit forecast is inherently greater than would be the case for a profit forecast based on assets and operation under the control of drax andor which covered a shorter future period the profit forecast has been prepared as at today and will be updated in the shareholder circular the forecast cost base reflects the expectations of the drax directors of the operating regime of the portfolio under draxs ownership and the central support it will require principal assumptions the profit forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions assumptions within managements control there is no change in the composition of the portfolio there is no material change to the manner in which these assets are operated there are no material changes to the existing running costs  operating costs of the portfolio there will be no material restrictions on running each of the assets in the portfolio other than those that would be envisaged in the ordinary course no material issues with the migration of services including trading and information technology from scottish power to drax no hedges are transferred as part of the transaction transaction costs and oneoff costs associated with the integration are not included assumptions outside of managements control the acquisition of the portfolio is completed on 31 december 2018 there is no material change to existing prevailing uk macroeconomic and political conditions prior to 31 december 2019 there are no material changes in market conditions in electricity generating market and no change to the uk energy supply mix there are no material changes in legislation or regulatory requirements eg rocs capacity market grid charges impacting the operations or accounting policies of the portfolio there are no changes to recent market prices for clean spark spread power carbon and other commodities there is no material change from the historical 10year average rainfall there are no material adverse events that have a significant impact on the financial performance of any of the acquired assets including any more unplanned outages than would be expected in the ordinary course prior to completion the business will be operated in the ordinary course there are no material issues with the transitional services provided by scottish power to drax pursuant to the tsa including the migration of such services to drax there is no material change in the management or control of the drax group end tags biomass

gardiner chief executive officer drax group 1 october 2018 opinion the uk has come a long way in its efforts to decarbonise greenhouse gas emissions last year were 43 below 1990 levels  while increasing renewable electricity generation and a strengthening carbon price means the country could soon go coalfree for an entire summer  there is still however much work needed to reach the uk target of reducing emissions to 20 of 1990 levels by 2050 and meeting the paris agreements aim of keeping temperature increases below two degrees celsius as ambitious as these goals may be recent research by the energy transitions commission etc believes they can be met by 2050 with the right government policies and action from businesses to help to mitigate man made climate change all industries across all sectors must cut carbon emissions its a big challenge but a clear first step must be the decarbonisation of electricity generation this step will enable other industries to reduce their emissions in turn through electrification since 2000 we have been building our experience in decarbonising electrical generation transforming what was once western europes largest coalfired power station into the uks biggest decarbonisation project this puts us in a unique position to offer the leadership and innovation needed  across the electricity industry and other sectors  to reach a zerocarbon world electricity generation will lead decarbonisation the electrification of carbonintensive sectors such as transport and heating will only contribute to reducing overall emissions if the electricity comes from mostly low or zerocarbon sources the etcs research suggests wind and solar will be capable of providing 85 of the worlds electricity generation by 2050 when these intermittent sources are unable to generate electricity the remaining 15 will come from a combination of nuclear hydro biomass and storage including batteries pumped storage and new technologies in fact biomass alone could provide as much as half of that 15 but it is critical that this flexible renewable low carbon fuel must be sustainably sourced for the wood biomass we use at drax power station its sourcing should contribute to growing and healthy forests which will be another key part of the climate change solution will gardiner ceo drax group at drax we have a long history of finding ways to cut emissions and improve the efficiency of our own biomass pellet supply chain  from bigger ships to more efficient rail freight loading and unloading the skills and experiences gained from these efforts serve not only to decarbonise our business but will benefit other supply chainbased industries along the path to lowercarbon emissions more than this it is far from the only way we are working towards doing this from here to zerocarbon one of the biggest hopes for removing carbon from industry lies in carbon capture and storage were leading the charge on bringing this technology to the fore by running a sixmonth pilot of a bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs system which will capture a tonne of carbon every day from one of our four 600 megawatt mw biomass units capturing emissions not only further reduces the carbon intensiveness of electricity generators of all kinds but also opens new revenue streams for businesses through utilising captured carbon  for drax beccs takes us another step towards becoming a carbon negative operation  where we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit it is also an opportunity to further expand the knowledge and experience of our team and become leading experts in a field which will be essential in meeting climate change goals  alongside this our plans to repower the last of our coalfired units to highlyefficient combined cycle gas turbines ccgt and build four rapidresponse open cycle gas turbines ocgt will give the electricity system the flexibility needed to support more intermittent renewable sources  the abilities of gas plant in balancing and system services can help to complete the journey away from coal before 2025 in subsequent decades gas can play a pivotal role assisting the transition to a zerocarbon power system our retail businesses haven power and opus energy  also allow us to help companies and the public sector outside of electricity generation to reduce their carbon footprint beyond just supplying renewable electricity were also looking at ways through closer customer partnerships to help businesses leverage new technologies to use electricity more efficiently and in turn lower their costs reaching a zerocarbon future is a monumental task for electricity producers that depends on innovative thinking and new technologies we have the experience in developing transformative ideas and making them a reality  all of which will be essential in guiding us into a brighter more stable decarbonised future tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and

september 2018 opinion 10year high gas prices 1 have prompted a resurgence in coalfired power across britain  and with it a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation if coalfired electricity remains cheaper than gasfired  as analysts predict  we could see the first yearonyear rise in carbon emissions from britains power sector in six years this highlights the importance of retaining a strong carbon price if we are to ensure the successful decarbonisation of the power system is not reversed after dropping to a historic low of just 02 gw during june and july britains coal power generation doubled in august and has shot up to 2 gw during the first week of september the last time coal output was this high was during the beast from the east  when temperatures plummeted in march with these coal power stations running instead of more efficient gas plants britain is producing an extra 1000 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  every hour 2 carbon emissions from electricity generation are up 15 as a result these coal plants are not running solely because they are needed to meet peak demand but because gas prices have risen sharply and carbon prices have not kept up making coal power stations more economic to run than gasfired ones it became cheaper to generate power from coal than from gas see thick lines chart below in late august even though carbon prices now double the cost of generating electricity from coal 3 coal plants are consistently in the money at the moment meaning they can generate power profitably all day and night estimated cost of generating electricity from coal and gas in quarter 3 thick lines and the output from coal power stations in britain thin line the cost of emitting co 2 has increased sharply up 45 so far this year due to the ongoing rally in european emissions trading scheme eu ets prices rising carbon prices should make gas more economical to burn as it emits less than half the co 2 of coal however wholesale gas prices have also risen 40 since the start of the year as supplies and storage are squeezed in the run up to winter  gas prices are at a tenyear high currently 14 above their previous quarterlyaverage peak back in 2013 see chart below  these rising costs are feeding through into wholesale power prices which have risen by a third over the past year to hit 60mwh the estimated cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels over the last 20 years along with the cost of emitting co 2  britains carbon price strengthened dramatically through 201415 due to the government implementing a carbon price support scheme this caused gas to become competitive against coal for power generation leading to carbon emissions from the power sector halving  unless britains carbon price can once again make up the gap between coal and gas prices we risk rolling back some of the worldleading gains made on cleaning up our electricity system  the committee on climate change has made it clear that power is the only sector that is pulling its weight when it comes to decarbonising the uk clean electricity could power lowcarbon vehicles and heating but this opportunity will be wasted if the electricity comes from highcarbon coal so what can be done the sharp rise in gas prices hints at a lack of flexibility in the energy system britain came uncomfortably close to gas shortages in march in part due to the closure of the countrys largest gas storage site with nearly half of the electricity generated in britain coming from gas plus fivesixths of household heat diversifying into other  cleaner  energy sources would help insulate consumers and businesses from price spikes no one country has the power to determine international fuel prices several factors have come together to push up gas prices  including a lack of transmission capacity depleted stores of gas after the long hot summer and a lack of wind power increased output from gasfired stations suppliers which dont wish to be caught short after the beast from the east are also stocking up on gas any kneejerk reaction to try and lower the cost of electricity for example slashing the cost of carbon emissions may only have a shortterm impact and could easily lead to longerterm damage such as the resurgence of coal which would require further interventions in the future britain does have control over its carbon price its power stations and industry currently pay the emissions trading system price determined on the europewide market which has fluctuated wildly over the past week between 25 22 and 19 17 per tonne plus 18 per tonne in carbon price support which goes to the treasury this needs to be maintained or strengthened further to save the power system from backsliding and to show strong climate leadership on

entertaining world cup campaign put big demands on great britains beer supplies this summer but europeanwide carbon dioxide co 2  shortages put a hold on that celebratory atmosphere as word spread that a lack of bubbles could result in the country running out of beer the drinks business managed to hold out but the threat of long term co 2 shortages still lingers over the continent one possible  and surprising  solution could lie in electricity generation thanks to the capturing and storing of its carbon emissions carbon capture and storage ccs is one of the key technologies in need of development to allow nations to meet their paris agreement goals it has the potential to stop massive amounts of emissions entering the atmosphere but it also raises the question what happens to all that carbon once its captured drax recently met with the british beer  pub association to discuss using some of the carbon it plans to capture in its upcoming trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs to keep the fizz in drinks its a novel solution to a potential problem but its just one of the many emerging possibilities being developed around the world smarter sneakers carbon capture is all about reducing carbon footprints  a phrase energy company nrg interpreted quite literally by creating the shoe without a footprint  the white trainer was created to showcase the abilities of carbon capture use and storage ccus and is made of 75 material produced from captured emissions that have been turned into polymers a molecular structure similar to plastics only five pairs of the sneakers were created as part of nrgs carbon xprize competition to find uses for captured carbon however they remain symbolic of the versatility offered by captured and stored carbon and

recycled materials it uses and means upcycled carbon could soon be appearing in millions of homes around the world cleaner concrete if the shoes people walk around on can be made from captured carbon so too can the cities they walk within making concrete is a notoriously dirty process cement the main binding agent in concrete is thought to contribute to as much as 5 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions  but this could change thanks to clever use and implementation of carbon capture technology at one level ccs can be introduced to capture emissions from the manufacturing process on another the co 2 captured can be used as a raw material from which to create the concrete effectively locking in carbon and storing it for the long term teams of engineers material scientists and economists at ucla who have worked on the problem for 30 years have succeeded in creating construction materials from co 2 emissions in lab conditions using 3d printing technology now its just a matter of scaling it up to industrial usage a metal alternative carbon nanotubes are stronger than steel but lighter than aluminium which makes them a hugely useful material theyre currently used in jets sports cars and even in industrial structures but producing them can be expensive and until recently could not utilise co 2 for manufacture a team from george washington university is changing that its c2cnt technology splits captured co 2 into oxygen and carbon in a molten carbonate bath using electrolysis from here the carbon is repurposed into carbon nanotubes at a high rate and lower cost than previous methods future fuels transportation is one of the major emitters of carbon around the world so any way it can be reduced or reused in this field will be a huge positive carbon recycling company lanzatech has developed a way to do this via a process that uses anaerobic bacteria to ferment emissions into cleaner chemicals and fuels its first facility opening this year in china will
