you could encounter sheep roe deer rabbits falcons bats and impressive views of north yorkshire as well as a host of other fauna and flora what you might not realise is the hill youre standing on is entirely manmade and is largely made of ash that this might be a surprise to visitors is testament to the success of barlow mound a project which was conceived in the 1970s as a disposal solution for the leftover power station product of ash that has gone on to provide a thriving natural habitat to be enjoyed by wildlife and local residents alike whilst barlow mound has a fascinating recent history  it is by no means a thing of the past today its a unique environment that is continually managed by a passionate team and offers plenty for visitors to see the mound under construction a mound out of a molehill when drax power station was first opened in 1974 it was the largest coal power station in western europe burning around 250000 tonnes of coal a week burning that much coal resulted in a lot of pulverised fuel ash left over as a byproduct today much of the ash byproduct from burning biomass and coal at drax is sold to the building industry  but before the market for this product emerged building a mound was the thing to do the aberfan disaster happened at around the same time as construction began at drax so there was a lot of persuading people that it was the right thing to do fgd and byproducts section head andrew christian says so its an engineered mound to make sure it wont ever move there was a lot of engineering that went into it and the central electricity generating board which then ran drax were brilliant at engineering as part of the planning permission for building the mound drax proposed to turn the mound into a natural habitat supporting trees and a variety of wildlife today the mound is continually managed by a passionate drax team as well as contracted ecologists and tenant farmers to ensure the nature reserve is an environment that supports all those who call it home all of a sudden ive got a farmer explaining sheep digestion systems to me and thats obviously not my area of expertise christian says for the ecologists its a bit of a dream because not that many people go on there so theres not many landmasses like that that have got wildflower meadows grassland trees wet areas where there arent human inhabitants so things are left to naturally evolve the team of ecologists provide regular advice to drax and that advice leads to installations such as the reptile hibernacula which provides a suitable home for grass snakes  dig a hole fill it full of rocks and logs put the grass on top they love it christian says another reason the ecological advice is important is due to the selfcontained nature of the habitat  a fence around the entire site means species numbers must be closely monitored what you can see at the nature reserve there are four marked walks for visitors to enjoy that wind through the changing landscapes of the nature reserve from fentons pond and its wildlife to the moundtop viewing platform offering panoramic views of yorkshire lincolnshire and humberside drax have recently improved facilities for walkers by installing new signage a bird hide and better identification of the walks the nature reserve is also home to the yorkshire wildlife and swan rescue centre which rehabilitates up to 2000 birds a year another new addition is the new outdoor classroom next to the skylark centre the classroom is now regularly used by outdoor ted  an outdoor learning programme for primary schools in yorkshire designed and delivered by education specialist stacey howard children can enjoy the nature reserve and can take part in activities such as archery shelter building and making campfires photo steve parker photo steve parker and in december 2017 the skylark centre is hosting two special christmas wonderland events for the public this years events will see the centre transformed into an elves workshop featuring christmas traditions from around the world face painting christmas quizzes arts  crafts and marshmellow roasting around the outdoor fire pit you can see more information on the christmas wonderland events here  everyone is welcome and entry is free with charitable donations welcomed a view to the future its part of the original planning condition of barlow mound to maintain the habitat and natural resource but the maintenance of the nature reserve is also about social responsibility as christian says if you live in barlow village when you come in and walk around it its a fantastic place and its free the skylark centre and nature reserve are temporarily closed the closure is to reduce the risk to businesscritical areas of our operation we are planning to

november 2017 sustainable bioenergy forests have long been places of mystery for people its within a dark wood that virgil and then dante locate the gates to the underworld while shakespeares magical midsummer nights dream plays out in a mystical forest near athens and while fairies and portals may be the stuff of fantasy the forests that inspired them remain a source of mystery to this day here are five more things you might not know about forests the forest sector employs more than 50 million people around the world employment is one of the major driving forces of global urbanisation as waves of people in both developed and less developed countries head to cities in search of better wages and living standards but outside of cities industries still thrive  particularly forestry which officially employs 132 million people around the world  the world bank even suggests that by counting people in informal forestry employment and those who earn a living indirectly through forests timber or fuel the number of people professionally involved in forestry is closer to 54 million worldwide forestrys total contribution to global gdp is also sizeable it currently adds an impressive 120 billion directly  a number expected to grow by as much as 50 over the next 10 to 15 years even more impressive is the contribution of the wider timber and wood product sector which generates as much as 600 billion  1 of global gdp according to the world bank we will soon be able weigh the worlds forests we know forests blanket about 30 of the land on earth  but what about calculating the mass and volume of all those trees thats a different task entirely but one which could offer important insights for sustainable forestry in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch earth explorer biomass  the first satellite to carry a pband radar which is capable of penetrating the forest canopies and capturing data on the density of tree trunks and branches essentially it will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the result will be a much clearer image of the amount of biomass present around the earths different forested areas and how it is changing over time as a result of carbon dioxide co 2  absorption forests are an energy source that clean up after themselves for all the ikea furniture made from wood 50 of the worlds total wood production is still used for energy with some 24 billion people globally using it for heating cooking and electricity generation the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the annual primary energy consumption making it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand  if it is managed and used in a sustainable way as with other energy sources that are combusted wood releases co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or a sustainable system of growing forests its carbon emissions are offset by new tree plantings which absorb carbon as they grow this means the only emissions produced are those that come from transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predicts that by 2030 forestry mitigation  with the help of carbon pricing  could contribute to co 2 reductions of 02 to 138 gigatonnes a year  forests improve drinking water forests provide whats known as natural infrastructure which not only regulate water levels but also improve the quality of drinking water root systems and organic material like the leaves and twigs that make up the forest floor absorb water reducing runoff and erosion they also play a part in absorbing nutrients that are harmful to water quality the forest canopy further helps this process by releasing water vapour helping regulate rainfall and providing protection against aerial drifts of pesticides which can filter back into water systems forests can suck up a third of co 2 emissions while governments around the world look to shift to cleaner renewable energy sources and cut emissions forests have been silently tackling climate change for centuries over the past few decades the worlds forests have absorbed as much as 30 of annual global human generated co 2 emissions in fact their ability to deal with fossil fuelderived carbon emissions is even written into the paris climate agreement while natural forests can contribute massively to sequestering absorbing and storing greenhouse gases managed forests can play an even more powerful role younger trees absorb more co 2 to fuel their rapid growth compared to older trees with stored carbon reserves managed forests with regular thinning and replanting of trees ensure there are plentiful numbers of these carbonhungry young trees around the world read the original 5 things you never knew about forests here  tags forests  sustainability keeping the options open 19 october 2017 sustainable bioenergy roughly 750 million acres of the us is covered in forestland  an area nearly 12 times the size of the uk approximately twothirds of that land is working timberland producing wood used for construction and furniture in short us forestry is a massive industry enviva is the worlds largest wood pellet producer and biggest biomass supplier to drax power station  but in the context of the us forestry industry in which it operates enviva does things differently were leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices says jennifer jenkins vice president and chief sustainability officer at enviva weve created unique tracking systems and we conduct sciencebased sourcing both of which encourage sound forest stewardship specifically enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesnt protecting bottomland forests a bottomland forest is an area of lowlying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species these forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important however theyre also a part of southeastern americas working forest landscape in fact enviva sources 34 of its wood from these areas  but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest for example in some cases harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive more than that harvesting can also help keep forests as forests in the areas where we work one of the biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use  specifically to developed or agricultural land explains dr jenkins our goal is to keep forests as forests we want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use if landowners can gain a steady income from regular harvests theyre likely to keep their land as working forests however this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe any land that doesnt meet envivas set of strict criteria means enviva wont source from it  it can simply walk away the landowners on the other hand dont have that luxury isnt it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest asks dr jenkins maybe they recognize its value maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead in recognition of our responsibility we made a commitment a fund that keeps forests as forests envivas commitment was to partner with the us endowment for forestry  communities to set up the enviva forest conservation fund  a 5 million 10year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the virginianorth carolina coastal plain it works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects more recently in june 2017  the enviva forest conservation fund announced a total of 500000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as ducks unlimited  an organization which  with the grant  plans to acquire more than 6000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public wildlife management area the fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes including a strict supplier assessment process and the companys track  trace tool  a oneofakind publiclyaccessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced it is entirely transparent and is a testament to envivas commitment to sustainability and doing things differently as dr jenkins explains this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004 as a company that makes wood pellets envivas reason for being is to help lower greenhouse gas emissions an emphasis on sustainability has always been a part of envivas dna tags forests  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets longleaf pine how wood product markets help to conserve a protected species 22 september 2017 sustainable bioenergy longleaf pine forests were once a dominant ecosystem across the southern us gulf and atlantic states spanning from the east coast in virginia as far west as texas however centuries of overuse and conversion to agriculture and to faster growing pine species mean today less than 5 of the estimated 90 million acres remain restoration of the longleaf pine savanna is now underway and the careful management of both public and private forests is key to preserving this ecosystem wood product and biomass markets play an important role in this ensuring there is an economic incentive for landowners to plant highvalue longleaf pines and manage them in a way that promotes conservation an ecosystem shaped by fire the ancient abundance of longleaf pines across the southern us owes to their highly pyrophytic nature meaning they are resistant to fire this allowed the trees to survive both the naturally occurring forest fires from summer thunderstorms and those started as land management by native americans these regular fires help give the longleaf savanna its distinctive features with a limited canopy providing ample sunlight and allowing grasses and herbs to grow in the nitrogenrich soil as colonial settlements expanded across north america the long straight timber offered by the pines as well as the resin and turpentine made these forests a valuable resource longleaf pine ecosystems reached a depleted state the restoration push today americas longleaf restoration initiative alri is taking strides to restore the species the collaborative effort between public and private sector partners has set a 15year goal of increasing longleaf acreage from 34 million to 80 million acres by 2025 these ecosystems are currently home to an estimated 900 endemic plants and 29 federally listed species including the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and indigo snake restoring the environment in which the flora and fauna can flourish is not as simple as planting large numbers of longleaf pine trees conservation efforts must focus on not only the planting of the pine but also the restoration development and maintenance of the pine savanna ecosystem says kyla cheynet a forest ecologist at drax biomass this system requires predictable disturbance to maintain the open canopy and rich herbaceous vegetation the role of the wood product market these disturbances include prescribed fires and the careful harvesting of trees to ensure the landscape maintains its open canopy that allows plenty of sunlight to reach the grasses and other vegetation along the forest floor the alris 2016 report highlighted the importance of thinning and prescribed fires in conserving longleaf savanna it found that while new planting of longleaf pines declined slightly 8 from 2015 the wildlife quality plant diversity and overall health of forests improved by removing competing tree species and allowing more sunlight to enter the forest harvesting or thinning longleaf pine forests provides a small percentage of the fibre used to manufacture compressed wood pellets used at drax power station but these markets help to incentivise responsible forest management and offer a source of profit for landowners these revenuegenerating practices are crucial to ensuring the continued survival of longleaf pine forests by preventing them from being converted to agricultural land or lost to development  tags forests  sustainability how sustainable biomass crosses the atlantic to power the nation 21 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels manufactured in china  imports that ensure we have readily available access to power

accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than just a clearer view on what is happening it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening and its with this information that real differences in our future can be made tags biomass energy  forests  investors  sustainability  technology 4 amazing uses of bioenergy 5 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy bioenergy is the worlds largest renewable energy source providing 10 of the worlds primary supply  but more than just being a plentiful energy source it can and should be a sustainable one and because of this its also a focus for innovation biomass currently powers 48 of great britains electricity through its use at drax power station and smaller power plants but this isnt the only way bioenergy is being used around the world people are looking into how it can be used in new and exciting ways powering selfsufficient robots what type of bioenergy algae and microscopic animals hows it being used to power two aquatic robots with mouths stomachs and an animaltype metabolism designed at the university of bristol the 30cm rowbot is modelled on the water boatman insect the other which is smaller closer resembles a tadpole and moves with the help of its tail both are powered by microbial fuel cells  fuel cells that use the activity of bacteria to generate electricity  developed at the university of the west of england in bristol as they swim the robots swallow water containing algae and microscopic animals which is then used by their fuel cell stomachs to generate electricity and recharge the robots batteries once recharged they row or swim to a new location to look for another mouthful is there a future its hoped that within five years the rowbot will be used to help clean up oil spills and pollutants such as harmful algal bloom  there are plans to reduce the tadpole bot to 01mm so that huge shoals of them can be dispatched to work together to tackle outbreaks of pollutants purifying water whats used human waste hows it being used the omni processor  a low cost waste treatment plant funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation  does something incredible it turns sewage into fresh water and electricity it does this by heating human waste to produce water vapour which is then condensed to form water this water is passed through a purification system making it safe for human consumption best of all it does this while powering itself the solid sludge left over by the evaporated sewage is siphoned off and burnt in a steam engine to produce enough electricity to process the next batch of waste is there a future the first omni processor was manufactured by janicki bioenergy in 2013 and has been operating in dakar senegal since may 2015 a second processor which doubles the capacity of the first is currently operating in sedrowoolley washington us and is expected to be shipped to west africa during 2017 closer to home and drax power station a similar project is already underway northumbrian water was the first in the uk to use its sludge to produce renewable power but unlike the omni processor it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid resulting in a total saving in the utility companys carbon footprint of around 20 and also multimillions of pounds of savings in operating costs flying across the atlantic whats used tobacco hows it being used most tobacco is grown with a few factors in mind  taste and nicotine content being the most important but two of the 80 acres of tobacco grown at briar view farms in callands virginia us are used to grow tobacco of a very different sort this tobacco can power aeroplanes  us biofuel company tyton bioenergy systems is experimenting with varieties of tobacco dropped decades ago by traditional growers because of poor flavour or low nicotine content the lownicotine varieties need little maintenance are inexpensive to grow and flourish where other crops would fail the company is turning this tobacco into sustainable biofuel and last year filed a patent for converting oil extracted from plant biomass into jet fuel is there a future in the hope of creating a promising source of renewable fuel scientists are pioneering selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to increase tobaccos sugar and seed oil content in 2013 the us department of energy gave a 48m grant to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  in partnership with uc berkeley and the university of kentucky to research the potential of tobacco as a biofuel powering repopulation of a disaster zone whats used wood exposed to radiation by the fukushima nuclear meltdowns hows it being used last year it was announced that german energy company entrade energiesysteme ag will set up biomass power generators in the fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity using the lightly irradiated wood of the area its hoped they will help japans attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear accident entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 995 which could help japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy is there a future the prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy and solar power  tags biomass energy  investors  sustainability  technology sustainability certified 24 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy of all the changes to drax power station over the last decade perhaps the biggest is one you cant see since converting three of its six generating units from coal to run primarily on compressed wood pellets  drax has reduced those units greenhouse gas ghg emissions by over 80  and while this is a huge improvement it would mean nothing if the biomass with which those reductions are achieved isnt sustainably sourced  for this reason drax works with internationallyrecognised certification programmes that ensure suppliers manage their forests according to environmental social and economic criteria thanks to these certification programmes drax can be confident it is not only reducing ghg emissions but supporting responsible forestry from wherever wood fibre is sourced sustainability certifications the compressed wood pellets used at drax power station come from various locations around the world so drax relies on a number of different forest certification programmes the three main ones being the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council  fsc   1 and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc the programmes share a common goal of demonstrating responsible forest management but adoption rates vary by region european landowners and regulators are most familiar with the fsc and national pefc standards while north american landowners generally prefer sfi and american tree farm system also members of the pefc family in instances in which drax sources wood pellets carrying these certifications or in instances in which drax purchase pellets sourced from certified forests these certifications offer an additional degree of assurance that the pellets are sustainable over 50 of the pellets used at drax power station come from the southern usa  where sfi and american tree farm system are the most widely implemented certification programmes overall adoption levels in this region are relatively modest however the sfi offers an additional level of certification that can be implemented by woodprocuring entities such as sawmills pulp mills and pellet mills this programme is referred to as sfi fiber sourcing and to obtain it participants must demonstrate that the raw material in their supply chains come from legal and responsible sources these sources may or may not include certified forests the programme also includes requirements related to biodiversity water quality landowner outreach and use of forest management and harvesting professionals together these certification systems have long contributed to the improvement of forest management practices in a region that provides drax with a significant proportion of its pellets and since the sfi and atfs programmes are endorsed by pefc north american suppliers have a pathway for their regions sustainable forest management practices to be recognised by european stakeholders these certification programmes have been in use for many years but with recent growth in the market for wood pellets a new certification system has emerged to deal specifically with woody biomass new kid on the block the sustainable biomass program sbp was set up in 2013 as a certification system to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources but rather than replacing any previous forest certification programmes it builds on them for example sbp recognises the evidence of sustainable forest management practices gathered under these other programmes however the pefc sfi and fsc programmes do not include requirements for reporting ghg emissions a critical gap for biomass generators as they are obligated to report these emissions to european regulators sbp fills this gap by creating a framework for suppliers to report their emissions to the generators that purchase their pellets when a new entity such as a wood pellet manufacturer first seeks certification under sbp that entity is required to assess its supply base feedstock which has already been certified by another established certification programme sfi fsc   pefc or pefc approved schemes is considered sbpcompliant all other feedstock must be evaluated against sbp criteria and the wood pellet manufacturer must carry out a risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance against each of the 38 sbp indicators if during the process a specific risk is identified for example to the forest ecosystem the wood pellet manufacturer must put in place mitigation measures to manage the risk such that it can be considered to be effectively controlled or excluded these assessments are audited by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee in conducting the risk assessment the wood pellet manufacturer must consult with a range of stakeholders and provide a public summary of the assessment for transparency purposes sustainable energy for the uk counting major energy companies including dong energy eon and drax as members the sbp has quickly become an authoritative voice in the industry at the end of 2016 the sbp had 74 certificate holders across 14 countries  including draxs pellet manufacturing arm drax biomass  in mississippi and louisiana its a positive step towards providing the right level of certification for woody biomass and together with the existing forestry certifications it provides drax with the assurance that it is powering the uk using biomass from legal and sustainable sources like the fastreducing carbon dioxide emissions of britains power generation sector  its a change you cant see but one that is making a big difference read the drax principles for sustainable sourcing  1 drax power ltd fsc license code fsc  c119787 tags biomass energy  energy policy  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp forests are more powerful than you think  heres why 21 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy almost one third of the earths land mass is covered by forests thats an area of around 4 billion hectares or roughly four times the size of the us in addition to being a prominent feature across the global landscape forests also play a significant role in how we live they make the air cleaner in cities and absorb carbon from the atmosphere they provide biodiversity and habits for wildlife they also provide essential forest products such as paper building materials and wood pellets for energy to celebrate the uns international day of forests  were looking at some of the reasons why forests and wood fuel are more powerful than you might think theyre a major source of renewable energy nearly half of the worlds renewable energy comes from forests in the form of wood fuel roughly 24 billion people around the world use it for things like cooking heating and generating electricity in fact about 50 of the total global wood production is currently used for these purposes however it is critical that this resource is managed sustainably and responsibly  one of the key aims of the international day of forests is to encourage people to utilise their local forest resources sustainably to ensure it endures for future generations they can revitalise economies because wood fuel is such a widely used energy source it also supports a healthy vibrant industry roughly 900 million people work in the wood energy sector globally  more than that rural economies built on wood energy can be revitalised by modernisation which can then stimulate local business  investment can help finance better forest management which in turn leads to forest growth improvements in sustainability standards and in some cases increased employment they can help mitigate climate change the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the global annual primary energy consumption which makes it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand in a sustainable and renewable way when wood is used as fuel it releases carbon dioxide co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or sustainable system of growing forests this carbon is offset by new tree plantings the only emissions produced therefore are the ones involved in transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predict that by 2030 forestry mitigation with the help of carbon pricing could contribute to reductions of 02 to 138 gigatonnes gt co 2 a year
