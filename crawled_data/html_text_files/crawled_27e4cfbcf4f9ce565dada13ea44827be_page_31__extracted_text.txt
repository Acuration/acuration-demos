archives press release selby apprentices win top prizes at drax awards 30 october 2019 press releases kai lewis aged 18 from selby won the uniper engineering academy apprentice of the year award and max shaw 22 from gateforth near selby was named maintenance apprentice of the year year 2 kai always knew he wanted a career in engineering and growing up only a few miles from drax he was curious about how the power station which is the uks largest renewable power generator worked now having completed two years of his apprenticeship as a technical engineer he is learning more about the important role he and the other engineers play in maintaining the power station so it can continue to produce enough renewable electricity for four million households kai who attended snaith high school said changing drax from a coal plant to one that could eventually be capturing carbon whilst generating power is a huge challenge that is really exciting to be a part of being at the forefront of that kind of innovation and learning new skills on the apprenticeship programme is a great opportunity and its great to be recognised for the work ive done with this award max a selby high school graduate and third year technical apprentice hopes to further his engineering career once he completes his apprenticeship he said it means a lot to win this award  it shows that all the hard work i have put in throughout the year has paid off im enjoying my apprenticeship  every day i am learning something new lr mike maudsley max shaw and harry gration maxs passion for engineering started from

cruachan facility in the western highlands can generate flexible power within seconds during times of peak demand helping to keep the lights on for tens of thousands of households it also provides crucial system support services to the electricity grid enabling more renewables such as wind and solar to come onto the network mr wheelhouse said it was fascinating to learn more about how important this unique power station is in supporting the energy system and just how quickly it can respond to changes in demand  delivering the power needed in as little as 30 seconds this kind of flexibility and resilience helps to support the growth of renewables enabling further decarbonisation of the energy system as we strive for net zero carbon emissions in scotland by 2045 the real value the technology adds every day to our energy system is the reason why we and industry partners continue to call on uk ministers to take action to ensure that they provide the revenue certainty developers need to underpin further proposed investments in pumped storage hydro capacity in scotland lr drax ceo generation andy koss scottish energy minister paul wheelhouse overlooking the turbine hall inside cruachan power station andy koss  draxs ceo generation  said  cruachan has been providing stability to the power network since 1965 when the turbines were first installed inside the hollowedout mountain as we move to a system with more renewables the services that cruachan provides are becoming more essential im incredibly proud of the work done by the team and the role they play in driving decarbonisation and economic growth as we continue to deliver the power relied on by thousands of homes and businesses cruachan is one of four pumped storage hydro stations in the uk and has a capacity of 440 mw  enough to power more than 90000 homes during peak demand  built on the shores of loch awe in argyll and bute it was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on this scale to be built in the world  the turbine hall is located 1 km within the hollowedout mountain of ben cruachan and houses four generators  supplying a range of vital balancing and ancillary services to the grid such as frequency control spinning and operating reserves helping to maintain secure power supplies drax acquired cruachan along with hydro facilities in galloway and lanark and a
