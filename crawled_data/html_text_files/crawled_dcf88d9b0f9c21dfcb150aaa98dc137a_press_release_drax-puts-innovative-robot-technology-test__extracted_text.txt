power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station drax puts innovative robot technology to the test a robot which could transform the way the uks biggest power station manages some of its key operations is being tested 3 october 2018 hundreds of train movements each month at drax the uks biggest power station could soon be managed by the robot  reducing the time needed to checkin fuel deliveries by up to six hours each day the innovative pilot project at drax power station in north yorkshire will begin this month october within its commercial services team to see if the use of robotic process automation rpa can help manage the booking in of millions of tonnes of fuel delivered to the power station each year an average of 20 freight trains a day deliver the biomass and coal needed at drax so it can produce the power required to keep the lights on for around six million households predominantly a biomass power generator more than 70 of the electricity produced by drax is renewable with the majority of rail deliveries bringing wood pellets into the power station to supply its four biomass generating units the process of booking in each rail delivery requires the use of eight separate systems and involves 167 individual steps for one staff member to complete the task which takes them between four and seven hours to complete depending on the number of deliveries the team believes that the use of a purposebuilt digital robot which will handle the processes automatically could deliver the same result in just 40 minutes people would then be required to intervene when the robot identifies anomalies and further investigation or more detailed work is required they believe the time needed for manual intervention would be cut from up to seven hours per day to just one  giving individuals six hours back each day to focus on other more rewarding and engaging tasks andy koss drax power ceo said were constantly looking for new ways to improve our operations to increase efficiency and make staff roles as fulfilling as possible if we can use this robot technology to free up time and allow people to put their skills and expertise to good use so theyre not getting bogged down in the admin we all love to hate then i think well see all sorts of benefits both in terms of efficiencies but also in levels of staff motivation innovation is at the heart of our business  we were pioneers in transforming the uks largest coalfired power station to become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and are exploring the use of bioenergy carbon capture and storage to help us deliver negative emissions and tackle climate change the use of rpa is another example of how were using new technologies to deliver our strategy beth clifford commercial services supervisor who will be trialling the robot said potentially this could massively reduce the more mundane and tedious parts of my job having more time to focus on other tasks will hopefully mean i feel like im adding more value will enjoy my job more and can also take on new work which will be more interesting i cant wait to see how this goes and my colleagues are the same vicky harris commercial service centre manager who is leading the pilot project said well be measuring how effective the trial is and whether it delivers the savings we expect before a final decision is made about rolling it out but were confident this is going to be a really positive development and we will be scoping out other processes at the power station which we think would also benefit from this kind of automation the pilot project using rpa to bookin draxs rail deliveries will run for up to a month rpa is a form of automation using a software robot that mimics human actions  such as mouse clicks on a computer but does not engage in any decisionmaking or the kinds of thought processes associated with artificial intelligence ai which is the simulation of human intelligence by machines ends media contacts ali lewis drax group interim head of media  pr e email protected t 07712 670 888 mark duffell mcd communications e email protected t 01484 968 238 07969 080 272 editors notes two thirds of drax power station now runs on biomass producing enough renewable power for around four million households it has plans to repower its remaining two coal generating units to develop high efficiency combined cycle gas turbines ccgts with battery storage if successful it could stop using coal as early as 2023 well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline for getting coal off the power system drax uses around 75 million tonnes of biomass each year the majority of which comes from north america and europe its uk biomass supply chain runs from coast to coast  tyne hull immingham and liverpool  with an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day over a sixday working week each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the uk with enough electricity for a year using rail saves approximately 270000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 3262250 tonnes of c0 2 per year about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax power ltd which operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe haven power  based in ipswich supplies electricity to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses drax biomass  is based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests supplying fuel used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more information visit wwwdraxcomuk share name email comment sign
