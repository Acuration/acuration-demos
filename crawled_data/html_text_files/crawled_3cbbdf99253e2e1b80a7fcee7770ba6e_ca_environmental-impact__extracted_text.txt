contamination event to establish root causes and learn the appropriate lessons which we then share across the business group environment policy environmental management systems during 2022 the environmental management of our generation assets in the uk was certified to iso 140012015 and these assets continue to be subject to regular external verification environmental performance environmental performance data is available in our esg data supplement esg data supplement 2022 emissions to air drax power station is required to comply with uk laws and regulations which limit emissions to atmosphere new standards came into effect in august 2021 under the industrial emissions directive and large combustion plant best available techniques reference document bref which sets limits for emissions 2022 was the first year of operation under the annual emission limits for biomass our operations in the us and canada which manufacture biomass pellets are also subject to laws and regulations which limit emissions to atmosphere and set requirements on the level of selfmonitoring and reporting which is required to be undertaken water use the use of water is subject to strict criteria compliance with written procedures and also uk us and canadian laws that compliance is overseen internally by the hse teams and externally by the local regulatory agencies drax power station uses water for operational and cooling processes the volumes of which are shown in the table above a primary use for the water at drax power station is when it is heated to produce steam at very high pressure which is used to power the turbines that generate the electricity of the water used a proportion is emitted as water vapour through our cooling towers the remainder is recycled and discharged under permit to the local river in line with our permit requirements procedures are in place to manage water system efficiency and usage  ensuring we meet all discharge consent limits compared to 2021 our total water abstracted for generation decreased from 64140878m3 to 51899818m3  once again this was related to the operational position ie mw produced for 2022 in 2022 we diverted 3389452345 m3 of water from river systems to run through our plants before being redirected back into the river for hydro generation at the galloway and lanark hydro scheme at cruachan power station our pumped storage facility we generate electricity by allowing water to fall from cruachan dam down through four turbines which generate electricity at times of demand for power from business and consumers the water flows through the turbines before being directed into loch awe at times when demand from business and consumers falls there is excess power on the grid we use the excess power to pump water from loch awe into the upper reservoir at cruachan dam we closelymonitor the arrangements for the cycling of this water and report to sepa as required related stories sustainable bioenergy ensuring british
