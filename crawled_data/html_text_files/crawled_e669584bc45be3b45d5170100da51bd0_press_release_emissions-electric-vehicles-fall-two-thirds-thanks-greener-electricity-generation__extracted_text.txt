thanks to greener electricity generation 17 august 2017 as more renewables replace coal on the power system  the electricity we use is getting cleaner making electric cars and suvs better than ever for lowering our carbon emissions the latest electric insights report produced by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax analysed electricity generation data from april to june this year it showed that the power produced during this quarter contained 199g of co 2 per kwh  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year dr iain staffell from imperial college london explained it is widely accepted that electric cars dramatically reduce air pollution in cities but there is still some debate about how clean they actually are  it varies depending on where the electricity to charge them with comes from according to our analysis looking at a few of the most popular models  they werent as green as you might think up until quite recently but now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk they are much better for example producing the electricity to charge a tesla model s back in 2012 would have created 124g of carbon per km driven nowadays emissions from charging the same car have halved to 74g per km driven in winter and just 41g per km in summer  thanks to the decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk smaller electric cars like the nissan leaf and bmw i3 can be charged for less than half the co 2 of the cleanest nonelectric car on the market  the toyota prius hybrid in the uk there are now more than 100000 electric vehicles on the roads  pure electric and plugin hybrid numbers have grown 30fold in four years representing 18 of new car registrations the following table shows the change in carbon intensity of electricity for some of the most popular models of electric vehicle make and model winter 201213 winter 201617 summer 2017 tesla model s 124gkm 74gkm 41gkm nissan leaf 97gkm 58gkm 32gkm mitsubishi outlander phev 87gkm 52gkm 29gkm bmw i3 81gkm 48gkm 27gkm for context a 2l range rover evoque emits 125gkm and a toyota prius emits 70gkm based on data from the governments vehicle certification agency at the same time as electric car numbers are increasing britains electricity has been decarbonising andy koss drax power ceo said its very exciting to see from this analysis by dr staffell and the team at imperial how we at drax are contributing to helping the uk to decarbonise our biomass generating units deliver carbon savings of 68 compared to gas power stations and more than 80 compared to when they used coal biomass is cost effective reliable and flexible  this is important not just in terms of reducing emissions in the energy sector but also the far reaching impacts this can have in transforming other sectors like the automotive and rail industries the need for more flexible renewable power generation is a real example of the challenges dieter helms review for beis must address since upgrading half of the power station at drax to sustainable biomass more than two thirds of the power produced is renewable in the first half of this year drax produced 17 of the uks renewable electricity  enough for four million households electric insights is published once a quarter and is supported by an interactive website  wwwelectricinsightscouk  which provides live data from 2009 until the present the data sources and methodology used in electric insights are listed in full on the website commissioned by drax group owner and operator of the uks largest power station and europes biggest biomassfuelled power plant the report is delivered independently by dr iain staffell from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the full report can be read here  pdf here  ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media relations e email protected t 01757 612165 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 01757 612848 editors notes the calculation to determine the carbon emissions from electric vehicles relies on a number of variables including the time of day or night a vehicle is charged and which power stations increase their output to meet additional demand electric insights has illustrated how these emissions have changed recently by assuming that vehicle charging is spread evenly across the day and uses the average electricity mix during each period the average electricity consumption was averaged across five variants of tesla model s which achieve over a 300 mile driving range  75d  90d  100d  p90d  p100d  these average 322 miles per kwh this was converted to 0194 kwh per km driven the data was taken from the vehicle certification agency direct co 2 emissions are listed as 0 gkm emissions from electricity production were taken from electric insights averaging all halfhourly periods in march 2012 the carbon intensity of production was 569gkwh we assume 75 of electricity is lost in transmission and distribution and 4 in charging the electric vehicle the carbon intensity of electricity consumed was 641gkwh 641 x 0194  1244gkm co 2  fuel economy listed for a 2016 model year toyota prius active 8 with 15 wheels ecvt 941 mpg 70 gkm co 2  other model variants have different fuel economy and carbon emissions the disclaimer from the vehicle certification agency applies to the data used the carbon intensity data for the mitsubishi is for when that suv is driven in electriconly mode not when driven in hybrid mode this edition of electric insights also found reduced carbon intensity is the new norm for britains power system it averaged 199gkwh  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year this is down from 740gkwh in the 1980s and 500gkwh in the 2000s there are seasonal variations in the carbon intensity of the uks electricity generation  more power generation is required to meet higher demand in the darker colder winter months than the summer when there is more power available from low carbon weatherdependent renewables like solar in the second quarter of this year weatherdependent renewables like solar and wind continued to grow with solar breaking a number of records during the period including supplying 25 of demand on april 8 and producing 891gw on may 26 over the quarter solar produced 4twh of electricity  12 above the previous maximum set in 2015 there is a move towards a decentralised power system as 10 of junes electricity did not use the national grid small renewables particularly solar make up a growing portion of the supply and are embedded into local distribution networks rather than connected to highvoltage transmission system the rise of solar has given rise to the proportion of generation which is bypassing the grid reaching its highest ever level in june  more than 25 of demand was met by embedded generation for 41 hours over the quarter primarily on sunny weekend afternoons having more intermittent renewables on the system is also having an impact on prices prices spike when wind and solar output drops and other generators are needed to plug those gaps the analysis by the team at imperial college london found that balancing market prices leapt from around 40 per mwh up to as high as 1500 on may 17 when solar and wind output fell sharply about electric insights electric insights quarterly was commissioned by drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the report analyses raw data that are made publicly available by national grid and elexon which run the electricity and balancing market respectively released four times a year it will focus on supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them along with dr iain staffell the team from imperial included professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributed expertise in energy policy the work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry the q2 2017 report has an additional coauthor dr jonathan scurlock national farmers union and the open university the quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website electricinsightscouk which provides live data from 2009 until the present it was designed by the economist groups independent
