power station york pupils ride into first place in 10000 schools stem challenge 14 july 2017 an idea to generate renewable electricity for use in a york school while also establishing zero carbon transport between its two sites has won first place in a regional competition sponsored by drax power with a total prize fund of 10000 the project reinvent challenge invited pupils across yorkshire aged 1119 to use their learning and knowledge in stem subjects science technology engineering and maths to develop a workable idea to help improve life in their community a team of five year 7 pupils from all saints school in york impressed judges with their entry dynamo which plans to create a free cycle hub providing 40 bikes for teachers pupils and visitors to travel the half mile between the schools two campuses each bike will be fitted with a bottle dynamo which allows energy generated from cycling to be stored the dynamos are then hooked up to transfer the stored energy to batteries which will be connected into the schools electricity distribution network drax awarded the winning idea 6000 to help it get started with the remaining prize fund being split between the runners up all saints teacher sarah bilton said this is a fantastic achievement were very proud of our pupils and the hard work thought and determination they have shown she added this challenge really got pupils thinking and was a great opportunity to help their understanding of enterprise and investigate ecofriendly ways to benefit the community lots of people drive between the sites or of course have to walk this will simplify and speed up getting from one side of the school to the other and in a way thats better for the environment it will be useful to the whole school community i cant think why someone hadnt thought of this before drax visitor centre manager and member of the judging panel rachael baldwin said all four finalists presented well thought out creative ideas but the dynamo team really impressed us with the technical thinking behind their project as well as coming up with an idea that would benefit their school and local community the team was presented with a trophy by andy koss drax power ceo he said its been tremendously rewarding to see young people harness their imagination and stem learning to find new ways to support their local communities the diverse range of ideas we have seen and presented by the competition finalists shows there is plenty of innovation within schools and colleges across yorkshire we hope this will inspire these students to pursue careers using stem subjects the runnersup were barlby high school near selby with their idea for a learning garden based around science nidderdale high school in pateley bridge with designs for 3 peaks a new climbing wall and scarborough university technical college with its life skills centre to support stem knowledge in adult learning the project reinvent challenge was supported by the north yorkshire business and education partnership nybep a social enterprise based in york that specialises in engaging employers with education to help young people prepare for the workplace ends media
