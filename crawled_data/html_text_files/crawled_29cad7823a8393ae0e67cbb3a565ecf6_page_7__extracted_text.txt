technology bitcoins electricity consumption problem 2 march 2018 electrification bitcoin is having a breakout year its price fluctuations are making headlines all over the world and major investment banks are finally beginning to take it seriously  in short bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency  its becoming a major player but for all the advantages it and other decentralised currencies offer such as lowtransaction fees and no intermediaries  theres a fundamental problem at their core they use an extraordinary amount of electricity according to bitcoin analysis site digiconomist  the bitcoin network now uses more than 52 terawatt hours twh every year  more than the whole of portugal ireland or peru if this rate of growth continues its forecast that by july 2019 it is expected to use more electricity than the us  so while bitcoin may be heralded as a saviour from the monopolies of big banks what does its incredible appetite for electricity spell for the worlds power networks why does bitcoin use so much electricity bitcoin might be an entirely digital currency but it still needs to be created and this requires a process called bitcoin mining bitcoin is a decentralised network meaning transactions are carried out directly between parties without any central authority instead bitcoin securely records all its transactions through a network made up of thousands of users computers bitcoin mining is essentially the process of recording and adding these transactions to the public network or ledger  known as the blockchain every 10 minutes each pending bitcoin transaction is converted into a complex mathematical problem that needs to be solved this is where the mining computers come in which use highpowered processing hardware to tackle the mathematical equations and solve each transaction the first miner to successfully crack one of these problems adds that bitcoin transaction to the ledger and is rewarded with an amount of newly mined bitcoins  currently set at 125 bitcoins btc worth roughly 140000 this process isnt a quick one and relies on large numbers of highpowered computers to solve the problems one of the largest bitcoin mining rigs in the world  in ordos inner mongolia  is made up of eight buildings crammed with 25000 machines  all cranking through calculations 24 hours a day unsurprisingly this huge amount of processing power uses a lot of electricity it also requires a huge amount of space and generates a lot of heat all of which have sent bitcoin miners around the world in search of cheap electricity plentiful space and cold weather the search for cheap tech power iceland and sweden have become popular destinations for bitcoin mining thanks to its climate which keeps computer equipment from overheating and plentiful electricity  in fact in iceland mining is set to reach 840 gigawatt hours gwh this year  more than the 700 gwh used by the countrys households icelands high level of geothermal and hydroelectric power means these mining operations have a low environmental impact however the same cant be said of the largest bitcoin miner in the world china while it has an abundance of hydropower and an increasing renewable capacity a large amount of chinas electricity still comes from coal  72 of its total generation came from the fossil fuel in 2015  this raises concerns around the environmental impact of bitcoins increasing electricity needs digiconomist estimates the emissions of just one largescale coalpowered bitcoin mining operation eg the operation in ordos could fall between 2440 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per hour  roughly the same as flying a full boeing 747400 for the same period however not everyone is convinced the network is as energy intensive as reports suggest  and part of the challenge is that  despite knowing how many bitcoins are in existence  theres no precise way of knowing how much mining is going on what is known however is that even as cryptocurrency prices fluctuate mining is increasing  in short bitcoins incredible appetite for electricity isnt going anywhere soon but could it get cleaner moving towards cleaner mining some companies are tackling the problem of making bitcoin more sustainable by bringing it off grid and linking it directly to cleaner sources of power much like how tech companies are striking deals with local renewable suppliers when locating data centres  hydrominer  for example is placing mining hardware directly into hydropower stations while harvest aims to use dedicated wind turbines to power mining which takes pressure off national grids and their electricity sources however a more fundamental change could be possible making the protocol used to create bitcoins less energyintensive ethereum arguably the main rival cryptocurrency to bitcoin this year switched from proofofworkbased mining to proofofstake  this means coin creation is not depended on highpowered computers cranking through calculations but instead through owners validating their stake in the cryptocurrency and voting on block creation  another alternative is chia network which harnesses unused hard drive storage space for blockchain verification chia farmers for offering storage space for the network both have significant ground to cover to catch the market leader however so the more pressing question remains whats next for bitcoin and what will happen as the number of available bitcoins decreases the future of bitcoin like gold there are a limited number of bitcoins that can ever be mined  21 million to be precise this means the reward for bitcoin mining halves roughly every four years as they become more abundant the next drop is scheduled for 2020 when the reward will slide to 625 btc but this doesnt mean theyre getting easier to mine in fact it is growing increasingly difficult and this means more computer power and a need for even more electricity which in turn means higher overheads a report from jp morgan estimates the price of mining a single bitcoin has grown tenfold in the last year to 3920  a change that could send miners in search of cheaper utilities more than this the added stress on grids could lead to a growth in dirtier and cheaper fossil fuels which can generate and power mining operations around the clock this could mean that as mining becomes more difficult and rewards drop it will be controlled by fewer largerscale operators which can absorb the spiraling costs either way its expected they will be forced to reduce their electricity consumption or at least the cost of it to remain economical as the rewards they earn cover less of their expenses ultimately however if cryptocurrency is set to play a positive role in our future it must become less electricity intensive and work with evolving energy systems to be as sustainable and progressive for the environment as it could be for the global economy tags technology  investors the history of the pylon 16 february 2018 electrification pylons are one of the most recognisable and perhaps divisive symbols of great britains electricity system there are plenty who decry these metal giants as blotches strung across the countrys green and pleasant landscape but time has turned the 1930s designs of great britains pylons into something of a modernist classic even beloved by some  what pylons symbolise however is more than just the modernisation of the country in the first half of the 20 th century they also represent the promise of safe and reliable electricity for all there are now more than 90000 pylons across great britain and while the energy system continues to evolve pylons have changed little since they first went up outside edinburgh in the 1920s miesbach to munich the first successful attempt to transmit electricity over long distances using overhead wires took place in 1882 german engineer oskar von miller and his french colleague marcel deprez successfully transmitted 25 kilowatts of electricity 57km along a telegraph line the simple iron line transmitted a 200 volt current from a steam enginepowered generator near miesbach to the glass palace of munich where it was used to power the motor for an artificial waterfall the line failed a few days later and even though it may be a world away from todays 800000 volt ultrahigh voltage transmission lines this first trial laid the foundation for the way we move energy today egypt to edinburgh jump to 1928 and there was something new arising on edinburghs horizon the first grid tower was erected here on july 14 th as part of the recently established central electricity boards ambitious project to create a national gridiron  connecting 122 of great britains most efficient power stations to consumers was a mission that required 4000 miles of cables mostly overhead sir reginald blomfield was called in to tackle this grand challenge blomfield adopted a design submitted by the american firm milliken brothers for the grid towers that would crisscross the country a staunch antimodernist  as he made clear in modernismus his attack on modern architecture  blomfield looked to ancient egypt to name his steel towers in egyptology a pylon is a gateway with two monumental towers either side of it  these represented two hills between which the sun rose and set with rituals to the sun god ra often carried out on the structures it was an epic name to match the grand ambitions of creating a national grid by september 1933 the last of the initial 26000 pylons that made up the national grid were installed  less than a third of the 90000 that make up the system today the grid was now ready to operate on time and on budget around the world to underground as the energy system continues to evolve great britains pylons are changing too in 2015 the national grid unveiled a new danishdesigned pylon that shifts away from the classic industrial tower to a tframed skilift style model designed to minimise the visual impact of the pylons on the landscape another approach also being adopted is burying cables underground the process of digging tracts and burying cables for thousands of miles could cost as much as 500 million but could help preserve areas of natural beauty while ensuring the whole country has access to the safe and reliable electricity it has come to expect as with all change these announcements have caused a surge in nostalgia for the pylon remembered from childhood car journeys across the country around the globe electricity pylons are now ubiquitous and are being pushed to new technological limits in 1993 greenland became home to the longest stretch of overhead powerline between pylons in the ameralik span  while chinas zhoushan island overhead powerline tie set the record for the worlds tallest pylons in 2010 with two 370meter towers despite the advancements its notable how little these structures have changed from the those first installed around the world the proposed humanoid sculptures of icelandic architecture firm choishine bare a resemblance to the original skeletal towers of the 30s and it shows just how successful those original pylons have been at delivering muchneeded electricity to homes and businesses around the country tags technology  national grid what will electricity look like in 2035 14 february 2018 electrification the year is 2035 cars cruise clean streets without the need for a driver our household appliances are all connected and communicate with one another and all of it is powered by electricity  specifically lowcarbon electricity its been 10 years since great britains last coal power station shut down and across the country wind turbines are generating more electricity than fossil fuels and nuclear energy combined pushing carbon emissions to a new low this isnt a vision of a greenminded scifi novel this is the forecast for great britain in less than 20 years time this sustainable lowcarbon future of 2035 is a significant evolution from today in 2018 and it comes despite a rising population a continued shift to urban living and an expected rise in power demand great britain gets power hungry if we transport back to the here and now of the late 2010s it would be easy to expect electricity demand to drop by 2035 in fact since 2005 electricity demand has been on a steady decline as a result of more efficient appliances and the decline of heavy industry by the mid2020s however this trend is expected to reverse but with the likelihood that appliances will grow more efficient and no sign of heavy industry coming back to british shores what will drive this growing demand two of the major contributors will be the electrification of transport and the heating system with the government setting 2040 as the end date for the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles  preparations are already underway for a fully electrified transport network  but it wont just be restricted to roads train networks and even potentially planes could switch from fossil fuels to electric increasing demand from the transport sector by 128 between 2015 and 2035 electric vehicles evs alone are predicted to add 25 terawatt hours twh of electricity demand by 2035 according to a report by bloomberg new energy finance  however this will be dependent on significant investment in the necessary charging infrastructure to enable a decarbonised transport network across the country added to this will be extra demand from a shift in how we heat our homes if planning goes ahead and pilot projects are completed lowcarbon electric heating is expected to begin rolling out in the next decade and will involve the phasing out of gas boilers in favour of electric heat pumps but as with ev adoption this will require major government investment and incentives to grow electric heating beyond the 7 of uk homes that use it today  an electrified heat network will add a greater strain on the electricity system particularly in winter months when demand is high the result is a forecast increase of 40 gw in demand during peak times  the mornings and the evenings these peak times for electricity consumption will be the greatest test for the grid as intermittent renewables meet more and more of the countrys demand it raises the question how we will cope with cold still and dark november evenings one solution is the growing role of large scale electricity storage  by 2035 technological advances are expected to bring electricity storage to 8 gw of installed capacity  double the size of drax the uks biggest power station it is also likely that the abilities of evs as electricity suppliers delivering excess electricity back to the grid once plugged in overnight will play an increasing role in meeting demand but to ensure this is possible it will require advances in another sector with a great impact on our power system technology this is not just about how technology could enable advances but how much electricity its likely to use the internet of everything and a smarter grid by 2035 chip manufacturer arm predicts there will be more than one trillion internet of things iot devices globally this smart technology will be able to turn everything from your morning coffee maker to your bed into intelligent machines gathering masses of data that can be used to optimise and personalise daily life powering all these devices let alone the vast plains of servers holding all the data they gather is one of the great challenges for the iot industry  however as much as smart devices will demand energy they will also help save it thanks to smart connected devices traffic lights will turn off when there are no cars offices will turn off lights when there is no one in a room and homes will understand your energy needs better and tailor appliance usage to your habits at a larger scale the introduction of artificial intelligence will allow the entire grid to connect and work in harmony with every one of the billions of devices taking energy from it a fullyintelligent system like this will allow grid operators to smooth out peaks in demand by for example charging evs overnight when there is less demand it means that while there will be an overall greater demand for electricity in 2035 the shape of demand may differ from the accentuated peaks of the current system renewable reaction to demand at its heart the increasing electrification of our transport utilities and technology has been driven by a few specific goals one of which is lowering our reliance on fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions  its positive then that all projections towards 2035 have us making significant strides towards this vision coal will have been completely removed from the electricity system  while gas generation will drop to just 708 twh  down from the 1122 twh expected in 2018 according to bloombergs forecast  in its place wind will become the greatest source of our electricity producing 1385 twh in 2035 up from 523 twh in 2018 the watershed year for wind power will come in 2027 when wind first overtakes gas to become the biggest contributor to the grid thanks to significant increases in capacity nuclear will still play an important role in the energy mix contributing 458 twh while solar will more than double in generation from 12 twh in 2018 to 25 twh in 2035  the same amount of power produced by all of californias solar panels in 2016  the results of this continued move to lower carbon sources will be significant carbon emissions from electricity in 2035 are expected to be 2381 gco 2 mj grammes of carbon dioxide per megajoule  less than half what is expected in 2018 and while there will be many major changes in the electricity system over the next 17 years it is this that is perhaps the most important and optimistic tags technology  investors 5 incredible numbers from the worlds largest biomass port 26 january 2018 sustainable bioenergy since its origins the port of immingham has held close links with the uks rail and energy networks it was the humber commercial railway and dock company along with the great central railway that first established the dock completing it in 1912 to serve its primary purpose of exporting the most important fuel of the time coal today immingham is the uks largest port by tonnage  and while these transport connections endure theyve changed with the times the port is now connected to modern rail infrastructure and helps run a renewable energy system immingham is one of a number of uk ports that receives shipments of wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity at drax power station in yorkshire with 20000 tonnes of wood pellets arriving at drax every day here are the numbers that tell the story of how the port of immingham keeps more biomass coming in than any other in the world  135 million revamping for renewables the port began to get serious about renewable energy in 2013 when an investment of around 135m kickstarted the creation of the immingham renewable fuels terminal  the largest biomass handling facility in the world developed by the associated british ports as part of a 15year deal with drax the revamp of the former coal port saw an update of its unloading storage rail and road facilities to make it biomassready getting those 60000 tonnes of biomass pellets from ship to train to drax requires tight supply chain systems designed especially for this task 2300 tonnes of biomass unloaded every hour a key component of immingham is its continuous ship unloaders replacing the ports grab cranes in 2013 these two structures use a combination of suction and an archimedes screw to discharge 2300 tonnes of biomass an hour from docking ships the continuous unloaders are bespoke for immingham and designed to keep operating at a constant rate as the humbers tide rises and falls biomass is drawn up through the unloaders to a conveyer that then takes it all the way from the jetty to one of the ports eight silos 120 olympicsized swimming pools of storage unlike coal which can be stored in the open air biomass must be kept dry  immingham stores wood pellets in eight silos each capable of holding 25000 tonnes of biomass with the port doubling its storage space from four silos in early 2016 the sites total capacity now comes in at 336000m 3  the equivalent of more than 120 olympicsized swimming pools  here the biomass can be stored for any time between a couple of days and a couple of months depending on draxs demand 72 trains heading to britains biggest power station every week the next leg of the journey for the wood pellets sees them moved along the conveyer to board draxs specifically designed trains  imminghams rail facilities and draxs train wagons were developed to automate the loading process for maximum efficiency trains slow down to half a mile per hour as they enter the loading bay where sensors and magnets open the hatch doors of the wagons and close them when theyre full the automation of this process allows a 25wagon train to be filled in just 37 minutes in total 12 trains can pass through each day meaning the port can send 72 trains to drax every week with each hoppers full load at 716 tonnes of compressed wood pellets each train can carry between 1700 and 1800 tonnes it takes the total biomass reaching the power station from immingham to a maximum of 130000 tonnes each week 400 million added to the local economy draxs contribution to the yorkshire and humber region includes 3650 jobs and a 4192 million economic impact  this is primarily the result of the impact made by drax power station to the region however its support of other businesses along its supply chains means its economic contribution is felt far beyond its selby site in 2016 drax indirectly supported 1800 jobs in yorkshire and the humber region at facilities such as immingham its indirect economic contribution came to 117 million as the regions biomass industry became increasingly important find out about another major uk port that has been transformed thanks to renewable energy how does biomass get shipped to the uk read the story of one of the us ports sending wood pellets to uk shores tags technology  supply chain  ships and shipping how electricity is made 25 january 2018 power generation every morning we take electricity as a given we switch on lights charge phones and boil kettles without thinking about where this power comes from the electronic devices and appliances that make up our daily routines are not particularly energy intensive boiling a kettle only uses 93 watts toasting for three minutes only requires 60 watts while cooking in a microwave for five minutes takes 100 watts however when people are waking up and making breakfast in almost 30 million households around the uk those small amounts soon create a significant demand for electricity on a typical winters morning  this combined demand spikes to more than 45 gigawatts gw  so this is what it takes to power your breakfast  from the everyday toaster in your kitchen backwards through thousands of miles of cables to the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of machinery in wind farms hydroelectric dams and at power stations such as drax where electricity generation begins the grid the journey starts in the home where all our electricity usage is tracked by meters these are becoming increasingly smart  displaying near realtime information on energy consumption in financial terms and allowing more accurate billing there are already 77 million smart meters installed around the uk but that number is set to triple this year  paving the way for a smarter grid overall what brings electricity into homes is perhaps the most visible part of the energy system on the uks landscape the transmission system is made up of almost 4500 miles of overhead electricity lines nearly 90000 pylons and 342 substations all bringing electricity from power stations into our homes  making sure all this happens safely and as efficiently as possible falls to the uks nine regional electricity networks and national grid regional networks ensure all the equipment is in place and properly maintained to bring electricity safely across the country while national grid is tasked with making sure demand for electricity is met and that the entire grid remains balanced  the station cools down one of the most distinctive symbols of power generation cooling towers carry out an important task on a massive scale water plays a crucial role in electricity generation but before it can be safely returned to the environment it must be cooled water enters cooling towers at around 40 degrees celsius and is cooled by air naturally pulled into the structure by its unique shape this means those plumes exiting from the top of the towers are rather than any form of pollution only water vapour and this accounts for just 2 of the water pumped into the towers drax counts 12 cooling towers each 114 metres tall  enough to hold the statue of liberty with room to spare once the water is cooled it is safe to reenter the nearby river ouse the stations birdseye view the control room is the nerve centre of drax power station from here technicians have a view into every stage of the power generation process the entire system controls roughly 100000 signals from across the power stations six generating units  water cooling air compressors and more while once this area was made up of analogue dials and controls it has recently been updated and modernised to include digital interfaces display screens and workstations specially designed by drax to enable operators to monitor and adjust activity around the plant the heart of power generation at the epicentre of electricity generation is draxs six turbines  these heavyduty pieces of equipment do the major work involved in generating electricity highpressure steam drive the blades which rotates the turbine at 3000 revolutions per minute rpm this in turn spins the generator where energy is converted into the electricity that will eventually make it into our homes these are rugged pieces of kit operating in extreme conditions of 165 bar of pressure and temperatures of 565 degrees celsius each of the six turbine shaft lines weighs 300 tonnes and is capable of exporting over 600 megawatts mw into the grid one of the most important parts of the entire process turbines are carefully maintained to ensure maximum efficiency even a slight percentage increase in performance can translate into millions of pounds in savings  turning fuel to fire to create the steam needed to spin turbines at 3000 rpm drax needs to heat up vast amounts of water quickly and this takes a lot of heat the power stations furnaces swirl with clouds of the burning fuel to heat the boiler biomass is injected into the furnace in the form of a finely ground powder this gives the solid fuel the properties of a gas enabling it to ignite quickly additional air is pumped into the boiler to drive further combustion and optimise the fuels performance pulveriser how do you turn hundreds of tonnes of biomass pellets into a powder every day thats the task the pulveriser take on in each of the power plants 60 mills 10 steel and nickel balls each weighing 12 tonnes  operate in extreme conditions to crush crunch and pulverise fuel these metal balls rotate 37 times a minute at roughly 3 mph exerting 80 tonnes of pressure crushing all fuel in their path air is then blasted in at 190 degrees celsius to dry the crushed fuel and blow it into the boiler at a rate of 40 tonnes per hour the journey begins biomass arrives biomass arrives at drax by the trainload roughly 14 arrive every day at the power station delivering up to 20000 tonnes ready to be used as fuel these trains arrive from ports in liverpool tyne immingham and hull and are specially designed to maximise the efficiency of the entire delivery process  allowing a full train to unload in 40 minutes without stopping the biomass is then taken to be stored inside draxs four huge storage domes  each capable of fitting the albert hall inside the domes can hold 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets between them here the biomass waits until its needed at which point it makes its way along a conveyor belt to the pulveriser and the process of generating the electricity that powers your breakfast begins tags technology  cooling tower  turbines  electricity generation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services the wooden buildings of the future 22 january 2018 sustainable bioenergy when we think of modern cities and the buildings within them we often think of the materials theyre constructed from  we think of the concrete jungle since the 19 th century steel glass and concrete enabled the building of bigger and more elaborate buildings in rapidlygrowing cities and those materials quickly came to define the structures themselves but today that could be changing new technologies and building techniques mean wood a material humans have used in construction for millennia is making a comeback and reducing the carbon footprint of our buildings too return of the treehouse civilisation has been building structures from wood for longer than you may realise the 32metre tall pagoda of horyuji temple in japan was built using wood felled in 594 and still stands today the sakyumuni pagoda of fogong temple in china is nearly twice as tall with a height of 67 metres it was built in 1056 today wood is once again finding favour the 30metre tall wood innovation and design centre of the university of british columbia unbc in canada was completed in october 2014 and is among the first of this new generation of wooden buildings and theyre only getting bigger this year the completion of the 84metre 24storey hoho tower in vienna will make it the tallest wooden building in the world but this will be far surpassed if plans for the oakwood tower in london are approved designed by a private architecture firm and researchers from the university of cambridge the proposed building will be 300metres tall if construction goes ahead making it londons second tallest structure after the shard and it would be made of wood falling back in love with wood wood construction fell out of favour in the 19 th century when materials like steel and concrete became more readily available but new developments in timber manufacturing are changing this researchers in graz austria discovered that by gluing strips of wood with their grains at right angles to each other the relative weakness of each piece of wood is compensated the result is a wood product known as crosslaminated timber clt which is tougher than steel for its weight but is much lighter and can be machined into extremely precise shapes think of it as the plywood of the future allowing construction workers to build bigger quicker and lighter glued laminated timber commonly known as glulam is another technology technique enabling greater use of wood in more complex construction manufactured by bonding highstrength timbers with waterproof adhesives glulam can also be shaped into curves and arches  pushing woods usage beyond straight planks and beam these dense timbers dont ignite easily either they are designed to act more like logs than kindling and feature an outer layer that is purposefully designed to char when exposed to flame which in turn insulates the inner wood susceptibility to mould insect and water damage is indeed a concern of anyone building with wood but as the centuriesold pagodas in japan and china demonstrate care for wood properly and theres no real limit to how long you can make it last so wood is sturdy but so is steel  why change green giant construction with concrete and steel produces an enormous carbon footprint concrete production on its own accounts for 5 of all our carbon emissions but building with wood can change that unbcs innovation and design centre saved 400 tonnes of carbon by using wood instead of concrete and steel on top of that building with wood freezes the carbon captured by the trees as they grow when trees die naturally in the forest they decompose and release the carbon they have absorbed during growth back in the atmosphere but wood felled and used to construct a building has captured that carbon for as long as it stands in place a city of wooden buildings could be a considerable carbon sink this can have further ripple effects the more timber is required for construction the more it increases the market for wood and the responsiblymanaged forests that material comes from and the more forests that are planted and managed with proper governance the more carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere  according to research from yale university a worldwide switch to timber construction would on its own cut the building industrys carbon emissions by 31  granted that will be a difficult task but if even a fraction of that can be achieved it could mean a future of timber buildings and greener cities tags engineering

electricpowered articulated lorry  the semi with governments around the world setting ambitious plans to ban the sale of petrolanddieselonly cars  the introduction of electricpowered utility vehicles  like teslas truck  in a range of industries will be essential to a truly decarbonised transport system disrupting trucking teslas heavy goods vehicle hgv highlights the growing capabilities of electric vehicles evs to deliver more than just short urban journeys it claims its semi will be able to travel 500 miles on a single charge enough to get you from london to edinburgh comfortably and tow 40 tonnes of cargo tesla isnt the only player with electric big rig concepts  los angelesbased thor trucks  daimler and volkswagen have unveiled their own  but its ambitious 2019 production target makes it a more immediate possibility than any other in the space despite media coverage claiming the semis megacharging capability breaks the laws of physics  big business is taking a sunny view of elon musks latest innovation walmart which has been taking strides to reduce its emissions has already preordered 15 of the semis  delivery firm ups has used small electric trucks in major cities for some years already  it has placed the largest order so far for 125  electrifying emergency response in the world of emergency services quick response is vital evs then which have fast acceleration and are quick off the mark are ideal candidates to deliver  especially as battery technology becomes more reliable and durable health services in nottingham have already been trialling electricpowered fast response vehicles while in japan nissan has unveiled an allelectric ambulance that carries a lithiumion auxiliary battery to power medical equipment on board this onboard power supply is a further advantage of evs and one not just restricted to emergency services electric pickup truck maker havelaar for example offers power outlets on its bison vehicle for electric tools the future of battery farming out in the countryside evs are making waves in farming john deere has unveiled plans for fully electric tractors claiming they require less maintenance and have a longer lifecycle than combustion engines  with more than a third of uk farms generating their own power from solar wind and even anaerobic digestion using farm byproducts theres potential for farmers to charge tractors renewably and cut their fuel and charging costs more than just helping cut emissions and costs there can also be performance benefits given their acceleration abilities electric tractors are well suited to heavy pulling without revving up engines and churning up ground joining hgvs and tractors in their ability to apply almost instant torque to heavy industrial jobs are edumper trucks the komatsu quarry truck weighs in at almost 45 tonnes and claims to be the biggest ev in the world the economic advantage of electrification air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are the main driving force behind many antifossil fuel regulations however research suggests decarbonising transport systems also have economic advantages for businesses a report by financial services firm hitachi capital found that switching vans and heavy goods vehicles hgvs to electric or other alternative fuels could save british businesses as much as 14 billion a year it claims evs run at 13p cheaper per mile than dieselfuelled vans while hgvs are reported to be 38p cheaper that adds up to total savings of 137 billion a year if all britains commercial vehicles were switched the move to a fully electrified transport system is already underway the number of registered electric cars increased by 280 in the uk over the past four years according to the hitachi report the chinese city of shenzhens entire fleet of 16359 buses has gone electric  a transition that began in 2009 and has been assisted by an 80 drop in the cost of a lithiumion battery pack according to bloomberg new energy finance  chinas need for electric bus batteries is almost on a par to that of all global ev battery demand china could be said to be driving the market evs are undoubtedly cleaner when it comes to roadside pollution however the exponential increase in evs will only benefit the fight against man made climate change if countries entire energy systems continue to decarbonise  emissionsfree vehicles will need to be powered predominantly by low carbon electricity for a more electric future to be a sustainable one tags technology  investors  electric vehicles evs refurbishing a 300tonne generator core within the heart of a power station 6 december 2017 power generation at the centre of drax power station in a corner of the cavernous turbine hall is a white box the inside of this box is spotlessly clean not only are its white walls free of dirt they are free of even dust but there is one outlier inside this sterile environment a 300tonne chunk of industrial equipment this equipment is a generator core  the central component for converting the mechanical energy to electrical power the core is driven by the steam turbine ninety tonnes of generator rotor spinning at 3000 rpm with just millimetres of clearance from the core produce 660 megawatts mw of electricity thats enough  645 mw when exported from drax into the national grid  to power a city the size of sheffield the generator is a serious piece of industrial machinery and despite the pristine conditions this white box is the site of serious engineering a process normally done by largescale manufacturers in dedicated factories rewinding a generator core  as the process is called  is a major operation no other uk facility is capable of doing this complex job so its here in a white box in the middle of an operational power station in north yorkshire that a team of engineers is undertaking work that will secure the generators use for decades this is the drax rewinding facility how a generator works a generator consists of two main components a spinning rotor and a stationary stator the rotor which is directly connected to the main turbine and spins 50 times every second sits inside the stator both the stator and the rotor contain a large number of copper coils known as windings these windings are what carry the electrical current the rotor acts like a very strong electromagnet which when a voltage is applied produces a strong magnetic field because the rotor sits inside the stator this magnetic field intersects the copper windings of the stator and induces a voltage in these windings allowing current to flow this voltage is then brought out of the stator and passed through a stepup transformer where it is increased to a level suitable for transmission through the national grid the stator core is made from many elements with hundreds of thousands of laminations 84 watercooled insulated copper bars each 11 metres long and weighing 200kg forming the windings various insulating materials blocks packing wedges and condition monitoring equipment generator stators can operate for decades without fault diy at drax in 2016 a team of engineers at drax embarked on a project to construct a facility to rewind the stator on site this required crosscompany collaborative working to design and construct this huge purpose built facility contamination can cause operational problems so the team built a sterile white room within the turbine hall  one of just two places within the power station with foundations strong enough to support the incredible 450 tonnes required for the rewind facility designed to hold the stator core and the conductor bars air is forced out of the room to limit the possibility of contamination to the core during the rewind when the unit is in service it becomes magnetic so any metallic particles left in the space will be attracted to the core explains drax electrical engineer thomas walker once magnetised any metal particles could be drawn in burrowing into the insulation and core lamination this is the kind of event that an electricity generator wants to avoid  but when it happens be prepared to fix it roll with it when draxs stators were manufactured in the 1980s completing their construction relied on manual handling techniques modern day facilities however rotate the core to minimise human contact it took just six months for a partnership involving drax siemens and enser to manufacture what could be the largest stator rollers in the world and within that time ship them from the us to north yorkshire with the rollers installed the next step was to move in the core two of the turbine halls cranes each capable of lifting 150 tonnes were combined to lift it hoisting the core onto the mechanical roller within the rewind facility once in place the roller rotates the core allowing for the copper conductor bars to be safely removed and inserted despite this mechanical help the removing and replacing of each one is still at its heart a human job we still need 10 men to physically move the conductor bars with lifting aids which makes it not an easy process says walker using this method the bars weighing 200kg each can be safely and precisely fitted into the core opting for inhouse rewinding a stator is a complex process however when the time logistics and costs of shipping the core to siemens  the germanbased manufacturers  was factored in the decision to do the work at drax power station was an easy one  a 300tonne core is not easy to transport and the highways agency do not like things like that on the roads theyd want us to use waterways says drax lead engineer mark rowbottom logistically it just wasnt worth it its too much money to move and ship that weight to germany so we looked at what we could do onsite more than just an economical and logistical decision and with the uks diminishing manufacturing facilities drax is now equipped to support generator rewinds for many years to come building and operating the rewind facility was a project that leveraged the engineering abilities of drax employees they are increasingly doing engineering traditionally outsourced to equipment manufacturers the experience we have gained and the close working relationship we have established with siemens enables us to support the generator for the remaining life of the station says rowbottom to see the core in that many pieces and stripped down to this level is very rare says walker who began working at the plant as an apprentice  of the 84 conductor bars half have been fitted and the team is scheduled to complete the stator rewind in early 2018 i never thought id do anything like this but am proud to say that ive done it tags drax power station  technology  engineering  investors the uks secret economic juggernaut the north 29 september 2017 sustainable business the north of england is home to some 15 million people this makes up almost a quarter of the uks total population and includes a mesh of proud local identities compared to the rest of the uk however there is a persistent gap in gva gross value added per capita and productivity performance  analysis by the treasury claimed that if the norths economy grew as quickly as the uk average to 2030 its economic output would be 37 billion higher in real terms  theres huge potential in north but it needs the right support to unlock it the northern powerhouse partnership is a businessled organisation aiming to do just that in a new report powerhouse 2050 transforming the north  it explores four areas of the economy originally identified in the northern powerhouse independent economic review  where the north has the potential to be a world leader within the next 33 years given the right cooperation between business university and government investment these four sectors could create 850000 more jobs and contribute an extra 100 billion to the uk economy by 2050 new extra large press starts production at nissan sunderland via nissan europe newsroom advanced manufacturing and materials the north has a strong history in manufacturing from traditional steel production in sheffield to shipbuilding in hull the region is currently home to several car manufacturing plants including vauxhall jaguar land rover and nissan building on this pedigree the norths real strengths lie in its ability to improve processes and productivity as well as the development of new products two key areas where it could be a world leader heading into 2050 are new lightweight and 2d materials as well as highprecision engineering close connections between research institutions and manufacturing industries will help provide businesses in the region with access to cutting edge technology and the highlyskilled workforce needed to operate it siemens and drax engineers worked together to upgrade turbines at drax power station the fiveyear 100m project was completed in 2012  find out more  energy the north has a long history of powering the uk and today still generates 41 of englands electricity building on this strength in the field the region has the potential to evolve into a world leader in the modern lowcarbon energy sector through the repurposing of existing infrastructure such as drax power stations transition from coal to biomass fuel  the north is uniquely placed to deliver the uks energy needs said drax power ceo andy koss there are huge opportunities for us as a region  not just in terms of potential jobs and the economic benefits  but also the positive environmental impacts associated with decarbonisation electricity generation storage and low carbon technologies including nuclear offshore wind and bioenergy are already well established in the north however there are also opportunities to reuse existing infrastructure such as greening the gas grid in leeds by converting it to low carbon hydrogen digital the digital and tech sectors are often seen as a major driver for wellpaid jobs that can drive national productivity and the wider economy and while london remains the central hub for venture capital funding and highprofile startups a report by tech nation found almost 70 of total investment in tech went to companies outside the capital in 2016 this includes 78 million raised by manchester tech businesses and 61 million invested in sheffield companies in fact the wider digital sector from adtech to fintech now employs 168671 people across city clusters in the north  this is a strong base from which to grow the regions tech and digital scene which will be supported by initiatives such as the 400 million northern powerhouse investment fund and the 30 million for the regions new national innovation centre for data health innovation the north has longestablished strengths in fields such as life sciences medical technologies and devices these include pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing hubs across the region what makes the uk unique in the health innovation space is its ability to leverage the national health service as an asset for research innovation and in developing new models of healthcare delivery  and the north is no different this collaboration can allow companies and institutions in the field to sit at the forefront of implementing and developing treatments medicines and devices for the 21 st century the future of health innovation will be closely connected to tech fields of big data and ai and these along with other types of research will require close collaboration between businesses the nhs and the regions universities within the relatively small uk the north may still be a small part often eclipsed by the countrys capital but as the report shows there is not only huge potential yet to be realised but a strong history on which to build tags technology  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter to receive a regular
