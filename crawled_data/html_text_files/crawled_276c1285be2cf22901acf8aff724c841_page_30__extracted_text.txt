contract to keep electricity system stable 29 january 2020 press releases national grid has awarded synchronous compensation contract to draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station the contract is to provide system services to keep the national grid stable the contract means drax will provide services such as inertia which keeps the system stable and reactive power which helps move power around the grid for the next six years andy koss ceo generation drax at cruachan power station click to viewdownload in high res system services such as inertia and reactive power were readily available in the past due to the number of large spinning power stations on the electricity system but the rise of nonsynchronous generators such as solar wind and interconnectors mean these services are now more important and have to be procured separately  andy koss ceo drax generation said provision of these crucial services is central to draxs purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future our strategic aim is to be a leading provider of system services which support the deployment of more renewable power  it could also help to bring us a step closer to our ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 this is the first tender national grid eso has run under phase one of its system stability pathfinder under the terms of the provisional contract one of the four turbines at the 440mw cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in argyll and bute will no longer generate power instead the turbine will only be used to provide the services needed to support the system national grid currently plans further stability tenders to take place both nationally and regionally which provide an opportunity to secure further contracts for some of draxs other power generation assets notes to editors national grid esos system stability pathfinder tender is separate to the capacity market auctions starting tomorrow and units are able to take part in both processes provided they are available to provide the contracted services inertia is a system support service which acts like a shock absorber helping to control changes in frequency to ensure the grid maintains a frequency of 50hz without having enough inertia available to reduce the rate of frequency changes which occur on the system the grid is more vulnerable to power cuts national grid made an

this could be done sustainably using lowgrade wood from the working forests we already source from which have a large surplus of this material draxs new biomass policy paves the way for worldleading sustainability standard 24 january 2020 press releases an independent advisory board iab led by former uk government chief scientific adviser sir john beddington was appointed by drax in october when it published a strengthened sourcing policy to ensure the biomass it uses to produce 12 of britains renewable electricity meets the highest sustainability standards in its first report the iab has found that draxs sustainable biomass sourcing reflects the recommendations made by forest research  the research agency of the forestry commission which is widely considered to be the industry gold standard drax group ceo will gardiner said the work of the iab is vital in guiding and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be i am reassured to know that our existing policies reflect the forestry commissions recommendations and well continue to work with the board to strive for greater excellence across our operations we recently announced our ambition to become the worlds first carbon negative company by using sustainable biomass with carbon capture and storage technology to achieve this we need to go further in our efforts to lead the world on biomass sustainability standards positively contributing to our climate the environment and the communities in which we operate the iab also recommended consideration is given to a review of existing evidence on sustainable biomass to advance understanding among academics policy makers and environmental groups such a restatement of evidence would be aimed at fostering agreement amongst scientists and environmental groups on the role of sustainable biomass sharing information with third parties on draxs operations and using scientific evidence to identify points of agreement disagreement and areas which need further study the iabs chair john beddington said its a complex area to navigate and if some common ground based on the scientific evidence can be agreed it creates a framework to help ensure the right types of biomass are used which make the greatest contribution towards addressing the climate emergency the uks committee on climate change has said that biomass will play a critical role in achieving the uks 2050 net zero target the iab which meets twice a year will produce a written report of its conclusions and recommendations for drax after its meetings and a summary of these

over loch awe ben cruachan is one of many munros that spend much of the winter blanketed in snow cruachan is unlike any other scottish mountain however on its slopes lies a dam which stores water in a reservoir that is then transported into a power station built inside the hollowedout centre of the mountain to generate power by spinning turbines on a few occasions the snowfall has been so extreme that weve been unable to access the dam for a few weeks at a time says gordon pirie a civil engineer at cruachan thankfully we have enough controls in place where we are still able to monitor and operate things remotely when there is excess power on grid the turbines reverse and use it to pump water from loch awe up to the reservoir in this way it is storing the excess electricity in the form of water  like a battery  and holding it in the top reservoir ready to be used by the power station when demand for power increases built on the shores of loch awe in argyll and bute in the mid1960s cruachan was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on its scale to be built in the world and is still one of only four power stations in the whole of the uk that can operate in this way making it a vital component of britains generation network the power station is very responsive and able to react quickly to changes on the system  it can achieve full load 440mw in just 30 seconds and can operate continuously at full output for around 15 hours if necessary thanks to scotlands wet weather 70 million cubic metres of water flowed into cruachans reservoir from surface water from the mountainside melting snow and rainfall in 2018 thats enough to fill 28000 olympicsized swimming pools this water is collected and delivered through a complex series of aqueducts which stretch for some 14km and brings water from 75 intakes across the mountain the intakes range from pipes no larger than small street drains to some large enough for a jeep to drive through keeping these aqueducts in working order so melt water from snow can continue to flow into the reservoir is one of piries main tasks even in freezing conditions the water will still flow through the aqueduct system the intakes have a builtin feature which allows the water to flow into them even if the surface is frozen solid he explains any snow or frost on the ground eventually thaws and makes its way to the reservoir cruachan shows that with a bit of ingenuity and determination scotlands dreich weather neednt be a negative the rain and snow which fall across the highlands helps produce renewable electricity that powers our homes and moves us closer to a netzero future the hollow mountain shows that every cloud really does have a silver lining image captions click to viewdownload top image a

on the drax website  drax acquired cruachan power station at the end of 2018 when it bought a portfolio of flexible renewable and lowcarbon power stations located across scotland and england since then the visitor centre has been renovated and drax has also introduced free school tours during term time as part of the companys efforts to boost stem science technology engineering and maths skills 50000 people visit cruachan power station each year and take guided tours inside the subterranean world of the power station where they can see the machine hall and learn about its history and the feat of engineering required to build it cruachan is one of four pumped hydro storage stations in the uk and has a capacity of 440 mw  enough to power more than 880000 homes during peak demand the turbine hall is located 1 km within the hollowedout mountain of ben cruachan and houses four generators supplying a range of vital balancing and ancillary services to the grid such as frequency control spinning and operating reserves helping to maintain secure power supplies draxs scottish operations include hydro facilities in galloway and lanark and a biomassfromwaste plant at daldowie near glasgow along with cruachan all of which were acquired at the end of last year about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2900strong employees operate

station  hydroelectric power trafford college visits europes biggest carbon saving project 10 january 2020 press releases the group of 23 students aged between 18 and 25 visited drax power station near selby in north yorkshire which has upgraded two thirds of its generating capacity to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal this has transformed the plant to become the uks largest renewable power generator  producing enough electricity for four million homes  and europes biggest decarbonisation project it has also paved the way for drax to pioneer groundbreaking bio energy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology if beccs can be used across all four of its biomass generating units drax could become the worlds first negative emissions power station helping it to make an even greater contribution towards tackling the climate emergency students were taken on a full tour of the site including the innovative beccs pilot plant which is capturing a tonne of co2 each day the 427metre turbine hall that houses the six huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity they also enjoyed a closeup view of the uks first wood pellet storage domes each large enough to fit the royal albert hall inside and the 12 cooling towers which at 115 metres high are taller than the statue of liberty drax groups head of business sustainability vicky bullivant said by providing tours at drax power station we want to further students understanding of how electricity is produced and hopefully fire their imaginations and inspire them to study stem subjects by showing them some of the pioneering technologies were trying like beccs which could play a vital role in addressing the climate crisis during the tour pupils learnt how renewable electricity is generated and discovered how sustainable compressed wood pellets have enabled drax to reduce its carbon emissions by more than 80 compared to when those generating units used coal bertin speaks from trafford college who organised the visit said the students had a great day at drax learning about how the electricity system works and where our electricity is generated visits like this are so valuable because seeing the power station and the scale of the operations is impossible to replicate in a classroom  it really brings the subject to life drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the engineers of the future by encouraging greater interest in stem science technology engineering and maths subjects last year it invested 35000 in the greenpower initiative involving seven local schools and colleges in building and racing electric vehicles the trafford college students are among over 12000 visitors to drax every year tours are free to all primary and secondary schools and can be tailored to suit the area of the curriculum teachers are interested in for further information on school tours at drax visit the website at wwwdraxcomuk  image caption
