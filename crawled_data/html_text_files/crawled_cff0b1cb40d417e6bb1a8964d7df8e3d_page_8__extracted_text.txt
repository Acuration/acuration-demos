decarbonisation climate change is the biggest challenge of our time will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 28 july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has

closer to being fossilfree iain staffell imperial college london 23 july 2019 opinion electricity generation is decarbonising faster in britain than anywhere else in the world 1 changes to the way we produce power over the last six years have reduced carbon emissions by 100 million tonnes per year 2 the carbon savings made in britains power sector are equivalent to having taken every single car and van off our roads 3 this puts britain at the forefront of the wider trend towards clean electricity coal generation is collapsing in germany  having fallen 20 in the last year due to rising carbon prices renewables have beaten fossil fuels as the largest source of generation in europe  a third of americas coal power stations have retired over the last decade as they switch to cleaner natural gas britains coal power stations made international headlines in may for sitting completely idle for two full weeks but coal is only part of the story the second quarter of 2019 saw three major milestones that signal britains progress towards a clean power system the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh across a whole day for the first time renewables hit an alltime high supplying more than half of britains electricity over a full day and for the first time ever less than a tenth of electricity was produced from fossil fuels going below 100 grams 100 grams of co 2 per kwh is an important number two years ago the committee on climate change recommended it as the target for 2030 that would mean our electricity system is in line with the national commitment to decarbonise britains electricity has dipped below 100 grams for single hours at a time but until now it had never done so for a full day june 30 th was a sunny sunday with a good breeze that brought a 33c heatwave to an end electricity demand was among the lowest seen all year while wind output was at a threemonth high the carbon intensity of electricity sat below 100 gkwh for half of the day falling to a minimum of just 73 gkwh in the midafternoon carbon emissions averaged over the day were 97 gkwh beating the previous record of 104 gkwh set a year ago fig 1  britains generation mix during june 30th that delivered electricity for less than 100g of carbon per kwh click to viewdownload going above 50 renewables june 30 th was a recordbreaker in a second way wind solar biomass and hydro supplied 55 of electricity demand over the day  smashing the previous daily record of 49 set last summer for the first day in the national grids history more electricity came from renewables than any other source that day britains wind farms produced twice as much electricity as all fossil fuels combined a quarter of the countrys electricity demand was met by onshore wind farms and 15 from offshore 4 despite several reactors being offline for maintenance nuclear power provided nearly a fifth of electricity again more than was supplied by all fossil fuels heading towards fossilfree electricity the rise of renewable energy has been a major factor in decarbonising britains electricity complemented by the incredible fall in coal generation every single coal plant in britain has sat idle for at least two days a week since the start of spring it has been three years since britains first zerocoal hour a year later came the first full day and earlier this year we saw the longest coalfree run in history  lasting 18 days this summer could see the first full month of no coal output if this trend continues fig 2  number of hours per week with zero generation from britains coal power stations click to viewdownload attention must now shift from zero coal to fossil free unabated natural gas without carbon capture and storage needs to be removed from the grid mix by 2050 to tackle the climate crisis and ensure the uk hits netzero emissions across the whole economy at the start of this decade britains power system had never operated with less than half of electricity coming from fossil fuels as renewables were rolled out across the country the share of fossil fuels has fallen dramatically by 2014 the grid was able to operate with less than onethird from fossil fuels and by 2016 it had gone below onefifth on may 26 th  the share of fossil fuels in britains electricity fell below 10 for the first time ever fig 3  the record minimum share of fossil fuels in britains electricity mix over the last decade with projections of the current trend to 2025 click to viewdownload this record could have gone further though during the afternoon 600 mw of wind power was shed  enough to power half a million homes national grid had to turn off a tenth of scotlands wind farms to keep the system stable and secure this wind power had to be replaced by gas biomass and hydro plants elsewhere in the country as these were located closer to demand centres and could be fully controlled at short notice this turndown coincides with ten straight hours where power prices were zero or negative going down to a minimum of 71mwh in the afternoon national grids bill for balancing the system that day alone came to 66m if the power system could have coped with all the renewable energy being generated fossil fuels would have been pushed down to just 8 of the generation mix this highlights the challenges that national grid face in their ambition to run a zero carbon power system by 2025  and the tangible benefits that could already be realised today if the trend of the last decade continues britain could be on course for its first fossilfree hour as early as 2023 this will only be possible if the technical issues around voltage and inertia at times of high wind output can be tackled with new lowcarbon technologies other countries are grappling with questions about whether renewables can be relied on to replace coal and gas britain is proof that renewables can achieve things that werent imaginable just a decade ago zero carbon electricity is  the job that cant wait  britain only has a few more years to wait before the first fossilfree hours become a reality 1 over the last decade the carbon intensity of electricity generation in britain has fallen faster than in any other major economy source energy revolution global outlook  2 in the 12 months to july 2019 carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation totalled 605 million tonnes

fired and the challenge is underway the government has officially set 2050 as the target year in which the uk will achieve carbon neutrality  theres no denying this economywide transformation will need a great deal of investment reaching net zero carbon emissions will require an evolutionary overhaul of not just great britains electricity system but the uk economy as a whole and indeed the way we live our lives and go about our business but that doesnt mean its out of reach instead it will fall to technologies such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus as well as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to make it economical and possible the secret to making decarbonisation affordable the uks committee on climate change ccc estimates the price of decarbonisation will cost as little as 1 of forecast gdp per annum in 2050 however the business energy and industrial strategy beis select committee inquiry found that failure to deploy ccus and beccs technology could double the cost to 2 there are a number of reasons for this such as the cost to jobs productivity and living standards of shutting down industrial emitters ccuss ability to contribute to a hydrogen economy can help avoid this moreover the ccc claims even with industries striving to decarbonise rapidly as much as 100 megatonnes of hardtoabate carbon dioxide co 2  is expected to remain in the uk economy by 2050 this makes carbon negative techniques and technologies  such as beccs  which uses woody biomass that has absorbed carbon in its lifetime as forests  alongside direct air capture dac the boosting of ocean plant productivity much greater tree planting and better sequestration of carbon in soil essential if the uk is to attain true carbon neutrality the importance of beccs and ccus in the zero carbon future is clear now is the time for rapid development not in 2030 not in 2040 but today in 2019 and into the 2020s but doing this requires the government to move beyond its historic policies that have failed to support the technology in the past progress needs longterm frameworks that provide private sector investors with the certainty they need to kickstart the commercialscale deployment of ccus technologies laying down the tracks to negative emissions for carbon capture to become an integrated part of the energy system it must deliver value well beyond the energy sector establishing markets for products developed from captured carbon will play a role here but to set the wheels in motion financial frameworks are needed that can allow beccs and ccus to thrive one device that can allow the market to develop ccus is the creation of contracts for difference cfds for carbon capture these currently exist in the lowcarbon generation space between generators and the governmentowned low carbon contracts company  lccc  through these contracts power generators are paid the difference between their cost of generating low carbon electricity known as a strike price and the price of electricity in great britains wholesale power market if the power price in the market is higher than the strike price generators pay the difference back to the lccc meaning consumers are protected from price spikes too it means that the generator is protected from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power offering the security to invest in new technology more than this cfds last many years meaning they transcend political cycles and the cost per megawatt can be reduced with a longer contract creating a market for carbon capture or negative emissions generation could offer the same security to generators to invest in the technology a cfd for beccs should not only incentivise the building of infrastructure to capture carbon but we must also recognise the valuable role that negative emissions can play by compensating beccs producers for their negative emissions it should provide a lower cost alternative to reducing all other co2 emissions to zero while still ensuring that the uk can get to net zero beyond installing carbon capture at existing generation sites one of the major financial barriers to the wider deployment of ccus and beccs is the cost and liability associated with transporting and storing captured carbon a regulated asset base rab funding model would encourage investment by gradually recovering the costs of transport and storage via a regulated return this approach is currently under consideration as a means of financing other major infrastructure projects  a rab allows businesses including investment and pension funds to invest in projects under the oversight of a government regulator in exchange for their commitment investors can collect a fee through regular consumer and nondomestic bills led by industry guided by government ultimately the current carbon trading system is based around charging polluters but as we approach a postcoal uk and in order to achieve net zero its necessary for this to evolve  from economically disincentivising emissions to incentivising carbonnegative power generation however with the cost of carbon capture and negative emissions differing between types of industries and technologies theres a requirement to consider differentiated carbon prices to guide industry through longterm strategy but the need for carbon capture development is too pressing for us as an industry to wait at drax power station our beccs pilot is just the beginning of our wider ambitions to become the first negative emissions power station our use of biomass already makes drax power station the largest generator of renewable electricity in great britain the responsiblymanaged working forests our suppliers source from absorbed carbon from the atmosphere as they grew so adding carbon capture at scale to this supply chain can turn our operation from low carbon to carbonneutral and eventually carbon negative and we have bigger plans still to create a net zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region  in partnership with equinor and national grid the cluster would deliver carbon capture at the scale needed to not just decarbonise the most carbonintensive industrial region in the uk but to put the country at the forefront of the decarbonisation of industry and manufacturing government action is needed to make ccus and beccs economically sustainable at scale as an integrated part of our energy system however the onus is on us the energy industry to lead development and act as trusted partners that can deliver the decarbonisation needed to reach net zero carbon by 2050 learn more

and how is it cutting global shipping emissions 5 july 2019 sustainable business shipping is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways tags technology  transport  decarbonisation  supply chain  engineering  sustainability what is a fuel cell and how will they help power the future 27 june 2019 carbon capture nasa museum houston texas how do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes the partnership between drax fuelcell energy p3p partners and the department of business energy and

of great britains power system changes constantly demand is always changing in winter it may peak at 50 gigawatts gw but overnight in summer it will be less than 20 gw some days wind is the biggest source of the countrys electricity generation other days its gas then there are days when for a few hours solar takes the top spot in the middle of the day and nuclear during the night in the past great britains electricity came almost entirely from big coal and nuclear power stations but as the need for decarbonisation has grown so has the number of sources feeding electricity to the grid creating an ever more complex and varied system made up of technologies that behave in very different ways for example some sources are weather dependent and cant generate all day every day others stop and start flexibly to smooth out changes in demand or intermittent generation but in the event all sources are available what dictates which sources actually generate and when the overriding influence is economics  the costs of starting up and running a turbine the price of fuel or taxes on carbon emissions in great britain electricitys wholesale price is not set in stone by an entity such as a regulator instead its negotiated via trading over the course of a day between generators power stations storage and wind turbines and suppliers who transmit that electricity to consumers as a result the price of electricity fluctuates every half hour responding to factors such as demand cost of fuels availability of resources such as sun and wind and carbon taxes for an example of the scale at which it fluctuates we can look at the period 14 june this year when the index price of electricity ranged from over 55mwh down to around 5mwh see chart above but while these figures speak to the overall price of a megawatt on the system they dont reflect all the individual sources nor their individual costs each of the multiple sources on the grid have their own operating costs fluctuating on a similar basis these changing prices give rise to what is known as the merit order a fluid theoretical ranking of generation sources this is not set by any regulator economist or even by traders rather it is a naturally occurring financial occurrence that explains what sources of electricity generation are feeding power onto the grid daytoday what is the merit order the merit order dictates which sources of generation will deliver power to the grid by ranking them in ascending order of price together with the amount of electricity generated this then determines the order in which power sources are brought onto the system ultimately suppliers want the right amount of electricity for the best possible price so in a system made up of many sources it is the lowest cost highest yield option that is brought online first which in theory helps keep overall electricity prices down north sea wind farm redcar this means it is often sources such as wind and solar which have no fuel costs that sit at the top of the merit order nuclear may come next as it continually generates a large amount of power for a low cost while taking a long time to turn down or off at the opposite end of the merit order are sources like coal and oil which have high fuel and carbon dioxide co 2  emission costs such as carbon taxes and the european emission trading scheme however the merit order isnt a set of hard and fast rules its an assumption used by traders or market commentators to guide what is likely to run and thereby the likely market price says ian foy drax head of ancillary services there is no published merit order it is like santa claus  it doesnt exist but it makes explaining christmas easier the intricacies of being in and out of merit if a generating unit is required to meet demand then its described as in merit if it is not required at any particular point in time then its out of merit  theres no point in suppliers paying for another power station for example to start generating if demand is already being met if the market is efficient we generate from the lowest cost source at all times says foy costs are not simple for example you have to take into account the cost of starting or shutting down generating units however costs are not publicly shared so theres no single view of the merit order each party has its own perspective on it it means the merit order changes from seasontoseason daytoday and hourtohour as rates of supply and demand and the availability of resources change dungeness nuclear power station in kent an obvious example is gas tends to be cheaper in summer than winter when its not being used for heating coal and gas also switch as global prices change says foy availability also changes over the year theres more solar in summer but none in the morning and evening peaks of winter there are also practical issues such as repairs being made on wind and hydro turbines or planned maintenance outages on thermal and nuclear power stations putting those generators out of action and knocking them out of merit and because the merit order is not an implemented working scheme it can be deliberately manipulated by outside forces one of the ways this is most clearly seen is in carbon pricing merit in a changing system the carbon price support tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain alongside the european emissions trading system have increased the cost of fossil fuel generation gas oil and coal levied as tonne of co 2 emitted this has the effect of pushing fossil generation down the merit order with coal emitting double the co 2 per unit of electricity compared to gas we can see how the merit order can be influenced to achieve environmental outcomes this has helped steer great britain towards record breaking coalfree periods and stimulated the building of low carbon generation sources other sources such as interconnection with europe and power storage facilities also slot into the merit order their position often shifts due to highly variable prices dependent on power generation in neighbouring countries or the amount of electricity that can be stored at a low cost respectively the grid is everchanging over the last two decades weve seen huge shifts in how power is generated and delivered this is unlikely to slow down in the near future but the merit order will remain like the grid it is in a constant state of change adapting to the many moving parts of the electricity system as long as great britain maintains its open electricity trading market the merit order will continue to dictate where the countrys power comes from tags renewable energy  electricity generation  carbon pricing  decarbonisation how close is great britains electricity to zerocarbon emissions 15 may 2019 power generation demand for electricity might have been 6 lower in the first three months of 2019 than in last years first quarter but the demand for lower carbon power is only growing and theres more pressure than ever for global industries to decarbonise more rapidly aided by a significantly milder winter than last year  great britains electricity sector continued to make further progress in reducing carbon emissions in the first quarter q1 of 2019 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity was almost 20 lower in q1 2019 than in the same period last year this was driven by a significant decrease in coal usage with 581 coalfree hours in total over the period  eight times more than in q1 2018 this trend has only increased with may seeing the countrys first coalfree week in modern times the findings come from electric insights  a report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london that analyses great britains electricity consumption and looks at what the future might hold as public commercial and political demand for lower carbon emissions mounts the question for the power system is can it truly reach zeroemissions keeping a zerocarbon system stable quarter after quarter the carbon intensity of great britains electricity system has declined from 545 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatt hour gkwh in q1 2012 to just over 200 gkwh last quarter for a single hour carbon emissions have fallen as low as just 56 gkwh but how soon can that figure reach all the way down to netzero carbon emissions the national grids electricity system operator eso believes it could be as soon as 2025  but some serious changes are needed to make it possible for the system to operate safely and efficiently when you have fewer sources offering balancing services like reserve power inertia frequency response and voltage control  the national grid eso believes an approach that establishes a marketplace for trading services holds the solution the hope is that competition will breed new innovation and bring new technologies such as gridscale storage and ai into the commercial energy markets offering reserve power and more accurate forecasting for solar and wind power for the meantime weatherdependent technologies are a key source of renewable electricity in great britain with wind making up more than 20 of all generation in q1 2019 however with wind capacity only expected to increase how should the system react when its not an option read the full article coauthored by julian leslie head of national control national grid eso how low can we go we cannot control the weather  but we can harness its power today there are around 20 gigawatts gw of wind capacity installed around great britain and this is forecast to double to 40 gw in the next seven years however average wind output can fluctuate between 2 gw one day and 12 gw the next  as happened twice in january it highlights the ongoing needs for flexibility and diversity of sources in the electricity system even as it decarbonises there are a number of ways to make up for shortfalls in wind generation the most obvious of which is through other existing sources there is more solar installed around the county than any source of generation except gas at 129 gw and sun power helped meet demand during a wind drought last summer  solar averaged 13 gw over the last 12 months this is more than coal which accounted for 11 gw however storage will also be important in delivering low or zerocarbon sources of electricity when there is neither wind nor sufficient sunlight at present this includes pumped storage and some battery technologies but in future will include greater use of gridscale lithiumion batteries as well as vehicletogrid systems that can take advantage of power stored in idle electric cars httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 new fuels particularly hydrogen also have the potential to meet demand and help create a wider lowercarbon economy for heating  as well as vehicle fuel with water as the only emission hydrogen can be produced from natural gas or using excess electricity from renewable sources or through carbon capture from industrial emissions  it can then be stored for a long time and at scale before being used to generate electricity rapidly when needed another increasingly important source of great britains electricity is interconnectors however they are not yet being used in a way that can support gaps in the electricity system with northern european countries normally all experiencing the same weather  and wind levels  at the same time read the full article what to do when the wind doesnt blow a bigger future for interconnection great britain added a new power source to its electricity system in q1 2019 in the form of belgium the opening of the 600 million nemo link between kent and zeebrugge added another 1 gw of interconnection capacity it joins connections to france the netherlands northern ireland and the republic of ireland to bring great britains total interconnection capacity to 5 gw these links accounted for 79 of the 78 terawatt hours twh of electricity consumed over the quarter electricity from imports also set new records for a daily average of 43 gw on 24 february  accounting for 129 of total consumption and a monthly average in march when it made up 106 of consumption  these records represent the first time great britain fell below 90 for electricity selfsufficiency with 34 gw of new interconnectors under construction coming online by 2022 and 91 gw more planned to be completed over the next five years great britains neighbours are set to play a growing role in the countrys electricity mix however while interconnectors offer an often costeffective way for great britain to ensure electricity supply meets demand the carbon intensity of neighbouring countries electricity should also be considered read the full article 10 of electricity now generated abroad the need for crossborder decarbonisation the new link to belgium has imported rather than exported electricity every day since it began operations as belgium has the lowest natural gas prices in europe and its power stations pay 16 per tonne less for carbon emissions than their british counterparts this makes it cheaper to import and less carbon intense than electricity from the more coaldependant netherlands and ireland planned links to germany and denmark could allow great britain to import more renewable power however if there is a wind drought across northern europe these countries often turn to their emissionsheavy coal or even dirtier lignite sources france is currently great britains cleanest source of imports mostly using nuclear and renewable generation however when the north sea link opens in 2021 it will give great britain access to norways abundance of hydropower to plug gaps in renewable generation considering the carbon intensity of great britains imports is important because the decarbonisation needed to address the global climate change emergency cant be solved by one

industries around the world are racing to find ways to reduce their emissions but looking slightly further down the line there is in fact a grander aim negative emissions negative emissions technologies nets can actually absorb more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit and theyre vitally important for avoiding catastrophic manmade climate change without nets it could be impossible to achieve the intergovernmental panel on climate changes ambition of keeping temperatures under 15 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels one example already being implemented is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs it is what its name suggests using technologies to capture and store the co 2 generated during the process of energy generation from biomass or organic materials rather than releasing it into the atmosphere beccs holds vast potential in the electricity generation industry drax power station is currently piloting one form of this technology on one of its biomass units to capture as much as a tonne of co 2 a day but if it were deployed across all its biomass units beccs technology could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station beyond the power industry however theres scope for growth across other industries once the biomass is sourced sustainably there are already five sites around the world where beccs is being trialled and implemented at scale laying the road to negative emissions storing co 2 from ethanol production in the illinois basin the ethanol production industry is already seeing significant deployment of beccs including the largest installation of the technology operating in the world the illinois industrial carbon capture and storage project is part of a corntoethanol plant in the us that has the capacity to capture 1 million tonnes of co 2 every year  here corn is used to create ethanol by fermenting it in an oxygendeprived environment this process creates co 2 as a byproduct which is captured and stored permanently in pores within the sandstone of the illinois basin under the facility researchers believe with further development the site could capture as much as 250 million tonnes each year norways cement challenge concrete is one of the worlds most versatile building materials as a result it is the second mostconsumed material in the world behind water  more than 10 billion tonnes of it is produced every year however its key ingredient  cement which acts as concretes binding agent  is made using a hugely carbonintensive manufacturing process and now accounts for as much as 6 of all global carbon emissions the norcem cement plant in brevik southeast norway has been experimenting with using biomass to power the kilns used to create its cement which must heat ingredients to 1500 degrees celsius now its taking this a step further by becoming part of the countrys ambitious full chain ccs project the project will see 400000 tonnes of co 2 captured annually which will then be transported by ship to a storage site on norways western coast from here a pipeline will transport the co 2 50 kilometres away and deposit it deep below the north seas bed the plan has the potential to work at an even bigger scale the pipeline will be capable of receiving as much as 4 million tonnes of co 2 per year  meaning it could even import and store carbon from other countries burning waste and growing algae in a world that seems increasingly unsure how to safely deal with its waste the idea of incinerating it and making use of the heat this produces seems widely beneficial but combusting any solid means releasing carbon emissions in japan however a biomassfired waste incineration plant is changing this by being the first in the world to capture its carbon emissions to get this project up and running toshiba the firm behind the project had to overcome unique challenges for example waste incineration produces a greater mix of chemicals than in ethanol or power production including some that are corrosive to the metal pipes normally used in carbon capture now running at commercial scale the saga city waste incineration plant isnt just capturing co 2  its also utilising it to cultivate crops at a nearby algae farm  the carbon is being absorbed and used to grow algae for use in commercial scale cosmetic products such as body and skin lotions carbon isnt the only thing finding new use at the facility reconstituted scrap metal from the plant is being used to make the medals for the 2020 tokyo olympics the carbon capture system has been operational since 2016 and is capable of capturing 3000 tonnes of co 2 a year but it isnt the regions first deployments of beccs fully integrating beccs into biomass power nearby the mikawa power plant on the fukuoka prefecture is leading the race in asia to fully integrate carbon capture technology into a biomass power station the 50 mw power station successfully piloted carbon capture in 2009 through a partnership with toshiba at the time it was powered by coal however in 2017 the plant upgraded to a 100 biomass boiler fuelled by palm kernel shells  a waste product from palm oil extraction mills now its in the process of ramping up its carbon capture capabilities with a target of being operational in 2020 the system  which after drax will be the second plant in the world to capture carbon using 100 biomass feedstock  will have the capacity to capture more than 50 of the biomass plants co 2 emissions or as much as 180000 tonnes per year  japans government is now supporting efforts to develop co 2 transportation and potential offshore storage solutions for next year pulping wood and growing food beccs technology has yet to be deployed in the paper industry to the same extent as in other organicmatterbased industries but with many pulp and paper mills already using byproducts such as hog fuel  in generating power for their sites its a prime area for beccs growth in saintfelicien quebec commercialscale carbon capture technology is being deployed at a pulp mill run by resolute forest products and as of march 2019 had a capacity of capturing 11000 tonnes of co 2 a year rather than storage however it supplies the carbon to a cucumbergrowing greenhouse next door to the mill  as well as supplying enough warm water to meet 25 of the greenhouses heating needs both long established biomassbased industries like ethanol and paper and new sectors like electricity are now adopting beccs technology and driving innovation the biomass feedstocks involved in beccs must however be sourced sustainably  or else a positive climate impact could be at the expense of environmental degradation elsewhere it should be possible to expand biomass supply in a sustainable way found a recent global biomass markets report from ricardo aea for the uks department for business energy and industrial strategy beis while its still a complex technology to deploy beccs is
