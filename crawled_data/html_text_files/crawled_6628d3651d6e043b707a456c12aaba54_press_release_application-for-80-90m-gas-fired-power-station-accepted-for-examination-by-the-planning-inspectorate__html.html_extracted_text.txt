Application for £80-90m gas fired power station accepted for examination by the Planning Inspectorate
Abergelli Power Ltd (APL, a subsidiary business of Drax Group) has had its application to build a new £80-90 million rapid response gas power station on land south of Felindre, near Abergelli, accepted for examination by the Planning Inspectorate.
21 June 2018
The examination of the Development Consent Order (DCO) application should get under way in the autumn, with the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy expected to make a decision on the proposals next year.
Prior to submitting its application for the DCO to build a 299MW rapid response gas power station, APL consulted widely with local people to ensure their views were taken into consideration.
If approved, up to 150 jobs will be supported during the construction of the plant and once built, it will produce enough electricity to power 150,000 homes – equivalent to a city around the size of Cardiff.
David Ball, Project Director, from Drax, said:
“We’re very pleased that our application for this rapid response gas power station is progressing through the planning process.
“This type of power station is designed to be able to be up and running quickly – in as little as 20 minutes – helping to keep the lights on when the system needs support.”
ENDS
Notes to editors:
Local people can have their say on the proposals during the examination of the application by the Planning Inspectorate.
APL will now formally notify City & County of Swansea Council, the community councils in the near vicinity of the site, local landowners and other statutory consultees of its proposals.
They will receive a copy of the accepted application documents. In addition, a notice will be published around the site and in local and national media to publicise the accepted application. The notice will provide information to local people on where they can review the application and how and when they can make representations to the Planning Inspectorate.
The Planning Inspectorate will appoint an independent inspector known as an Examining Authority to oversee the examination of the application, a process that is likely to start in the autumn. Anyone who makes a representation can register to become an Interested Party once the examination starts.
A preliminary meeting with Interested Parties, APL and the Examining Authority will be held to coincide with the start of the examination process. This meeting will be held locally and interested parties will be given at least 21 days’ notice of the meeting. At this meeting, the Examining Authority will inform APL and Interested Parties of the examination procedure and schedule going forward.
The post-application and examination processes, including the formal notification of the accepted application and the consultation on the Application documents (undertaken in accordance with Section 56 of the Planning Act 2008), are defined by relevant regulations and the Planning Inspectorate.
