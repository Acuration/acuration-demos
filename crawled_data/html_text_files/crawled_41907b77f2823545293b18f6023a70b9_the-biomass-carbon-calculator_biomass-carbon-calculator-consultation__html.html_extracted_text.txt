Biomass carbon calculator consultation
Information about Drax’s consultation process, designed to seek the views of stakeholders on its new Biomass Carbon Calculator.
About the consultation
Drax is committed to taking a leading role in the lifecycle emission reporting of biomass. We aim to deliver transparent and accurate reporting of our own supply chain emissions and wish to encourage and facilitate improved reporting across the industry. As a contribution towards these objectives, Drax has developed the
‘Biomass Carbon Calculator’
.
The Calculator is a greenhouse gas lifecycle emission tool that allows accurate calculation and transparent reporting of wood pellet supply chain GHG emissions in accordance with UK and EU regulations.
To ensure the tool meets all necessary regulatory requirements and provides a high industry standard for emissions reporting, we held an open consultation on the Calculator running from 1
st
May to 12
th
June 2020.
Drax thanks all respondents for participating in the consultation. We received five formal responses from a range of stakeholders including regulators, non-government organisations and industry. In addition, we received informal feedback from a variety of other stakeholders, including our suppliers and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Team of Specialists on Wood Energy
[1]
.
We have considered all feedback and published an updated version of the
Calculator
and accompanying
User Guide
alongside a
summary of responses
on 10/11/2020
.
Following these updates, the Calculator was independently verified against the methodologies laid out in the UK Renewables Obligation and Annex VI of the EU Renewable Energy Directive recast.
