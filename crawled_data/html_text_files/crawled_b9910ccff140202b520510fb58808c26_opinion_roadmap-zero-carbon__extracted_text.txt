roadmap to zero carbon drax has a wealth of experience in decarbonisation and must play a leading role in meeting the emission and climate goals of the future says drax group ceo will gardiner will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 1 october 2018 opinion the uk has come a long way in its efforts to decarbonise greenhouse gas emissions last year were 43 below 1990 levels  while increasing renewable electricity generation and a strengthening carbon price means the country could soon go coalfree for an entire summer  there is still however much work needed to reach the uk target of reducing emissions to 20 of 1990 levels by 2050 and meeting the paris agreements aim of keeping temperature increases below two degrees celsius as ambitious as these goals may be recent research by the energy transitions commission etc believes they can be met by 2050 with the right government policies and action from businesses to help to mitigate man made climate change all industries across all sectors must cut carbon emissions its a big challenge but a clear first step must be the decarbonisation of electricity generation this step will enable other industries to reduce their emissions in turn through electrification since 2000 we have been building our experience in decarbonising electrical generation transforming what was once western europes largest coalfired power station into the uks biggest decarbonisation project this puts us in a unique position to offer the leadership and innovation needed  across the electricity industry and other sectors  to reach a zerocarbon world electricity generation will lead decarbonisation the electrification of carbonintensive sectors such as transport and heating will only contribute to reducing overall emissions if the electricity comes from mostly low or zerocarbon sources the etcs research suggests wind and solar will be capable of providing 85 of the worlds electricity generation by 2050 when these intermittent sources are unable to generate electricity the remaining 15 will come from a combination of nuclear hydro biomass and storage including batteries pumped storage and new technologies in fact biomass alone could provide as much as half of that 15 but it is critical that this flexible renewable low carbon fuel must be sustainably sourced for the wood biomass we use at drax power station its sourcing should contribute to growing and healthy forests which will be another key part of the climate change solution will gardiner ceo drax group at drax we have a long history of finding ways to cut emissions and improve the efficiency of our own biomass pellet supply chain  from bigger ships to more efficient rail freight loading and unloading the skills and experiences gained from these efforts serve not only to decarbonise our business but will benefit other supply chainbased industries along the path to lowercarbon emissions more than this it is far from the only way we are working towards doing this from here to zerocarbon one of the biggest hopes for removing carbon from industry lies in carbon capture and storage were leading the charge on bringing this technology to the fore by running a sixmonth pilot of a bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs system which will capture a tonne of carbon every day from one of our four 600 megawatt mw biomass units capturing emissions not only further reduces the carbon intensiveness of electricity generators of all kinds but also opens new revenue streams for businesses through utilising captured carbon  for drax beccs takes us another step towards becoming a carbon negative operation  where we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit it is also an opportunity to further expand the knowledge and experience of our team and become leading experts in a field which will be essential in meeting climate change goals  alongside this our plans to repower the last of our coalfired units to highlyefficient combined cycle gas turbines ccgt and build four rapidresponse open cycle gas turbines ocgt will give the electricity system the flexibility needed to support more intermittent renewable sources  the abilities of gas plant in balancing and system services can help to complete the journey away from coal before 2025 in subsequent decades gas can play a pivotal role assisting the transition to a zerocarbon power system our retail businesses haven power and opus energy  also allow us to help companies and the public sector outside of electricity generation to reduce their carbon footprint beyond just supplying renewable electricity were also looking at ways through closer customer partnerships to help businesses leverage new technologies to use electricity more efficiently and in turn lower their costs reaching a zerocarbon future is a monumental task for electricity producers that depends on innovative thinking and new technologies we have the experience in developing transformative ideas and making them a reality  all of which will be essential in guiding us into a brighter more stable decarbonised future share most read electrification storage
