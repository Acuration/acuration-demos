generation after a year of smashing renewable records  great britains electricity system is less dependent on fossil fuels than ever before over the course of 2017 lowcarbon energy sources including nuclear as well as renewables accounted for half of all electricity production the finding comes from electric insights  a quarterly research paper on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the latest report highlights how great britains electricity system is rapidly moving away from fossil fuels with coal and gas dropping from 80 of the electricity mix in 2010 to 50 in 2017 its an impressive change for eight years but its even more dramatic when compared to 60 years ago powering the past with renewables in 2017 renewable output grew 27 over 2016 and produced 96 terawatt hours twh of electricity  enough to power the entire country in 1958 back then great britain was dependent on one fuel coal it was the source of 92 of the countrys power and its highcarbon intensity meant emissions from electricity generation sat at 93 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  compare that to just three million tonnes of co 2 emissions from roughly the same amount of power generated in 2017 just by renewables today the electricity system is much more diverse than in 1958 in fact with nuclear added to renewable generation 2017s total lowcarbon capacity produced enough power to fulfil the electricity needs of 1964s beatlemania britain but whats enabled this growth in renewable generation one answer as bob dylan explained a year earlier is blowin in the wind read the full article here powering the past  stormy weather powering great britain wind power experienced a watershed year in 2017 thanks to blusterier weather and a wave of new wind farm installations coming online wind generation grew 45 between 2016 and 2017 windfarms both onshore and offshore produced 15 of the entire countrys electricity output in 2017 up from 10 in 2016 the 45 twh it generated over the course of the year was almost double that of coal  and theres potential for this to increase in 2018 as more capacity comes online the 16 gigawatts gw of new offshore wind turbines installed in great britain last year accounted for 53 of the net 315 gw installed across europe  with large offshore farms at dudgeon and race bank still being commissioned the 32 gw of total new operating capacity registered in 2017 across offshore as well as onshore wind is on course to grow coauthor of the article renewableuks head of external affairs luke clark said these figures underline that renewables are central to our changing power system higher wind speeds and a jump in installed capacity drove a dramatic increase in the amount of clean power generated alongside breaking multiple records for peak output wind energy continued to cut costs as wind power is dependent on weather conditions it is intermittent in its generation but in 2017 more than one storm offered ideal conditions for wind turbines during q4 there were three named storms as well as the remnants of a hurricane all battering the british isles all of which helped push average wind speeds 5 higher than in 2016 while calculating wind power based on wind speed is complex  windier weather means more power  monthly average wind speed is proportional to monthly average power output from wind farms while the 2017 annual average wind speed of 101mph was in line with the countrys longterm average wind generation was not consistent across the year in q4 wind output was close to an average of 7 gw by contrast between may and august it was closer to 4 gw thankfully these calmer months saw longer hours of daylight allowing solar power to compensate read the full article here wind power grows 45 driving down carbon emissions the knockon effect of an increase in renewable generation is a drop in the carbon intensity of electricity production and in 2017 this reached a new low across the year carbon emissions including those from imported sources totalled 72 million tonnes down 12 from 2016 this decrease is equal to 150 kg of co 2 saved per person or taking 47 million cars off the roads the least carbon intensive period of the quarter came just after midnight in the early hours of monday 2 october when it measured a record low of 56 grammes per kilowatt hour gkwh thanks to low fossil fuel generation and high levels of renewables over the whole year there were 139 hours when carbon intensity dipped below 100 gkwh this generally required 50 of the electricity mix to come from renewable sources and demand to be lower than 30 gw for carbon intensity to dip under 100 gkwh on a more permanent basis greater renewable capacity will be required as demand rises read the full article here carbon emissions down 12 interconnectors meeting future demand electricity demand in great britain has been on the decline since 2002 primarily due to more efficient buildings and appliances  and a decline in heavy manufacturing however this is expected to change over the coming years as more electric vehicles are introduced and the heating system is electrified to help meet 2050 carbon emissions targets while installing greater renewable capacity will be crucial in meeting this demand with lowcarbon power interconnectors will also play a significant role particularly from france which boasts a large nuclear and lowcarbon capacity however electricity sales through interconnectors are often based on dayahead prices rather than the live market which can lead to trades that arent reflective of demand on each sides of the channel in q4 there were eight halfhours when demand was very high more than 50 gw yet power was being exported this occurred despite dayahead prices suggesting traders would lose money due to lower demand in france and the cost of using the interconnector it highlights the need for improvements in internetwork trading as great britain increases its intermittent renewable generation and looks to a greater reliance on importing and exporting power read the full article here moving electricity across the channel great britains electricity system continues to break its renewable records each year and heading into 2018 this is likely to continue wind and solar power will continue to grow as more installations come online and a fourth coal unit at drax will be upgraded to sustainable biomass  which could lead to another breakthrough year regardless 2017 will be a tough one to beat explore the

january 2018 sustainable bioenergy when we think of modern cities and the buildings within them we often think of the materials theyre constructed from  we think of the concrete jungle since the 19 th century steel glass and concrete enabled the building of bigger and more elaborate buildings in rapidlygrowing cities and those materials quickly came to define the structures themselves but today that could be changing new technologies and building techniques mean wood a material humans have used in construction for millennia is making a comeback and reducing the carbon footprint of our buildings too return of the treehouse civilisation has been building structures from wood for longer than you may realise the 32metre tall pagoda of horyuji temple in japan was built using wood felled in 594 and still stands today the sakyumuni pagoda of fogong temple in china is nearly twice as tall with a height of 67 metres it was built in 1056 today wood is once again finding favour the 30metre tall wood innovation and design centre of the university of british columbia unbc in canada was completed in october 2014 and is among the first of this new generation of wooden buildings and theyre only getting bigger this year the completion of the 84metre 24storey hoho tower in vienna will make it the tallest wooden building in the world but this will be far surpassed if plans for the oakwood tower in london are approved designed by a private architecture firm and researchers from the university of cambridge the proposed building will be 300metres tall if construction goes ahead making it londons second tallest structure after the shard and it would be made of wood falling back in love with wood wood construction fell out of favour in the 19 th century when materials like steel and concrete became more readily available but new developments in timber manufacturing are changing this researchers in graz austria discovered that by gluing strips of wood with their grains at right angles to each other the relative weakness of each piece of wood is compensated the result is a wood product known as crosslaminated timber clt which is tougher than steel for its weight but is much lighter and can be machined into extremely precise shapes think of it as the plywood of the future allowing construction workers to build bigger quicker and lighter glued laminated timber commonly known as glulam is another technology technique enabling greater use of wood in more complex construction manufactured by bonding highstrength timbers with waterproof adhesives glulam can also be shaped into curves and arches  pushing woods usage beyond straight planks and beam these dense timbers dont ignite easily either they are designed to act more like logs than kindling and feature an outer layer that is purposefully designed to char when exposed to flame which in turn insulates the inner wood susceptibility to mould insect and water damage is indeed a concern of anyone building with wood but as the centuriesold pagodas in japan and china demonstrate care for wood properly and theres no real limit to how long you can make it last so wood is sturdy but so is steel  why change green giant construction with concrete and steel produces an enormous carbon footprint concrete production on its own accounts for 5 of all our carbon emissions but building with wood can change that unbcs innovation and design centre saved 400 tonnes of carbon by using wood instead of concrete and steel on top of that building with wood freezes the carbon captured by the trees as they grow when trees die naturally in the forest they decompose and release the carbon they have absorbed during growth back in the atmosphere but wood felled and used to construct a building has captured that carbon for as long as it stands in place a city of wooden buildings could be a considerable carbon sink this can have further ripple effects the more timber is required for construction the more it increases the market for wood and the responsiblymanaged forests that material comes from and the more forests that are planted and managed with proper governance the more carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere  according to research from yale university a worldwide switch to timber construction would on its own cut the building industrys carbon emissions by 31  granted that will be a difficult task but if even a fraction of that can be achieved it could mean a future of timber buildings and greener cities tags decarbonisation  engineering  technology fourth biomass unit conversion 17 january 2018 investors rns number  1114c drax group plc drax welcomes the uk government response to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme which will enable drax to convert a fourth unit to biomass the response proposes that rather than imposing a cap on roc 1 support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all roc 1 units this would protect existing converted units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum the response would enable drax to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax will now continue its work to deliver the low cost conversion of a fourth biomass unit accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply drax plans to complete the work on this unit as part of a major planned outage in the second half of 2018 before returning to service in late 2018 the capital cost is significantly below the level of previous conversions repurposing the existing cofiring facility on site to deliver biomass to the unit the unit will likely operate with lower availability than the three existing converted units but the intention is for it to run at periods of higher demand which are often those of higher carbon intensity allowing optimisation of roc 1 generation across three roc 1 accredited units the cfd 2 unit remains unaffected will gardiner chief executive of drax group commented we welcome the governments support for further sustainable biomass generation at drax which will allow us to accelerate the removal of coal from the electricity system replacing it with flexible low carbon renewable electricity we look forward to implementing a costeffective solution

electrification electric vehicles evs are often seen as a key driver towards a greener future indeed transport accounts for roughly a quarter of the uks greenhouse gas emissions and seriously affects air quality in major cities to tackle pollution problems governments around the world are implementing ambitious policies to promote the electrification of transport and phase out ice internal combustion engine vehicles the uk and france both plan to ban the sale of petrol and dieselonly cars by 2040 while india is setting an even more ambitious end date of 2030  added to this are evs growing popularity with drivers there are now almost 110000 electric cars and vans on uk roads spurred on by lowering battery costs and a growing range of models including plugin hybrid vehicles evs now account for 2 of new registrations switching to evs is an obvious way to massively cut pollution in areas of dense traffic but the question remains  how clean are evs on the broader scale when you look at the electricity used to charge them electric vehicles are getting cleaner evs dont give off the same exhaust emissions as engines but the power in their batteries has to come from somewhere follow the flow back from the car through the charging point all the way back to the power station and its likely some of that electricity is coming from fossil fuels and that means emissions they werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell a researcher at imperial college london and author of electric insights  a study commissioned by drax that analyses electricity generation data in britain now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk evs are delivering much better results he continues in fact yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to greener electricity generation today they are twice as efficient as conventional cars take the tesla model s in the winter of 2012 producing the electricity for a full charge created 124g of carbon emissions per km driven roughly the same as a 2l range rover evoque now the carbon intensity of charging a tesla has nearly halved to 74gkm in winter and 41 gkm in summer as the uk continues to break its own renewable energy records for smaller evs the results are even better the nissan leaf and bmw i3 can now be charged for less than half the co 2 of even the cleanest nonplugin ev the toyota prius hybrid so the current outlook for evs is hugely positive  but as their numbers continue to increase will the demand they add to the grid put their clean credentials at risk will evs accelerate electricity demand the national grid suggests there could be as many as nine million evs on uk roads by 2030 which could lead to an additional 410 gw of demand on the system at peak times  this in some cases could lead to a rise in emissions electricity demand in britain typically peaks between 6pm and 10pm when people arrive home and switch on lights and appliances if you were to charge your ev between those evening hours the emissions would be 8 higher than reported in the chart above if you charged between midnight and 6am they would be 10 lower today this demand is met by the existing mix of power stations which last quarter included more than 50 renewable and lowcarbon sources  but when there are sudden spikes in demand above this typical usage the national grid must call in the help of carbonintensive reserve generators such as coalpowered stations polluting diesel generators are also on standby around the uk ready to turn on and feed into regional distribution grids at a moments notice to meet the challenge of peaktime ev charging less carbon intensive power generation storage and smart power management systems are needed these include rapid response gas power stations such as the four drax ocgts planned to come online in the early 2020s as well as gridscale batteries homebased batteries and demandside response schemes as the share of intermittent renewable capacity on the grid increases more backup power needs to be available for when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine keeping our future fuels clean a future increasingly relying on backup generators is far from inevitable especially if the use of smart technology and smart meters increases by analysing electricity costs and countrywide demand smart meters have the potential to ensure evs only charge outside peak times unless absolutely necessary when electricity is more likely to come from renewable or lowcarbon and cheaper sources if the grid continues to decarbonise through advances in renewable technologies and lowercost coaltobiomass conversions the potential of evs electricity coming with associated emissions is diminished even further there is no doubt that evs will make up a significant part in the future of our mobility that they will also play a part in the future of cleaning up that mobility is as good as assured but on this journey its imperative we keep our eyes on the road commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by a team of academics from imperial college

know about britains electricity last quarter 17 august 2017 power generation for an hour over lunch on wednesday 7 th june more than 50 of britains electricity came from renewables it was only the second time this had ever happened  the first had come just two months earlier in april the second quarter q2 of 2017 was a period largely made up of firsts for britains electricity system while there were only two instances of renewable power tipping the 50 mark between april and june overall wind solar biomass and hydro energy made up more than a quarter of all britains electricity for the first time ever these findings come from electric insights  research on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by top university academics over the past year the quarterly report has shown breaking renewable records is becoming the new normal for britains electricity last quarter was no different here we look at the key findings from q2 2017 and what they mean for the changing nature of the energy sector more than half great britains electricity came from renewables twice wind solar biomass and hydro accounted for 515 of the uks electricity for an hour on 7 th june  generating 191 gigawatts gw combined with nuclear power and imports from france lowcarbon output was a record 286 gw  a massive 89 of total demand this followed 30 th april when britains electricity edged over the 50 renewable mark for a shorter but no less significant period the percentage of renewables making up our power supply is set to grow as additional renewable capacity comes onto the grid there is currently 6 gw of additional wind capacity being constructed in britain solar capacity has already hit 124 gw  more solar panels than analysts thought would be installed by 2050 plans to convert more of britains coal units to biomass will increase the availability of renewable power further still electricity was cleaner than ever there was a key date in the history of coal during q2 on 21 st april britain recorded the first full day it had gone without burning any coal since 1882  the year holborn viaduct power station became the worlds first coalfired public electricity station while that date is symbolic of the uks shift away from coal in practice it means carbon emissions are also dropping to historically low levels carbon intensity reached a new low in q2 averaging 199 gkwh over the quarter  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year for context carbon intensity averaged 740 gkwh in the 1980s and 500 gkwh in the 2000s an important indicator of this falling carbon intensity is that britains electricity now regularly drops below 100 gkwh and reached an alltime low of 71 gkwh on the sunny and windy sunday of 11 th june electric cars are cleaner than before one of the greatest decarbonisation challenges moving forward is how we transform transport electrification is the primary driver of change in this sector and q2 saw britain hit a significant milestone as the total number of electric vehicles evs in the country surpassed 100000 the potential of evs in cleaning up transport is significant but there are also concerns they could in some cases increase co 2 levels due to pollution from power stations however as the last quarters data shows evs are in fact twice as carbon efficient as conventional cars thanks to the amount of renewable and low carbon electricity on the system according to our analysis looking at a few of the most popular models evs werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell from imperial college london but now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk they are delivering much better results the most solar power a quarter has ever seen the longer days in q2 enabled solar power to become a key source of electricity  and for eight hours over the quarter it generated more than all fossil fuels combined it also set output records by supplying 25 of total demand on 8 th april and producing 891 gw on 26 th may while wind remains the largest source of renewable energy generation in the uk solars influence is growing  especially as decentralisation of the power system continues to proliferate  of britains 124 gw solar capacity 57 is concentrated in 1400 solar farms of around 5 mw each while the rest is distributed across almost one million rooftop arrays in homes businesses and other institutions in fact during june 10 of all britains electricity came from these sorts of decentralised sources  sources of power not on the national grid this is unlikely to spell a fundamental shift to an entirely decentralised power grid in the short term but it does hint at the changes the sector is seeing from its carbon profile to its variety to its flexibility britains power system is changing  and thats a good thing explore the data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by a team of academics from imperial college london led by dr iain staffell and facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants  tags decarbonisation  electric insights  electricity generation  investors a flexible energy future andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 3 august 2017 opinion renewable technologies now account for a larger proportion of great britains electricity sources than ever before and theyre growing the first quarter of 2017 was another recordbreaking one for renewables biomass wind and hydro all registered their highest energy production ever while solar recorded its highest ever peak output draxs own generation is now 68 renewable and accounted for 17 of the countrys overall renewable generation in the first half of 2017  enough to power over four million homes weve made great progress over a relatively short period however with every step forward we need to ensure our approach is helping enhance stability in a power system increasingly made up of intermittent renewables what will become more and more important for security of electricity supply will be technologies that respond quickly to spikes in demand and drops in supply  for example when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing in short what the power system of today needs is flexibility the flexibility factor a recent report by imperial college london for the committee on climate change ccc highlights the significance of increasing systemwide flexibility in achieving decarbonisation imperials analysis emphasises the cost savings this can have projecting that flexibility in a 50 gkwh system  the lowerend of the cccs 2030 target for a decarbonised system  could save between 71 billion and 81 billion a year in system integration costs without flexibility the costs of balancing the system will rise significantly this in turn could lead to the current fastpace of grid decarbonisation stalling the need for flexibility in our energy system is too financially and environmentally significant to ignore but what sources and technologies will we need to create it the next big thing in system flexibility there are a number of technologies that are often touted as key to a flexible system including storage principally batteries interconnectors rapid response gas plants renewable technologies such as biomass and demand side response all are indeed crucial to a flexible future but alone each one still has its challenges millions of pounds are being invested in battery and storage research  both in the ambition of driving down costs and in increasing capacity however there is a way to go on both fronts for example consider the scale at which batteries must operate the storage domes at drax power station hold up to 300 kt of wood pellets  enough to generate roughly 600 gwh of electricity at the current battery prices of around 350 per kwh it would cost 210 billion to replace their capacity with batteries  even if prices fell dramatically we are still talking about a 60 billion price tag greater interconnection is something energy industry regulator ofgem and the national infrastructure commission nic are calling for but national grid has voiced concerns that wholesale market price swings could lead to changes in power flows across interconnectors this in turn could impact great britains system however they remain a potential solution to solving flexibility not just for their ability to deliver power but in their ability to deliver ancillary services  something which will become increasingly important in a more volatile power system for example if built hinkley point c will have some of the biggest single units on the system 1600 mw which will create more demand for ancillary services such as frequency response technologies such as biomass and gas are well placed to provide this as well as quickly respond to changes in demand and supply they also highlight why it is important to consider each megawatt coming onto the system not all technologies offer electricity and system stability tools ancillary services and so each one should be assessed from a whole system cost perspective  and according to how they fit into the overall supply mix each type of generation can bring diverse services so to achieve true flexibility we cant rely on one technology  instead we will need to rely on many better together to achieve full system flexibility we will need a coordinated combination of sources this means maintaining a stable system that includes increasing levels of intermittent renewables and flexible generation sources like biomass and gas that will supply baseload megawatts plug the gaps left by intermittent renewables and provide ancillary services the four rapid response gas power plants we are developing will play a key role once they are consented secure capacity market contracts and become operational in the early 2020s they will be crucial to plugging gaps in power supply as a result of unfavourable weather conditions creating a system that is sufficiently flexible will make britain much more effective in responding to stresses such as very low wind speeds over several hours  unexpected power station unit outages or high demand more than this it will keep us on track to meeting carbonreduction challenges for an affordable decarbonised power system we need to be stable to be stable we need to be flexible and to be flexible we need to be varied and we need to work together tags decarbonisation  investors how quickly will these countries reach their climate targets 28 june 2017 power generation it was no surprise when president donald trump echoed his election campaign stance and announced his intention to renegotiate  or failing that withdraw the us  from the paris agreement on climate change it raised the question would other countries back away from their own climate change targets in fact many reaffirmed their commitment to the pact and continue their progress towards becoming low carbon economies for those in the european union this means meeting the 2030 climate and energy framework  which sets three key targets for member states cut greenhouse gas ghg emissions by at least 40 from 1990 levels produce at least 27 of their energy through renewable sources and improve energy efficiency by at least 27 many countries across europe however have set climate objectives that go beyond these whether they can meet those goals is another matter portugal what are its climate targets the portuguese government has pressed the eu to go further than its 2030 targets and is aiming for 40 of total energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030  this target is part of its green growth commitment 2030 which also sets out to create more green  or low carbon economy  jobs and improve overall energy efficiency across the country how is it achieving this portugal has rapidly increased its renewable energy production by investing in wind mainly onshore and hydro power although it is rapidly developing its solar capabilities it is also looking at small scale renewable energy generation through wave thermal and biomass power portugal has two operational coal plants that together are responsible for 16 of the countrys carbon emissions however the government is seeking to phase these out prior to 2025 how is it doing so far the growth in renewable energy within the power industry specifically has been a big success story for portugal in 2005 renewables accounted for only 16 of total electricity production  by 2015 they produced an average of 52 the country made headlines in may 2016 for running on 100 renewable electricity for four days in a row unsurprisingly this means the government is confident of achieving a target of 31 renewables in gross final energy consumption by 2020 which would mean 574 renewable electricity generation germany what are its climate targets germany set its current climate targets as far back as 2007 it subsequently agreed to the paris agreement and the eus 2014 climate and energy framework added to this the country has its own ambitious aims for 2050  cut ghg emissions by up to 95 compared to 1990 levels with an interim target of 40 by 2020 increase the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption to 60 and increase all electricity generated from renewables to 80 how does it plan to achieve this germanys climate action programme 2020 and climate action plan 2050  set out its plans for reducing ghg emissions much of this is based around the energiewende energy transition a strategy that will see the country phaseout nuclear power and decarbonise the economy through renewable energy initiatives according to these plans germanys energy supply must be almost completely decarbonised by 2050 with coal power slowly phased out and replaced with renewables especially wind power the utilisation of biomass will be limited and sourced mostly from waste it also stresses the role of the european union emission trading system to meet targets how is it doing so far between 1990 and 2015 emissions reduced by 27 in 2015 the share of renewable sources in german domestic power consumption amounted to 316 however german energyrelated co₂ emissions rose almost 1 in 2016  despite a fall in coal use and the ongoing expansion of renewable energy sources this rise is due in part to an overall increase in energy consumption and an increase in natural gas use and diesel for electricity heat and transport projections from the environment ministry in september 2016 indicated that germany will likely miss its 2020 climate target  uk httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201706adobestock_90651791mp4 what are its climate targets alongside its eu and paris commitments the uk houses of parliament approved the climate change act in 2008 which commits to reducing ghg emissions by at least 80 of 1990 levels by 2050 the act requires the government to set legallybinding carbon budgets  a cap on the amount of ghg emitted in the uk over a fiveyear period the first five carbon budgets have been put into legislation and will run up to 2032 these include reducing emissions 37 below 1990 levels by 2020 and 57 by 2030 a key milestone in the uks decarbonisation is to entirely phase out coal by 2025 which will mean either closing or converting as in the case of drax power station  existing coal power stations how does it plan to achieve this under its legally binding carbon budget system  every tonne of ghg emitted between now and 2050 will count where emissions rise in one sector of the economy be it agriculture heavy industry power transport etc the uk must achieve corresponding falls in another the uks initial focus has been to transition to renewable electricity production wind biomass and solar power have all grown significantly aided by government support and by initiatives like the carbon price floor how is it doing so far the uks progress towards its targets is positive but leaves room for improvement renewables generated 149 of the uks electricity in 2013 in 2015 they accounted for nearly a quarter of electricity generation and by 2016 low carbon power sources contributed an average of 40 of the uks power  with wind generating more power than coal for the first time ever the department for business energy and industrial strategy estimates that as of 2016 ghg emissions fell 42 since 1990  despite this the committee on climate change ccc has said that the government is not on track to meet its pledge of cutting emissions 80 by 2050  however it points out the uk is likely to meet the target of making electricity almost entirely lowcarbon by early 2030s but only if further steps are taken such as including increasing investment in more lowcarbon generation such as biomass and developing carbon capture and storage ccs technologies the uk government is due to publish an emissions reduction plan in the autumn of 2017 norway what are its climate targets norways climate policy is based on agreements reached in the storting the norwegian parliament in 2008 and 2012 they stipulate a commitment to reduce global ghg emissions by at least 30 by 2020 from 1990 levels the government also approved the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 as well as signing the paris agreement norway has aligned itself with the european unions climate target and intends to fulfil its commitment collectively with the eu of which it is not a member state this means using the eu emissions trading market international cooperation on emissions reductions and projectbased cooperation how does it plan to achieve this around 98 of norways electricity production already comes from renewable energy sources mostly through its more than 900 hydropower plants the remainder is through wind and thermal power norway exports hydropower to the netherlands and exchanges renewable energy with denmark sweden and finland there are plans for similar green exchanges with germany and the united kingdom via interconnectors within the next five years norway is also aided by a substantial carbon sink in its forests which cover 30 of its land surface they sequester absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere to such an extent that it equals approximately half of the scandinavian countrys annual emissions how is it doing so far while norway already has one of the worlds most carbon neutral electricity sectors its significant domestic oil and gas sector means it still struggles to reduce its overall emissions as such the government is expected to rely on carbon trading with the eu or international offsets to meet its ambitious goals nonetheless earlier this year the government said that ghg emissions will fall to around 1990 levels by 2020 although it did not stipulate whether this included buying carbon credits from abroad or not tags climate change  decarbonisation  energy policy 3 ways decarbonisation could change the world 27 june 2017 sustainable business mitigating climate change is a difficult challenge but its one well within the grasp of governments companies and individuals around the world if we can start thinking strategically on the behalf of the german government the internal energy agency iea and the international renewable energy agency irena have jointly published a report outlining the longterm targets of a worldwide decarbonisation process and how those targets can be achieved through longterm investment and policy strategies at the heart of the report is a commitment to the 66 two degrees celsius scenario which the report defines as limiting the rise in global mean temperature to two degrees celsius by 2100 with a probability of 66 this is in line with the paris agreement which agreed on limiting global average temperature increase to below two degrees celsius here are three of the findings from the report that highlight how decarbonisation could change the world the energy landscape will change  and thats a good thing decarbonisation will by definition mean reducing the use of carbonintensive fossil fuels today 81 of the worlds power is generated by fossil fuels but by 2050 that will need to come down to 39 to meet the 66 two degrees celsius scenario according to the report but this doesnt mean all fossil fuels will be treated equally coal will be the most extensively reduced while other fossil fuels will be less affected oil use in 2050 is expected to stand at 45 of todays levels but will likely still feature in the energy landscape due its use in industries like petrochemicals gas will likely also remain a key part of the energy makeup thanks to its ability to provide auxiliary grid functions like frequency response and blackstarting in the event of grid failure renewables like biomass will likely play an increasing role here as well particularly when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs technology overall renewable energy sources will need to increase substantially in the reports global roadmap for the future renewables make up two thirds of the primary energy supply reaching this figure will be no mean feat  it will mean renewable growth rates doubling compared with today everyday electricity use will become more efficient the report highlights the need for enduse behaviour to change this can mean everyday energy users choosing to use a bit less heat power and fuel for transport in our daytoday activities but a bigger driver of change will be by investment in better more efficient enduse technology  the technology devices and household appliances we use every day  in fact the study argues that net investment in energy supply doesnt need to increase beyond todays level  what needs to increase is investment in these technologies for instance by 2050 70 of new cars must be electric cars to meet decarbonisation targets infrastructure design could also be improved for energy efficiency  smart grids battery storage and buildings retrofitted with energy efficient features such as led lighting will be essential theres also the possibility of increased use of cleaner building materials and processes  for example constructing large scale buildings out of wood rather than carbonintensive materials such as concrete and steel decarbonisation will cost but not decarbonising will cost more the upfront costs of meeting temperature targets will be substantial a case study used in the report estimates that 119 trillion would need to be spent on lowcarbon technologies between 2015 and 2050 but it also suggests another 29 trillion may be needed to meet targets however failure to act could mean the world will pay out an even higher figure in healthcare costs or in other economic costs associated with climate change such as flood damage or drought therefore the sum for decarbonisation could end up costing between two and six times less than what failing to decarbonise could cost on top of this the new jobs including those in renewable fuel industries that will replace those lost in fossil fuels and opportunities that will be created between 2015 and 2050 could add 19 trillion to the global economy more than that global gdp could be increased by 08 in 2050 thanks to added stimulus from the low carbon economy achieving a cleaner future wont be easy  it requires planning effort and the will to see beyond shortterm goals and think about the longterm benefits but as the report demonstrates get it right and the results could be considerable tags decarbonisation  fossil fuels  investors everything you ever wanted to know about cooling towers 17 may 2017 power generation cooling towers arent beautiful buildings in the traditional sense but its undeniable they are icons of 20 th century architecture theyre a ubiquitous part of our landscape  each one a reminder of our industrial heritage yet despite the familiarity we have with them knowledge about what a cooling tower actually does remains limited a common misconception is that they release pollution in fact what they actually release is water vapour  similar to but nowhere near as hot as the steam coming out of your kettle every morning and this probably isnt the only thing you never knew about cooling towers what does a cooling tower do as the name suggests a cooling towers primary function is to lower temperatures  specifically of water or cooling water as its known at drax power stations utilise a substantial amount of water in the generation of electricity at a thermal power plant such as drax fuel is used to heat demineralised water to turn it to high pressure steam this steam is used to spin turbines and generate electricity before being cooled by the cooling water which flows through two condensers on either side of each of the steam turbines and then returning to the boiler it is this process that the cooling towers support  and it plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of electricity generation at draxs north yorkshire site to optimise water utilisation some power stations cycle it to do this they have cooling towers of which at drax there are 12 these large towers recover the warmed water which then continues to be circulated where chemistry is permitting the warmed water about 40c is pumped into the tower and sprayed out of a set of sprinklers onto a large volume of plastic packing where it is cooled by the air naturally drawn through the tower the plastic packing provides a large surface area to help cool the water which then falls in to the large flat area at the bottom of the massive structure called the cooling tower pond as the water cools down some of it  approximately 2  escapes the top of the tower as water vapour this water vapour which is commonly mistakenly referred to as steam may be the most visible part of the process but its only a byproduct of the cooling process the majority of the water utilised by drax power station is returned back to the environment either as vapour from the top of the towers or safely discharged back to the river ouse each year about half of the water removed from the river is returned there in effect it is a huge amount of water recycling and in environmental terms  it is not a consumptive process how do you build a cooling tower the history of cooling towers as we know them today dates back to the beginning of the 20 th century when two dutch engineers were the first to build a tower using a hyperboloid shape very wide on the bottom curved in the centre and flared at the top the structure meant fewer materials were required to construct each tower it was naturally more robust and it helped draw in air and aid its flow upwards it quickly became the de facto design for towers across the world the dutch engineers tower measured 34 metres which at the time was a substantial achievement but as engineering and construction abilities progressed so too did the size of cooling towers today each of 12 towers measures 115 metres tall  big enough to fit the dome of st pauls cathedral or the whole of the statue of liberty with room to spare if scaled down to the size of an egg the concrete of each cooling tower would be the same thinness as egg shell the structures at drax are dwarfed by the cooling towers at the kalisindh power plant in rajasthan india the tallest in the world each stands an impressive 202 metres tall  twice the height of the tower housing big ben and just a touch taller than the uks joint fifth tallest skyscraper the hsbc tower at 8 canada square in londons canary wharf the industrial icon of the future todays energy mix is not what is used to be the increased use of renewables means were no longer as reliant on fossil fuels and this has an effect on cooling towers already a large proportion of the uks most prominent towers have been demolished going the same way as the coal they were once in service to but this doesnt mean cooling towers will disappear completely power stations such as drax which has upgraded four of its boilers to superheat water with sustainablysourced compressed wood pellets instead of coal the dwindling coal fleet and some gas facilities still rely on cooling towers as they continue to be part of our energy mix the cooling tower will remain an icon of electricity generation for the time being but itll be a mantle it shares with biomass domes gigantic offshore wind turbines and fielduponfield of solar panels  the icons of todays diverse energy mix view our water cooling towers close up drax
