archives press release drax acquires lanark hydro scheme as part of 702m power deal 11 january 2019 press releases believed to be the oldest hydroelectric plant in the uk the power stations associated with the lanark hydro scheme at stonebyres and bonnington on the river clyde have a combined output of 17mw and were developed to meet demand for electricity in lanarkshire after the first world war it is part of a portfolio of hydro pumped storage and gas power generation assets which have been sold by spanish company iberdrola to drax group  owners of the uks largest power station at selby in north yorkshire the deal adds a total of 26gw of generation capacity to draxs portfolio reinforcing its position at the heart of great britains energy system drax will now generate enough power for more than 83 million homes with operations in scotland wales yorkshire lancashire london the south east of england the east of england and the east midlands andy koss drax power ceo said as a british energy company were really proud to be the new owners of these critical power stations across scotland were looking forward to working with our new colleagues at each of the sites and playing an increasingly important role in the uks power system weve been to meet the team at stonebyres power station and have been impressed with the skill and expertise there  this hydro power system has operated on the clyde for over ninety years generating reliable supplies of electricity almost continuously powered by three waterfalls known collectively as the falls of clyde the lanark hydro scheme uses weirs to divert water from the river to generate electricity at the two power stations at stonebyres and bonnington the combination of hydro plants in scotland with draxs biomass units in yorkshire reinforces the companys position as great britains biggest generator of flexible and renewable electricity the scottish assets included in the deal are runofriver hydro locations at galloway and lanark 126mw cruachan pumped storage hydro 440mw in argyll and a biomassfromwaste facility daldowie near glasgow with the additional 2gw of gas power stations in england also acquired through the
