less and less coal this june the fossil fuels share of the electricity mix dipped below 1 for the first time ever  for 12 days it dropped all the way to zero spurred on by the beginnings of an uncharacteristically dry hot summer and a jump in solar generation the possibility of the country going entirely coalfree for a full summer now looks more achievable than ever in modern times this is one of the key findings from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london it found that across q2 2018 there were as many coalfree hours as in the whole of 2016 and 2017 combined and while the reports findings are hugely positive they also hint at where development is still needed what else does the performance of this quarter tell us about what we can expect in the power sector  in great britain and around the world great britain is slashing coal generation the rest of the world needs to catch up great britain has reduced its coalfired power generation by fourfifths over the last five years last quarter the countrys coal fleet ran at just 3 of its 129 gigawatt gw capacity coal capacity is now lower than the capacity of solar pv panels 131 gw installed nationwide with the most recent decline resulting from draxs conversion of a fourth unit from coal to biomass  when coal generation was running it primarily provided system balancing services overnight in may and june rather than baseload electricity however this positive trend is not seen around the world the share of coal in national power systems during 2017 globally coal still provides 38 of the worlds electricity  the same amount it did 30 years ago this comes despite efforts in europe and north america to move away from coal and growing investment into renewable generation and technologies overall europes coal generation dropped from 39 to 22 over the last 30 years  despite some countries  such as poland and serbia  still drawing significant generation from the fossil fuel the us has also reduced its coal generation from 57 to 31 over the past 30 years as natural gas proves more economical even in an era of procoal policies  coal train at rail station in india however in the middle east and africa which draw significant generation from their oil and gas reserves and south america where coal accounts for less than 3 of generation total coal generation is growing in fact globally only seven countries use less coal today than 30 years ago germany poland spain ukraine the us great britain and canada electric insights attributes part of this global growth to the continued increase in demand for electricity particularly in asia china south korea and indonesia collectively burn 10 times more coal than they did 30 years ago indias coal habit has also increased over the past decade to account for 76 of its electricity generation while japans usage has grown from 15 to 34 in the same period as well as the stresses created by growing demand this highlights a global disparity in the approach to decarbonising electricity systems and a need for longerterm environmentally and sociallyconscious marketbased

electricity generation britain edges closer to zero coal solar farm in south wales decarbonisation is growing but its going to get harder great britains decline in coal use has rapidly accelerated its decarbonisation efforts annual coal power station emissions have shrunk over the past five years from 129 to 19 million tonnes of co 2 and helped reduce the average carbon intensity of electricity generation to a record low of 195 gkwh last quarter however this rapid pace of decarbonisation is unlikely to be sustained as growth in renewables faces a plateau the countrys current nuclear capacity reaches retirement and the target of moving beyond coal by 2025 is completed renewable sources now account for a steady 25 of annual electricity generation these sources largely came onto the system through policies such as the governments renewables obligation which is now closed to entrants contracts for differences the future of which is uncertain for mature technologies like onshore wind and solar and feedin tariffs for rooftop solar installations which will close in april 2019 the end of these initiative paints a hazy picture of how future renewable capacity will be brought into the system nuclear capacity also looks unlikely to expand at the rate needed to plug gaps in demand with half of the countrys fleet expected to close for safety reasons by 2025 the hinkley point c nuclear power station meanwhile is only expected to come online at the end of that year  read the full article here has britains power sector decarbonisation stalled ramsgate kent during summer 2018 heatwave weather will continue to play a major part in renewable generation if the first quarter of 2018 was defined by low temperatures and heavy snowfall  the second quarter saw the impact of the opposite in weather conditions from 23 june a heatwave set in around the country that saw temperatures increase by 33 o c in a week driving demand to jump 860 mw  the equivalent of an extra 25 million households or an area the size of scotland  the increase in demand isnt as drastic as when cold fronts hit but if summers continue to get hotter this could change today wintertime demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it drops below 14 o c as electric heaters are plugged in to aid largely gasbased centralheating systems when the mercury rises however demand increases by 350 mw for every degree rise over 20 o c as businesses turn on air conditioning and the countrys refrigerators work harder these heatwave spikes are at the moment more easily dealt with than winter storms while the beast from the east saw demand reaching a peak of 533 gw junes topped out at 325 gw the clear skies and long days of june also meant solar pv generation soared making up for the wind drought caused by the highpressure weather wind output floated between 03 gw and 43 gw in june far below its quarter peak to 13 gw however solar made up for this by peaking past 8 gw for 13 days in june and setting a new record of 939 gw at lunchtime on 27 june read the full articles how the heat wave affects electricity demand the summer wind drought and smashing solar explore the data in detail by visiting

july 2018 opinion 165 degrees is the goldilocks temperature for the brits  not hot enough for aircon not too cold to put the heating on in march we saw how the beast from the east caused a surge in demand now the long summer heatwave is doing the same june 23 rd marked the start of the heatwave with daytime temperatures surpassing 30c in scotland and wales the last week of june was 33c warmer than the previous week and demand was 860 mw higher see chart below  this rise is equivalent to power demand from an extra 25 million households this reflects the growing role of air conditioning and refrigeration in shops and cooling for data centres global electricity demand from cooling is rising dramatically and is seen as a  blind spot  in the global energy system this will become more important as global temperatures and more importantly global incomes rise however it is easier to deal with than cold spells during winter because demand is low and solar pv output is high below 14c demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it gets colder as buildings need more heating around a tenth of british homes have electric heating as do half of commercial and public buildings  and while the uk is not synonymous with air conditioners demand rises by 350 mw for each degree that temperature rises above 20c this effect may well grow stronger in the coming years national grid expect that the peak load from air conditioners will triple in the coming decade perhaps events such as the current prolonged heatwave may spur more households to invest in air conditioning read the press release

investors balancing for the renewable future 6 july 2018 power generation its not news to say great britains electricity system is changing low carbon electricity sources are on course to go from 22 of national generation in 2010 to 58 by 2020 as installation of wind and solar systems continue to grow but while there has been much change in the sources fuelling electricity generation the system itself is still adapting to this transformation when the national grid was first established in the 1920s it was designed with coal and big spinning turbines in mind it meant that just about every megawatt coming onto the system was generated by thermal power plants as a result the mechanisms keeping the entire system stable  from the way frequency and voltage is managed to how to start up the country after a mass black out  relied on the same technology these ancillary services  those that stabilise the system  are crucial to maintaining a balanced electricity system ancillary services are needed to make sure demand is met by generation and that generation gets from one place to the next with no interruptions explains ian foy head of ancillary services at drax because whats important is that all demand must be met instantaneously in todays power system however weather dependent technology like offshore wind and home solar panels are increasingly making up the countrys electricity generation their intermittency or variability is in turn impacting both the stability of the grid and how ancillary services are provided running a large power system with as much as 85 intermittent generation  for example on a very windy clear sunny day  is thought to be achievable it isnt a scenario anticipated for the large island of great britain but to deal with the fastpace of change on its power system which recently managed to briefly achieve 47 wind in its fuel mix  there is a need to develop new techniques technologies and ways of working to change how the countrys grid is balanced new storage tech takes on balancing services one of the technologies thats expected to provide an increasing amount of balancing services is gridscale batteries  one stabilisation function offered by batteries and other electricity storage options is to provide reserve at times when demand peaks or troughs this matches electricity demand and generation combined with their ability to respond quickly to changes in frequency batteries can be a significant source of frequency response batteries can also absorb and generate reactive power  which can then be deployed to push voltage up or down when it starts to creep too far from the 400kv or 275kv target depending on the powerlines the electricity is travelling along needed to safely move electricity around the grid the challenge with batteries is that the quantity of megawatt hours mwh required to compensate for intermittency is very large the difference between the peak and trough on any day may be more than 20 gw for several hours see for yourself at electric insights  the significant price reductions in battery storage apply to technologies with short duration or low volume mwhs these are the technologies which have been developed at scale recently but will probably struggle to make up in any large quantity any shortfalls in generation resulting from prolonged periods of low intermittent generation a challenge currently being addressed relates to maintenance of battery state of charge this is a consequence of battery storage having a cycle efficiency of less than 100 this means that losses from continuous charging and recharging will have to be replenished from the available generation to avoid batteries going empty and being unavailable for grid services ultralow carbon advances rather than relying on batteries to provide ancillary services to support intermittent generation technical advancements are allowing the wind and solar facilities  which are generating more and more of the countrys electricity  to do so themselves the traditional photovoltaic pv inverters found on solar arrays were initially designed to push out as much active or real power as possible however new smart pv inverters are capable of providing or absorbing reactive power when it is needed to help control voltage as well as continuing to provide active power the major advantage of smart inverters is the limited equipment update required to existing solar farms to allow them to offer reactive power control the challenge here is that pv is embedded in distribution systems and therefore reactive services they provide may not cure all the problems on the transmission system similarly existing wind installations have traditionally focused on getting the greatest amount of megawatts from the available resources but with fewer thermal power stations on the grid ways of balancing the system with wind turbines are also being developed inertia is the force that comes from heavy spinning generators and acts as a damper on the system to limit the rate of change of frequency fluctuations while wind turbines have massive rotating equipment they are not connected to the grid in a way that they automatically provide inertia however research is exploring whats known as inertial response emulation that may allow wind turbines to offer faster frequency response this works through an algorithm that measures grid frequency and controls the power output of a wind turbine or whole farm to compensate for frequency deviations or quickly provide increases or decreases in power on the system inertial response emulation cannot be a complete substitute for inertia but can reduce the minimum required inertia on the system even in a future where the majority of the countrys electricity comes from renewable sources thermal generators may still be able to provide benefits to the system by running in synchronous compensation mode ie producing or consuming reactive power without real power however what is vitally important for the future of balancing services in great britain is a healthy transparent and investable market for generators demand side response and storage whether connected on the transmission or distribution networks a market for the future grid one of the primary needs of balancing service providers is greater transparency into how national grid procures and pays for services currently national grid does not pay for inertia with it becoming more important to grid stability incentive is needed to encourage generators with the capability to provide it those technologies that cant provide inertia could be encouraged to research and develop ways they could do so in the future standardising the services needed will help ensure providers deliver balancing products to the same level needed to support the grid it would also benefit from fixed requirements and timings for such services bundling related products such as reserve and frequency control and active power and voltage management will also offer operational and cost efficiencies to the providers driving investment in balancing services for the future ultimately requires the availability of longerterm contracts to offer financial certainty for the providers and their investors bridge to the future click to view larger graphic for the challenges of decarbonisation to be met in a socially responsible way great britains power system must be operated at as low a cost as possible to consumers with new technologies almost anything could be possible but operating them has to be affordable

coaltobiomass conversion under the renewables obligation  ro scheme  thermal power technologies such as gas that has proven capabilities in ancillary services markets can at least be used in a

joined at the volts what role will interconnectors play in great britains electricity future 14 june 2018 power generation for more than 50 years great britain has been electrically connected to europe the first undersea interconnector between british shores and the continent was installed in 1961 and could transmit 160 megawatts mw of power today there is 4 gigawatts gw in interconnector capacity between great britain france ireland and the netherlands  and theres more on the way by the mid2020s some estimates suggest interconnector capacity will reach 18 gw thanks to new connections with germany denmark and norway the government expects imports to account for 22 of electricity supply by 2025 up from 6 in 2017  this increased connectivity is often held up as a means of securing electricity supply and while this is largely true it doesnt tell the full story in fact this plan could risk creating a dependency on imported electricity at a time when flexibility and diversity of power sources are key to meeting demand in an increasingly decentralised  decarbonising system great britain needs to be connected and have a close relationship with its european neighbours but this should not come at the expense of its power supply power price or ongoing decarbonisation efforts yet these are all at risk with too great a reliance on interconnection to secure a long term stable power system tomorrow these issues need to be addressed today unfair advantage at their simplest interconnectors are good for the power system they connect the relatively small british isles to a significant network of electricity generators and consumers this is good for both helping secure supply and for broadening the market for domestic power but the system in which interconnectors operate isnt working since 2015 interconnectors have had the right to bid against domestic generators in the governments capacity market auctions the government uses these auctions to award contracts to generators that can provide electricity to the grid through existing or proposed facilities the original intention was also to allow foreign generators to participate as an interim step the transmission equipment used to supply foreign generators power into the gb market  interconnectors  have been allowed to take part in practice interconnectors end up with an economic advantage over other electricity producers firstly interconnectors are not required to pay to use the national transmission system like domestic generators are this charge is paid to national grid to cover the cost of installation and maintenance of the substations pylons poles and cables that make up the transmission network plus the cost of system support services keeping the grid stable  interconnectors are exempt from paying these despite the fact imported electricity must be transported and balanced within england scotland and wales in the same way as domestic electricity secondly interconnectors dont pay carbon tax in the gb energy market the carbon price floor is one of the cornerstones of great britains decarbonisation efforts and has enabled the countrys electricity system to become the seventh least carbonintense of the worlds most power intensive systems in 2016 up from 20 th in 2012 interconnectors themselves do not emit carbon dioxide co 2  in great britain but this does not mean they are emissionfree frances baseload electricity comes largely from its lowcarbon nuclear fleet but the netherlands and ireland are still largely dependent on fossil fuels for power because the european grid is so interconnected even countries which dont yet have a direct link to great britain such as germany with its high carbon lignite power stations also contribute to the european grids supply the neuconnect link is planned to connect germany and gb in the late 2020s not being subject to the uks carbon tax  only to the european unions emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on co 2  imported power can be offered cheaper than domestic lowercarbon power this not only puts great britain at risk of importing higher carbon electricity in some cases but also exporting carbon emissions to our neighbours when their power price is higher to that in the gb market this prevents domestic generators from winning contracts to add capacity or develop new projects that would secure a longerterm stable future for great britain in fact introducing more interconnectivity could in some cases end up leading to supply shortages be they natural or market induced under peak pressure the contracts awarded to interconnectors in the capacity market auctions treat purchased electricity as guaranteed but any power station can break down  any intermittent renewable can stop generating at short notice supply from neighbouring countries is just the same research by aurora found that historically interconnectors have often delivered less power than the system operator assumed they would and on occasion exported power at times of peak demand this happened recently during the beast of the east  when low temperatures across the continent drove electricity demand soaring this europeanwide cold spell meant ireland and france which has a largely electrified heating system experienced huge electricity demand spikes driving power prices up as a result for much of the time between 27 and 28 february great britain exported electricity to france to capitalise on its high prices this not only led to more fossil fuels being burned domestically but it meant less power was available domestically at a time when our own demand was exceptionally high even when the interconnectors do flow in our direction they cannot provide crucial grid services like inertia so our large thermal power stations are often still needed it is difficult to say for certain how interconnectors will function during times of high demand in the future due to a lack of longterm data but that which we do know and have seen suggests they dont always play to the countrys best interests there is still an important role for interconnectors on the great britain grid but to deliver genuine value the system needs to be fairer so they dont skew the market where interconnectors fit into the future interconnectors bring multiple benefits to our power system they can help with security of supply by bringing in more power at times of systems stress with the right system in place they can help reduce the need to rely on domestic fossil fuels and enable more renewable installation and if electricity is being generated cheaper abroad they can also create opportunities to reduce costs for consumers however the correct framework must be put in place for interconnectors to bring such benefits while allowing for domestic projects that can help secure the countrys electricity supply as a start interconnectors should be reclassified  known as derating  to compete with technologies on an equal footing draxs proposed ocgt plants which can very quickly start up and provide the grid with the power and balancing services it needs  before switching off again could offer a more reliable route to grid stability than such overwhelming dependence on interconnectors will in addition the coaltogas and battery plans at drax power station would prove to be a highly flexible national asset new gas and interconnectors should be able to compete fairly with one another policymakers should facilitate a system that allows competing technologies to exist in a cost beneficial way both interconnectors and domestic thermal power generators can play their part in creating stability transitioning towards a decarbonised economy and fitting within the uks industrial strategy in 1961 when the first interconnector was switched on it marked a new age of continental cooperation five decades on we should not forget this goal in an ever more complex grid what we need is different technologies systems and countries working together to achieve a flexible stable and cleaner power system for everyone tags decarbonisation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  energy policy  energy prices  investors  national grid keeping the electricity systems voltage stable 15 may 2018 power generation in daytoday life the electricity system normally plays a consistent unfluctuating role powering the same things in the same way however behind the scenes electricity generation is a constant balancing act to keep the grid stable power stations themselves are like living animals  in need of continuous adjustment transmission networks need continual maintenance and keeping the whole grid at a frequency of 50 hz takes careful monitoring and finetuning one of the other constant challenges for great britains electricity system is keeping voltage under control keeping the volts in check voltage is a way of expressing the potential difference in charge between two points in an electrical field in more simplistic terms it acts as the pressure that pushes charged electrons known as the current through an electric circuit great britains national grid system runs at a voltage of 400 kilovolts kv and 275kv scotland also uses 132kv it is then reduced in a series of steps by transformers to levels suitable for supply to customers for example 11kv for heavy industrial or 230 volts v when delivered to homes by regional distribution networks  keeping the voltage steady requires careful management a deviation as small as 5 above or below can lead to increased wear and tear of equipment  and additional maintenance costs or even largescale blackouts power stations such as drax can control the voltage level through whats known as reactive power  if voltage is high absorbing reactive power back into the generator reduces it says drax lead engineer gary preece by contrast generating reactive power increases the voltage reactive power is made in an electricity generator alongside active power the electricity that powers our lights and devices and national grid can request generators such as drax to either absorb or produce more of it as its needed to control voltage so how is a generator spinning at 3000 rpm switched from producing to absorbing reactive power all it takes is the turn of a tap absorbing reactive power taps along a transformer allow a certain portion of the winding  which make up a transformers active part with the core  to be selected or unselected this allows the transformer to alter whats known as the phase angle which refers to the relationship between apparent power made up of reactive power and active power and active power this change in the phase angle regulates the power factor power factor is measured between 0 and 1 between 1 and 0 lagging means a generator is producing reactive power and increasing overall voltage whereas between 1 and 0 leading means it is absorbing reactive power and reducing voltage that absorbed reactive power doesnt just disappear rather it transfers to heat at the back end of the power stations generator temperatures can be in excess of 60 degree celsius says preece theres also a lot of vibration caused by the changes in flux at the end of the generator this can cause long term damage to the winding as the generators continue to produce active power while absorbing reactive power the conditions begin to reduce efficiency and if prolonged begin to damage the machines draxs advantage here is that it operates six turbines all of which are capable of switching between delivering or absorbing reactive power or vice versa in under two minutes voltage management in a changing grid the changing nature of great britains energy supply means voltage management is trickier than ever voltage creeps up when power lines are lightly loaded the increase of decentralised generation  such as solar panels and smallscale onshore wind farms operating to directly supply specific localities or a number of customers embedded on regional electricity networks  means this is becoming more common around the grid this creates a greater demand for the kind of reactive power absorption and voltage management that drax power station carries out gridscale batteries are being increasingly developed as a means of storing power from weather dependent renewable sources this power can then be pumped onto the grid when demand is high in a similar manner these storage systems can also absorb reactive power when theres too much on the system and discharge it when its needed  bringing the voltage down and up respectively the trouble is gridscale battery storage systems need to be absolutely huge and a 100 mw facility would be close to the size of football field and double stacked explains preece they are also not synchronised to the grid as a thermal turbine generator would be subsequently there is no contribution to inertia  as great britains power system continues to evolve maintaining its stability also needs to adapt where once the challenge lay in keeping voltage high and enough reactive power on the grid today its absorbing reactive power and keeping voltage down  it highlights the need for thermal generators that are designed to quickly switch between generating and absorbing to support the wider network this story is
