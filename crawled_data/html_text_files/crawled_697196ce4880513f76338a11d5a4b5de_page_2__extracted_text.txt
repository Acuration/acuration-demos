a transformational deal  our acquisition of canadian biomass pellet producer pinnacle renewable energy im very excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the drax family  together we will build on what we have already achieved having become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and the uks largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal the deal positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business  making us a truly international business trading biomass from north america to europe and asia it also advances our strategy to increase our self supply reduces our biomass production costs and creates a longterm future for sustainable biomass  a renewable energy source that the uns ipcc says will be needed to achieve global climate targets its also an important milestone in draxs ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our pioneering negative emissions technology beccs  thats because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax negative emissions from beccs are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery inside a pinnacle pellet mill we already know pinnacle well  it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with drax our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so im looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together we will benefit from pinnacles scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues in 2019 pinnacles production cost was 20 lower than draxs completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 49 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets at 17 plants in locations across western canada and the us south  up from 16mt now it also expands our access to three major north american fibre baskets and four export facilities giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply this positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by demand in asia biomass wood pellet storage dome drax power station we believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with c67 billion of longterm contracts with high quality asian and european customers including drax and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027 drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio we believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics helping to reduce distance time carbon footprint and cost train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station importantly  there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group we recognise that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern us where we currently operate in line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with environmental groups indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas we are determined to create a longterm future for sustainable biomass and deliver beccs  the negative emissions technology that will be needed

drax group 27 january 2021 opinion tackling climate change requires global collaboration as a ukus sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated collaborative energy system the technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions such as the us south where our american communities operate carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help drax to be carbon negative by 2030  an ambition i announced at cop25  just over a year ago in madrid will gardiner announcing draxs carbon negative ambition at cop25 in madrid december 2019 our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but are also a vital economic force as the world begins to recover from the effects of covid19 engineer inside the turbine hall of drax power station we all want the uks recovery to be a green recovery  one which benefits the north along with the whole of the country government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station  for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south  we are also partnered with 11 other organisations in the uks humber region to develop a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200000 jobs around the uk in 2039 the expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for ccus and biomass sustainability  clear longterm policies are essential here not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment these are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact co 2 emissions and lives of people engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station at drax we directly employ almost 3000 people in the us and uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cuttingedge carbon capture and removal technology we can then share our expertise with

bioenergy these differ to nonrenewable energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric

zero economy and there will be ever increasing periods where great britain is powered by only zero carbon generation to support this the electricity system operator is putting in place the systems products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025 achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing which has been central in delivering uk leadership in the move away from coal and has led to uk electricity emissions falling by over 63 between 2012 and 2019 alone it is thanks to successive governments commitment to robust carbon pricing that the uk is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago  before the birth of the steam locomotive a consistent robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment lowcarbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in british history in the first quarter of 2020 yet even with the demise of coal and the progress in offshore wind more needs to be done to drive the remaining emissions from electricity as its use is extended across the economy wwwdraxcomuscaptureit in the nearterm in combination with other policies continued robust carbon pricing on electricity will incentivise the continued deployment of low carbon

as national determined contributions ndcs these sit under the umbrella of the paris agreement goals and set out individual targets for individual countries with many countries still reeling from the effects of covid19 the question is which countries are actually on track to meet them what are the goals the ndcs of each country represent its efforts and goals to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change these incorporate various targets from decarbonisation and forestry to coastal preservation and financial aims while all countries need to reduce emissions to meet the paris agreement targets not all have an equally sized task the principle of differentiated responsibility acknowledges that countries have varying levels of emissions capabilities and economic conditions the universal ecological fund outlined the emissions breakdown of the top four emitters showing that combined they account for 56 of global greenhouse gas emissions china is the largest

management and arboriculture what is carbon dioxide 18 september 2020 carbon capture what is co 2  carbon dioxide or co 2  is a colourless and odourless naturally occurring gas in the earths atmosphere which is made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms  as a greenhouse gas ghg it traps heat making sure the planet isnt uninhabitably cold however fast rising levels of co 2 and other longlasting ghgs in the atmosphere are currently causing global warming to occur at an alarmingly rapid rate what is the carbon cycle carbon is the basis of all life on earth  it is a key ingredient in almost everything on the planet as the earth has a closed atmosphere there has always been the same amount of carbon on the earth but it is in a constant state of change transitioning from gas to solid to liquid and moving between the atmosphere and the earth this process is called the carbon cycle  and it is key to ensuring the earth is capable of sustaining life co 2 forms one part of this process and makes up the largest available source of carbon on earth how is co 2 made carbon is stored in oceans soil and living things and is released from this storage into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together through a number of processes including the decay of organic matter the combustion of materials such as wood coal and natural gas through the breathing of humans and animals and from events such as volcanic eruptions how does co 2 affect the planet an abundance of co 2 in the earths atmosphere means more heat gets trapped which in turn contributes to a rise in global temperatures and climate change  this acceleration in carbon entering the atmosphere began during the industrial revolution around the 1800s when fossil fuels were mined and burned to create energy which released longstored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  from the beginning of the industrial revolution until today the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per million to 387 parts per million which constitutes a 39 increase  today co 2 levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together when organic materials containing carbon are burned wood coal and natural gas how can countries reduce co 2 in the atmosphere according to the paris climate agreement  nations must work to limit warming of the globe to be well under two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in the first half of 2015 the earth registered a one degree celsius rise in global temperatures above preindustrial levels which means drastic and meaningful action must be taken to decarbonise within the next few years there are many ways to reduce the earths carbon footprint including reforestation and using alternative ways to generate energy that dont rely on fossil fuels for example wind  solar  biomass and hydro can all provide sustainable carbonneutral and low carbon sources of electricity technology such as carbon capture and storage ccs can capture carbon permanently storing co 2 from industries in which some co 2 emissions remain by combining ccus with biomass energy bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs it is even possible to generate negative emissions where more co 2 is removed from the atmosphere than is emitted  co 2 fast facts in the 1960s the growth of co 2 occurred at 06 parts per million per year in the last 10 years the rate has been 23 parts per million per year the average human breathes out 93 kilograms of co 2 per year  however our breathing only contributes 065 billion tonnes of carbon returned to the atmosphere which is 001 of the amount released by fossil fuels each year trees absorb co 2 in the atmosphere and release it in the form of oxygen making them vitally important in the worlds fight against climate change in the us alone forests absorb 13 of the

in modern times having fallen by threequarters compared to the same period ten years ago the average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kwh of electricity consumed over the quarter the carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just 18 gkwh in the middle of the spring bank holiday  clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix together nuclear and renewables produced 90 of britains electricity leaving just 28 gw to come from fossil fuels the generation mix over the spring bank holiday weekend highlighting the mix on the sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record national grid and other gridmonitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 gkwh at that time that was still a record low but very different from the electric insights numbers so why the discrepancy these sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation  as opposed to consumption  not all the electricity we consume is generated in britain and not all the electricity generated in britain is consumed here should the emissions from power stations in the netherlands count towards our carbon footprint if they are generating power consumed in our homes earths atmosphere would say yes as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities co 2 has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced on that bank holiday afternoon britain was importing 2 gw of electricity from france and belgium which are mostly powered by lowcarbon nuclear we were exporting threequarters of this 15 gw to the netherlands and ireland while they do have sizeable shares of renewables they also rely on coal power britains exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources so the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders we estimate that 1190 tonnes of co 2 were produced here 165 were emitted in producing our imports and 730 avoided through our exports in the longterm it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out over the whole quarter carbon emissions would be 153gkwh with our measure or 151 gkwh with productionbased accounting but it does matter on the hourly timescale consumption based accounting swings more widely imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24 th  but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 gkwh when renewable output is high in britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it and this helps to clean their power systems when renewables are low britain will import if power from ireland and the continent is lower cost but it may well be higher carbon two measures for the carbon intensity of british electricity over the bank holiday weekend and surrounding days this speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy should we use production or consumption based accounting with production by far the most common measure  the uk is doing very well and overall emissions are down 32 so far this century with consumptionbased accounting its a very different story and theyre only down 13   this is because we import more from abroad everything from manufactured goods to food to data when streaming music and films online either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions on the one hand productionbased accounting  britain could be producing 100 clean power but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand  that should not be classed as zero carbon as its pushing the problem elsewhere on the other hand consumptionbased accounting  it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running if we got to 96 low carbon 1300 mw of gas running we would be down at 25 gkwh then if we imported fully from france and sent it to the netherlands and ireland wed get down to 0 gkwh regardless of how you measure carbon intensity it is important to recognise that britains electricity is cleaner than ever the hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception by continuing to expand renewable generation preparing the grid for their integration and introducing negative emissions technologies such as beccs  bioenergy with carbon capture

policy  national grid what are negative emissions 21 august 2020 carbon capture what are negative emissions in order to meet the longterm climate goals laid out in the paris agreement there is a need to not only reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases into the air but actively work to remove the excess carbon dioxide co 2  currently in the atmosphere and the co 2 that will continue to be emitted as economies work to decarbonise the process of greenhouse gas removal ggr or co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere is possible through negative emissions  where more co 2 is taken out than is being put into the atmosphere negative emissions can be achieved through a range of naturebased solutions or through manmade technologies designed to remove co 2 at scale what naturebased solutions exist to remove co 2 from the atmosphere one millenniaold way of achieving negative emissions is forests  trees absorb carbon when they grow either converting this to energy and releasing oxygen or storing it over their lifetime this makes forests important tools in limiting and potentially reducing the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere planting new forests and regenerating forests has a positive effect on the health of the world as a result however this can also go beyond forests on land vegetation underwater has the ability to absorb and store co 2  and seagrasses can in fact store up to twice as much carbon as forests on land  an approach to negative emissions called blue carbon did you know bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world  its thick forests absorb three times the amount of co 2 the small country emits what manmade technologies can deliver negative emissions many scientists and experts agree one of the most promising technologies to achieve negative emissions is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this approach uses biomass  sourced from sustainably managed forests  to generate electricity as the forests used to create biomass absorb co 2 while growing the co 2 released when it is used as fuel is already accounted for  making the whole process low carbon by then capturing and storing any co 2 emitted often in safe underground deposits the process of electricity generation becomes carbon negative  as more carbon has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added direct air carbon capture and storage daccs is an alternative technological solution in which co 2 is captured directly from the air and then transported to be stored or used while this could hold huge potential the technology is currently in its infancy and requires substantial investment to make it a more widespread practice the process of removing co 2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions because more co 2 is being taken out of the atmosphere than added into it how much negative emissions are needed according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change  negative emissions technologies could be required to capture 20 billion tonnes of carbon annually to help prevent catastrophic changes in the climate between now and 2050 negative emissions fast facts humans are currently moving carbon from the lithosphere the crust of the earth to the biosphere where we live at 100 times the rate of the natural carbon cycle there is enough sustainable biomass available to the uk to support beccs to remove 51 megatonnes of co 2 every year by 2050 according to the committee on climate change more companies are beginning to invest in negative emissions technologies with apple conserving mangroves  stripe allocating 1 million annually to purchasing sequestered carbon and microsoft declaring it will be carbon negative by 2030 go deeper drax sets worldfirst ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 negative

faqs frequently asked questions  negative emissions  technology what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture and storage ccs is the process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a largescale source  for example a power station or factory  and then permanently storing them carbon capture usage and storage ccus is where captured carbon dioxide co 2  may be used rather than stored in other industrial processes or even in the manufacture of consumer products  how is carbon captured carbon can be captured either precombustion  where it is removed from fuels that emit carbon before the fuel is used or postcombustion  where carbon is captured directly from the gases emitted once a fuel is burned precombustion carbon capture involves solid fossil fuels being converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide under heat pressure the separated co 2 is captured and transported to be stored or used postcombustion carbon capture uses the addition of other materials such as solvents to separate the carbon from flue gases produced as a result of the fuel being burned the isolated carbon is then transported normally via pipeline to be stored permanently  usually deep underground  or used for other purposes carbon capture and storage traps and removes carbon dioxide from large sources and most of that co 2 is not released into the atmosphere what can the carbon be used for once carbon is captured it can be stored permanently or used in a variety of different ways for example material including carbon nanofibres and bioplastics can be produced from captured carbon and used in products such as airplanes and bicycles while several startups are developing methods of turning captured co 2 into animal feed captured carbon can even assist in the largescale production of hydrogen  which could be used as a carbonneutral source of transport fuel or as an alternative to natural gas in power generation where can carbon be stored carbon can be stored in geological reserves  commonly naturally occurring underground rock formations such as unused natural gas reservoirs saline aquifers or unmineable coal beds the process of storage is referred to as sequestration the underground storage process means that the carbon can integrate into the earth through mineral storage  where the gas chemically reacts with the minerals in the rock formations and forms new solid minerals that ensure it is permanently and safely stored carbon injected into a saline aquifer dissolves into the water and descends to the bottom of the aquifer in a process called dissolution storage according to the global ccs institute  over 25 million tonnes of carbon captured from the power and industrial sectors was successfully and permanently stored in 2019 across sites in the usa norway and brazil what are the benefits of carbon storage co 2 is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in our atmosphere and therefore contributes to global warming by capturing and storing carbon it is being taken out of the atmosphere which reduces greenhouse gas levels and helps mitigate the effects of climate change carbon capture fast facts ccus is an affordable way to lower co 2 emissions  fighting climate change would cost 70 more without carbon capture technologies the largest carbon capture facility in the world is the petra nova plant in texas which has captured a total of 5 million tonnes of co 2  since opening in 2016 drax power station is trialling europes biggest bioenergy carbon capture usage and storage project beccs which could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year by the mid 2030s delivering a huge amount of the negative emissions the uk needs to meet net zero go
