power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station tag drax power station the problem solver 22 january 2017 power generation one of the things i like about my job is working through the challenges we get on a daily basis and finding a solution explains adam nicholson process performance section head at drax power station  that eagerness to find solutions makes him the ideal candidate for his current job managing daytoday improvements at drax im responsible for the team which ensures the plant operates at optimum efficiency he says his team make sure the turbines boiler emissions combustion and mills are not just working but running as smoothly as possible its a job that brings up constant challenges its ultimately what i became an engineer for he says to follow that problemsolving thirst through earlier in his career nicholson was involved in one of the plants biggest problemsolving missions converting it from running exclusively on coal to also run on compressed wood pellets  it was a unique test  one that required starting from scratch there wasnt a bank of existing knowledge that nicholson and his fellow engineers could call upon we did a lot of testing to learn more about the fuel he explains we had to understand how to get it to the boiler how to process it before we put it in how to convert the mills and then how exactly the combustion would work some of that learning involved experimenting with unorthodox solutions to complex problems the dog tunnel one of the big problems with biomass is you cant expose it to as high a temperature as you can coal nicholson explains this presented a challenge when it came to pulverising it before fuel at the power station can be combusted a set of mills pulverises it into a fine powder using a ring of rotating heavyduty balls  this fuel powder is then dried inside the mill with a mix of hot air drawn from the boiler house and cool air but a fundamental difference between coal and biomass meant this process had to change with coal the air can enter the mills at about 300 degrees with biomass if you get much above about 180 degrees the biomass will set on fire says nicholson as part of the rd phase he needed to work out a way to cool the mills down on a temporary basis we all took a big gulp and thought how are we going to do this part of the problem was the existing ducts werent big enough to deliver enough cool air to the mills to lower their temperature to a safe range nicholson improvised a solution it was known as the dog tunnel he says if he could get a temporary larger air supply to the mills it could provide more cool air and lower the overall temperature allowing the testing to be conducted so he found a company that could supply industrial flexible ducting which he connected to a larger cold air duct and then fed through to a mill to deliver more cool air as its informal name suggests the result didnt look like much but it worked it didnt look like a finished solution but the theory behind it was sound for occasions like this we had to think lets just do it prove it and then we can work on a permanent solution thats ultimately what i became an engineer for to follow that problemsolving thirst through the next challenge now the power station is successfully producing more than half of its electricity from biomass nicholsons daytoday responsibilities lie in ensuring safe operations and driving process efficiencies to do this he keeps tabs on the combustion process  for example by using thermal imaging cameras to monitor the inside of the furnace  and tweaks it to get as much energy as possible from the biomass fuel but at a site as large and complex as drax there will always be new engineering challenges that require inventive thinking often you dont know how youre going to do something until you do a bit more work and try and understand the problem nicholson says were nowhere near the end of our learning curve tags careers  drax power station  technology taming the electric beast power generation its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance says gareth newton as a mechanical engineer in one of the power stations maintenance teams hes a man with a closer eye on that animal than most and when something does need fixing or improving its his job to make sure it happens its a task that keeps him busy on top of the teams ive got a team servicing the filter fans ive got a team doing a filter change on a biomass unit then ive got another company doing a pipework replacement on a discharge line for me somebody else is doing a service on the belt cleaners newton says listing half a typical days responsibilities on any given day he oversees a number of different teams that carry out a variety of maintenance tasks and more often than not that list is a long one hes a part of the materials handling team who deal with all the material arriving and leaving the power station this includes the biomass and coal fuel coming in and the ash gypsum and other byproducts from the generation process going out it means he has a hand in the maintenance of almost all parts of the plant from the compressed wood pellet storage domes to the boiler with such a broad perspective of such a complex plant he knows its not always the things you expect to fail that need fixing monitoring the machine its a machine  its being used its not a showpiece or something in a museum its real and every now and then it will throw a gear out and stop he says those failures dont always happen to a schedule  so when something does go wrong it can be unexpected you might have a 50000 gearbox sat in the stores ready and waiting to replace a faulty one but it will be the 10 probe on a conveyer belt you never thought would break that fails and holds the whole system up he says when something like that happens he adds its not always about having the exact tool that can fix it right there and then its about thinking out of the box the biggest part of this job and i think its one of the biggest parts of heavy industry engineering is not fixing or modifying things with what youve got he says its about using what you havent got to try and engineer your way out he continues if you havent got a tool or part that you need can you make something new can you find a way to make it work or do you even need it its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance keeping your hands dirty newton grew up around engineering his father ran a salvage yard and precious metals business and would bring back broken bits of machinery for the kids to fix as toys ive always had dirty hands he says its something thats stuck with him today even though he now spends a large proportion of his time monitoring jobs at a computer or moving between teams its the practical side of the job that keeps him interested the best part of the job is working with your hands and even though the demands of the living animal that is drax can sometimes keep him on site longer than his working hours its a beast hes happy to look after its a job you either love or hate if you didnt enjoy the engineering side you probably wouldnt like it because theres a lot of ingenuity and thinking on your feet needed he says but there are a lot of jobs out there that i wouldnt want tags careers  drax power station  technology the toolmaster power generation before drax power station was a part of andrew storrs career it was a part of his local environment when i was at school in selby they were building the second half of the station he says we could see them building the cooling towers out of the classroom windows but it wasnt until a careers advisor brought an old cine film of the power station into class that he considered working there part of the film was them stripping the turbine and i watched it and thought i want to do that he says today storr does more than strip the turbines hes part of the engineering team that oversees them  a job that needs to be taken seriously if the turbines off forget the rest of it were not generating electricity  he says weve got to make sure the turbine and the generator are absolutely as bulletproof as possible because weve only got one per unit considering the conditions each one comes under this is no easy task the turbine shaft weighs 300 tonnes and spins at 3000 rpm the high pressure turbine is 165 bar and temperaturewise the steam running through it making it spin is 565 degrees centigrade bulletproof is an understatement when it comes to carrying out maintenance on a turbine its more than likely youll have to visit storrs workshop fixing the governor the workshop hasnt always been there it all started fifteen years ago when a piece of equipment broke it was a turbine governor relay a precision hydraulic actuator that keeps the turbine spinning at the right speed drax needed a new one theyve got to be 100 reliable storr explains if they lose control of the turbine it can either come to a grinding halt or speed up too much and selfdestruct the team went in search of a replacement contacting a manufacturer who came back with a skyhigh quote but storrs boss at the time had another idea he asked whether storr could reverse engineer a full set of governor relays i made the fatal mistake of saying yeah so i set off with a few photographs and a handful of sketches storr explains what followed were sleepless nights and a lot of grey hair but in the end he managed to reproduce a full set that cost nearly half of the original quote better than that they worked perfectly today theyre on unit 5 doing the business building the workshop manufacturing the governor relays was a turning point storr and the team saw there could be further savings and benefits if they did more manufacturing or refurbishment inhouse they had the staff capable of doing it they just needed the facilities although there was some initial scepticism from some in the company drax armed storr with a small budget and he set out on building the workshop that was 15 years ago back then the workshop was designed to only refurbish equipment but it has since grown now they can manufacture too today when drax buys in equipment which is either very expensive or lacking in quality storrs team can modify it make it fit better last longer or improve its efficiency without sending it away from the plant and incurring extra costs were reaping the rewards were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility storr says we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people the workshop has given drax an edge when it comes to its engineering ability but storr remains modest about the achievement the thing is he says ive got a good boss and he will support you but i do see it as a bit of a feather in my cap tags careers  drax power station  technology the life of an electrical engineer power generation a station like drax doesnt run itself its six turbines generate nearly 4000mw of power when operating at full load unsurprisingly for a site that produces 7 of britains electricity needs the role of an electrical engineer is an important one  both when managing how power is connected to the highvoltage electricity transmission grid  and how the giant electrical machines generating the energy work it doesnt get much bigger than drax you need to be at the top of your game every day says lead engineer gary preece a man at the top of his game is a fair way to describe preece he has been an electrical engineer almost his entire life beginning as an apprentice working at the liverpool dockyards at age 16 preece has worked a range of increasingly demanding projects and roles including engineering consultancy and work for the royal navy on their type 26 global combat ship  where he was in charge of designing the onboard power infrastructure he became a member of the drax team five years ago life on the job on a station the size of drax you dont have a typical day there are just too many systems that can change status that can fail or that require immediate attention to remain operational its neverending preece says working as an electrical engineer in a plant the size of drax doesnt just mean getting called down to help out when a fuse blows his responsibilities as lead engineer encompass a broad range of functions theres lots to do theres a lot of handson work but theres also a lot of study work tasks can include scoping out planning and budgeting new projects working with contractors and suppliers fault analysis and power level studies this last role is what preece has come to like most about the job  working with sophisticated computer simulations to model output and crisis scenarios all so drax can operate at its optimal level with national grid i really enjoy a lot of the theoretical work he says we can do so much with this software of course there are times when he does have to fix things and in a power plant mistakes can have major consequences the energy levels in a power plant are so high that when something fails it usually fails spectacularly this means preece needs to be on call all day and all night if theres a technology failure he needs to be on the site finding out what went wrong and directing recovery efforts theres no hiding place if something goes wrong you have to fix it transforming draxs electric infrastructure sometimes individual projects can occupy all aspects of preece engineer thinker and planner one of the most challenging was when drax wanted to import a largely unused industrial generator transformer unit from kent to the station in yorkshire the transformer was split into three 200tonne components before transit preece and his team conducted extensive checks on the components and oil transformers contain oil to insulate the coil to evaluate the state of the machinery and these steps had to be repeated after every stage of the journey to ensure no damage had been sustained after checks were completed the units needed to be transported via the m25 motorway to ports in the south of england from which they would travel by ship on the north sea ready to be unloaded and transported to drax for installation however the team hit complications this time with the highways agency the structures were so heavy that we had to take a ferry from a different port because authorities were worried the bridges we were planning on using to get there wouldnt take the weight of the units we had to do a turnaround in the middle of the motorway getting the extra transformers installed gave the plant some important breathing room in the unlikely event of a failure some power stations dont have spares if there was a failure they could be out of commission for months says preece for a power station as large as drax that would be disastrous but even with the extra transformers on site the number of ways the electrical infrastructure at a power plant can go wrong is huge thats why experienced engineers like preece are as indispensable as the machinery itself drax is one of the best opportunities youre going to get for artistic licence it doesnt get much bigger tags careers  drax power station  technology these three inches of copper can power a city 17 january 2017 electrification a series of unassuming cables extend out of the turbine hall at drax power station  theyre easily missed but these few inches of copper play an instrumental role in powering your home surging through each one is enough electricity to power a city but the process of getting electricity from power station to plug isnt as simple as connecting one wire to a live turbine and another to your iphone charger we need an entire network of power stations cables and transformers linking the network when the country first became electrified it did so in stages each region of the uk was powered by its own selfcontained power supply that changed in 1926 when the uk set up the central electricity board and began what was at the time the biggest construction project britain had ever seen the national grid the project took 100000 men and five years to complete and when it was finished it connected 122 of the countrys most efficient power stations via 4000 miles of overhead cabling it had a sizeable effect in 1920 there were roughly 750000 electricity consumers by 1938 that had risen to 9 million the grid has changed in the 80 years thats passed but it remains the network that transfers power across the country to where its needed whenever its needed the strange thing about electricity is that you could live 10 miles from a power station and you cant be sure the electricity youre using is coming from that station says callan masters an engineer with national grid whose job it is to maintain and upgrade the network the whole system works together  the whole system has a demand and the whole system has to deliver it and to do this the network has to be able to deliver electricity quickly and efficiently masters explains it acts like a motorway for power riding the motorway for power the process of transporting electricity involves a series of stages the first of which is stepping up the voltage when electricity is transported via cables or wires it loses some of its energy as heat think of a lightbulb  as it illuminates it heats up because its losing energy the lower the current of that electricity however the less energy is lost so to reduce these losses when transporting power national grid transmits electricity at low currents which it can do by increasing its voltage at the power station electricity is generated at 23500 volts and is then stepped up to 400000 volts by a transformer the first of these is located on a substation on site at the power station once stepped up the electricity is transported through high transmission cables  before being stepped down via a transformer on the other end this stepped down electricity is passed onto a regional distribution system such as the overhead cables you might find on top of wooden poles before being stepped down a final time thats the role of a little transformer at the end of your street masters explains finally the electricity is transported via a final cable into your home  this time at 230 volts all this needs to happen incredibly quickly as thousands of kettles are switched on to herald the end of eastenders  the demand of electricity surges delivering that electricity at the touch of a button relies on a complex network but it starts with those inconspicuous few inches of copper at the power station tags

towers and their colossal tapering silhouettes are the most iconic element of the architecture of energy drax has 12 of them but a structure of that size poses a considerable maintenance challenge for the first time since draxs six towers were constructed between 1967 and 1974  one of them was in need of repair what could possibly go wrong no matter how well you build something things can go wrong after more than five decades of continuous operation each tower is made from concrete that varies in thickness from seven inches in the middle to around 15 inches at the top and bottom over time even a structure this solid can begin to weaken cooling towers are reinforced with steel bars embedded within their concrete which can rust and expand causing the concrete around it to crack  a process called spalling water vapour which passes through the towers on an almost constant basis can also migrate into poorly compacted concrete inside the tower and cause further cracks before the drax team could set about repairing the towers they needed to know where these cracks were inspecting a structure that tall needed an innovative solution it needed drones surveying the damage drones were used to make a comprehensive photographic record of the towers that could be inspected for signs of damage the drones also helped produce a 3d model of the structure to visualise the towers defects it was the firstofakind for the company the drone survey found that on tower 3b there were a number of cracked concrete patches on the towers that needed repairing and maintenance was scheduled to coincide with draxs 2016 outages  periods during the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the power station undergo routine repair work the next challenge was how to carry out these repairs on a structure taller than the statue of liberty to inspect the cooling tower drax created a 3d model with the help of cyberhawk  engineering at an altitude drax tower 3b is nearly 115 metres tall enough to fit in the statue of liberty or st pauls cathedral with room to spare how do you go about repairing a structure like this the answer steeplejacks steeplejacks were called so because originally they were the people used for scaling the side of church steeples to make repairs but a cooling tower presents a distinctly different structure that cant necessarily be climbed up from the bottom to scale it and make the repairs a different approach was needed drax reached out to specialist steeplejack contractors zenith structural access  who build devices that allow the scaling of industrialscale structures zeniths solution was to fix a metal frame to the top of the tower which then lowers a walkway suspended by strong metal cables down its side from a perch suspended from the top of tower 3b workmen were deployed to make the repairs  more than 100 metres above ground suspended in their cradles the teams sealed the surface of each crack and then injected resin to fix the cracks in the concrete shell where the concrete had spalled new specialist repair mortars were applied regular repairs with the identified defects on the tower fully repaired attention can now move on to others on site routine inspections using drones and binoculars have been planned to take place every three years these will monitor the condition of all the towers and allow for future maintenance to be planned in advance two more towers are already scheduled for repair in 2017s outages once again itll be case for engineering work at elevation tags biomass energy  cooling tower  drax power station  engineering  technology  visit us north yorkshire tops chart for renewable energy andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 8 april 2016 opinion a new survey from the green alliance and regen sw shows that selby in north yorkshire produces the most renewable energy of any area in england and wales as you can see drax s home tops the chart by a large margin thats because between three and four per cent of the uks electricity is generated from sustainable biomass here at drax power station weve already converted half the station to use compressed wood pellets that half of drax has reduced its carbon emissions by more than 80 per cent as a result but theres so much more drax could do to help the uk get more coal off the grid and if the green alliances next data visualization pitted renewables against fossil fuels a renewableonly drax as our countrys biggest power station would give low carbon technologies an even bigger share than would be the case today drax can not only generate more renewable power ourselves but also help solar and wind power to cope with demand as some of the older coal gas and nuclear plant retire over the coming years moving towards a balanced mix of renewables including further biomass upgrades at drax could save bill payers billions of pounds found research carried out by nera and imperial college london this was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main forms of renewable energy  wind solar and biomass the uk is already far below the european average when it comes to using wood for energy if the government made the right decision and levelled the playing field for biomass in the uk drax could help our country climb the table meet our national climate change targets more quickly and contribute to saving bill payers billions of pounds upgrading from coal to wood pellets is also ensuring drax group  which employs more than 1400 people  has a real future at the heart of the northern powerhouse however its not just for government to change the status quo  businesses have a role to play too many uk businesses have made firm commitments to limit and reduce their impact on the environment for all their use of energy is a critical area to consider and address some of the biggest electricity users such as thames water and manchester airport group are increasingly demanding renewable electricity drax groups haven power is proud to offer the only 100 guaranteed renewable electricity product in the market to businesses big and small perhaps thats what the green alliances next index could investigate  which businesses have taken practical steps towards a renewable future tags biomass energy  drax power station  electricity generation  yorkshire how to plug the electricity gap andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 26 january 2016 opinion by 2025 the uk will face a 4055 per cent gap between electricity supply and demand according to a report from the institute of mechanical engineers  the government has disputed imeches projection but its own forecasting suggests that uk electricity demand will be 19 higher in 2035 vs 2015  the alleged 2025 gap will be caused by the closure of coalfired power stations to meet targets for carbon reduction according to the imeche current plans to plug the gap by building new gasfired capacity are unrealistic it would require a staggering 30 new power stations to be planned and built from scratch within the next 10 years at drax we have already developed a solution we can do it quickly cheaply and safely in fact it would drastically reduce the time and money involved in building all of those 30 new gas power stations from scratch weve already adapted three of our coalfired generating units to use highdensity pellets made from compressed lowgrade wood and were using worldbeating technology developed by our own engineers here in the uk to do it in all around four or five per cent of the uks entire electricity needs every single day of the year are already being met thanks to our unique biomass technology at drax its an approach that could be adopted elsewhere in the country providing a huge contribution to plugging the electricity gap our highdensity compressed wood pellets are the only nonfossil fuel that can bring about these changes in the time we have left given the right support within two or three years we could convert the remaining three units at drax power station to run on biomass wood pellets with all six units converted plus lynemouth power station  which already has that future secured  and one or two other smaller biomass power stations around 10 per cent of the uks electricity could be generated using this technology well before 2025  long before new gasfired capacity could come on stream the costs involved would be dramatically lower too we invested around 650 million to convert three generating units develop a supply chain and build new storage at drax it is estimated that the equivalent in new combined cycle gas turbine power stations would cost more as it would be new rather than repurposed infrastructure energy hierarchy the imeche has developed an energy hierarchy listing five sustainabilityrelated priorities against which to judge any future energy strategy the two that focus on energy generation are a perfect fit in terms of coaltobiomass conversions at drax and lynemouth priority 3  utilisation of renewable sustainable resources high density compressed wood pellets are made from lowgrade wood sourced according to the highest levels of forestry conservation priority 5  utilisation of conventional resources as we do now using worldleading engineering skills and avoiding the need to build brand new power stations our coal units can be converted without the need for new national grid connections many of our european neighbours such as sweden and germany already use a far higher proportion of biomass to meet their energy needs
