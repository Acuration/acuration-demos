combination of a heatwave and an entertaining world cup campaign put big demands on great britains beer supplies this summer but europeanwide carbon dioxide co 2  shortages put a hold on that celebratory atmosphere as word spread that a lack of bubbles could result in the country running out of beer the drinks business managed to hold out but the threat of long term co 2 shortages still lingers over the continent one possible  and surprising  solution could lie in electricity generation thanks to the capturing and storing of its carbon emissions carbon capture and storage ccs is one of the key technologies in need of development to allow nations to meet their paris agreement goals it has the potential to stop massive amounts of emissions entering the atmosphere but it also raises the question what happens to all that carbon once its captured drax recently met with the british beer  pub association to discuss using some of the carbon it plans to capture in its upcoming trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs to keep the fizz in drinks its a novel solution to a potential problem but its just one of the many emerging possibilities being developed around the world smarter sneakers carbon capture is all about reducing carbon footprints  a phrase energy company nrg interpreted quite literally by creating the shoe without a footprint  the white trainer was created to showcase the abilities of carbon capture use and storage ccus and is made of 75 material produced from captured emissions that have been turned into polymers a molecular structure similar to plastics only five pairs of the sneakers were created as part of nrgs carbon xprize competition to find uses for captured carbon however they remain symbolic of the versatility offered by captured and stored carbon and its potential to contribute to the manufacture of everyday objects better furniture finding an alternative to plastics is one of the key ways of facilitating a move away from global dependencies on crude oil sustainable materials company newlight uses captured co 2 or methane emissions to create a bioplastic called aircarbon  a thermopolymer which means it can be melted down and reshaped the company has teamed up with ikea  which will buy 50 of the 23000 tonnes of bioplastic newlights plant produces per year its part of the swedish furniture giants efforts to increase the amount of recycled materials it uses and means upcycled carbon could soon be appearing in millions of homes around the world cleaner concrete if the shoes people walk around on can be made from captured carbon so too can the cities they walk within making concrete is a notoriously dirty process cement the main binding agent in concrete is thought to contribute to as much as 5 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions  but this could change thanks to clever use and implementation of carbon capture technology at one level ccs can be introduced to capture emissions from the manufacturing process on another the co 2 captured can be used as a raw material from which to create the concrete effectively locking in carbon and storing it for the long term teams of engineers material scientists and economists at ucla who have worked on the problem for 30 years have succeeded in creating construction materials from co 2 emissions in lab conditions using 3d printing technology now its just a matter of scaling it up to industrial usage a metal alternative carbon nanotubes are stronger than steel but lighter than aluminium which makes them a hugely useful material theyre currently used in jets sports cars and even in industrial structures but producing them can be expensive and until recently could not utilise co 2 for manufacture a team from george washington university is changing that its c2cnt technology splits captured co 2 into oxygen and carbon in a molten carbonate bath using electrolysis from here the carbon is repurposed into carbon nanotubes at a high rate and lower cost than previous methods future fuels transportation is one of the major emitters of carbon around the world so any way it can be reduced or reused in this field will be a huge positive carbon recycling company lanzatech has developed a way to do this via a process that uses anaerobic bacteria to ferment emissions into cleaner chemicals and fuels its first facility opening this year in china will create fuelgrade bioethanol that can be blended with gasoline to create vehicle fuel or even converted into jet fuel with 65 lower greenhouse gas emissions  aviation too can benefit from carbon recycling through the creation of synthetic crude oil and gas using co 2  technology company sunfire is developing processes that combine hydrogen set to become a major part of industry and transport and biogenic co 2  emissions from natural sources to create synthetic hydrocarbons that could fuel planes from silicon valley to valles marineris earth isnt the only place humans are innovating around carbon capture  at least right now with the race to send men and women to mars stepping up the challenges of dealing with its inhospitable atmosphere which is 95 co 2  and ensuring a minimal human impact to the planet are becoming more acute carbon capture and use presents an opportunity to tackle both californian company opus 12 has developed a device that recycles co 2 from ambient air and industrial emissions and turns it into fuels and chemicals using only electricity and water the device has the co 2 conversion power of 37000 trees or 64 football fields of dense forest packed into the volume of a suitcase and can convert co 2 into 16 different products in the longterm the technology might provide critical services for human colonies on the red planet by capturing and using co 2 from the atmosphere or any future marsbased factories the opus 12 device can also use ice buried on the planet in places that could be accessible to astronauts  to convert mars co 2 into plastic to make bricks and tools methane that can form rocket fuel and feedstocks for microbes to create medicine or food turning pollution into possibilities many of these technologies are in their infancy but the possibilities they present are very real in fact draxs upcoming trial of beccs will see it capture and store as much as a tonne of carbon every day the proliferation of this technology in industry and electricity production  and the resultant increase in captured carbon  will help encourage more companies to see co 2 emissions as an opportunity for revenue while helping countries meet their paris agreement emissions goals learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere from capture methods to storage and use across three continents these companies are showing promising results for ccus why experts think bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will be an essential part of the energy system the science of safely and permanently putting carbon in the ground the numbers must add up to enable negative emissions in a zero carbon future says drax group ceo

reactions could have a big future in electricity a roadmap for the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster protecting and creating jobs fighting climate change competing on the world stage can we
