after a year of smashing renewable records  great britains electricity system is less dependent on fossil fuels than ever before over the course of 2017 lowcarbon energy sources including nuclear as well as renewables accounted for half of all electricity production the finding comes from electric insights  a quarterly research paper on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the latest report highlights how great britains electricity system is rapidly moving away from fossil fuels with coal and gas dropping from 80 of the electricity mix in 2010 to 50 in 2017 its an impressive change for eight years but its even more dramatic when compared to 60 years ago powering the past with renewables in 2017 renewable output grew 27 over 2016 and produced 96 terawatt hours twh of electricity  enough to power the entire country in 1958 back then great britain was dependent on one fuel coal it was the source of 92 of the countrys power and its highcarbon intensity meant emissions from electricity generation sat at 93 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  compare that to just three million tonnes of co 2 emissions from roughly the same amount of power generated in 2017 just by renewables today the electricity system is much more diverse than in 1958 in fact with nuclear added to renewable generation 2017s total lowcarbon capacity produced enough power to fulfil the electricity needs of 1964s beatlemania britain but whats enabled this growth in renewable generation one answer as bob dylan explained a year earlier is blowin in the wind read the full article here powering the past  stormy weather powering great britain wind power experienced a watershed year in 2017 thanks to blusterier weather and a wave of new wind farm installations coming online wind generation grew 45 between 2016 and 2017 windfarms both onshore and offshore produced 15 of the entire countrys electricity output in 2017 up from 10 in 2016 the 45 twh it generated over the course of the year was almost double that of coal  and theres potential for this to increase in 2018 as more capacity comes online the 16 gigawatts gw of new offshore wind turbines installed in great britain last year accounted for 53 of the net 315 gw installed across europe  with large offshore farms at dudgeon and race bank still being commissioned the 32 gw of total new operating capacity registered in 2017 across offshore as well as onshore wind is on course to grow coauthor of the article renewableuks head of external affairs luke clark said these figures underline that renewables are central to our changing power system higher wind speeds and a jump in installed capacity drove a dramatic increase in the amount of clean power generated alongside breaking multiple records for peak output wind energy continued to cut costs as wind power is dependent on weather conditions it is intermittent in its generation but in 2017 more than one storm offered ideal conditions for wind turbines during q4 there were three named storms as well as the remnants of a hurricane all battering the british isles all of which helped push average wind speeds 5 higher than in 2016 while calculating wind power based on wind speed is complex  windier weather means more power  monthly average wind speed is proportional to monthly average power output from wind farms while the 2017 annual average wind speed of 101mph was in line with the countrys longterm average wind generation was not consistent across the year in q4 wind output was close to an average of 7 gw by contrast between may and august it was closer to 4 gw thankfully these calmer months saw longer hours of daylight allowing solar power to compensate read the full article here wind power grows 45 driving down carbon emissions the knockon effect of an increase in renewable generation is a drop in the carbon intensity of electricity production and in 2017 this reached a new low across the year carbon emissions including those from imported sources totalled 72 million tonnes down 12 from 2016 this decrease is equal to 150 kg of co 2 saved per person or taking 47 million cars off the roads the least carbon intensive period of the quarter came just after midnight in the early hours of monday 2 october when it measured a record low of 56 grammes per kilowatt hour gkwh thanks to low fossil fuel generation and high levels of renewables over the whole year there were 139 hours when carbon intensity dipped below 100 gkwh this generally required 50 of the electricity mix to come from renewable sources and demand to be lower than 30 gw for carbon intensity to dip under 100 gkwh on a more permanent basis greater renewable capacity will be required as demand rises read the full article here carbon emissions down 12 interconnectors meeting future demand electricity demand in great britain has been on the decline since 2002 primarily due to more efficient buildings and appliances  and a decline in heavy manufacturing however this is expected to change over the coming years as more electric vehicles are introduced and the heating system is electrified to help meet 2050 carbon emissions targets while installing greater renewable capacity will be crucial in meeting this demand with lowcarbon power interconnectors will also play a significant role particularly from france which boasts a large nuclear and lowcarbon capacity however electricity sales through interconnectors are often based on dayahead prices rather than the live market which can lead to trades that arent reflective of demand on each sides of the channel in q4 there were eight halfhours when demand was very high more than 50 gw yet power was being exported this occurred despite dayahead prices suggesting traders would lose money due to lower demand in france and the cost of using the interconnector it highlights the need for improvements in internetwork trading as great britain increases its intermittent renewable generation and looks to a greater reliance on importing and exporting power read the full article here moving electricity across the channel great britains electricity system continues to break its renewable records each year and heading into 2018 this is likely to continue wind and solar power will continue to grow as more installations come online and a fourth coal unit at drax will be upgraded to sustainable biomass  which could lead to another breakthrough year regardless 2017 will be a tough one to beat explore the

investors what will electricity look like in 2035 14 february 2018 electrification the year is 2035 cars cruise clean streets without the need for a driver our household appliances are all connected and communicate with one another and all of it is powered by electricity  specifically lowcarbon electricity its been 10 years since great britains last coal power station shut down and across the country wind turbines are generating more electricity than fossil fuels and nuclear energy combined pushing carbon emissions to a new low this isnt a vision of a greenminded scifi novel this is the forecast for great britain in less than 20 years time this sustainable lowcarbon future of 2035 is a significant evolution from today in 2018 and it comes despite a rising population a continued shift to urban living and an expected rise in power demand great britain gets power hungry if we transport back to the here and now of the late 2010s it would be easy to expect electricity demand to drop by 2035 in fact since 2005 electricity demand has been on a steady decline as a result of more efficient appliances and the decline of heavy industry by the mid2020s however this trend is expected to reverse but with the likelihood that appliances will grow more efficient and no sign of heavy industry coming back to british shores what will drive this growing demand two of the major contributors will be the electrification of transport and the heating system with the government setting 2040 as the end date for the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles  preparations are already underway for a fully electrified transport network  but it wont just be restricted to roads train networks and even potentially planes could switch from fossil fuels to electric increasing demand from the transport sector by 128 between 2015 and 2035 electric vehicles evs alone are predicted to add 25 terawatt hours twh of electricity demand by 2035 according to a report by bloomberg new energy finance  however this will be dependent on significant investment in the necessary charging infrastructure to enable a decarbonised transport network across the country added to this will be extra demand from a shift in how we heat our homes if planning goes ahead and pilot projects are completed lowcarbon electric heating is expected to begin rolling out in the next decade and will involve the phasing out of gas boilers in favour of electric heat pumps but as with ev adoption this will require major government investment and incentives to grow electric heating beyond the 7 of uk homes that use it today  an electrified heat network will add a greater strain on the electricity system particularly in winter months when demand is high the result is a forecast increase of 40 gw in demand during peak times  the mornings and the evenings these peak times for electricity consumption will be the greatest test for the grid as intermittent renewables meet more and more of the countrys demand it raises the question how we will cope with cold still and dark november evenings one solution is the growing role of large scale electricity storage  by 2035 technological advances are expected to bring electricity storage to 8 gw of installed capacity  double the size of drax the uks biggest power station it is also likely that the abilities of evs as electricity suppliers delivering excess electricity back to the grid once plugged in overnight will play an increasing role in meeting demand but to ensure this is possible it will require advances in another sector with a great impact on our power system technology this is not just about how technology could enable advances but how much electricity its likely to use the internet of everything and a smarter grid by 2035 chip manufacturer arm predicts there will be more than one trillion internet of things iot devices globally this smart technology will be able to turn everything from your morning coffee maker to your bed into intelligent machines gathering masses of data that can be used to optimise and personalise daily life powering all these devices let alone the vast plains of servers holding all the data they gather is one of the great challenges for the iot industry  however as much as smart devices will demand energy they will also help save it thanks to smart connected devices traffic lights will turn off when there are no cars offices will turn off lights when there is no one in a room and homes will understand your energy needs better and tailor appliance usage to your habits at a larger scale the introduction of artificial intelligence will allow the entire grid to connect and work in harmony with every one of the billions of devices taking energy from it a fullyintelligent system like this will allow grid operators to smooth out peaks in demand by for example charging evs overnight when there is less demand it means that while there will be an overall greater demand for electricity in 2035 the shape of demand may differ from the accentuated peaks of the current system renewable reaction to demand at its heart the increasing electrification of our transport utilities and technology has been driven by a few specific goals one of which is lowering our reliance on fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions  its positive then that all projections towards 2035 have us making significant strides towards this vision coal will have been completely removed from the electricity system  while gas generation will drop to just 708 twh  down from the 1122 twh expected in 2018 according to bloombergs forecast  in its place wind will become the greatest source of our electricity producing 1385 twh in 2035 up from 523 twh in 2018 the watershed year for wind power will come in 2027 when wind first overtakes gas to become the biggest contributor to the grid thanks to significant increases in capacity nuclear will still play an important role in the energy mix contributing 458 twh while solar will more than double in generation from 12 twh in 2018 to 25 twh in 2035  the same amount of power produced by all of californias solar panels in 2016  the results of this continued move to lower carbon sources will be significant carbon emissions from electricity in 2035 are expected to be 2381 gco 2 mj grammes of carbon dioxide per megajoule  less than half what is expected in 2018 and while there will be many major changes in the electricity system over the next 17 years it is this that is perhaps the most important and optimistic tags investors  technology the power systems super subs 5 february 2018 power generation every day we flick on lights load dishwashers and boil kettles but few of us pause and think of the stress this can cause for the electricity system we certainly dont call national grid in advance to let them know when we plan to do laundry but when any number of the 258 million households in great britain turn on a washing machine the grid needs to be ready for it fortunately these spikes in demand are often predictable we are creatures of habit says ian foy drax head of ancillary services we all tend to come home from work at the same time and turn on similar appliances and this keeps the shape of daily electricity demand much the same national grid the operator of great britains high voltage power transmission system uses this consistent demand to plan when and how much electricity will be needed for the coming days and agrees contracts with generators to meet it however there are times when the unexpected can happen  an unseasonable cold spell or a power station breakdown  causing sudden imbalances in supply and demand to plan for this the grid carries reserve power which is used to fill these shortterm gaps delivering this doesnt just mean keeping additional power stations running to deliver last minute electricity instead it involves a range of services coming from different types of providers technologies and timescales in great britain there are four primary ways this is delivered frequency response the fastest form of reserve is frequency response it is an automatic change in either electricity generation or demand in response to the system frequency deviating from the target 50hz  generation and demand must be kept balanced within tight limits second by second failure to do so could lead to the whole system becoming unstable leading to the risk of blackouts this is why every second of the day national grid has power generators operating in frequency response mode these power stations effectively connect their steam governor or fuel valves to a frequency signal if frequency falls generation increases if frequency rises generation is reduced an issue which has arisen over the past few years is a reduction in system inertia  the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension some small power generation technologies along with some demand are sensitive to the rate of change of frequency  too high a rate can cause it to disconnect from the system and this unplanned activity can lead to system instability some forms of generation such as wind and solar along with high voltage direct current hvdc interconnectors between great britain and the rest of europe do not provide inertia as these electricity sources grow on the system the system operator must find ways to accommodate them reducing the size of the largest credible loss eg reducing interconnector load buying faster frequency response or running conventional generation out of merit are the usual approaches spinning reserve the next quickest and most common reserve source spinning reserve can jump into action and start delivering electricity in just two minutes this reserve both positive and negative is carried on multiple generating units often running at a part load position for example if draxs biomass unit 3 is running at 350 mw of a possible 645 mw typical delivery rates are 10 to 20 mw per minute this type of reserve responds to unexpected shortterm changes in power demand or changes in power generation either in size or timing for example during a major tv event or if a generator changes output unexpectedly during television ad breaks the millions of people watching may switch on kettles or flick on lights sending demand soaring  if a programme or sporting event does not end at the scheduled time national grid has to quickly change the generation schedule by sending an electronic dispatch to a generator who responds by quickly ramping up or down thermal power stations such as drax along with hydro and pumped storage which can increase or decrease output on demand  are the most common providers of this form of reserve but newer technologies such as batteries will also be able to offer the speed required  short term operating reserve stor a slightly slower cousin to spinning reserve stor is contracted months in advance by national grid it is designed to be available within 20 minutes notice around 2 gigawatts gw of capacity can provide reserves against exceptionally large losses or demand spikes stor capacity tends to be plant which cannot make a living in the energy market because it has a high marginal cost traditionally stor has been supplied by low efficiency aeroderivative turbines or diesel engines but a wider variety of technologies from batteries to demand reduction are increasingly being contracted demand turn up managing reserve power isnt just about finding extra generation to meet demand sometimes its about quickly addressing too much generation high levels of generation coming onto the grid without an equally high demand can overload power lines and networks  causing instability and frequency imbalances  which can lead to blackouts this might happen in the summer months when the weather allows for lots of intermittent renewable generation such as wind and solar but low levels of demand due to factors like warmer weather and longer daylight hours to restore balance the grid is beginning to ask intensive commercial or industrial electricity users to increase consumption or turn off any of their own generation in favour of gridprovided power in the case of generating units at drax power station  the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation to help slow the rate of frequency change and minimises large frequency swings reserve in a changing energy system planning for the unexpected has long been a staple of the electricity system but as the shape of that system changes  reserve and response delivery is having to change too carrying reserve is easier on conventional plants because you know what the plant is capable of generating says foy wind and solar are subject to the weather which changes over time the certainty you get with conventional generation you dont necessarily get with the intermittency of weatherdependant renewables add to that the way we use electricity everything from high efficiency lighting electric vehicles through to smart appliances and we can see the challenges will grow as more variable renewables hits the system storage technologies will become more important in providing a fastacting source of short term reserve and response smart appliance technology too will play a bigger role in spreading demand across the day and reducing the size of demand peaks and troughs which require rapid changes in generation industry has a role to play too some of the biggest users of electricity are expected to play an increasingly important role in support of the system operator national grid told members of parliament in 2016 that it is our ambition to have 3050 of our balancing capacity supplied by demand side measures by 2020 artists impression of a drax rapidresponse gas power station ocgt with planning permission until these technologies and market mechanisms are widespread and implemented at scale across the grid however it will fall to thermal power stations such as biomass  gas turbines such as the planned progress

system balancing and ancillary services  energy storage  investors the shape of electricity use in 2018 31 january 2018 power generation in homes and offices on streets and in shops there are more electronic devices than ever however for all the phones washing machines and tvs british consumers are plugging in our electricity consumption has been on a downward tick  and has been since the middle of the last decade  at the same time an increasing percentage of our demand is being met by renewable and lowcarbon energy sources by 2016 greenhouse gas emissions from electricity had dropped to 62 below 1990 levels  helping the uk get close to meeting its third carbon budget target its the power sector that has seen the biggest reductions through the decline of coal the greater use of gas and the rise of renewables there are still big strides to make in the economy as a whole  particularly in sectors such as heat transport and buildings but there are positive signs of transformation that could help the country reach its fifth carbon budget goal of lowering emissions by 57 between 1990 and 2030 will 2018 prove to be another milestone year for great britains electricity system and could the electrification of the economy help other sectors stepup their own decarbonisation the efficiency transformation reduced demand for electricity comes in part as a result of the decline in energyintensive manufacturing and heavy industry however in the domestic sector the decline has been equally significant since 2002 energy consumption in the home has fallen 19 from 52229 ktoe kilotonne of oil equivalent to 42486 ktoe as well as electricity this includes gas solid fuels such as coal and more this drop comes despite a growing population economic growth an increase in the number of households and a rising number of consumer devices and appliances  so what exactly is bringing down energy consumption one cause is the increased efficiency of electronics and appliances the phasing out of incandescent lightbulbs  which had hardly changed since edisons day  in favour of energysaving models such as leds has reduced electricity used to light homes by a third since 1997 as well as the improved efficiency of large appliances like fridge freezers there is also a greater consumer awareness of electricity saving habits such as washing clothes at lower temperatures the increase in small batterypowered devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops on the other hand means were spending less time using higherpowered equipment that constantly pulls from the grid such as tvs and hifis what this can lead to however is a change in the shape of electricity demand the shape of power demand can be explored in electric insights  for example overnight when many people choose to charge those batterypowered appliances such changes in demand present a challenge to forecasters at in national grids control room who predict ahead when where and how much power will be needed from the countrys electricity grid shifting demand spikes todays peak electricity demand times remain relatively unchanged from the 20 th century people still come home and turn on lights kettles and washing machines at around 5pm and 6pm but as artificial intelligence makes its way into more and more home appliances  these spikes are likely to level out across the day connected devices will aim to predict peak times and where such tariffs are provided by energy suppliers only run when overall demand costs are lower at the same time lifestyles have changed affecting electricity demand even further in the past some of the biggest surges in uk electrical history came in the immediate aftermath of big tv moments when people across the country switched on kettles opened fridges and went to the toilet now the proliferation of ondemand and online tv has reduced the need for national grid to keep power stations on standby during major televised moments as people choose to watch at their leisure rather than when they are broadcast sports however remains one of the things that still attracts large numbers of live viewers this junes football world cup means the national grid will be braced for any surges in postpenalty shootout tea breaks combined with a royal wedding  the last of which caused a significant spike  summer 2018 could see a few rare moments when mass tv viewing shunts electricity demand enough for it to be noticeable cleaner power but while 2018 may see some instances where demand surges its likely power generation will continue to grow cleaner the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis has released projections suggesting installed renewable electricity capacity could reach 36 gigawatts gw by 2030  building on a 900 increase between 2007 and 2017 it is of course important we continue to use electricity more efficiently in 15 years from now its predicted that power generation could begin to rise significantly and so decarbonising the production of power is arguably just as important as saving it this year will see another flexible 600 megawatt mw coal unit converted to sustainable biomass at drax power station in yorkshire and the first of 84 offshore wind turbines turned on as part of the 588mw beatrice project in the outer moray firth these developments will quicken the pace of decarbonisation in great britains electricity network meaning that positive trend that will continue this is the second story in a series on electricity demand through the ages the first of which looked at the 1970s  tags electricity  investors how do you keep a 12 tonne steel ball in prime condition 18 january 2018 power generation there are 600 giant balls at drax power station each one weighs 12 tonnes  roughly the same as a saloon car  and is designed for one simple but very specific purpose to pulverise every day thousands of tonnes of biomass and coal are delivered to the power station to fuel its generators but before this fuel can be combusted it must be ground into a powder in pulverising mills so it burns quicker and more efficiently its the giant balls that do the grinding and although these balls may be incredibly durable the constant smashing crushing and pulverising they go through on a daily basis can take its toll maintaining the 600 balls across the power stations 60 mills is a vital part of keeping the plant running as effectively as possible surviving the pulveriser each of the six generating units at drax three biomass and three coal has up to 10 mills that feed it fuel all of which operate at extreme conditions inside each one 10 metal balls rotate 37 times a minute at roughly 3 mph exerting 80 tonnes of pressure crushing all fuel in its path air is then blasted in at 190 degrees celsius to dry the crushed fuel and blow it into the boiler at a rate of 40 tonnes per hour to survive these extremities the balls must be tough drax works with a local foundry in scunthorpe lincolnshire to manufacture them first they are cast as hollow orbs of nickel steel or chrome iron and then smoothed to within one millimetre of being perfectly spherical after 8000 hours of use engineers check how rapidly theyre wearing down by measuring their thickness using ultrasound equipment and if deemed to be too thin which usually occurs after about 50000 hours of use replace them for this they must first remove the top of the mill  including the grinding top ring  and then individually lift out and replace each massive ball those that are removed are typically shipped back to scunthorpe to be recycled transforming for a decarbonised future when drax power station was first built in the 1970s  the mills were designed to only crush coal but since it was upgraded to run primarily on biomass in the form of sustainable wood pellets  they have been adapted to work with the new fuel for the most part this requires only minor changes  the primary difference is that coal is harder to fully pulverise coal typically does not get entirely ground down in the first cycle so a classifier is needed in the mill to separate the heavier particles and recirculate them for further grinding the process of switching one mill from biomass to coal takes about seven days and nights this work was carried out on unit 4s mills ahead of this winter following biomass trials in the spring and summer of 2017 now that the decision has been made to permanently upgrade that fourth power generation unit  converting one of its 10 mills from coal to biomass later in 2018 will take about twice as long using the same essential equipment and process for both fuels helps to quicken the pace of decarbonisation at drax power station as the uk moves to end the production of unabated

existing converted units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum the response would enable drax to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax will now continue its work to deliver the low cost conversion of a fourth biomass unit accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply drax plans to complete the work on this unit as part of a major planned outage in the second half of 2018 before returning to service in late 2018 the capital cost is significantly below the level of previous conversions repurposing the existing cofiring facility on site to deliver biomass to the unit the unit will likely operate with lower availability than the three existing converted units but the intention is for it to run at periods of higher demand which are often those of higher carbon intensity allowing optimisation of roc 1 generation across three roc 1 accredited units the cfd 2 unit remains unaffected will gardiner chief executive of drax group commented we welcome the governments support for further sustainable biomass generation at drax which will allow us to accelerate the removal of coal from the electricity system replacing it with flexible low carbon renewable electricity we look forward to implementing a costeffective solution for our fourth biomass unit at drax enquiries investor relations mark

music blares and an excited crowd surges forward smartphones held aloft its a moment of rapture  but this is not a theatrical or musical performance this is the launch of an electric car specifically the launch of teslas new electric roadster  which claims to be the fastest production car ever made and while the sportscar may have been the undoubted star of the event it wasnt the only one unveiled tesla also launched an electricpowered articulated lorry  the semi with governments around the world setting ambitious plans to ban the sale of petrolanddieselonly cars  the introduction of electricpowered utility vehicles  like teslas truck  in a range of industries will be essential to a truly decarbonised transport system disrupting trucking teslas heavy goods vehicle hgv highlights the growing capabilities of electric vehicles evs to deliver more than just short urban journeys it claims its semi will be able to travel 500 miles on a single charge enough to get you from london to edinburgh comfortably and tow 40 tonnes of cargo tesla isnt the only player with electric big rig concepts  los angelesbased thor trucks  daimler and volkswagen have unveiled their own  but its ambitious 2019 production target makes it a more immediate possibility than any other in the space despite media coverage claiming the semis megacharging capability breaks the laws of physics  big

then which have fast acceleration and are quick off the mark are ideal candidates to deliver  especially as battery technology becomes more reliable and durable health services in nottingham have already been trialling electricpowered fast response vehicles while in japan nissan has unveiled an allelectric ambulance that carries a lithiumion auxiliary battery to power medical equipment on board this onboard power supply is a further advantage of evs and one not just restricted to emergency services electric pickup truck maker havelaar for example offers power outlets on its bison vehicle for electric tools the future of battery farming out in the countryside evs are making waves in farming john deere has unveiled plans for fully electric tractors claiming they require less maintenance and have a longer lifecycle than combustion engines  with more than a third of uk farms generating their own power from solar wind and even anaerobic digestion using farm byproducts theres potential for farmers to charge tractors renewably and cut their fuel and charging costs more than just helping cut emissions and costs there can also be performance benefits given their acceleration abilities electric tractors are well suited to heavy pulling without revving up engines and churning up ground joining hgvs and tractors in their ability to apply almost instant torque to heavy industrial jobs are edumper trucks the komatsu quarry truck weighs in at almost 45 tonnes and claims to be the biggest ev in the world the economic advantage of electrification air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are the main driving force behind many antifossil fuel regulations however research suggests decarbonising transport systems also have economic advantages for businesses a report by financial services firm hitachi capital found that switching vans and heavy goods vehicles hgvs to electric or other alternative fuels could save british businesses as much as 14 billion a year it claims evs run at 13p cheaper per mile than dieselfuelled vans while hgvs are reported to be 38p cheaper that adds up to total savings of 137 billion a year if all britains commercial vehicles were switched the move to a fully electrified transport system is already underway the number of registered electric cars increased by 280 in the uk over the past four years according to the hitachi report the chinese city of shenzhens entire fleet of 16359 buses has gone electric  a transition that began in 2009 and has been assisted by an 80 drop in the cost of a lithiumion battery pack according to bloomberg new energy finance  chinas need for electric bus batteries is almost on a par to that of all global ev battery demand china could be said to be driving the market evs are undoubtedly cleaner when it comes to roadside pollution however the exponential increase in evs will only benefit the fight against man made climate change if countries entire energy systems continue
