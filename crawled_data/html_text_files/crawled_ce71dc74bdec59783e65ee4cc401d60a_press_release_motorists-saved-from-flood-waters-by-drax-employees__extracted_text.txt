vehicles got stuck in floodwater near the glenlee power station on tuesday evening as a result of heavy rainfall which deluged local roads 11 december 2019 the first was a man in his 70s who had been stuck in his bmw car for over an hour on the a762 road between glenlee power station and earlstoun power station  when robert peacock and daniel hunter from drax arrived on the scene at around 4pm wading through chest deep water to reach the vehicle robert peacock a mechanical fitter at draxs galloway hydro scheme said it was just by chance we came across the elderly gentleman but he had been stranded in his car in freezing water for an hour we could not open the doors and ended up having to smash the rear window to gain access and drag him out i think hypothermia would have set in soon had we not got to him robert and daniel transported the man to the glenlee power station where they provided him with dry clothes to change into and a hot drink before taking him to an ambulance waiting on the other side of the floodwaters which took him to hospitalthe second incident involved a woman with a small child who were trapped inside a car which had broken down in floodwater on the same road at around the same time another drax team member rob little assisted them to safety ian kinnaird draxs head of hydro said the quick thinking of the teams at our power stations their swift response and professionalism helped to prevent these serious incidents resulting in tragedy  were very proud of what they did and send our well wishes to the people who were trapped in both these
