londons most iconic buildings made with ash modern unique iconic  londons skyline is recognised around the world but did you know some of it is built with ash 20 march 2017 sustainable business londons historic relationship with its power system is clear to see in its skyline old decommissioned power stations a reminder of the citys industrial heritage have been repurposed to house art or corporate headquarters  connecting the citys past to its present but these historical buildings arent the only physical connection to how the city is powered in fact much of modern london is built using a byproduct from electricity generation although drax power station now generates more than half its electricity using sustainable biomass  a proportion comes from coal of which ash is a byproduct but rather than discarding this ash to landfill drax sells it to companies who turn it into something useful lytag  lytag is made from transforming the ash into small round pellets and then heating them to 1100c creating very hard spheres of lightweight aggregate these can be used to create high strength concrete as well as used in filter systems roof tiles and sports surfaces here are some of the most iconic buildings in london made using lytag the gherkin the building at 30 st mary axe also known as the gherkin is a notable feature of the capitals skyline but more than being a unique landmark when constructed it was dubbed londons first ecological tall building it uses wind for heating and cooling which means it uses nearly 50 less energy than comparable office buildings and was constructed using recycled and recyclable materials where possible including lytag london city hall like the gherkin londons city hall is not only a visually unique building but an energyefficient one  too solar panels across its fa√ßade generate renewable electricity while smart meters and sensors ensure the power it does use is carefully optimised  it even recycles heat generated by its computers and lights in construction lytag was used in the flooring helping the buildings overall sustainability credentials heron tower lightweight lytag aggregate formed part of the concrete used to construct the heron tower which helped reduce structural loading this city of london skyscraper was awarded an excellent rating from breeam  the worlds leading sustainability assessors the rating owes much to the south side of the building which is studded with an incredible 48000 photovoltaic arrays  st pancras station the recent upgrade to st pancras involved widespread refurbishment as well as civil and structural modifications to facilities across the station one such modification was a 185metre extension to create 13 new platforms for additional domestic and international services wimbledon centre court in 2006 the worlds most famous tennis court began a major overhaul for the first time in its history centre court at the all england lawn tennis and croquet club was to get a retractable roof that covers the whole court but to do this it needed to undergo a fivestorey redevelopment which also increased its capacity to 15000 spectators lytag was used to create a specially formulated water resistant concrete that anchored the additional seating and helped bring the worlds biggest tennis tournament into a new era more to come although coal is fast becoming a smaller part of the uks electricity generation mix  lytag remains a part of london construction its currently being used in the one bank street development in canary wharf and the pinnacle building in the city of london which when finished will be the second tallest building in london  a noteworthy addition to the capitals skyline share most read electrification storage
