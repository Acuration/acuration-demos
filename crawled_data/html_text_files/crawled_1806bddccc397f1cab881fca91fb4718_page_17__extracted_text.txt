2020s underpinned by a tranmsport and storage ts network progress towards delivering ggr targets will be reported in next years climate change committee progress report and in the meantime over the next year beis should develop policies on governance and support mechanisms to enable ggr scale up in the 2020s the cccs 2021 progress report to parliament  ccc progress report summary our assessment is that both engineered greenhouse gas removals ggr and landbased removals will be essential for reaching net zero a small number of beccs and daccs test facilities are presently in operation worldwide investment in research and development needs to be complemented with policy design to support engineered ggr scaleup during the midtolate 2020s a key milestone on the sixth carbon budget pathway is progress towards the commissioning of the first commercialscale beccs plant in the late 2020s this will need to be underpinned by the construction of co2 pipeline and storage infrastructures as part of the wider establishment of ccs in the early 2020s progress towards this underpinning infrastructure delivery and the development of support policies for ggr deployment will be considered in next years progress report in 2022  the net zero strategy should set out expected amounts and timings of landbased and engineered removals ie bioenergy with ccs beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs in contributing to meeting the sixth carbon budget and the net zero target these should avoid overreliance on these solutions building on the results of the beis ggr consultation policy on governance and support mechanisms should be developed over the next year in order to enable ggr scaleup during the midlate 2020s  this should include enabling domestic engineered removals to contribute to uk carbon budgets and net zero establishing ggr monitoring verification and reporting structures that ensure that ggr is sustainable and verifiable and setting out support mechanisms that align with the expectations for the role and timing of ggr contribution to uk emissions reductions tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  negative emissions drax kickstarts planning process to expand its iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station press releases the decision to seek planning permission to expand pumped storage hydro at cruachan demonstrates draxs commitment to scotland and is a landmark moment in unlocking the vast renewable resources needed in the uk ahead of cop 26 in glasgow pumped storage hydro is a critical technology which enables more renewable power and supports scotlands electricity system helping the country towards its target of reaching net zero by 2045 five years before the uk as a whole work to build draxs new pumped storage hydro power station could begin as soon as 2024 removing 1 million tonnes of rock from inside ben cruachan and creating hundreds of jobs across rural scotland renewable energy company drax group is kickstarting the planning process to build a new underground pumped storage hydro power station  more than doubling the electricity generating capacity at its iconic cruachan facility in scotland the project announced as the uk prepares to host the cop26 climate conference in glasgow will support almost 900 jobs in rural areas across scotland during construction and will provide critical storage capacity needed to support a net zero power system the 600mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 104gw the new power station would be built within a new hollowedout cavern which would be large enough to fit big ben on its side to the east of draxs existing 440mw pumped storage hydro station more than a million tonnes of rock would be excavated to create the cavern and other parts of the power station the existing upper reservoir which can hold 24 billion gallons of water has the capacity to serve both power stations an artists impression of cruachan 2 top and the existing cruachan power station bottom  click to viewdownload  like draxs existing site the new station will be able to provide lifeline stability services to the power system alongside acting like a giant water battery by using reversible turbines to pump water from loch awe to the upper reservoir on the mountainside the station can store power from wind farms when supply outstrips demand the stored water would then be released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this will help to cut energy costs by reducing the need for wind farms to be paid to turn off when they are generating excess power the new station would have the capacity to generate enough power for around a million homes will gardiner drax group ceo said drax group ceo will gardiner  click to viewdownload  this is an exciting and important project which underlines draxs commitment to tackling the climate crisis and supporting the energy system as it continues to decarbonise our plans to expand cruachan will unlock more renewable electricity to power homes and businesses across the country and support hundreds of new jobs in rural scotland last year the uks lack of energy storage capacity meant wind farms had to be paid to turn off and we lost out on enough renewable power to supply a

zero target it is great news for this area and for scotland jenni minto argyll  bute msp said investment in new pumped storage hydro capacity could greatly enhance the flexibility and resilience of the electricity network and help us move towards meeting our ambitious global climate change targets in the runup to cop26 in glasgow its more vital than ever that we come up with innovative solutions to the climate emergency and ensure that future generations to reap the rewards of scotlands vast renewable potential in order to deploy this critical technology drax must secure consent under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 from scottish ministers  a process which takes around one year to complete from the applications submission alongside a successful section 36 application the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the existing lack of a framework for largescale longduration storage and flexibility technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation the first phase of the section 36 application process includes public consultation this summer when people can provide comments on draxs proposals for cruachan via the project website from 1 july further consultation events are planned for later in the year and an application is then expected to be submitted to scottish ministers in early 2022 ends media contact aidan kerr media manager generation e
