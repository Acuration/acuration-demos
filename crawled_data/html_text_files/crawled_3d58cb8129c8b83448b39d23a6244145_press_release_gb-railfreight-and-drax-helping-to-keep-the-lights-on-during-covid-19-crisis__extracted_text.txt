power station gb railfreight and drax helping to keep the lights on during covid19 crisis teams at gb railfreight gbrf are continuing to work closely with drax to maintain supplies of the sustainable biomass needed for the uks largest power station to generate electricity needed by millions of homes and business during the covid19 crisis 14 april 2020 severe storms and flooding in the area near

station john smith managing director of gb railfreight said gb railfreight is playing its part in supporting the uks covid19 response by helping to keep essential services running across the country our partnership with drax power station in yorkshire is proof of this we are delivering vital supplies of sustainable biomass which are transported across the country by rail to drax which supplies

times and strong teamwork across the rail industry is absolutely key in keeping freight services moving recent flooding in this area brought additional challenges to keeping services moving however the hard work and dedication of our people has meant that vital supplies of sustainable biomass have continued to be transported ends picture caption a gbrf biomass train makes its way from drax power
