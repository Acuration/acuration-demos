17032021 three industrial consortia secure further funding from the industrial strategy challenge fund sunset at filey north yorkshire on the north sea coast equidistant between the tees and humber rivers three industrial consortia  northern endurance partnership net zero teesside and zero carbon humber  secure further funding from the industrial strategy challenge fund to deliver the uks first decarbonised industrial clusters on the east coast of england the three successful bids total 229 million in private and public funding and will accelerate development of integrated onshore and offshore infrastructure for carbon emissions and low carbon hydrogen bids from three industrial partnerships that will link together to deliver deep reductions in industrial emissions on the east coast of england have been awarded funding as part of the industrial decarbonisation challenge under the uk research and innovations ukri industrial strategy challenge fund iscf the three bids amount to 229 million in private and public funding with industry contributing twothirds of the total and will support the next stage in development of the three projects the northern endurance partnership nep will accelerate the development of an offshore pipeline network and geological storage in the uk southern north sea captured carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from both the net zero teesside nzt and zero carbon humber zch projects will be transported and permanently stored deep underground in endurance the uks largest appraised saline aquifer for carbon storage caption idattachment_899

to enable decarbonisation of industrial emitters in the teesside area in the humber the zero carbon humber zch partnership will develop h2h saltend one of the worlds first atscale low carbon hydrogen production plants and a co 2 and hydrogen pipeline network connecting to industrial sites and gas and biomass power stations throughout the humber enabling them to capture their co 2 emissions andor to switch to low carbon hydrogen nzt and zch are atscale projects that will kickstart decarbonisation of industry and power in two of the uks largest industrial clusters both projects aim to be commissioned by 2026 with realistic pathways to achieve net zero through a combination of carbon capture and hydrogen if successful the combined projects will support decarbonisation of nearly 50 of the uks industrial emissions andy lane managing director nep and nzt commented i am pleased to welcome the phase 2 funding the projects have received through the iscf which will help to accelerate key elements of onshore and offshore ccus infrastructure on the east coast of england this support for ccus in the uk is critical to enabling projects such as nep nzt and zch to enter frontend engineering design feed a crucial step forward as we look to develop the worlds first decarbonised industrial cluster by 2030 public funding demonstrates government commitment and increased ambition to establish the ccus industry outlined in the recent ten point plan and along with clear government policy which is currently being developed will unlock significant further investment from the private sector grete tveit senior vice president for low carbon solutions at equinor which is a partner in zch nzt and nep said these awards are great news for the uk the humber and teesside make up nearly half of uks industrial emissions so to reach net zero there is enormous value in tackling emissions at both clusters together rolling out carbon capture use  storage and hydrogen across the uks industrial clusters supports the governments aims for a green recovery and to level up by safeguarding and creating many highskilled jobs and will establish the uk as a world leader in hydrogen and low carbon technologies as the uks leading energy provider we will continue to work with our partners to progress our projects to final investment decision engage locally and nationally to make this happen martin cook senior vice president for business development for national grid ventures a partner in zch and nep said these awards represent an important milestone as we look to decarbonise the uks largest industrial heartland and build a globally competitive platform for economic growth in the north of england teesside and the humber offer the potential for a unique mix of technologies and scale to achieve net zero delivering significant value for money national grid will use our knowledge and experience of gas and electricity transmission infrastructure and our capabilities developed on previous ccs projects to deliver the infrastructure required to enable industry to achieve deep decarbonisation the industrial decarbonisation challenge funded as part of the iscf is the governments flagship challengeled innovation programme run through uk research and innovation ukri a nondepartmental public body sponsored by the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis around 26bn of public money has already been invested through the programme in projects from all sectors to tackle big societal and industrial challenges of today ends notes to editors about northern endurance partnership bp equinor eni national grid shell and total form the northern endurance partnership a partnership announced in october 2020 to develop offshore carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage infrastructure in the uk north sea with bp as operator the infrastructure will serve the proposed net zero teesside and zero carbon humber projects which aim to establish decarbonised industrial clusters in teesside and humber if both projects fulfil their potential nep can enable the decarbonisation of nearly 50 of the uks industrial emissions about net zero teesside net zero teesside is a carbon capture utilisation and storage ccus project based in teesside in the north east of england in partnership with local industry and with committed world class partners it aims to start up in 2026 and fully decarbonise a cluster of carbonintensive businesses by as early as 2030 net zero teesside comprises a consortium of bp eni equinor shell and total with bp leading as operator the project plans to capture up to 10 million tonnes of co 2 emissions each year equivalent to the emissions associated with the annual energy use of up to 3 million homes in the uk to learn

cluster supporting the uk net zero target with its first project aiming to start up in 2026 zch will establish critical infrastructure to capture at least 17 million tonnes of co 2 emissions per year and supply up to 10 gigawatts of hydrogen in industry and power projects across the humber by the mid2030s zch will contribute significantly to uk ambitions for 10 million tonnes of co 2 capture and 5gw of low carbon hydrogen production by 2030 and provide carbon negative power from biomass with carbon capture technology beccs the zch partnership includes associated british ports british steel
