inertia the shock absorbers keeping the grid stable newtons third law of motion has more to do with keeping the electricity grid stable than you might think 12 september 2017 power generation from the comfort of home its easy to assume britains power is run across a consistently calm and stable system and while this is for the most part true keeping it this way relies on a set of carefully calibrated and connected tools these include frequency response  which keeps all electricity around the country on the same frequency  and reactive power  the quiet force moving electricity around the grid but theres another at play and at least by name its something youve probably heard of inertia system inertia is energy stored in spinning plant that slows down the rate at which frequency changes rapid changes in frequency can create instability in the system think of it like a car  inertia does the same job as shock absorbers in the suspension smoothing the sudden bumps and potholes keeping the wheels on the ground to maintain control however the changing nature of britains energy system is creating challenges in ensuring there is enough inertia available for a stable future grid the energy systems shock absorbers inertia describes objects natural tendency whether theyre moving or resting to keep doing what theyre doing until forced to change for example when you kick a pebble forces like friction and gravity prevent it hurtling endlessly off into the distance electricity generation in thermal power stations such as drax involves many moving parts none more important than turbines and generators in a turbine high pressure steam hits a set of blades which makes it spin a little like running a fan in reverse the spinning motion is used to power the generator which is a rotor wound in electrified copper wire transforming it into an electro magnet as this magnetic field passes through copper bars surrounding the rotor it generates electricity this spinning turbine has inertia if the fuel powering it is suddenly switched off it will continue to spin until it is stopped either by friction or by force every thermal generator in the uk system spins at 3000 rpm has inertia and generates electricity at a frequency of 50 hz in the uk all electricity is generated at the same frequency and crucially needs to remain stable  even deviations of 1 from this can damage equipment and cause blackouts managing frequency is done by managing generation if demand exceeds supply frequency falls too much supply and frequency rises national grid closely monitors frequency across the system and automatically instructs power generators like drax to respond to changes in frequency by dialing up or down generation and ensuring this change in generation is done smoothly and instantaneously relies on using inertia for example using the inertial forces of spinning generators power stations are able to respond instantly to requests to alter generation so inertia is important to the stability of the power system but because of the changing nature of todays grid we are facing challenges when it comes to inertia many forms of renewable generation arent built around spinning turbines and this means no inertia future challenges renewable sources like the wind turbines currently operational in the uk and solar pv  alongside energy imported from the continent do not provide inertia to the grid this means as the uk moves to decarbonise the energy system and rely on more intermittent and often embedded renewable energy rather than thermalgenerated electricity questions arise over where the grid will get the inertia needed to remain stable one possible solution is synthetic inertia while wind turbines do not contain inherit inertia modern suppliers are now enabling the machines rotating blades to create synthetic inertia  which can add extra power to the grid to support generation loss some regions including germany and quebec now require inertiageneration in turbines as standard  this cant be done with solar pv however smart grids and improving storage technologies have the potential to deal with a lack of inertia batteries which can absorb electricity when there is an oversupply and then release it again when demand is high can respond nearinstantly to fluctuations to help maintain the grids frequency there are of course renewable sources that offer natural inertia including hydro tidal and biomass generation but as the uk shifts to more renewable energy sources with no naturally occurring inertia these turbinebased generation methods will be vital in ensuring wider grid stability gas has an important role too as a lower carbon alternative to coal power and one that will increasingly shift from being the backbone of britains electricity system to playing a supporting flexible role this short story is adapted from a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the areas of balancing services system
