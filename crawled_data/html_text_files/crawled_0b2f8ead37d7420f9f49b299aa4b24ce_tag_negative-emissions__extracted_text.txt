movement of carbon from one place to another in nature carbon moves through the carbon cycle  in industries like energy however carbon transportation refers to the physical transfer of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from the point of capture to the point of usage or storage why does carbon need to be transported anthropogenic manmade co 2 released in processes like power generation leads to the direct increase of co 2 in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming  however these emissions can be captured as part of carbon capture and storage ccs  the co 2 is then transported for safe and permanent storage in geological formations deep underground capturing and storing co 2 prevents it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming processes that can deliver negative emissions  such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage dacs  aim to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere through ccs in ccs carbon must be transported from the site where its captured to a site where it can be permanently stored this means it needs to travel from a power station or factory to a geological formation like a saline aquifer or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as of september 2021 there were 27 operational ccs facilities around the world with the combined capacity to capture around 40 million tonnes per annum mtpa of co 2  its estimated that the uk alone has 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space in sandstone rock formations under the north sea how is carbon transported co 2 can be transported via trucks or ships but the most common and efficient method is by pipeline moving gases of any kind through pipelines is based on pressure gases travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure compressing gas to a high pressure allows it to flow to other locations gas pipelines are common all around the world including those transporting co 2  in the us there are for instance more than 50 co 2 pipelines  covering around 6500 km and transporting approximately 68 million tonnes of co 2 a year  gas takes up less volume when its compressed and even less when it is liquefied solidified or hydrated therefore before being transported captured co 2 is often compressed and liquefied until it becomes a supercritical fluid  in a supercritical state co 2 has the density of a liquid but the viscosity thickness of a gas and is therefore easier to transport through pipelines its also 5080 less dense than water with a viscosity that is 100 times lower than liquid this means it can be loaded onto ships in greater quantities and that there is less friction when its moving through pipes and subsequently into geological storage sites how safe is it to transport carbon its no riskier to transport co 2 via pipeline or ship than it is to transport oil and natural gas  and existing oil and natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to transport co 2  to enable the safe use of co 2 pipelines ccs projects must ensure captured co 2 complies with strict purity and temperature specifications as well as making sure co 2 is dry and free from impurities that could impact pipelines operations whilst there are a growing number of ccs transport systems around the world ccs is still is a relatively new field but research is underway to identify best practises materials and technologies to optimise the process this includes research around potential risks and techniques for leak mitigation and remediation in the uk the health and safety executive regulates health safety and integrity issues for all natural gas pipelines which are covered by legislation the legislation ensures the safety of pipelines pressure systems and offshore installations and can serve as a strong foundation for co 2 transport regulation fast facts globally ccs projects have been operational since the 1980s with more than 260 million tonnes of co 2 being captured and stored over 40 years the global capacity of ccs projects in development in september 2021 was 111 million tonnes per year  this was a 48 increase compared to the end of 2020 the uks existing gas transmission network is made up of some 7660 km of highpressure gas pipelines the price of reusing offshore oil and gas pipelines to transport co 2 could be just 1 to 10 of the cost of building a new pipeline go deeper catch up on how a range of carbon capture transport and storage projects around the world are progressing here are the details of five proposed carbon capture projects in the uk read the full story of how carbon is captured transported and stored how governments can implement the policies needed to enable ccs at scale  tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  engineering  negative emissions  technology transporting carbon  how to safely move co2 from the atmosphere to permanent storage 15 october 2021 carbon capture key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture transport and store emissions will protect those industries while helping the uk reach its climate goals its just a matter of putting the pipes in place go deeper how do you store co 2 and what happens to it when you do tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  drax power station  negative emissions  sustainability  technology  zero carbon humber what is direct air carbon capture and storage dacs 9 july 2021 carbon capture what is direct air carbon capture and storage dacs direct air carbon capture and storage dacs sometimes referred to as dac or daccs is one of the few technologies that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere unlike other carbon removal technologies that capture co 2 emissions during the process of generating electricity or heat dacs can be deployed anywhere in the world it can tap into a supply of electricity co 2 removal is crucial to meeting the international climate goals set by the 2015 paris agreement but its not enough just to cut co 2 emissions to achieve net zero  it will also be necessary to remove the co 2 that two centuries of industrialisation have released into the environment as a technology that removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases  assuming it is powered by green electricity  dacs has the potential to play a key role in this process how does dacs work dacs could be described as a form of industrial photosynthesis just as plants use photosynthesis to convert sunlight and co 2 into sugar dacs systems use electricity to remove co 2 from the atmosphere using fans and filters air is drawn into the dacs system using an industrial scale fan liquid dacs systems pass the air through a chemical solution which removes the co 2 and returns the rest of the air back into the atmosphere solid dacs systems captures co 2 on the surface of a filter covered in a chemical agent where it then forms a compound the new compound is heated releasing the co 2 to be captured and separating it from the chemical agent which can then be recycled the captured co 2 can then be compressed under very high pressure and pumped via pipelines into deep geological formations  this permanent storage process is known as sequestration alternatively the co 2 can be pumped under low pressure for immediate use in commercial processes such as carbonating drinks or cement manufacturing a 2021 study by the coalition for negative emissions shows that dacs could provide at least 1gt of sustainable negative emissions by 2025 dacs fast facts human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of co 2 by 48 above preindustrial levels found in 1850 during prehistoric ice ages co 2 levels were around 200 parts per million ppm the average level in 2020 was more than 417ppm 101 out of 116 of the ipcc scenarios mitigating greenhouse gas emissions depend on using negative emissions technology  including dacs what role can dacs play in decarbonisation co 2 is in the air at the same concentration everywhere in the world this means that dacs plants can be located anywhere unlike carbon capture systems that remove co 2 from industrial processes at source there are 15 dacs plants currently in operation worldwide  climeworks operates three in switzerland iceland and italy together these smallscale plants capture approximately 9000 tonnes of co 2 per annum the first largescale plant  currently being developed in the permian basin texas is expected to capture 1000000 tonnes one megatonne per annum when it becomes operational in 2025 at just 004 the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere is very dilute which makes removing and storing it a challenge this means that dacs costs significantly more than some other co 2 capture technologies  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne the process also requires large amounts of energy which adds to the demand for electricity however dacs has the potential to become an important piece in the jigsaw of co 2 removal technologies

reaching net zero but it is at home in the uk where real progress is starting to be made in answering some of the tougher challenges posed by the global environmental crisis eyebrows were raised when the uk set itself one of the most stretching timeframes in which to decarbonise but like many business leaders i am firmly of the belief that this ambitious target will be the catalyst to deliver the innovative thinking needed to get the planet to where it needs to be i was delighted to learn recently that government has awarded the zero carbon humber partnership 75 million in funding to develop worldleading net zero technologies mhi beccs pilot plant within ccus incubation area drax power station north yorkshire drax was one of the founder members of the partnership and its goal is to build

storage domes and water cooling towers at drax power station in north yorkshire i believe that in a similar way to how renewables have made huge strides in helping decarbonise power a range of new technologies are now needed to decarbonise industry and industrial regions our work as a partnership in the humber is establishing a landmark project for the uk and the worlds journey to net zero and clean growth reaching net zero depends on a diverse range of technologies there are many factors that will be essential for the world to reach net zero  but perhaps none more important than open collaboration and integration government industry and individual businesses will need to work together and share learnings and infrastructure to be able to make true progress this collaboration will of course take many forms but one that is crucially important is industrial clusters such as zero carbon humber and neighbouring net zero teesside a recent report by accenture highlighted how vital decarbonising industrial regions will be to reaching climate goals industrial carbon dioxide co 2  emissions account for as much as 11 gigatonnes or 30 of global greenhouse gas emissions ghg however the report also highlights the opportunities both environmental and economic in decarbonising clusters the market for global industrial efficiency alone is expected to receive investments worth as much as 40bn while the global hydrogen market was estimated at around 175bn in 2019 the humber is the uks largest cluster by industrial emissions emitting 10 million tonnes of co 2 per year  more than 2 of the uks total ghg emissions pioneering projects around hydrogen production ccus and negative emissions through beccs are all ready to scale in the region beginning the task of reducing and removing emissions the potential benefit to the regional economy could also be significant  its estimated these technologies could create 48000 direct indirect and induced jobs in the humber region by

detrimental effects of many industrial processes and even go as far as countering the impacts of climate change among nets beccs offers a means of generating electricity or heat while also removing co 2 from the atmosphere it works by using biomass from sustainable sources which absorb co 2 from the atmosphere when they grow when the biomass is used as fuel that same co 2 is captured and stored

ccs landscape drax  from coal emitter to climate innovator drax has evolved from a coal power station to run four of its 600mwplus generating units on sustainable biomass and is the largest decarbonisation project in europe beccs pilots at the plant have already been successful in capturing more than a tonne of co 2 a day by proving the viability of multiple capture technologies drax has set 2030 as the date when it aims to become carbon negative which would also see its beccs operations scale up to capture as much as 8 million tonnes of co 2 a year  drax power station with biomass storage domes lit up the power station is in an advantageous location to deliver such significant negative emissions located near the uks humber region drax is partnered with a range of industrial emitters through the zero carbon humber partnership which aims to become the worlds first net zero carbon industrial cluster through a combination of industrial ccs hydrogen and beccs sharing carbon capture and transport infrastructure across the region helps to reduce costs for each party and in draxs case can translate into keeping electricity costs down for consumers delivering beccs negative emissions and a net zero carbon cluster is an economic driver for the humber a recent report found it could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades negative emissions from beccs also has an essential role to play in enabling the uk to reach its target of net zero emissions by 2050  drax is ready to invest in this essential technology which will help the uk decarbonise faster and kickstart a whole new industry here says drax ceo will gardiner  drax group ceo will gardiner

communities work together fortum oslo varme  turning waste to negative emissions agriculture and forestry waste are some of the worlds primary sources of sustainable biomass however large amounts of household waste are also biological in origins  for example cardboard or vegetable peels food waste recycling bin in a kitchen dealing with cities waste is an environmental necessity and key to achieving net zero on a wider scale wastetoenergy plants have long provided a means to avoid landfill usage but by introducing ccs to such facilities they can deliver positive impact to the cities they serve the fov fortum oslo varme plant in oslo delivers heat and power to the norwegian capital by incinerating waste approximately 50 of which comes from biological origins the wastetoenergy facility first launched a ccs pilot in 2016 to remove co 2 from the atmosphere through beccs the project is part of the citys broader ambition to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 95 between 2009 and 2030 as the citys largest single emissions source introducing ccs to the fov can reduce oslos emissions by 14 an essential step to reach the citys ambitious climate goals the plant currently treats 400000 tonnes of waste per year that cant be recycled and has already conducted a 5500hour pilot with a 95 capture rate the issue of nonrecyclable waste hangs over almost every city in the world and the fovs system could be implemented on as many as 500 similar plants around europe alone delivering power district heating negative emissions from organic materials and waste reduction hofor  keeping beccs on budget hofor is a notforprofit utility currently exploring the potential of beccs and makes an interesting case study for how the technology can be deployed as economically as possible short for hovedstadsomradets forsyningsselskab which roughly translates as greater copenhagen utility hofor is investigating the addition of beccs to its combined heat and power chp station biomassfed chp plants use residual energy from power generation such as steam to heat water that is then circulated through a citywide network of pipes to provide heating it means that the energy utilisation of biomass is very high and importantly for nordic countries provides a large supply of affordable heating maintaining the affordability of its heating supply is crucial for hofor which is bound by regulatory conditions to not undertake investments that make heat more expensive for its customers for this reason hofors exploration of beccs needs to place an emphasis on technologies that have a high readiness level and ways to keep costs to a minimum by partnering with other local utilities as part of the c4 carbon capture cluster copenhagen  the company is looking to share the costs of carbon transport and storage infrastructure keeping heat prices low while delivering negative emissions there is also the potential for hofor to sell captured carbon that can be used to create products such as green aviation fuel carbon offsetting offers another way for the utility to invest in beccs if there is an organised and longterm market for such transactions in place go deeper discover the best business model for beccs negative emissions consist of a range of technologies and naturebased solutions that capture and permanently store co 2 and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere they offer a way to remove emissions that are currently impossible to entirely reduce in industries like aviation agriculture and construction and eventually begin to reverse the effects of climate change join the coalition for negative emissions tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  negative emissions how to build a business model for negative emissions 10 may 2021 carbon capture in brief policy intervention is needed to enable enough beccs in power to make a net zero uk economy possible by 2050 early investment in beccs can insure against the risk and cost of delaying significant abatement efforts into the 2030s and 2040s a twopart business model for beccs of carbon payment and power cfd offers a clear path to technology neutral and subsidy free ggrs the uks electricity system is based on a market of buying and selling power and other services  for this to work electricity must be affordable to consumers but the parties providing power must be able to cover the costs of generating electricity emitting carbon dioxide co 2  and getting electricity to where it needs to be this process has thrived and proved adaptable enough to rapidly decarbonise the electricity system in the space of a decade with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation  the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is one of the key technologies needed at scale for the uk to reach net zero yet there is no market for the negative emissions beccs can deliver in contrast to other energy system services  beccs has been repeatedly flagged as vital for the uk to reach its climate goals owing to its ability to deliver negative emissions  the climate change committee has demonstrated that negative emissions  also known as greenhouse gas removals ggrs or carbon removals  will be needed at scale to achieve net zero to offset residual emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and agriculture but there is no economic mechanism to reward negative emissions in the energy market for decarbonisation technologies like beccs in power to develop to the scale and within the timeframe needed the government must implement the necessary policies to incentivise investment and allow them to thrive as part of the energy and carbon markets beccs is essential to bringing the whole economy to net zero the primary benefit of beccs in power is its ability to deliver negative emissions by removing co 2 from the atmosphere through responsibly managed forests  energy crops or agricultural residues then storing the same amount of co 2 underground while producing reliable renewable electricity looking down above units one through five within drax power station a new report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary cornerstone of uk decarbonisation and its wider impacts on a net zero economy developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would have positive spillover effects that contribute to wider decarbonisation green growth and the uks ability to meet its legallybinding climate commitments by 2050 drax has a unique opportunity to fit carbon capture and storage ccs equipment to its existing biomass generation units to turn its north yorkshire site into what could be the worlds first carbon negative power station plans are underway to build a co 2 pipeline in the yorkshire and humber region which would move carbon captured from at drax out to a safe longterm storage site deep below the north sea this infrastructure would be shared with other ccs projects in the zero carbon humber partnership  enabling the uks most carbonintensive region to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing beccs can also have spillover benefits for other emerging industries lessons that come from developing and operating the first beccs power stations as well as transport and storage infrastructure will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects hydrogen production for example is regarded as a key to providing low zero or carbon negative alternatives to natural gas in power industry transport and heating learnings from increased bioenergy usage in beccs can help develop biomass gasification as a means of hydrogen production as well as applying ccs to other production methods the economic value of these positive spillovers from beccs can be far reaching but they will not be felt unless beccs can achieve a robust business model in the immediate future with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation designing a beccs business model the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis outlined several key factors to consider in assessing how to make carbon capture usage and storage ccus economically viable these are also valid for beccs development engineers working within the turbine hall drax power station one of the primary needs for a beccs business model is to instil confidence in investors  by creating a policy framework that encourages investors to back innovative new technologies reduces risk and inspires new entrants into the space the cost of developing a beccs project should also be fairly distributed among contributing parties ensuring that costs to consumerstaxpayers are minimised building from these principles there are three potential business models that can enable beccs to be developed at the scale and in the timeframe needed to bring the uk to net zero emissions in 2050 power contract for difference cfd by protecting consumers from price spikes and beccs generators and investors from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power this approach offers security to invest in new technology the strike price could also be adjusted to take into account negative emissions delivered and spillover benefits as well as the cost of power generation carbon payment another approach is contractual fixed carbon payments that would offer a beccs power station a set payment per tonne of negative emissions which would cover the operational and capital costs of installing carbon capture technology on the power station this would be a new form of support and unfamiliar to investors who are already versed in cfds the advantage of introducing a policy such as fixed carbon payment is its flexibility and it could be used to support other methods of ggr or ccs the same scheme could be adjusted to reward for example co 2 captured through ccs in industry or direct air carbon capture and storage daccs it could even be used to remunerate measurable spillover benefits from frontrunning beccs projects carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two above the frontier report says it would be the most effective business model for supporting a beccs in power project carbon payments would act as an incentive for negative emissions and spillovers while cfds would then cover the costs of power generation cost and revenue profiles of alternative support options based on assuming a constant level of output over time way to go hybrid why does the hybrid business model of power cfd with carbon payment come out on top frontier considered how easy or difficult it would be to transition each of the options to a technology neutral business model for future projects and then to a subsidy free business model by looking ahead to tech neutrality the business model would not unduly favour negative emissions technologies  such as beccs at drax  that are available to deploy at scale in the 2020s over those that might come online later plus the whole point of subsidies is to help to get essential fledgling technologies and business models off to a flying start until the point they can stand on their own two feet the report concluded ease of transition to technology neutrality  all three options are unlikely to have any technology neutral elements in the shortterm although they could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral and ease of transition to subsidy free  while all of the options can transition to a subsidy free system the power cfd does not create any policy learnings around treatment of negative emissions that contribute to this transition the other two options do create learnings around a carbon payment for negative emissions that can eventually be broadened to other ggrs and then captured within an efficient co 2 market overall we conclude that the twopart business model performs best on this criterion the other two options perform less well with the power cfd performing worst as it does not deliver learnings around remunerating negative emissions assessment of business model options green indicates that the criteria is largely met yellow indicates that it is partially met and red indicates that it is not met transition to a net zero future engineer inspects carbon capture pilot plant at drax power station crucial to the implementation of beccs is the feasibility of these business models in terms of their practicality in being understood by investors how quickly they can be put into action and how they will evolve or be replaced in the longterm as technologies mature and costs go down this can be improved by using models that are comparable with existing policies these business models can only deliver beccs in power as well as other negative emissions technologies at scale and enable the uk to reach its 2050 net zero target if they are implemented now every year of stalling delays the impact positive spillovers and negative emissions can have on global co 2 levels the uk government must provide the private sector with the confidence to deliver beccs and

3  the governments energy white paper commits by 2022 to establishing the role which beccs can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy and setting out how the technology could be deployed the government has also committed to invest up to 1 billion to support the establishment of carbon capture usage and storage ccus in four industrial clusters 4  national grids 2020 future energy scenarios fes indicate that it is not possible to achieve net zero without beccs 5  however at present a business model 6 which could enable this investment is not in place a business model is required because a number of barriers and market failures otherwise make economic investment impossible there is no market for negative emissions there is currently no source of remuneration for the value delivered by negative emissions and therefore no return for the investment needed to achieve them positive spillovers are not remunerated  positive spillovers that would be delivered by a firstofakind beccs power plant but which are not remunerated include providing an anchor load for carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage ts infrastructure that can be used by subsequent ccs projects delivering learning that will help lower the costs of subsequent beccs power plants and delivering learning and shared skills that can be used across a range of ccs projects including hydrogen production with ccs beccs relies on the presence of co 2 transport and storage infrastructure  where this infrastructure doesnt already exist or where the availability or costs are highly uncertain this presents a significant risk to investors in beccs in power ccus incubation area drax power station click image to viewdownload frontier economics has been commissioned by drax to develop and evaluate business model options for beccs in power that could overcome these barriers and help deliver timely investment in beccs business model options we started with a long list of business model options after eliminating options that are unsuitable for beccs in power we considered the following three options in detail power contract for difference cfd the strike price of the cfd would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillover benefits carbon payment a contractual carbon payment would provide a fixed payment per tonne of negative emissions the payment level would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillovers carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two options above the carbon payment would provide remuneration for negative emissions and learnings and spillovers while the power cfd would support power market revenues for the plants renewable power output we first considered if committing to any of these business model options for beccs in power now might restrict future policy options for a broader ggr support scheme we assessed whether these options could over time be transitioned into a broader ggr support scheme ie one not just focused on beccs in power and concluded that this would be possible for all of them we then considered how these business model options could be funded and whether the choice of a business model option is linked to a particular source of funds for example power cfds are currently funded by a levy paid by electricity suppliers to the low carbon contracts company lccc we concluded that business models do not need to be attached to specific funding sources all of the options can be designed to fit with numerous different funding options so the two decisions can be made independently this means that the business model options can be considered on their own terms with thinking about funding sources being progressed in parallel we then evaluated the three business model options against a set of criteria developed from principles set out in the beis consultation on business models for ccs summarised in the figure below figure 1 principles for design of business models instil investor confidence  attract innovation  attract new entrants  instil supply chain confidence cost efficiency  drive efficient management of investment costs  drive efficient quantity of investment  drive efficient dispatch and operation  risks allocated in an efficient way taking into account the impact on the cost of capital feasibility  limit administrative burden  practicality for investors  requirement for complementary policy  wider policy and state aid compatibility  timely

source frontier economics click to viewdownload graphic all three business model options performed well across most criteria however our evaluation highlighted some key tradeoffs to consider when choosing a business model investor confidence the power cfd and the twopart model with a cfd performed better than the carbon payment on this measure as they shield investors from wholesale power market fluctuations feasibility the power cfd performed best on this measure because it is already established in existing legislation and is well understood it will be quick to implement introducing a mechanism to provide carbon payments may require new legislation however this will be needed in any case to support other ccus technologies 7  and could be introduced in time before projects come online and potential to become technology neutral and subsidy free all three options could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral however the standalone power cfd performed least well as it does not deliver any learnings around remunerating negative emissions overall the twopart model performed well across the criteria and would offer a clear path to a technology neutral and subsidy free world delivering learnings that will be relevant for other ggrs as well conclusions the uks net zero target will be challenging to achieve and will require investment in negative emissions technologies to offset residual emissions from hardtoabate sectors as highlighted by the ccc 8  beccs in power is a particularly important part of this picture and represents a costeffective means of delivering the scale of negative emissions needed early investment in beccs is also important in insuring against the risk and cost of back ending significant abatement effort however market failures most notably the lack of a market for negative emissions lack of remuneration for positive spillovers and learnings and reliance on availability of ts infrastructure mean that without policy intervention the required level of beccs in power is unlikely to be delivered in time to contribute to net zero there are a number of business options available in the near term to overcome these barriers in our view a twopart model combining a power cfd and a carbon payment is preferable this measure addresses identified market failures can be implemented relatively easily and in time to capture benefits of early beccs in power investment and can be structured to ensure an efficient outcome for customers including with reference to investors likely cost of capital and in a way that allocates risks appropriately viewdownload the full report pdf  1 biomass can be combusted to generate energy typically in the form of power but this could also be in the form of heat or liquid fuel or gasified to produce hydrogen the resulting emissions can then be captured and stored using ccs technology the focus of this report is on biomass combustion to generate power with ccs which we refer

to biomass has allowed us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 while providing clean and flexible energy to millions of homes and businesses across the uk this month saw the end of commercial coal generation at drax power station  a milestone in the history of our company and of the uk economy too but the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here which is why we have committed to a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  we will achieve this by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with ccs or beccs which will enable us to permanently

we have already successfully run two beccs pilots at the power station in 2019 we demonstrated that we can capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock and in 2020 we began a second pilot working with mitsubishi heavy industries to further enhance the potential for delivering negative emissions we aim to deploy beccs at scale by 2027 to that end earlier this month we kickstarted the planning process for our proposals to build our first beccs units  marking a major milestone in the project and putting us in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 the support we need drax power station has a proud history of transformation and today we are making rapid progress in further decarbonising our operations and making bold commitments about our future the core of our successful decarbonisation has been a close partnership with government  and it is this partnership that will make beccs a reality and enable the multiple benefits that come with it an effective negative emissions policy and regulatory framework from government will enable further investments from companies such as drax we believe it is possible for such a policy framework to emerge in the coming months with cop26 later this year making that policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future here in the uk beccs in context but we know that there is no silver bullet solution to tackling climate change negative emissions technologies such as beccs will be needed alongside others for example more renewables electric vehicles  energy storage energy efficiency and hydrogen beccs will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon beccs complements  and does not  and should not  substitute for ambitious decarbonisation plans technologies such as beccs have a clear and unique role to play by helping harder to abate sectors such as heavy industry aviation and agriculture  decarbonise this is critically important if we are to meet our legally binding 2050 net zero target the ccc estimates that 51m tonnes of co 2 will need to be captured via beccs to meet net zero sustainability at our core we know that beccs can only make a meaningful contribution to tackling climate change if the bioenergy is sustainably sourced this has been fundamental to draxs transition from coal to biomass and it remains fundamental as we progress our plans for beccs biomass as the uk government has stated is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions so we need the right framework to ensure it is sourced sustainably as the worlds largest bioenergy producer and generator we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability too at drax we have invested in world leading policies tools and expertise to ensure that our biomass is sustainably sourced we go beyond regulatory compliance and have set up an independent advisory board  chaired by the uk governments former chief scientific advisor to help us and challenge us on sustainable biomass and its role in draxs transition to net zero click to read thanks to our independent catchment area analyses  we know more about the forests we source from than ever before we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests for example in the south east us where drax sources most of its biomass there is more than double the carbon stored in forests than there was 50 years ago a partnership with our stakeholders the purpose of todays session is to discuss all these issues and more our aim is clear to enable a successful energy transition at drax we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up beccs technology to put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to reach net zero emissions and to help create tens of thousands

in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 a partnership between industry and government successful decarbonisation has always been a partnership between industry and government  this is evident looking at the incredible rise of britains offshore wind sector as a direct response to governments political commitment a strong price signal and an investable contract for difference mechanism offshore wind capacity has grown from 1gw to over 10gw in a decade and build costs are now two thirds lower than what they were 10 years ago pylon that takes excess wind power to be stored at cruachan pumped hydro storage power station in scotland at drax our conversion from coal to biomass was benefited from much the same framework the uk government was  and continues to be  very strong in its support for biomass as a renewable technology to replace coal our cfd mechanism has given investors the certainty they need to invest and successive governments commitment to a carbon price that matches or exceeds that of our european neighbours has told the market that britain is serious about decarbonising the power sector rapidly that combination of factors  a clear transparent investable framework for renewables combined with a strong price signal from the uk government discouraging fossil fuel power generation  has been the key to driving private sector investment in renewable power technology in the uk as a result the uk leads the world in decarbonising its electricity sector  while also enabling a global technology revolution in offshore wind power importantly the whole effort has been underpinned by transparency competition and confidence in the regulatory and legal framework all of which are critical building a partnership for the future by continuing this partnership between industry and government the uk could become the world leader in emerging green technologies such as beccs right now markets and regulatory frameworks for beccs or negative emissions more broadly either dont exist  or arent flexible enough  to support the scaling of the technologies we need to get to net zero  but the firstgeneration framework as i have just described provides a great model fundamentally we believe that we can do beccs at a cost of less than 100t of co 2  which is less than any other negative emissions technology available we know this investment will help the uk reach net zero at a lower cost than it otherwise could do maintenance inside a water cooling tower at drax power station but although were ready to make the investment  the uks regulatory system isnt yet ready to support it despite being world leaders in these areas our carbon pricing system and financial markets dont yet recognise the value of negative emissions even though our political institutions and scientists say they are vital to tackling climate change  there is no government defined business model for beccs which will be essential to signalling long term political support as well as operational support and despite being the best placed country in the world to develop beccs we risk losing out as other countries race to deploy this technology first just last week we saw aker microsoft and orsted sign a memorandum of understanding to develop beccs in denmark however in its tenpoint plan  the uk government has committed to outline what role biomass and beccs will play in the uks transition to net zero by the end of this year soon it will be consulting on a new bioenergy strategy and it has already taken evidence on greenhouse gas removal technologies and consulted on ccs clusters this we believe demonstrates that a set of policies could emerge in the coming months that will support investment in beccs at their core we think these policies should capture the stability and investability of a cfd for the renewable power that we will produce as well as deliver payment for the negative emissions by compensating negative emissions with a credit for every ton of co 2 they remove from the environment the government can properly reward those technologies and add a critical new set of tools to the fight against climate change  ultimately lower the cost of winning that battle this would enable drax to invest in beccs begin delivering negative emissions and helping to decarbonise the north of england as soon as 2027 with cop26 later this year making this policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future develop here in the uk beccs in context we know that there is no silver bullet solution to tackling climate change negative emissions technologies such as beccs will be needed alongside others for example more renewables electric vehicles  energy storage energy efficiency and hydrogen drax employee charging an electric car at haven power in ipswich beccs complements  and does not  and should not  substitute for ambitious decarbonisation plans technologies such as beccs have a clear and unique role to play by helping harder to abate sectors such as heavy industry aviation and agriculture  decarbonise this is critically important if we are to meet our legally binding 2050 net zero target the ccc estimates that 51m tonnes of co 2 will need to be captured via beccs to meet net zero  sustainability at our core we know that beccs can only make a meaningful contribution to tackling climate change if the bioenergy is sustainably sourced this has been fundamental to draxs transition from coal to biomass and it remains fundamental as we progress our plans for beccs sustainably sourced wood residues at morehouse bioenergy pellet plant in louisiana biomass as the uk government has stated is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions so we need the right framework to ensure it is sourced sustainably as the worlds largest bioenergy producer and generator we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability too at drax we have invested in world leading policies tools and expertise to ensure that our biomass is sustainably sourced we go beyond regulatory compliance and have set up an independent advisory board  chaired by the uk governments former chief scientific advisor to help us and challenge us on sustainable biomass and its role in draxs transition to net zero thanks to our independent catchment area analyses  we know more about the forests we source from than ever before we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests for example in the south east us where drax sources most of its biomass there is more than double the carbon stored in forests than there was 50 years ago ready to deliver beccs will be a critical green technology and with the right support and policy framework we could be pioneers in making it a reality  there is no better place to deliver beccs than at drax and no better time to deliver it than now at drax we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up beccs technology to put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to reach net zero emissions and to help create tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england thank you very much for listening will gardiner delivered this keynote address at the utility week investor summit tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and
