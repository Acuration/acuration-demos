Drax is a winner in the RoSPA Awards 2015
23 June 2015
Drax Power Limited (part of the Drax Group) is among the winners in the RoSPA Occupational Health and Safety Awards 2015. The Winner of the Electricity Industry Sector award in the prestigious annual scheme run by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) was presented during a ceremony at ExCeL London on June 16.
As the UK’s family safety charity, RoSPA’s mission to save lives and reduce injuries covers all ages and stages of life. In support of this mission, the RoSPA Awards, which date back 59 years, recognise commitment to continuous improvement in accident and ill health prevention at work. Through the scheme, which is open to businesses and organisations of all types and sizes from across the UK and overseas, judges consider entrants’ overarching occupational health and safety management systems, including practices such as leadership and workforce involvement.
David Rawlins, RoSPA’s Awards Manager, said: “The RoSPA Awards encourage improvement in occupational health and safety management. Organisations that gain recognition for their health and safety management systems such as Drax, contribute to raising standards overall and we congratulate them.”
Andy Koss, Chief Executive for Drax Power said:
“Receiving this award is recognition that our standards and safety practices are among the very best. Safety is our number one priority – nothing is more important. We can be proud of this achievement, but safety requires continuous vigilance and the commitment of everyone across the site.”
The majority of RoSPA’s awards are non-competitive, grading achievement at merit, bronze, silver and gold levels. Organisations that maintain high standards in consecutive years can win gold medals, president’s awards and orders of distinction.
Competitive awards are presented in more than 20 industry sectors, and they also recognise excellence in specialist areas, such as the management of occupational road risk (MORR).
The sponsors of the RoSPA Awards 2015 are: headline sponsor – NEBOSH; The RoSPA International Sector Award – airsweb; The MORR Trophy – Allianz; The International Dilmun Environmental Award – GPIC; The Best New Entry Trophy – Safety and Health Expo; The Workforce Involvement in Safety and Health Trophy – Springfields Fuels; and, The MORR Technology Trophy – Tesco Dotcom.
This year, RoSPA Occupational Health and Safety Awards ceremonies are being held in three locations: at ExCeL London on June 16 alongside the Safety and Health Expo 2015; in Birmingham on July 14 and 15  and in Glasgow on September 17, the day after the RoSPA Scotland Occupational Health and Safety Congress.

Notes
Drax’s principal activities are electricity production, electricity sales to business customers, and processing sustainable biomass for use in electricity production. With carbon abatement central to the business strategy, the Group is transforming itself into a predominantly biomass-fuelled power provider through burning sustainable biomass in place of coal and providing the UK with cost effective, low carbon, and reliable renewable power.
The Group owns and operates the largest power station in the UK, typically responsible for supplying some 7-8% of the UK’s electricity. Upstream the Group has a presence in the US focused on developing wood pellet plants for the self-supply of some of its sustainable biomass requirements. At the other end of the supply chain, the Group’s retail arm, Haven Power, serves the electricity needs of a growing number of business customers.
