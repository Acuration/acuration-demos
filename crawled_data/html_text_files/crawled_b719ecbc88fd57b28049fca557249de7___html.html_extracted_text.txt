Press releases

Patch’s software helps voluntary carbon market participants buy, sell, and manage credits. With the Patch Radius software solution, Drax customers will be able to seamlessly      purchase from a number of portfolios of carbon credits, including those from BECCS by Drax.
Drax has the ambition to become a global leader in carbon removals through the implementation of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology, with the aim of capturing 14 million metric tonnes of carbon removals a year by 2030. Supporting Drax’s ambition in carbon removals, this partnership aims to accelerate the carbon market by facilitating carbon credit sales to companies of all sizes looking to achieve their climate goals.
Marc Bradbrook, SVP Business Development said,
“A strong carbon market will be essential to accelerating the deployment of technologies like BECCS, and business and organisations need to invest in building it now, if we are going to see removals at the volume needed to limit warming to 1.5°C.”
“We are delighted to be entering a partnership with Patch which we hope will enable us to better engage with customers in the carbon credit market and scale this critical industry.”
High integrity carbon credits are increasing in demand as more organisations look to hit their decarbonisation targets. In addition to using the Patch software to facilitate the sale of BECCS by Drax credits to Drax customers, Drax also plans to submit BECCS by Drax credits to be evaluated against Patch’s project acceptance criteria. Once successfully onboarded, BECCS by Drax credits will be available to Patch’s broader network of customers.
“Drax is leveraging Patch Radius to deliver to its customers exactly what they’re looking for: a way to seamlessly access carbon credits. We’re excited to partner with Drax to enable more companies to understand and engage with a range of carbon credits,”
said Jan Mertens, VP of Global Revenue at Patch.
Drax has agreed deals with
Respira
for up to two million metric tonnes of carbon removals, and
C-Zero
, and is continuing to see commitments from emerging players across industries in this space.
Scientists at the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have reached consensus that the world needs to remove and manage gigatons of carbon dioxide to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Accelerating the development of CCS clusters could deliver an extra £32BN for the UK economy per year from 2050
18 October 2023
Press releases

New research shows that cluster development could be worth hundreds of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of pounds in GVA to the UK’s economy by 2050.
With over 80% of the UK’s licensed storage in the North Sea, the majority of these economic benefits could go to the North of England and create an additional 330,000 jobs.
If the UK fails to deliver on its CCS rollout 136,000 jobs could be at risk.
A new independent research report, UK Cluster potential – how the UK can lead the world in Carbon Capture and Storage, by Development Economics, finds that if the UK Government accelerates and expands the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Clusters across the country it could generate an extra £32bn of gross value added (GVA) for the economy from 2050 onward and nearly 500,000 additional jobs.
The research, commissioned by Drax Group, demonstrates that in the most optimistic scenario the UK Government could enhance our energy security, turbo-charge economic growth across the country and cement the UK’s position as a world-leader in carbon capture and removals technology.
It states that this scenario could be delivered through policy changes which can unlock investment and clarify how CCS Clusters are developed. These include:
Finalising CCS business and financial models;
Confirming the role of the UK ETS scheme and voluntary carbon markets in supporting investment in CCS;
Providing a near-term incentive for prospective storage operators to appraise storage locations building on recent North Sea Transition Authority licencing rounds.
The North of England would be the region to benefit most with £22bn added to the economy per year from 2050 onward and 330,000 additional jobs.
The report also explores the economic impacts of two additional scenarios, one where the UK delivers on current CCS policy commitments and another where it does not.
If the UK does fulfil its ambitions, it will be worth an additional £23bn per year from 2050 and an additional 310,000 jobs.
Richard Gwilliam, UK BECCS Programme Director at Drax Group, said:
“Carbon capture and removals can be a catalyst for growth, stronger energy security, increasing employment and reaching Net Zero in the UK. This research demonstrates that if the UK puts its foot on the accelerator and expands the rollout of CCS Clusters across the country, a unique prize worth tens of billions of pounds to the economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs is within reach.
“At Drax, we want to play our part in ensuring the UK becomes a global leader in CCS and that is why we are working towards installing two bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) units at Drax Power Station. This would see us become a key part of a Humber-based carbon capture cluster and we are currently working on routes to deployment through the Track 1 Expansion and Track 2 processes.”
Steve Lucas, Director at Development Economics, said:
“This research demonstrates the significant opportunity for the UK to be a global leader in carbon capture and storage and the importance of CCS for key industries which provides jobs, growth and opportunity across the UK. With ambition, clarity, and the necessary support from Government – following the key suggestions outlined in the report’s roadmap – there is a significant prize to be won for the UK economy and environment”.
However, in its recent progress report the Climate Change Committee warned that the rollout of CCS is already behind schedule and Development Economics’ research shows that if this trend continues and the UK fails to deliver on its CCS policy commitments, the economic effects could be severe.
This includes the loss of 136,000 jobs and £9bn GVA per year from 2050 from heavy-emitting companies, which will have no other route to decarbonise and therefore could move their operations abroad to countries with better resourced and more CCS clusters.
The report argues that the combination of additional support delivered in the most optimistic scenario, the country’s past hydrocarbon expertise and £15bn from the investment community for the energy transition, would put the UK on the map as a world-leader in CCS.
It also demonstrates that the Humber, with existing plans to become the world’s first carbon negative region and 80% of the UK’s licensed CO
2
storage, could become a global model for regional cluster development. The research shows that with increased ambition the Humber could benefit from an additional 42,000 jobs and £3.4bn GVA per year by 2050.
Drax plans plan to invest billions in its BECCS plans at North Yorkshire’s Drax Power Station to develop two units which could remove 8Mt of carbon from the atmosphere per year while continuing to provide renewable baseload power to the UK grid.
This will ensure the station continues to generate secure renewable electricity into the future while delivering up to 10,000 high-skilled jobs in the Humber at the project’s peak and playing a critical role in delivering carbon removals so the UK can meet its binding engineered greenhouse gas removal target.
Drax is currently exploring the roles the Track-1 Expansion and Track-2 CCS cluster sequencing can play in supporting the transition to BECCS at the Selby site. Power-BECCS remains eligible to participate in either process.

The robodog has joined Drax’s Condition Based Maintenance team to spot potential failures on the plant before they happen. The bright yellow dog is fitted with a camera which enables it to conduct critical visual and thermal inspections on equipment such as hot boilers while its human controllers are kept safe away from the equipment.
As Sparky gets familiar with the plant, he will be programmed to follow tailored routes around the site. This will enable him to operate autonomously, enhancing efficiency even further.
Ensuring the safety, health, and wellbeing of people on site is the company’s top priority. Drax’s investment in Sparky is part of a wider drive to improve safety standards across the company’s global operations.
Richard Barber, Maintenance Systems Lead Engineer, said:
“A robotic dog might not be what you have in mind when you think about safety, but Sparky is a real game changer for us. The technology enables our team to collect better information about our equipment, while also keeping our colleagues out of harm’s way.
“Its optical panoramic camera allows us to zoom in-depth on equipment and it is fitted with a thermal infrared camera, which means we can see any hot spot or unusual thermal anomalies on the machinery. We want to prevent faults from happening, not simply repair them when they occur. With Sparky on patrol at the power station, we will be able to do just that.”
Sparky will have plenty of room to roam around, with Drax Power Station being one of the country’s largest industrial sites. The plant near Selby has four operational power generating units, each as high as a 15-storey office block, a main chimney nearly as tall as the London Shard, and more than 1,800 miles of steel tubing, enough to stretch from John O’Groats to Land’s End and back again.
The four-legged friend is the brainchild of Boston Dynamics, an American engineering and robotics design company which started as a spin-off from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Sparky is part of the Spot pedigree of robodogs from the firm.

Drax joins the Carbon Business Council
19 September 2023
Press releases

As a Cornerstone Member, Drax will work with the Carbon Business Council to accelerate the scaling of carbon removal technologies and build a network of leaders within the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) space. Drax aims to be a global leader in CDRs through the implementation of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
The
Carbon Business Council
(CO2BC) is a non-profit trade association of companies and organisations that have come together to responsibly restore the climate, and which now represent combined carbon management assets of more than $16.5 billion.
Drax’s expertise will assist the Carbon Business Council in developing CDR policy, building awareness of why carbon removals are an essential pillar of climate action, and fostering community within the CDR industry.
Ross McKenzie, Group Director of Corporate Affairs said,
“Nearly all pathways to limit global warming to 1.5C require carbon removals like those delivered by bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.”
“At Drax, we want to become global leaders in carbon dioxide removals and are thrilled to be joining the Carbon Business Council as a Cornerstone member to further accelerate the development of the nascent CDR industry.”
In joining, Drax has signed the
Ethical Oath to Restore the Earth
, which calls for the responsible delivery of carbon removals, including the importance of removals working in tandem with emissions reductions.
Ben Rubin, the Executive Director and Co-Founder of the Carbon Business Council said,
“From the printing press to penicillin, entrepreneurs have a history of approaching challenges with a problem-solving set of eyes. Because reversing climate change will require multiple solutions coming from both innovators and policymakers, it’s important to have market leaders like Drax at the policy table.”
Carbon removals are used by organisations to balance their hard-to-abate carbon emissions, achieve a net zero and, in some cases, a carbon negative status. Longer lasting and lower risk carbon credits, such as the types generated by carbon removals technologies, are increasing in demand as more organisations look to hit their decarbonisation targets.
Drax hopes to invest billions over the coming years in global carbon removals and renewable energy projects, with the aim of capturing 14 million metric tonnes of carbon removals a year by 2030.
Scientists at the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have
reached consensus
that the world needs to remove and manage gigatons of carbon dioxide in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Drax Foundation funds new £150k grant to help schools become more energy efficient
Press releases

The new funding will enable Bath-based
Energy Sparks
to ensure that up to 240 schools across the UK have free access to its online energy management tool, education programme and support services. This includes schools in the areas of the country where Drax Group operates: Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, East of England and Scotland.
The charity currently works with more than 1,000 UK schools to help them reduce their energy use and carbon footprint.
Shona King, Head of Community at Drax Group, said:
“We are proud that this new grant will help Energy Sparks engage many more schools and pupils across the UK in reducing their energy use and costs as well as fighting climate change. Alongside our existing grant funding for LED lighting and solar panels, we are excited to bring Energy Sparks’ energy analysis tool and education programme to more schools in and around the communities where we operate.
“It’s important to us to help children start thinking about saving energy and reducing their carbon footprint from a young age as these issues are going to be increasingly important for them in the future.”
Dr Claudia Towner, CEO and Programme Director at Energy Sparks, said:
“We are delighted to receive this funding from the Drax Foundation, it means we can reach even more schools and pupils, and remove financial barriers to ongoing engagement for some of the existing schools using our services.
“Our work equips children and young people with the knowledge, skills, and tools to take measurable action in their school and wider community to reduce carbon emissions. We also enable school leaders, staff and communities to better understand and reduce their school’s energy consumption, save money and introduce wider measures to reduce their carbon footprint.”
Energy Sparks was founded in 2020 and, in the last year, through Energy Sparks’ tools, the average primary school it works with has saved at least £3,000 in energy costs and 12.8 tonnes of CO2, additionally, the average secondary school has saved at least £12,000 and 48 tonnes of CO2.
Energy Sparks’ education activities encourage pupils to learn about climate change and why reducing carbon emissions is important, investigating energy use around the school site, taking action to reduce energy use and spreading the energy saving and carbon reduction message across their wider school community.
Energy Sparks’ online tool presents bespoke analysis of the energy data with suggestions of actions the school community could take to save energy and reduce the school’s carbon emissions.
This new funding is drawn from a pot of £1.5m that Drax Foundation
unveiled earlier this year
for UK schools to install energy-efficient LED lights and solar panels, and deliver energy saving monitoring and education.

Gone with the wind: fossil fuel loses ground in UK’s energy mix
13 September 2023
Press releases

After more than a century of fossil fuels dominating the UK’s power grid, Britain now has more installed wind capacity than gas generation.
New data from Drax Electric Insights also shows output from gas power stations fell year on year by 23% in Q2 2023 and output from coal fell by 75% to its lowest level on record.
Carbon emissions from electricity production fell to less than 10 million tonnes of CO2 in the second quarter of 2023 for only the second time on record
New analysis from Imperial College London for Drax Electric Insights has found that for the first time ever, installed wind capacity has surpassed gas, reaching 27.9GW in June compared to the 27.7GW installed capacity of gas generation.
As a result, after more than a century of fossil fuels dominating Britain’s electricity grid, coal and gas power generation has plummeted at the fastest rate outside of the pandemic.
In its latest quarterly report, Drax Electric Insights has found that output from gas-fired power stations fell by 23% in Q2 2023 compared to the same quarter last year. Meanwhile output from coal, which was once was the backbone of grid, was slashed by 75% to its lowest levels on record.
Overall, carbon emissions from electricity production fell to less than 10 million tonnes of CO2 in the second quarter of 2023 for only the second time on record, with the only previous occasion being due to the destruction of demand from Covid-19 lockdowns.

Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and lead author of the quarterly Drax Electric Insights report series, said:
“Wind power is blowing away gas and coal from Britain’s energy mix and in just a decade, we’ve gone from relying completely on the polluting fuels of the past to embracing the clean energy technologies of the future.
“The shift to wind as the largest power source by capacity is a clear sign of the progress we’ve made, showing countries around the world that they can decarbonise their power grids when government and industry works together.”
Great Britain now has just one remaining coal-fired power station following Drax’s decision earlier this year to permanently end use of the fuel at its plant in North Yorkshire.
Once the largest coal-fired power station in Western Europe, Drax Power Station is now the single largest generator of renewable power in the UK. Over the last decade, four of the power station’s six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass, providing the UK with clean, green, and secure renewable electricity.
Penny Small, Drax’s Group Generation Director, said:
“Cutting the UK’s reliance on imported foreign gas and coal is critical to strengthening the country’s national energy security and tackling climate change.
“At Drax, we believe the UK’s next big focus should be on unlocking investment in technologies which permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere. That’s why we are progressing plans to deploy Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology at scale in the UK and the US.
“BECCS is a remarkable technology that simultaneously removes millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while generating renewable electricity.”
