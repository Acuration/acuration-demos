power station tag electricity system balancing and ancillary services the great balancing act what it takes to keep the power grid stable 8 june 2018 power generation what does it mean to say great britains electricity network needs to be balanced it doesnt refer to the structural stability of pylons rather balancing the power system is about ensuring electricity supply meets demand second by second from the side of a consumer the power system serves one purpose to deliver electricity to homes and businesses so that it powers our lives but from a generator and a system operator perspective there is much more at play electricity must be transported the length of the country levels of generation must be managed so they are exactly equal to levels being used and properties like voltage and frequency must be minutely regulated across the whole network to ensure power generated at scale in industrial power stations can be used by domestic appliances plugged into wall sockets ensuring all this happens smoothly relies on the system operator  national grid  working with power generators to provide ancillary services  a set of processes that keep the power system in operation stable and balanced here we look at some of the most important ancillary services at play in great britain frequency response one of the foundations of great britains power system stability is frequency the entire power network operates at a frequency of 50 hz  which is determined by the number of directional changes alternating current ac electricity makes every second however just a 1 deviation from this begins to damage equipment and infrastructure so it is imperative it remains consistent this is done by national grid instructing flexible generators such as thermal steampowered turbines like those at drax power station or our planned battery facility  to either increase or decrease generation so electricity supply is matched exactly to demand if this is unbalanced it affects the networks frequency and lead to instability and equipment damage generators are set up to respond automatically to these request correcting frequency deviations in seconds reactive power and voltage management the electricity that turns on light bulbs and charges phones is whats known as active power however getting that active power around the transmission system efficiently economically and safely requires something called reactive power  reactive power is generated the same way as active power and assists with pushing the real power around the system but unlike active power its does not travel very far the influence of reactive power is local and the balance in any particular area is very important to maintain power flows and a stable system this means national grid must work with generators to either generate more reactive power when there is not enough or absorb it when there is an excess which can happen when lines are lightly loaded meaning they have a low level of power running through them draxs ability to absorb reactive power is also vital in controlling the grids voltage  great britains system runs at a voltage of 400 kilovolts kv and 275 kv scotland also uses 132kv before it is stepped down by transformers to 230 volts for homes or 11 kv for heavy industrial users voltage must stay within 5 of 400 kv before it begins to damage equipment by producing reactive power a generator increases the voltage on a system but by switching to absorbing reactive power it can help lower the voltage keeping the grids electricity safe and efficient system inertia as well as being able to automatically adjust to keep the country on the right frequency draxs massive turbines spinning at 3000 rpm also have the advantage of adding inertia to the grid  inertia is an objects natural tendency to keep doing what it is currently doing this system inertia of the spinning plant is effectively stored energy this can be used to act as a damper on the whole system to slow down and smooth out sudden changes in system frequency across the network  much like a cars suspension it helps maintain stability reserve power humans are creatures of habit this means the whole country tends to load dishwashers turn on tvs and boil kettles at roughly the same time each day making the rise and fall in electricity demand easy enough for national grid to predict however if something unexpected happens  a sudden cold snap or a power station breaking down  the grid must be ready for this national grid keeps reserve power on the system to jump into action and fill any sudden gaps in demand and fluctuations in voltage and frequency it could cause ancillary services in an evolving system as with how electricity is generated across the country balancing services are undergoing major change as more intermittent renewables such as wind and solar come onto the system to provide low carbon power necessary for great britain to decarbonise  that same system becomes more volatile and more difficult to balance click to viewdownload more than that the ancillary services needed to stabilise a more volatile grid cant be generated by every generation source many depend on a turbine rotating at 3000 rpm generating electricity at a steady frequency of 50hz as is found in thermal generators such as drax intermittent also known as variable sources of power are weather dependent  they are often unable to provide the same services as biomass and gas power stations while attempts to supply some of these ancillary services by colocating wind or solar facilities with giant batteries are underway thermal power stations that can quickly and reliably balance the system at scale still play an essential role in making the transmission network safe efficient

rapid decarbonisation  tags flexibility and stability and power system security  electricity system balancing and ancillary services keeping the electricity systems voltage stable 15 may 2018 power generation in daytoday life the electricity system normally plays a consistent unfluctuating role powering the same things in the same way however behind the scenes electricity generation is a constant balancing act to keep the grid stable power stations themselves are like living animals  in need of continuous adjustment transmission networks need continual maintenance and keeping the whole grid at a frequency of 50 hz takes careful monitoring and finetuning one of the other constant challenges for great britains electricity system is keeping voltage under control keeping the volts in check voltage is a way of expressing the potential difference in charge between two points in an electrical field in more simplistic terms it acts as the pressure that pushes charged electrons known as the current through an electric circuit great britains national grid system runs at a voltage of 400 kilovolts kv and 275kv scotland also uses 132kv it is then reduced in a series of steps by transformers to levels suitable for supply to customers for example 11kv for heavy industrial or 230 volts v when delivered to homes by regional distribution networks  keeping the voltage steady requires careful management a deviation as small as 5 above or below can lead to increased wear and tear of equipment  and additional maintenance costs or even largescale blackouts power stations such as drax can control the voltage level through whats known as reactive power  if voltage is high absorbing reactive power back into the generator reduces it says drax lead engineer gary preece by contrast generating reactive power increases the voltage reactive power is made in an electricity generator alongside active power the electricity that powers our lights and devices and national grid can request generators such as drax to either absorb or produce more of it as its needed to control voltage so how is a generator spinning at 3000 rpm switched from producing to absorbing reactive power all it takes is the turn of a tap absorbing reactive power taps along a transformer allow a certain portion of the winding  which make up a transformers active part with the core  to be selected or unselected this allows the transformer to alter whats known as the phase angle which refers to the relationship between apparent power made up of reactive power and active power and active power this change in the phase angle regulates the power factor power factor is measured between 0 and 1 between 1 and 0 lagging means a generator is producing reactive power and increasing overall voltage whereas between 1 and 0 leading means it is absorbing reactive power and reducing voltage that absorbed reactive power doesnt just disappear rather it transfers to heat at the back end of the power stations generator temperatures can be in excess of 60 degree celsius says preece theres also a lot of vibration caused by the changes in flux at the end of the generator this can cause long term damage to the winding as the generators continue to produce active power while absorbing reactive power the conditions begin to reduce efficiency and if prolonged begin to damage the machines draxs advantage here is that it operates six turbines all of which are capable of switching between delivering or absorbing reactive power or vice versa in under two minutes voltage management in a changing grid the changing nature of great britains energy supply means voltage management is trickier than ever voltage creeps up when power lines are lightly loaded the increase of decentralised generation  such as solar panels and smallscale onshore wind farms operating to directly supply specific localities or a number of customers embedded on regional electricity networks  means this is becoming more common around the grid this creates a greater demand for the kind of reactive power absorption and voltage management that drax power station carries out gridscale batteries are being increasingly developed as a means of storing power from weather dependent renewable sources this power can then be pumped onto the grid when demand is high in a similar manner these storage systems can also absorb reactive power when theres too much on the system and discharge it when its needed  bringing the voltage down and up respectively the trouble is gridscale battery storage systems need to be absolutely huge and a 100 mw facility would be close to the size of football field and double stacked explains preece they are also not synchronised to the grid as a thermal turbine generator would be subsequently there is no contribution to inertia  as great britains power system continues to evolve maintaining its stability also needs to adapt where once the challenge lay in keeping voltage high and enough reactive power on the grid today its absorbing reactive power and keeping voltage down  it highlights the need for thermal generators that are designed to quickly switch between generating and absorbing to support the wider network this story is part of a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the areas of balancing services system support services and ancillary services

ancillary services the power systems super subs 5 february 2018 power generation every day we flick on lights load dishwashers and boil kettles but few of us pause and think of the stress this can cause for the electricity system we certainly dont call national grid in advance to let them know when we plan to do laundry but when any number of the 258 million households in great britain turn on a washing machine the grid needs to be ready for it fortunately these spikes in demand are often predictable we are creatures of habit says ian foy drax head of ancillary services we all tend to come home from work at the same time and turn on similar appliances and this keeps the shape of daily electricity demand much the same national grid the operator of great britains high voltage power transmission system uses this consistent demand to plan when and how much electricity will be needed for the coming days and agrees contracts with generators to meet it however there are times when the unexpected can happen  an unseasonable cold spell or a power station breakdown  causing sudden imbalances in supply and demand to plan for this the grid carries reserve power which is used to fill these shortterm gaps delivering this doesnt just mean keeping additional power stations running to deliver last minute electricity instead it involves a range of services coming from different types of providers technologies and timescales in great britain there are four primary ways this is delivered frequency response the fastest form of reserve is frequency response it is an automatic change in either electricity generation or demand in response to the system frequency deviating from the target 50hz  generation and demand must be kept balanced within tight limits second by second failure to do so could lead to the whole system becoming unstable leading to the risk of blackouts this is why every second of the day national grid has power generators operating in frequency response mode these power stations effectively connect their steam governor or fuel valves to a frequency signal if frequency falls generation increases if frequency rises generation is reduced an issue which has arisen over the past few years is a reduction in system inertia  the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension some small power generation technologies along with some demand are sensitive to the rate of change of frequency  too high a rate can cause it to disconnect from the system and this unplanned activity can lead to system instability some forms of generation such as wind and solar along with high voltage direct current hvdc interconnectors between great britain and the rest of europe do not provide inertia as these electricity sources grow on the system the system operator must find ways to accommodate them reducing the size of the largest credible loss eg reducing interconnector load buying faster frequency response or running conventional generation out of merit are the usual approaches spinning reserve the next quickest and most common reserve source spinning reserve can jump into action and start delivering electricity in just two minutes this reserve both positive and negative is carried on multiple generating units often running at a part load position for example if draxs biomass unit 3 is running at 350 mw of a possible 645 mw typical delivery rates are 10 to 20 mw per minute this type of reserve responds to unexpected shortterm changes in power demand or changes in power generation either in size or timing for example during a major tv event or if a generator changes output unexpectedly during television ad breaks the millions of people watching may switch on kettles or flick on lights sending demand soaring  if a programme or sporting event does not end at the scheduled time national grid has to quickly change the generation schedule by sending an electronic dispatch to a generator who responds by quickly ramping up or down thermal power stations such as drax along with hydro and pumped storage which can increase or decrease output on demand  are the most common providers of this form of reserve but newer technologies such as batteries will also be able to offer the speed required  short term operating reserve stor a slightly slower cousin to spinning reserve stor is contracted months in advance by national grid it is designed to be available within 20 minutes notice around 2 gigawatts gw of capacity can provide reserves against exceptionally large losses or demand spikes stor capacity tends to be plant which cannot make a living in the energy market because it has a high marginal cost traditionally stor has been supplied by low efficiency aeroderivative turbines or diesel engines but a wider variety of technologies from batteries to demand reduction are increasingly being contracted demand turn up managing reserve power isnt just about finding extra generation to meet demand sometimes its about quickly addressing too much generation high levels of generation coming onto the grid without an equally high demand can overload power lines and networks  causing instability and frequency imbalances  which can lead to blackouts this might happen in the summer months when the weather allows for lots of intermittent renewable generation such as wind and solar but low levels of demand due to factors like warmer weather and longer daylight hours to restore balance the grid is beginning to ask intensive commercial or industrial electricity users to increase consumption or turn off any of their own generation in favour of gridprovided power in the case of generating units at drax power station  the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation to help slow the rate of frequency change and minimises large frequency swings reserve in a changing energy system planning for the unexpected has long been a staple of the electricity system but as the shape of that system changes  reserve and response delivery is having to change too carrying reserve is easier on conventional plants because you know what the plant is capable of generating says foy wind and solar are subject to the weather which changes over time the certainty you get with conventional generation you dont necessarily get with the intermittency of weatherdependant renewables add to that the way we use electricity everything from high efficiency lighting electric vehicles through to smart appliances and we can see the challenges will grow as more variable renewables hits the system storage technologies will become more important in providing a fastacting source of short term reserve and response smart appliance technology too will play a bigger role in spreading demand across the day and reducing the size of demand peaks and troughs which require rapid changes in generation industry has a role to play too some of the biggest users of electricity are expected to play an increasingly important role in support of the system operator national grid told members of parliament in 2016 that it is our ambition to have 3050 of our balancing capacity supplied by demand side measures by 2020 artists impression of a drax rapidresponse gas power station ocgt with planning permission until these technologies and market mechanisms are widespread and implemented at scale across the grid however it will fall to thermal power stations such as biomass  gas turbines such as the planned progress

energy storage  electricity system balancing and ancillary services how electricity is made 25 january 2018 power generation every morning we take electricity as a given we switch on lights charge phones and boil kettles without thinking about where this power comes from the electronic devices and appliances that make up our daily routines are not particularly energy intensive boiling a kettle only uses 93 watts toasting for three minutes only requires 60 watts while cooking in a microwave for five minutes takes 100 watts however when people are waking up and making breakfast in almost 30 million households around the uk those small amounts soon create a significant demand for electricity on a typical winters morning  this combined demand spikes to more than 45 gigawatts gw  so this is what it takes to power your breakfast  from the everyday toaster in your kitchen backwards through thousands of miles of cables to the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of machinery in wind farms hydroelectric dams and at power stations such as drax where electricity generation begins the grid the journey starts in the home where all our electricity usage is tracked by meters these are becoming increasingly smart  displaying near realtime information on energy consumption in financial terms and allowing more accurate billing there are already 77 million smart meters installed around the uk but that number is set to triple this year  paving the way for a smarter grid overall what brings electricity into homes is perhaps the most visible part of the energy system on the uks landscape the transmission system is made up of almost 4500 miles of overhead electricity lines nearly 90000 pylons and 342 substations all bringing electricity from power stations into our homes  making sure all this happens safely and as efficiently as possible falls to the uks nine regional electricity networks and national grid regional networks ensure all the equipment is in place and properly maintained to bring electricity safely across the country while national grid is tasked with making sure demand for electricity is met and that the entire grid remains balanced  the station cools down one of the most distinctive symbols of power generation cooling towers carry out an important task on a massive scale water plays a crucial role in electricity generation but before it can be safely returned to the environment it must be cooled water enters cooling towers at around 40 degrees celsius and is cooled by air naturally pulled into the structure by its unique shape this means those plumes exiting from the top of the towers are rather than any form of pollution only water vapour and this accounts for just 2 of the water pumped into the towers drax counts 12 cooling towers each 114 metres tall  enough to hold the statue of liberty with room to spare once the water is cooled it is safe to reenter the nearby river ouse the stations birdseye view the control room is the nerve centre of drax power station from here technicians have a view into every stage of the power generation process the entire system controls roughly 100000 signals from across the power stations six generating units  water cooling air compressors and more while once this area was made up of analogue dials and controls it has recently been updated and modernised to include digital interfaces display screens and workstations specially designed by drax to enable operators to monitor and adjust activity around the plant the heart of power generation at the epicentre of electricity generation is draxs six turbines  these heavyduty pieces of equipment do the major work involved in generating electricity highpressure steam drive the blades which rotates the turbine at 3000 revolutions per minute rpm this in turn spins the generator where energy is converted into the electricity that will eventually make it into our homes these are rugged pieces of kit operating in extreme conditions of 165 bar of pressure and temperatures of 565 degrees celsius each of the six turbine shaft lines weighs 300 tonnes and is capable of exporting over 600 megawatts mw into the grid one of the most important parts of the entire process turbines are carefully maintained to ensure maximum efficiency even a slight percentage increase in performance can translate into millions of pounds in savings  turning fuel to fire to create the steam needed to spin turbines at 3000 rpm drax needs to heat up vast amounts of water quickly and this takes a lot of heat the power stations furnaces swirl with clouds of the burning fuel to heat the boiler biomass is injected into the furnace in the form of a finely ground powder this gives the solid fuel the properties of a gas enabling it to ignite quickly additional air is pumped into the boiler to drive further combustion and optimise the fuels performance pulveriser how do you turn hundreds of tonnes of biomass pellets into a powder every day thats the task the pulveriser take on in each of the power plants 60 mills 10 steel and nickel balls each weighing 12 tonnes  operate in extreme conditions to crush crunch and pulverise fuel these metal balls rotate 37 times a minute at roughly 3 mph exerting 80 tonnes of pressure crushing all fuel in their path air is then blasted in at 190 degrees celsius to dry the crushed fuel and blow it into the boiler at a rate of 40 tonnes per hour the journey begins biomass arrives biomass arrives at drax by the trainload roughly 14 arrive every day at the power station delivering up to 20000 tonnes ready to be used as fuel these trains arrive from ports in liverpool tyne immingham and hull and are specially designed to maximise the efficiency of the entire delivery process  allowing a full train to unload in 40 minutes without stopping the biomass is then taken to be stored inside draxs four huge storage domes  each capable of fitting the albert hall inside the domes can hold 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets between them here the biomass waits until its needed at which point it makes its way along a conveyor belt to the pulveriser and the process of generating the electricity that
