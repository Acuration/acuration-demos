battersea power station along the banks of the thames are architectural icons of the london skyline but before they were landmarks they were oil and coalburning power stations right in the heart of the city they powered as the city developed the technology used to generate power advanced and the need for cleaner fuel sources grew  the requirement for large citybased fossil fuel power stations like these fell the closure of battersea and the bankside power stations became inevitable rather than knocking them down however it was clear their scale heritage and location could be repurposed to

a sharp turn downwards instead theyre in a race to the bottom to earn the title of the first net zero carbon city in the uk while they might be battling to be the first in the uk to reach net zero they are far from the only cities with net zero in their sights in the wake of the growing climate emergency cities companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting net zero it has become a global focus based on necessity  for the world to hit the paris agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees celsius its predicted the world must become net zero by 2070  yet despite its ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and societys drive for real change across the uk drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030  removing more carbon from the atmosphere than produced in our operations creating a negative carbon footprint track our progress at towards carbon negative   in this article weve simplified our explanation of net zero carbon dioxide co 2  is the most abundant greenhouse gas ghg it is also a longlived ghg that creates warming that persists in the long term although the land and ocean absorb it a significant proportion stays in the atmosphere for centuries or even millennia causing climate change it is therefore the most important ghg to abate other longlived ghgs include include nitrous oxide n 2 o lifetime of circa 120 years and some fgasses eg sf 6 with a lifetime of circa 3200 years ghgs are often aggregated as carbon dioxide equivalent abbreviated as co 2 e or co 2 eq and it is this that net zero targets measure in this article carbon is used for simplicity and as a

accessible and safe to use for just about everyone every day widescale blackouts are very rare but they do happen on 9 august 2019 a power cut saw more than 1 million people and services lose power for just under an hour it was the first largescale blackout since 2013 although this proves the network is not infallible the fact it was such an outlier in the normal performance of the grid highlights its otherwise exemplary stability and reliability but what is it exactly that makes an electricity system stable and reliable at its core system stability comes down to two key factors a country or regions ability to generate enough electricity and its ability to then transport it through a transmission system to where its needed when everything is running smoothly an electricity system is described as being balanced  in this state supply meets demand exactly and all necessary conditions  such as voltage and frequency  are right for the safe and efficient transport of electricity any slight deviation or mismatch across any of these factors can cause power stations or infrastructure to trip and cut off power a recent report by electric insights identified the countries around the world with most reliable power systems in which the uk was fourth it offers an insight into what factors contribute to building a stable system as well as those that hold some countries back generation and reliable infrastructure according to the report france has the most reliable electricity system of any country with a population of more than five million people having gone a decade without a power outage one reason for this is the countrys fleet of 58 statecontrolled nuclear power stations which generate huge amounts of consistent baseload power in 2017 nuclear power made up more than 70 of frances electricity generation while hydropower accounted for another 10 of the 475 terawatt hours twh consumed across the county that year penly nuclear power station near dieppe france now as its nuclear stations age france is increasing its renewable power generation as these sources are often weather dependent imports from and exports to its neighbours are expected to become a more important part of keeping the french network stable at times when there is little sunlight or wind  or too much importing and exporting electricity is also key to switzerlands power system third most reliable network on the list with 41 bordercrossing power lines allowing the country to serve as a crossroads for power flowing between italy and germany it means its total imports and exports can often exceed electricity production within the country electricity pylons in switzerland switzerlands mountainous landscape also means ensuring a reliable electricity system requires a carefully maintained transmissions system the swiss grid is 6700 kilometres long and uses 40000 hitech metering points along it to record and process around 10000 data points in seconds  the key to the stability of south korea  the second most stable network on the list  is also its imports but rather than actual megawatts it comes in the form of oil gas and coal the country is the worlds fourth biggest coal importer and its coal power stations account for 42 of its total generation seoul south korea however in the face of urban smog issues and global decarbonisation goals it is pursuing a switch to renewables this can come with repercussions to stability so south korea is also investing in transmission infrastructure including a new interconnector from the east of the country to seoul its main source of electricity consumption it highlights that if decarbonisation is going to accelerate at the pace needed to meet paris agreement targets then many of the worlds most stable and reliable electricity systems need to go through significant change balance will be needed between meeting decarbonisation targets with overall system stability however there are many countries around the world that focus less on ensuring consistent stability through decarbonisation and are instead more focused on how to achieve stability in the first place stalling generation the democratic republic of congo is the eleventhlargest country on earth it is rich with minerals and resources yet it is the least electrified nation just 9 of people have access to power in rural areas that number drops to just 1 and the country suffers blackouts more than once a month as a result of load shedding when there isnt enough power to meet demand so parts of the grid are deliberately shut down to prevent the entire system failing currently the country has just 27 gw of installed electricity capacity 25 gw of which comes from hydropower  the countrys inga dam facility on the congo river has the potential to generate more electricity than any other single source of power on the planet its thought the proposed grand inga site could produce as much as 40 gw  twice that of chinas three gorges dam and provide electricity to a massive part of southern africa a legacy of political instability in the country however has so far made securing financing difficult congo river democratic republic of congo nigeria is one of the worlds fastest growing economies and with that comes rapidly rising demand for electricity however just 45 of the country is currently electrified and of these areas many still suffer outages at least once a month the country has 125 gw of installed capacity most of which comes from thermal gas stations but technical problems in power stations and infrastructure mean it is often only capable of generating as much as 5 gw to transmit on to end consumers this limited production capability means it often fails to meet demand resulting in outages the problem has been prolonged by struggling utility companies that are unable to make the investments needed to stabilise electricity supply keen to resolve what it has referenced as an energy supply crisis the nigerian government recently secured a 1 billion credit line from the world bank to improve access to electricity across the country the investment will focus in part on securing the transmission system from theft thus allowing the private utility companies to generate the revenue needed to improve generation transmission holding back emerging systems balancing transmissions systems is a crucial part of stable electricity networks maintaining a steady frequency that delivers safe usable electricity into homes and businesses is at the crux of reliability even countries that can generate enough electricity are held back if they cant efficiently get the electricity to where it is needed brazil has an abundance of hydropower installed its 97 gw of hydro accounts for more than 70 of the countrys electricity mix  however the countrys dams are largely concentrated around the amazon basin in the north west whereas demand comes from cities in the south and eastern coastline transporting electricity across long distances between generator and consumer makes it difficult to maintain the correct voltage and frequency needed to keep a stable and reliable flow of electricity as a result brazil suffers a blackout every onetothree months hydropower plant henry borden in the serra do mar brazil the country is tackling its transmissions problems by diversifying its electricity mix to include greater levels of solar and wind off its east coast  closer to many of its major cities the country has also looked to new technology for solutions at the start of the decade as much as 8 of all electricity being generated in brazil was being stolen  reaching as high as 40 in some areas these illegal hookups both damage infrastructure making it less reliable as well as blur the true demand making grid management challenging brazil has since deployed smart meters to measure electricitys journey from power stations to end users more accurately allowing operators to spot anomalies sooner electricity theft is a major problem in many developing regions with as much as 10 billion worth of power lost each year in india which suffers blackouts as often as brazil it highlights that even when there is generation to meet demand maintaining stability at a large scale requires constant attention and innovation as new challenges arise this looks different around the world some countries might face challenges in shifting from stable thermalbased systems to renewables others are attempting to build stability into newly connected networks but no matter where in the world electricity is being used ensuring reliability is an everongoing task electric insights is commissioned by drax and delivered by a team of independent

to household recycling and access to green spaces cities and governments around the world are facing increasing pressure to find solutions to a growing number of urban problems one of these which doesnt come up often is sewage but every day 11 billion litres of wastewater from drains homes businesses and farms is collected across the uk and treated to be made safe to reenter the water system although for the most part sewage treatment occurs beyond the view of the general population it is something that needs constant work if not dealt with properly it can have a significant effect on the surrounding environment of the many ways that sewage is dealt with perhaps one of the most innovative is to use it for energy daldowie fuel plant near glasgow is one such place which processes sewage sludge taken from the surrounding area into a renewable low carbon form of biomass fuel the solution in the sludge in operation since 2002 daldowie was acquired by drax at the end of 2018 and today processes 35 of all of scotlands wastewater sludge into dry lowodour fuel pellets we receive as much as 25 million tonnes of sludge from scottish water a year says plant manager dylan hughes who leads a team of 71 employees and produce up to 50000 tonnes of pellets making it one of the largest plants of this kind in the world we have to provide a 247 365day service that is built into the infrastructure of glasgow he explains this sludge processed at daldowie is not raw wastewater which is treated in scottish waters sewage facilities instead the sludge is a semisolid byproduct of the treatment process made of the organic material and bacteria that ends up in wastewater from homes and industry from drains sinks and yes toilets until the late 1990s one of great britains main methods of disposing of sludge was by dumping it in the ocean  after this practice was banned cities where left to figure out ways of dealing with the sludge using sludge as a form of fertiliser or burying it in landfills was an already established practice however scottishpower instead decided to investigate the potential of turning sludge into a dry fuel pellet that could offer a renewable low carbon substitute to coal at its power plants cement manufacturing fuel kilns daldowie was originally designed to supply fuel to methil power station near fife which ran on coal slurry however it was decommissioned in 2000 before daldowie could begin delivering fuel to it this led the plant to instead provide fuel to longannet power station where it was used to reduce its dependency on coal before it too was decommissioned in 2016 today daldowies pellets are used in england and scotland to fuel kilns in cement manufacturing  an industry attempting to navigate the same decarbonisation challenges as power generation which daldowie was established to tackle though the end use of the fuel has changed the process through which the facility transforms the waste remains the same the process of turning waste to energy the process starts after wastewater from glasgow and the surrounding area is treated by scottish water daldowie receives 90 of the sludge it processes directly via a pressurised sludge pipeline the rest is delivered via sealed tanker lorries when it arrives at daldowie the sludge is 98 water and 2 solid organic waste it is first screened for debris before entering the plants 12 centrifuges which act as massive spinning driers these separate water from what is known as sludge cake the semisolid part of the sludge feedstock this separated water is then cleaned so it can either be used elsewhere in the process or released into the nearby river clyde membrane tank at daldowie fuel plant the remaining sludge cake is dried using air heated to 450 degrees celsius using natural gas this also reduces germs through pasteurisation while the rotating drums give the fuel granules their pellet shape once dried the pellets are cooled and inspected for quality any material not up to necessary standards is fed back into the system for reprocessing fuel that does meet the right standards is cooled further and then stored in silos where possible throughout the process hot air and water are reused helping keep costs down and ensuring the process is efficient nearly two decades into its life very little has had to change in the way the plant operates thanks to these efficiencies but while the process of turning the waste sludge into energy remains largely unchanged there is as always room for new innovation  improving for the future of the site daldowie is contracted to recycle wastewater for scottish water until 2026 to ensure the plant is still as efficient and effective as possible the daldowie team is undertaking a technical investigation of what if anything would be needed to extend the life of the plant for at least an additional five years the plant operates under the highest environmental and health and safety standards but further improvements are being planned in 2020 hughes explains we are upgrading the odour control equipment to ensure we have a best in class level of performance the control room and plant operators at daldowie draxs scotland office in glasgow is working with other industrial facilities in the area as well as the scottish environmental protection agency sepa to work with the local community we are putting in place a series of engagement events including plant tours from early 2020 offering local residents an opportunity to meet the local team and discuss the planned improvements there are also other potential uses for the fuel including use at drax power station as the pellets are categorised as waste and biomass it would require a new license for the power station however at a time when there is a greater need to reduce the impact of human waste and diversify the countrys energy it would add another source of renewable fuel to great britains electricity mix that could help to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future tags biomass energy  daldowie  decarbonisation  engineering  power station  technology will gardiners drax carbon negative ambition remarks at cop25 will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 10 december 2019 opinion thank you very much nick its a pleasure to be here in madrid my name is will gardiner and i am the ceo of the drax group we have been proud members of the powering past coal alliance for a year now but our journey beyond coal began more than a decade ago when we realised that we had a responsibility to our communities our shareholders and our colleagues to be part of the solution to the escalating climate crisis and so at drax we did something that many believed wasnt possible and began to replace coal generation with sustainable renewable biomass  with the right support and commitment from successive uk ministers and through the ingenuity of our people within a decade we transformed into europes largest decarbonisation project and its biggest source of renewable power  generating 12 of the uks renewable electricity last year while reducing our carbon emissions by more than 80 since 2012 we have reduced our emissions we believe more than any other energy company in the world and we have enabled a just transition for thousands of uk workers who began their career in coal but will end it by producing renewable flexible and low carbon power for 13 million british homes but as the climate crisis intensifies and the clock counts down we cant stand still so today i am pleased to share our new ambition to move beyond carbon neutrality to achieve something that nobody has before and become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030  by applying carbon capture and storage technology to our bioenergy generation we can become the first company in the world to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we produce while continuing to produce about 5 of the uks overall electricity needs as the ipcc and uk governments committee on climate change make clear  negative emissions are vital if we are to limit the earths temperature rise to 15 degrees  at drax we can be the first company to produce negative emissions at scale helping to arrest climate change and redefining what is possible in the transition beyond coal if we are to defeat the climate crisis we must do it in a way that unlocks jobs and economic growth unleashes entrepreneurial spirit and leaves nobody behind the uk is unrivalled in decarbonising in this way we are second to none in deploying renewables like offshore wind and bioenergy  which have transformed lives and our postindustrial communities we need to apply a similar framework to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as made offshore wind so successful fundamentally an effective strategic partnership of government and the private sector was critical the government provided support and an effective carbon tax regime with confidence in that regulatory framework many businesses provided investment and innovation as a result offshore wind has grown from less than 600 megawatts mw of installed capacity in 2008 to more than 8000 mw in 2018  an increase of more than 13 times in 10 years to produce 75 of the uks electricity at the same time the cost of that electricity has declined from 114mwh in 2015 to 39mwh in 2019 the latter being a cost that will make offshore wind viable without subsidy with government support and an effective regulatory regime to give the private sector the confidence to invest and innovate bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will trace that same path at the same time investing in this technology will both save lots of existing jobs and create many next generation green technology jobs that is why we have founded along with equinor and national grid zero carbon humber  to work with the government to bring carbon capture and storage infrastructure to the northeast of the uk we can save 55000 existing heavy industry jobs while capturing as much as 30 million tons of co 2 per year at the same time we will create a new industry and also the infrastructure for a new hydrogen economy to take our decarbonisation further by creating the right conditions for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to flourish britain can continue to benefit  socially economically and environmentally from being at the vanguard of the fight against climate change and at the same time it is our ambition at drax to play a major role in that fight by becoming the first carbon negative

decarbonisation  negative emissions  will gardiner the policy needed to save the future 6 december 2019 carbon capture over the past decade the united kingdom has decarbonised significantly as coal power has been replaced by sources like biomass wind and solar every year power generation emits fewer and fewer tonnes of carbon thanks to renewables and with the ban on the sale of new diesel and petrol cars coming in no later than 2040 roads and urban areas are about to get cleaner too however there are still tough challenges ahead if the uk is to meet its target of carbon neutrality by 2050 aviation heavy industry agriculture shipping power generation  some of the key activities of daily economic life  all remain reliant on fuels that emit carbon this is where greenhouse gas removal ggr technologies have a big role to play these can capture carbon dioxide co 2  and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and either store them or use them helping the drive towards carbon neutrality while the idea of being able to capture carbon has been around for some time the technology is fast catching up with the ambition there now exist a number of credible solutions that allow for capturing emissions the challenge however is putting in place the framework and policies needed to enable technologies to be implemented at scale time is short a recent report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis emphasised the need for government action now if we are to achieve the volume of carbon removal needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 the tech to take emissions out of the atmosphere the planet naturally absorbs co 2  forests absorb it as they grow mangroves trap it in flooded soils and oceans absorb it from the air so harnessing this power through planting growing and actively managing forests is one natural method of ggr that can be easily implemented by policy aerial view of mangrove forest and river on the siargao island philippines the idea of using technology to capture co 2 and prevent its release into the atmosphere has been around since the 1970s it was first deployed successfully in enhanced oil recovery  when captured emissions are injected into underground oil reserves to help remove the oil from the ground over time its been developed and is now in place in a number of fossil fuel power stations around the world allowing them to cut emissions  however by combining the same technology with renewable fuels like compressed biomass wood pellets we can generate electricity that is carbon negative  each of these solutions operate in different ways but all are important vivid economics report emphasises that a range of different solutions will be required to reach a point where 130 million tonnes of co 2 mtco 2  are being removed from the atmosphere in the uk annually by 2050 however investment and clear government planning and guidance will be crucial in enabling the growth of grr the report estimates largescale ggr could cost around 13 billion per year by 2050 in the uk alone a figure similar in size to current government support for renewables if you went back 20odd years people were sceptical of the role of wind solar and biomass and whether the technologies would ever get to a cost point where they could be viably deployed at scale explains drax policy analyst richard gow in the last few years weve seen enormous cost reductions in renewables and people are far more confident in investing in them  that has been driven by very good government policy ggr needs the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  but what shape should those policies take for them to be effective options for policies perhaps the most straightforward route to enabling ggr is to build on existing policies for example there are existing tree planting schemes such as the woodland carbon fund woodland carbon code and the country stewardship scheme all of which could receive greater regulatory support or additional rules obliging emitters to invest in actively managed forests  more technically complex solutions like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs could be incentivised by alternative mechanisms in order to provide clarity on and to stabilise revenue streams these are already used to support companies building lowcarbon power generation such as through the contracts for difference scheme and have been effective in encouraging investment in projects with high upfront costs and longpayback periods alternative options to support the rollout of negative emissions technologies should also be considered for example the government could make it obligatory for companies that contribute to emissions to pay for ggr to avoid increased burden on electricity consumers in such a scenario fossil fuel suppliers would be required to offset the emissions of their products by buying negative emissions certificates from ggr providers as a result the price of fossil fuels for users would likely rise to cover this expense and the costs would then be shared across the supply chain rather than just a single party another approach that passes the costs of ggr deployment on to emitters is using emissions taxes to fund tax credits for ggr providers making these tax credits tradable would also mean any large taxpaying company such as a supermarket or bank could buy tax credits from ggr providers this approach would come at no cost to government as sales of the tax credits would be funded by an emissions tax and would offer revenue to ggr providers the challenge with tax credits however is they are vulnerable to changes in government an alternative is to offer direct grants and longterm contracts with ggr providers which would ensure funding for projects that transcends changes in parliament they could however prove costly for government whatever policy pathway the government may choose to follow there are underlying foundations needed to support effective ggr deployment making policies work there are still many unknown factors in ggr deployment such as the precise volume that will be needed to counter hardtoabate emissions this means all policy must be flexible to allow for future changes and the individual requirements of different regions forestbased solutions might suit some regions daccs might be better in others underlying the strength of any of these policies is the need for accurate carbon accounting understanding how much emissions are removed from the atmosphere by each technology will be key to reaching a true net zero status and giving credibility to certificates and tax credits pearl river nursery mississippi proper accounting of different technologies impact will also be crucial in delivering innovation grants these can come through the uks existing innovation structure and will be fundamental to jumpstarting the pilot programmes needed to test the viability of ggr approaches before commercialisation different approaches to ggr have different levels of effectiveness as well as different costs beccs for example serves two purposes in both generating lowcarbon power and capturing emissions  resulting in overall negative emissions across the supply chain its important to account for the full value chain of beccs explains gow therefore it should be rewarded through two mechanisms a cfd for the clean electricity produced and an incentive for the negative emissions a double policy here is important because you are providing two products which benefit different sectors of the economy one benefits power consumers and the other provides a service to society and the environment as a whole and cost should be apportioned as such beccs and daccs also have to consider wider supply chains such as carbon transport and storage infrastructure  although this requires a high initial investment by connecting to industrial emitters it can enable providers to recover the costs through charges to multiple network users ultimately the key to making any ggr policies work effectively and efficiently is speed in order to put in place accounting principles test different methods and begin courting investors government needs to act now the vivid economics report is further confirmation of the vital role that beccs will play in reaching a net zerocarbon economy and the need to deploy the uks first commercial project in the 2020s drax group ceo will gardiner says our successful beccs pilot is already capturing a tonne of carbon a day with the right policies in place drax could become the worlds first negative emissions power station and the anchor for a zero carbon economy in the humber region it will be significantly more cost efficient to begin deploying ggr in the next decade and slowly increase it up to the level of 130 mtco 2 per year than attempting

2019 power generation rt hon sajid javid mp chancellor of the exchequer hm treasury 1 horse guards road london sw1a 2hq 29 october 2019 dear chancellor need for carbon pricing clarity at the first net zero budget we are writing to you to urge you to maintain the uks robust approach on carbon pricing the prolonged uncertainty regarding the uks carbon pricing future as it exits the eu reiterates the need for the upcoming budget  at whatever final date is chosen  to provide some muchneeded certainty in a potentially turbulent period for businesses across the uk with its approach to carbon pricing the powering past coal alliance and its net zero commitment the uk has been a leader in global efforts to meet the ambition of the paris agreement by phasing out coal as well as incentivising low carbon energy development and helping drive cost reductions this leadership should continue at the first net zero budget as outlined by the committee on climate change in its recent advice to the uk government on its carbon pricing future 1  reaching net zero will require a strong and rising carbon price in order to induce changes to both shortterm behaviour and longerterm investment decisions importantly in the run up to cop26 in glasgow in november 2020 it is important that the uk continues its global leadership and is not perceived to waver on its commitment to tackling climate change given the uncertainty over the uks exit from the eu there is little clarity on what the carbon pricing mechanism will be in the near term and this is already impacting on the forward pricing of carbon in electricity markets therefore providing certainty and stability is crucial when the government sets the carbon price support cps rate for april 2021 and beyond any reduction in cps rates made in isolation of wider clarity on the uks carbon pricing arrangements post eu exit risks sending a negative signal to low carbon investors and undermining the continuing need for a strong and rising carbon price in addition to the considerations on the cps the carbon emissions tax cet  that will replace the eu ets in the event that the uk leaves the eu without a deal  will need to be set out for 2020 as soon as possible to minimise the potential divergence between the cet and the eu ets over 2020 it is vital that the cet is set a level for 2020 that is comparable with recent eu ets pricing we look forward to measures to help the uk meet its leading ambitions at the first net zero budget including certainty and stability on the cps further clarity on the uks carbon pricing future following a successful linking agreement between a uk ets and the eu ets to be in place for 2021 should be provided as soon as is practicable signed drax  ørsted  sse  sandbag cc simon clarke mp exchequer
