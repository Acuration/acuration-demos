biomass capacity expansion and cost reduction 19 november 2019 investors highlights targeting biomass selfsupply capacity of five million tonnes by 2027 15 million tonnes of existing capacity plus 035 million tonnes of lowcost capacity announced at the 2019 half year results evaluating options for a further three million tonnes over the next seven years supports target to reduce biomass cost by c30 percent to c50mwh targeting returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital trading update  inline with expectations acquired assets performing strongly capacity market restored and included in 2019 adjusted ebitda 1 will gardiner drax group ceo said draxs purpose is to enable a zerocarbon lower cost energy future we believe sustainable biomass has a longterm critical role to play thats why we plan to supply 80 percent of our biomass from our own sources  a significant increase on the 20 percent we currently selfsupply supplying more of our own biomass will cut costs and reduce supply chain risks ensuring our biomass power generation remains viable in the long term when combined with carbon capture it will also enable negative emissions helping the uk on its path to net zero by 2050 will gardiner ceo drax group click to viewdownload in high res capital markets day drax is today hosting a capital markets day for investors and analysts will gardiner and his management team will update on how the group is delivering on its purpose the day will outline the significant opportunities drax sees in growing its biomass supply and renewable generation businesses investment in biomass to increase capacity and reduce cost as a part of the groups key strategic objective of building a longterm future for sustainable biomass drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce its cost of biomass to a level which is economic without subsidy in 2027 these savings will be delivered through further optimisation of existing biomass operations and greater utilisation of lowcost wood residues an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other renewable fuels and a significant expansion of selfsupply capacity drax is targeting five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity by 2027 15 million today plus 035 million tonnes in development with greater scope for operational leverage and cost reduction drax will continue to work with its current suppliers to develop its portfolio at the 2019 half year results drax announced an investment in lowcost capacity at its existing three sites in the us gulf adding 350k tonnes of new capacity by 2021 the capital cost is in the region of 50 million enabling targeted fuel cost savings in excess of 15mwh on the additional capacity once commissioned drax is evaluating options to deliver an additional three million tonnes of capacity these options are expected to deliver returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital with strong cash flow generation and a fast payback these activities would enable drax to develop an unsubsidised biomass generation business by 2027 with the option to service wood pellet demand in other markets  europe north america and asia biomass sustainability is at the heart of the groups activities and drax has implemented industry leading processes which support this expansion encourage forest growth and make a positive contribution to climate change drax lasalle bioenergy wood pellet plant in louisiana is now colocated with a sawmill a new rail spur became operational at lasalle earlier in 2019 click to viewdownload options for gas generation drax continues to see flexible gas generation as an enabler of greater renewable and low carbon generation in addition to supporting the development of hydrogen any investment decision would reflect draxs objective of delivering earnings visibility and be underpinned by a 15year capacity agreement to support a low doubledigit rate of return drax would consider a range of funding options including partnerships consistent with draxs balance sheet objective of around 2 x net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 over time capital allocation and dividend drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017 trading and operational performance the performance of the assets acquired from iberdrola in december 2018 has been strong particularly the pumped storage business which has performed well driven by the system support market drax reiterates the adjusted ebitda 1 guidance provided at the time of acquisition of 90110 million in the 2019 financial year in july drax completed the refinancing of the acquisition bridge facility used to acquire these assets these facilities now extend the groups debt maturity profile to 2029 adding an esg 2 facility with a mechanism that adjusts the margin based on draxs carbon emissions against an annual benchmark the groups cost of debt is now below four percent and below three percent on the new facilities reflecting the groups reduced business risk the group continues to identify opportunities to optimise its balance sheet and cash flow during the summer drax completed major planned outages on two biomass units following a delayed return to service the plan is to run all four roc 3 units at high utilisation levels in the fourth quarter of 2019 the outlook for coal generation remains challenging and drax continues to monitor the situation with regards to future operation noting that all unabated uk coal generation must close by 2025 following formal confirmation from the uk government drax expects the capacity market to be reinstated shortly with full retrospective payments made for the capacity provided capacity payments due to drax for 2019 and since the suspension of the capacity market in 2018 are 75 million drax expects these to be included in 2019 adjusted ebitda 1  with cash settlement in january 2020 these factors underpin the groups expectations for full year adjusted ebitda 1  which remain unchanged and

opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing tags about us  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and
