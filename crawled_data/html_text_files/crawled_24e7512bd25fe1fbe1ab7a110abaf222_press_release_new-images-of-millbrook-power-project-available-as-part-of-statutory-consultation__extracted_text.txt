showing what a proposed gasfired power station at rookery south pit in bedfordshire will look like have been published ahead of four exhibition events taking place from friday june 9 2017 as part of the public consultation on the development 7 june 2017 public exhibitions taking place from friday june 9 to monday june 13 images showing the development from different local viewpoints will be on show at the exhibitions local people encouraged to attend and have their say during the public consultation people living and working in the area near the villages of stewartby and marston moretaine in bedfordshire are encouraged to attend the exhibitions where they will be able to meet the team behind millbrook powers proposals find out more about the plans and give their views the proposals for a rapid response gasfired power station at the site in bedfordshire could see millions of pounds invested in the local economy the millbrook power project will support around 150 jobs during construction and create a number of fulltime skilled jobs when operational as well as procuring goods and services from the local area the rapid response gas power station will not be running all the time instead it will be used to provide system support firing up quickly at times when the countrys need for electricity is greatest this includes at times of system stress to plug the gaps when sufficient intermittent renewable power isnt available such as when the wind isnt blowing or the sun isnt shining the project team behind millbrook power which is owned by drax group would like to hear peoples views on the project and the findings of its preliminary environmental information report david ball the millbrook power project director from drax group said the images have been created as part of the environmental impact assessment process to help everyone understand exactly what it is were proposing to develop at the rookery pit site and encourage them to attend the consultation exhibition events many in the area are already aware of our project as it was first announced in 2014 but the public consultation now underway is an important part of the development process we want people in particular those who have moved into the area over the past two to three years to be fully aware of the revised plans and the efforts we have made to minimise the projects impact on the local environment both during its construction and operation the proposals include an underground electricity connection avoiding the need for additional overhead lines and transmission towers a single generating turbine which requires one 35m high chimney stack instead of the five turbines and stacks 40m high previously considered millbrook power is hosting the public exhibitions about its plans in marston moretaine stewartby ampthill and lidlington from june 9 to 13 as part of a 35day period of statutory public consultation people living within 5km of the site should have received a leaflet about the project and the consultation period with a freepost feedback form to provide comments subject to public consultation and planning consent the power station at rookery south pit could be operational in 2022 notes to editors millbrook power is the development company solely focused on taking forward the project at rookery south pit it has been owned by drax group  wwwdraxcomuk

and regarded by millbrook power as an ideal site for a gasfired power plant given the pits proximity to the national gas and electricity transmission networks and its reduced ground levels given its size the project is classified as a nationally significant infrastructure project and so it will be examined by the planning inspectorate on behalf of the secretary of state for business energy  industrial strategy central bedfordshire council and bedford borough council are key consultees in the application process for a development consent order dco millbrook power intends to submit its dco application to the planning inspectorate before the end of this year there would likely be a formal examination period in 2018 and a final decision from the secretary of state could be expected in 2019 the projects preliminary environmental information report considers a range of issues including ecology landscape and visual impacts noise transport and air quality and will be made available during the consultation period at local council offices and libraries it has been published on the projects website  httpswwwdraxcomukaboutusourprojectsmillbrookpowerdocuments   the various studies contained in the report take into account the consented energyrecovery facility proposed nearby by covanta and veolia this is due to its proximity to the proposed millbrook power development site only it is otherwise an entirely separate project and not part of or related to the rapid response gas power station project in any other way millbrook power is owned by drax group which is playing a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used as the uk moves to a low carbon future drax operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies 7 percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfueled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable
