We are committed to the safety of our colleagues and visitors, protecting our buildings and assets and identifying, apprehending and prosecuting any offenders on our sites. As a result, we have invested in a closed-circuit television system (“CCTV”) at our Drax sites.
Here we set out how the CCTV system will be managed and used by us and to inform individuals, whose personal data may be captured on the CCTV system, about how and why that personal data may be processed by us.
The use of the CCTV  system is overseen by our Group Data Protection Officer who can be contacted at
[email protected]
or using the contact details in the “
Contacting Us
” section. The day-to-day operation of the CCTV system is managed by a third-party service provider under the direction of our Security Operations Manager.
We are aware that images of recognisable individuals, such as colleagues and site visitors (“
data subjects
”), captured by the CCTV system constitute ‘personal data’, use of which is governed by data protection law (“
the law
”).
We will ensure that our use of the CCTV system and the personal data that it captures complies with the law.
The cameras are in operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and they will be monitored from our Drax Power Station Control Room. Until around. In addition, our third-party security providers will regularly check and confirm the efficiency of the system, including that the equipment is properly recording, that the cameras are functional, that the time and date are correct and that that footage is being deleted or retained in accordance with this document.
The images captured by the CCTV System will not be stored for any longer than is required in order to achieve the purposes identified above. CCTV footage will automatically be deleted on a rolling basis, unless specific images are required to be retained in order to deal with an incident or in order to respond to a request by an individual made under the law.
Further information on CCTV privacy can be found here:

Disclosure of your information
Our Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from other websites, plug-ins and applications.  Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share information about you.   We do not control those third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy notices / policies.  When you leave our Website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit before you provide them with personal information.
We may share your personal information with the third parties set out below:
service providers who provide digital services (such as Group SJR or WP Engine) and analytics and search engine providers (such as Google Analytics);
other companies in our Drax group of companies such as Drax Generation Enterprise Limited who provide CCTV security, information security, IT, system administration, stakeholder management and customer services and undertake management reporting;
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any contractual terms or our
Terms of Use
;
We require all service providers and Drax companies that we share your personal information with to respect the privacy and security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law.  We do not allow our third-party service providers, including Drax companies, to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
Most of the personal information we collect about you is based in the United Kingdom or in some cases, a service provider or their sub-processor may be based elsewhere in the European Union (EU) and so, they are required to comply with European data protection law.  On occasion, we may appoint a third-party service provider whose operation or a server or sub-processor may be based outside of the EU.  As part of our Vendor Management Policy, we carry out due diligence on our third-party providers and assess whether your personal information will be transferred to them or accessed by them from outside the EU.  If that is the case, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
we will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission
[1]
; or
where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer personal information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between the EU and the US. You can view certifications at
gov
[2]
; or
where we use certain service providers who are not in a ‘adequate’ country or part of the Privacy Shield, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal information the same protection it has in the EU, called an EU Model Clause Agreement
[3]
.
If you would like to know the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EU, please contact us using the details set out in the “
Contacting Us
” section at the end of this notice.

Storage of your personal information
We will only keep your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the relevant purpose(s) we collected it for, as set out above in this notice, and for as long as we are required to keep it for legal purposes.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
For example, we will hold personal information on people and groups of people who apply, via our website’s tour enquiries form, by phone or email, to undertake a tour of Drax Power Station. This is so we can inform the operational power station of upcoming visits and also so we can reserve space on the tours.
In some circumstances:
you can ask us to delete your personal information, see Your Rights below for further details; and
we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can no-longer be associated with you) for research, planning application or statistical purpose in which case, we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those colleagues, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.  They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator where we are legally required to do so.
Your rights
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights, to:
request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;
request erasure of your personal information in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below);
request the restriction of processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and
request the transfer of your personal information to another party.
You also have the
right to object
to the processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues.  The ICO can be contacted by telephone on 0303 123 1113 or by post as follows: Information Commissioners Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow,
Cheshire, SK9 5AF or via email at
[email protected]
.  We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please contact us in the first instance using any of the details set out below in the “
Contacting Us
” section.
Changes to our privacy notice
Any changes we make to our notice in the future will be posted on this page.
