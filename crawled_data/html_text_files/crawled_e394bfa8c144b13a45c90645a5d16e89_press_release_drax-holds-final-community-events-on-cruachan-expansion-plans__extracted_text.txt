holding the final round of its public consultation on its exciting plans to more than double the generating capacity of the iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station 8 march 2022 under the plans a second underground power station will be built adjacent to the existing one to enable cruachan to play an even bigger role in supporting the expansion of renewable energy sources such as wind power and provide stability services to the national grid around 900 jobs will be created and indirectly supported during the new power stations construction providing a huge economic boost to communities around loch awe and across argyll the previous round of public exhibitions revealed overwhelming support for the development since then the project team has worked to refine the proposals and is pleased to be able to share details of this at the events dalmally community centre  tuesday 15 march 2022 130pm to 730pm taynuilt village hall  wednesday 16 march 2022 130pm to 730pm steve marshall draxs development manager said more than a hundred people attended the last round of public exhibitions underlining the level of public interest in draxs exciting plans to expand cruachan this power station has been at the heart of the community for more than half a century and with this proposed investment from drax it will continue to be so for many more decades to come our development will support around 900 jobs during construction a huge investment in the local area by expanding cruachan we will ensure more renewable power is available to scotlands homes and businesses helping to reduce energy costs and emissions following the public consultation drax will submit a section 36 application to the scottish government for their consideration a decision from the government is expected to be received in 2023 the project requires a new financial stability support mechanism from the uk government to secure private investment in longduration storage sites such as cruachan if this is developed and the planning application is approved then work to build the new capacity at cruachan could get underway in 2024 with the facility operational in 2030 ends editors notes copies of the exhibition boards and other materials will be available for viewing and download via the website at wwwcruachanexpansioncom from 14 march or they can be viewed at cruachan visitor centre from 17 march no investment decision has yet been taken by drax and development remains subject to the right regulatory framework from the uk government media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email

worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4mt of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 17 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate capacity of 46mt which will increase to c5mt once developments are complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 30 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses customers drax is the largest supplier of renewable electricity to uk businesses supplying 100 renewable electricity as standard to more than 370000 sites through drax and opus energy it offers a range of energyrelated services including energy optimisation as well as electric
