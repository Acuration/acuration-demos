longleaf pine forests were once a dominant ecosystem across the southern us gulf and atlantic states spanning from the east coast in virginia as far west as texas however centuries of overuse and conversion to agriculture and to faster growing pine species mean today less than 5 of the estimated 90 million acres remain restoration of the longleaf pine savanna is now underway and the careful management of both public and private forests is key to preserving this ecosystem wood product and biomass markets play an important role in this ensuring there is an economic incentive for landowners to plant highvalue longleaf pines and manage them in a way that promotes conservation an ecosystem shaped by fire the ancient abundance of longleaf pines across the southern us owes to their highly pyrophytic nature meaning they are resistant to fire this allowed the trees to survive both the naturally occurring forest fires from summer thunderstorms and those started as land management by native americans these regular fires help give the longleaf savanna its distinctive features with a limited canopy providing ample sunlight and allowing grasses and herbs to grow in the nitrogenrich soil as colonial settlements expanded across north america the long straight timber offered by the pines as well as the resin and turpentine made these forests a valuable resource longleaf pine ecosystems reached a depleted state the restoration push today americas longleaf restoration initiative alri is taking strides to restore the species the collaborative effort between public and private sector partners has set a 15year goal of increasing longleaf acreage from 34 million to 80 million acres by 2025 these ecosystems are currently home to an estimated 900 endemic plants and 29 federally listed species including the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and indigo snake restoring the environment in which the flora and fauna can flourish is not as simple as planting large numbers of longleaf pine trees conservation efforts must focus on not only the planting of the pine but also the restoration development and maintenance of the pine savanna ecosystem says kyla cheynet a forest ecologist at drax biomass this system requires predictable disturbance to maintain the open canopy and rich herbaceous vegetation the role of the wood product market these disturbances include prescribed fires and the careful harvesting of trees to ensure the landscape maintains its open canopy that allows plenty of sunlight to reach the grasses and other vegetation along the forest floor the alris 2016 report highlighted the importance of thinning and prescribed fires in conserving longleaf savanna it found that while new planting of longleaf pines declined slightly 8 from 2015 the wildlife quality plant diversity and overall health of forests improved by removing competing tree species and allowing more sunlight to enter the forest harvesting or thinning longleaf pine forests provides a small percentage of the fibre used to manufacture compressed wood pellets used at drax power station but these markets help to incentivise responsible forest management and offer a source of profit for landowners these revenuegenerating practices are crucial to ensuring the continued survival of longleaf pine forests by preventing them from being converted to agricultural land or lost to development  tags forests  sustainability 15 words foresters use 16 august 2017 sustainable bioenergy in japanese theres a single word to describe sunlight filtering through the leaves of a tree komorebi its a poetic term to describe an image almost everyone recognises however english has no direct translation but while english lacks a komorebi equivalent it does contain a significant number of words that speak to the very specific features of the forestry industry  terms that describe the crooked nature of a tree open to the elements on a mountain side or words for the process of stripping a grown tree of its limbs here we look at the unusual the uncommon and the whimsical words that make up the language of forestry silviculture seen as both a science and an art silviculture is the practice of controlling the establishment growth composition health and quality of forests this goes beyond just managing working forests for wood products markets however and includes those dedicated to everything from leisure to wildlife comminution one of the first steps in the production of biomass such as wood pellets is reducing down the raw materials like the fresh felled green wood and this relies on a process known as comminution this is carried out by a range of specifically designed machinery such as rotary hammer mills chippers and grinders but can also be done in the forest using mobile chippers to reduce tops and branches krummholz from the german word krumm meaning crooked bent or twisted krummholz is a term for trees that are stunted and sculpted by harsh winds found near the tree line of mountains or on coastlines where there are large quantities of salt in the air exposure to the elements often means these trees are windblown into surreal shapes while branches on one side are often deformed or dead underdog a key component of any sports movie the origins of the word underdog may actually have come from the logging industry in premechanised times logs would be placed over a sawpit and cut up the middle with a long twohandled saw the unfortunate sawyer working at the bottom often knee deep in rainwater under a falling rain of sawdust was known as an underdog however other theories exist which claim the term originates from dog fighting a hypsometer used to measure angles to determine the height of trees hypsometer a hypsometer is a tool used to measure angles when used by foresters it can determine the height of a tree to use it foresters measure the top and bottom of the tree from a measured distance away and use trigonometry to calculate the height hoppus foot the standard measurement of volume used for timber across the british empire the hoppus foot was introduced by english surveyor edward hoppus in 1736 the imperial measurement was developed to estimate how much squared useable timber could be converted from a round log while allowing for wastage a mobile wood chipper in operation in arkansas slash and brash slash and brash are both terms for the woody debris left by logging operations however while slash can be chipped and sold as biomass brash is not normally removed instead it can be spread along routes used by forestry machinery to prevent ground damage in what are known as brash mats leader the very top stem of a tree this typically develops from a trees terminal bud which is the main area of growth in a plant and is found at the end of a limb foresters using horses and rail carts to transport timber in california 1904 hot logging hot logging is the process of loading logs onto lorries and removing them from forests immediately after felling  when theyre still hot from the saw this is in contrast to the more common process of storing or decking logs on site before removing hot logging is often used when whole tree harvesting as the trees are removed from site and processed at the mill to maximise recovery of high value saw timber material snag dead trees might not seem like the most useful plants in a forest but snags prove otherwise snags are standing dead or dying trees and they serve an important role in forest ecosystems often missing their top or most of their smaller branches snags provide habitats for wide varieties of birds mammals and invertebrates as well as supporting decomposers such as fungi in fresh water environments snags also make essential shelter for fish spawning sites beating up towards the end of the growing season trees that have died shortly after planting are counted and replanted in what is known as beating up this process also allows foresters to identify and address any issues that may have affected growth thinning a staple of responsible forestry thinning is the practice of periodically removing a proportion of trees from a forest to reduce competition and provide the healthiest most valuable trees with greater access to water sunlight and nutrients as well as opening up more resources for the remaining trees this process also provides feedstock for the biomass and paper industries rotation in managed forests foresters keep a range of different age trees to ensure a constant flow of healthy and mature wood rotation is the term for the number of years required between new planting typically of seedlings and final harvesting in the us south rotations of plantation pine are commonly about 25 years and 45 years for naturally regenerated pine while in the uk this is closer to 60 for the same species in even more northerly finland rotations are typically between 80 and 90 years snedding coming from the scandinavian word snäddare meaning smooth log snedding is the process of stripping shoots and branches from a branch or felled tree known as limbing in us snedding is carried out with by chainsaws or more heavyduty harvesters and stroke delimbers mensuration how to you measure the total wood of a forest mensuration thats how mensuration is a form of mathematics that allows foresters to measure the volume of standing or felled timber it is an important tool in not only the quantifying of how much product there is to sell but in monitoring and managing the health and growth of a forest tags forests the science behind keeping soil healthy 27 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy read here tags biomass energy  forests how space tech helps forests 20 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy can you count the number of trees in the world accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than just a clearer view on what is happening it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening and its with this information that real differences in our future can be made tags biomass energy  forests  investors  sustainability  technology forests are more powerful than you think  heres why 21 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy almost one third of the earths land mass is covered by forests thats an area of around 4 billion hectares or roughly four times the size of the us in addition to being a prominent feature across the global landscape forests also play a significant role in how we live they make the air cleaner in cities and absorb carbon from the atmosphere they provide biodiversity and habits for wildlife they also provide essential forest products such as paper building materials and wood pellets for energy to celebrate the uns international day of forests  were looking at some of the reasons why forests and wood fuel are more powerful than you might think theyre a major source of renewable energy nearly half of the worlds renewable energy comes from forests in the form of wood fuel roughly 24 billion people around the world use it for things like cooking heating and generating electricity in fact about 50 of the total global wood production is currently used for these purposes however it is critical that this resource is managed sustainably and responsibly  one of the key aims of the international day of forests is to encourage people to utilise their local forest resources sustainably to ensure it endures for future generations they can revitalise economies because wood fuel is such a widely used energy source it also supports a healthy vibrant industry roughly 900 million people work in the wood energy sector globally  more than that rural economies built on wood energy can be revitalised by modernisation which can then stimulate local business  investment can help finance better forest management which in turn leads to forest growth improvements in sustainability standards and in some cases increased employment they can help mitigate climate change the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the global annual primary energy consumption which makes it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand in a sustainable and renewable way when wood is used as fuel it releases carbon dioxide co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or sustainable system of growing forests this carbon is offset by new tree plantings the only emissions produced therefore are the ones involved in transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predict that by 2030 forestry mitigation with the help of carbon pricing could contribute to reductions of 02 to 138 gigatonnes gt co 2 a year  tags biomass energy  forests  sustainability the biomass carbon story matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 23 february 2017 sustainable bioenergy there is an important difference between carbon dioxide co 2  emitted from coal and other fossil fuels and co 2 emitted from renewable sources both do emit co 2 when burnt but in climate change terms the impact of that co 2 is very different to understand this difference it helps to think small and scale up it helps to think of your own back garden one tree every year for 30 years imagine you are lucky enough to have a garden with space for 30 trees three decades ago you decided to plant one tree per year every year in this example each tree grows to maturity over thirty years so today you find yourself with a thriving copse with 30 trees at different stages of growth ranging from one year to 30 years old at 30 years of age the oldest has now reached maturity and you cut it down  in the spring of course before the sap rises  and leave the logs to dry over the summer you plant a new seedling in its place through the summer and autumn the 29 established trees and the new seedling you planted continue to grow absorbing carbon from the atmosphere to do so winter comes and when it turns cold and dark you burn the seasoned wood to keep warm burning it will indeed emit carbon to the atmosphere however by end of the winter the other 29 trees plus the sapling you planted will be at exactly the same stage of growth as the previous spring contain the same amount of wood and hence the same amount of carbon as long as you fell and replant one tree every year on a 30year cycle the atmosphere will see no extra co 2 and youll have used the energy captured by their growth to warm your home harvesting only what is grown is the essence of sustainable forest management if you didnt have your seasoned selfsupplied wood to burn you might have been forced to burn coal or use more gas to heat your home over the course of the same winter these fuels would have emitted carbon to the atmosphere which endlessly accumulates  causing climate change not only does your tree husbandry provide you with an endlessly renewable supply of fuel but you also might enjoy other benefits such as the shelter your trees provide and the diversity of wildlife they attract no added carbon this is a simplified example but the principles hold true whether your forest contains 30 trees or 300 million  the important point is that with these renewable carbon emissions provided you take out less wood than is growing and you at least replace the trees you take out you do not add new carbon to the atmosphere that is not true with fossil fuels it is true that you could have chosen not to have trees you could instead build a wind turbine or install solar panels on your land that would be a perfectly reasonable choice but youll still need to use the coal at night when the sun doesnt shine or when the wind isnt blowing worst of all you dont get all the other benefits of a thriving forest  its seasonal beauty and the habitat thats maintained for wildlife of course the wood drax needs doesnt grow in our garden we bring it many miles from areas where there are large sustainably managed forests and we carefully account for the carbon emissions in the harvesting processing and transporting the fuel to drax  thats why we only achieve more than 80 carbon savings compared to coal tags decarbonisation  forests  investors  sustainability 5 things you never knew about forests 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy forests and the products we derive from them are one of the most ubiquitous aspects of human civilisation despite the rapid pace of modern life that isnt changing forest still covers 30 of the worlds land and in the uk more than an estimated 55 million m 3 of wood was used in 2015  either directly through furniture books or hygiene paper or indirectly in infrastructure like fences railways or through biomass electricity generation behind all this lies the forest and the industry surrounding it but how much do you really know about forests in some regions forests are increasing mention forestry and there are plenty of people who make the jump to the activities of unscrupulous developers and deforestation but while forest land is declining worldwide in fact weve lost 129 million hectares since 1990  the good news is the rate of decline is dropping sharply down 50 across the same period a lot of this is thanks to growing environmental awareness responsible forestry management and reforestation around the world 10000 hectares of new woodland was created in the uk in 2014 and in the usa where a third of all land is forested forestland has been consistently increasing over the last 25 years  theres been an increase of roughly 76 million hectares between 1990 and 2015 vigorously growing forests absorb co2 faster its well known that trees are the lungs of the earth but not all trees or ages are equally effective at absorbing the greenhouse gas co 2  a growing younger forest is a better sink for carbon dioxide than a forest that is mature and stable this has implications for the way these resources are used  notably when it comes to the sourcing of material for compressed wood pellets whereas coal releases carbon that has been trapped underground for millions of years wood releases carbon captured within its lifetime making it a very low carbon fuel once manufacturing and transportation are factored in the technique is to harvest trees when they have stopped growing at a fast rate use the wood for forest products such as timber pulpwood or compressed wood pellets for energy and replant the area with new high growth potential trees the result is a forest with a steady stream of co 2 hungry young trees and a steady stream of renewable raw material forests can stop floods a study led by the universities of birmingham and southampton and funded by the environment agency found that forests in europe play an important role in mitigating the effects of heavy rain thanks to the buffering abilities of the forest canopy and the enormous water absorption capacity of woods and forests they can slow the flow of a sudden downpour of rain overfilling nearby streams or rivers this water will eventually be released but slowing its movement mitigates flash flooding different parts of the forest have different uses the primary commercial product from forests is not a hard one to guess wood but theres more to it than that for construction timber the lower thicker parts of a trees trunk are used smaller parts of the trunk are used as pulpwood which can be used to make paper panels or for energy residues from the wood processing industry such as sawdust can also be used for compressed wood pellets with the rise of the internet smartphones and ereaders the paper market has been shrinking manufacture of highdensity wood pellets helps replace demand for wood once used by the paper market as pellets can be made using lowgrade wood thinnings and residues not used in construction or furniture trees talk to each other until recently it was thought that trees perform most of their biological functions in isolation from each other but biologists have learned in recent years that in fact they communicate and help each other under the forest floor trees roots are linked by bright white and yellow fungal threads called mycelium in a forest these threads act as a kind of network linking trees to one another these links enable trees to share nutrients carbon and water some species of tree also increase nitrogen uptake in the soil and help to improve the conditions in which other species grow in fact research by the university of british columbia  indicates that certain large older trees that rise above the forest act as mother trees which actively help to manage the resources for the other trees in the forest based on their findings it seems trees not only talk to each other but help each other grow too tags forests  sustainability  1 2 3 4 name email comment sign up for updates from
