protecting the uks power from cyberattacks a country cant run without electricity but how do you ensure the uks largest single site generator is safe from cyber threats 6 october 2016 power generation at the heart of all aspects of modern life is a common resource electricity we need it to power our homes and our devices to do our jobs and increasingly with electric trains trams and cars to get from a to b for that electricity to be generated we need power stations theyre a critical part of the uks infrastructure and so for terrorists and foreign states that have much to gain from disrupting the country electricity generators are an obvious target drax power station is the uks largest with the capability to generate enough electricity to power every home in the north of england with this mantle comes a higher risk of security threats  notably cyberattacks protecting the plant from these attacks is not only essential for draxs business but for the safety of the country the threat of cyberattacks cyberattacks exist in the digital space but can have a very real and tangible effect on the physical world between 200710 a computer virus later called stuxnet attacked the iranian nuclear programme damaging a number of the centrifuges  a key part of the nuclear manufacturing process as a result iran was forced to decommission roughly 1000 centrifuges  in a separate attack 35000 computers belonging to the saudi energy company saudi aramco were partially wiped and destroyed disrupting saudi arabias ability to supply 10 of the worlds oil over the past few years the threat of malicious entities has only increased  an alleged nation state attack on ukraines power grid in late december 2015 left thousands of homes without electricity drax is not immune to similar attempts  every month the security team investigates about 1000 issues on an average month two of the 1000 are judged to be serious enough to warrant further investigation this is where darktrace comes in identifying the threats darktrace is an incredibly powerful system that identifies and deals with threats to drax it starts by getting to know you it learns every single device on the network its speed of traffic and the patterns of each users daily work behaviour for example if a user logs in to the work systems at 8pm but has never done so before darktrace will identify this behaviour and flag it as different from the norm flagging each of these events depending on its assessed severity it maps the devices into a graphic that looks like a galaxy of stars of different colours draxs security team use this to see at a glance which devices need attention and action the result is a view across the whole power station  both the corporate environment and our industrial control systems  those security experts can then see where there have been issues with password protection software updates with errors and where any breaches come from more importantly they can see viruses infecting devices in real time when the system thinks it might see one there are three possible outcomes ignore throttle kill once darktrace identifies any abnormal activity that could be a threat the system offers three options ignore throttle or kill ignore means allowing the system to continue as normal this option would be used if the system flagged something as a threat which human investigation found was harmless the throttle option is designed for a situation when a virus is affecting one part of the operation of one device but shutting down the device entirely would disable a critical function the throttle option slows the affected part of the device down to a virtual standstill but allows the device to continue the rest of its operations while the system investigates kill means removing the unit from the network immediately if a machine behaves in a way that suggests it could be infected it can be shut down almost immediately every day a live dashboard of variables is available to identify problems investigate breaches fix any infected devices and then rebuild those systems its a daily schedule that not only ensures the power station can continue uninterrupted but that the entire country can too share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero sustainable bioenergy forests net zero and the science behind
