The policy needed to save the future
6 December 2019
Carbon capture

Over the past decade the United Kingdom has decarbonised significantly as coal power has been replaced by sources like biomass, wind and solar. Every year power generation
emits fewer and fewer tonnes of carbon thanks to renewables
and with the ban on the sale of new diesel and petrol cars coming in no later than 2040, roads and urban areas are about to get cleaner too.
However, there are still tough challenges ahead if the UK is to meet its target of carbon neutrality by 2050. Aviation, heavy industry, agriculture, shipping, power generation – some of the key activities of daily economic life – all remain reliant on fuels that emit carbon.
This is where Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) technologies have a big role to play. These can capture carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and either store them or use them, helping the drive towards carbon neutrality.
While the idea of being able to capture carbon has been around for some time, the technology is fast catching up with the ambition. There now exist a number of credible solutions that allow for capturing emissions. The challenge, however, is putting in place the framework and policies needed to enable technologies to be implemented at scale.
Time is short. A
recent report by Vivid Economics
for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) emphasised the need for government action
now
if we are to achieve the volume of carbon removal needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
The tech to take emissions out of the atmosphere
The planet naturally absorbs CO
2
, forests absorb it as they grow, mangroves trap it in flooded soils, and oceans absorb it from the air. So, harnessing this power through planting, growing and actively managing forests is one natural method of GGR that can be easily implemented by policy.

The idea of using
technology
to capture CO
2
and prevent its release into the atmosphere has been around since the 1970s. It was first
deployed successfully in enhanced oil recovery
, when captured emissions are injected into underground oil reserves to help remove the oil from the ground.
Over time it’s been developed and is now in place in a number of fossil fuel power stations around the world, allowing them to
cut emissions
. However, by combining the same technology with renewable fuels like compressed biomass wood pellets, we can generate electricity that is
carbon negative
.
Each of these solutions operate in different ways, but all are important. Vivid Economics’ report emphasises that a range of different solutions will be required to reach a point where 130 million tonnes of CO
2
(MtCO
2
) are being removed from the atmosphere in the UK annually by 2050.
However, investment and clear government planning and guidance will be crucial in enabling the growth of GRR. The report estimates large-scale GGR could cost around £13 billion per year by 2050 in the UK alone, a figure similar in size to current government support for renewables.
“If you went back 20-odd years, people were sceptical of the role of wind, solar and biomass and whether the technologies would ever get to a cost point where they could be viably deployed at scale,” explains Drax Policy Analyst Richard Gow.
“In the last few years we’ve seen enormous cost reductions in renewables and people are far more confident in investing in them – that has been driven by very good government policy.”
GGR needs the same clear long-term strategy to
enable companies to make secure investments and innovate
. But what shape should those policies take for them to be effective?
Options for policies
Perhaps the most straightforward route to enabling GGR is to build on existing policies. For example, there are existing tree planting schemes such as the Woodland Carbon Fund, Woodland Carbon Code and the Country Stewardship Scheme, all of which could receive greater regulatory support, or additional rules obliging emitters to invest in
actively managed forests
.
More technically complex solutions, like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), could be incentivised by alternative mechanisms in order to provide clarity on, and to stabilise, revenue streams.
These are already used to support companies building low-carbon power generation
such as through the Contracts for Difference scheme and have been effective in encouraging investment in projects with high upfront costs and long-payback periods.
Alternative options to support the roll-out of negative emissions technologies should also be considered. For example, the government could make it obligatory for companies that contribute to emissions, to pay for GGR to avoid increased burden on electricity consumers.
In such a scenario, fossil fuel suppliers would be required to offset the emissions of their products by buying negative emissions certificates from GGR providers. As a result, the price of fossil fuels for users would likely rise to cover this expense and the costs would then be shared across the supply chain rather than just a single party.
Another approach that passes the costs of GGR deployment on to emitters is using emissions taxes to fund tax credits for GGR providers.
Making these tax credits tradable would also mean any large tax-paying company, such as a supermarket or bank, could buy tax credits from GGR providers. This approach would come at no cost to government as sales of the tax credits would be funded by an emissions tax and would offer revenue to GGR providers.
The challenge with tax credits, however, is they are vulnerable to changes in government. An alternative is to offer direct grants and long-term contracts with GGR providers which would ensure funding for projects that transcends changes in Parliament. They could, however, prove costly for government.
Whatever policy pathway the government may choose to follow, there are underlying foundations needed to support effective GGR deployment.
Making policies work

There are still many unknown factors in GGR deployment, such as the precise volume that will be needed to counter hard-to-abate emissions. This means all policy must be flexible to allow for future changes, and the individual requirements of different regions (forest-based solutions might suit some regions, DACCS might be better in others).
Underlying the strength of any of these policies, is the need for accurate carbon accounting. Understanding how much emissions are removed from the atmosphere by each technology will be key to reaching a true net zero status and giving credibility to certificates and tax credits.

Proper accounting of different technologies’ impact will also be crucial in delivering innovation grants. These can come through the UK’s existing innovation structure and will be fundamental to jumpstarting the pilot programmes needed to test the viability of GGR approaches before commercialisation.
Different approaches to GGR have different levels of effectiveness as well as different costs. BECCS, for example,
serves two purposes in both generating low-carbon power and capturing emissions
– resulting in overall negative emissions across the supply chain.

“It’s important to account for the full value chain of BECCS,” explains Gow. “Therefore, it should be rewarded through two mechanisms: a CfD for the clean electricity produced and an incentive for the negative emissions. A double policy here is important because you are providing two products which benefit different sectors of the economy, one benefits power consumers and the other provides a service to society and the environment as a whole, and cost should be apportioned as such.
BECCS and DACCS also have to consider
wider supply chains, such as carbon transport and storage infrastructure
. Although this requires a high initial investment, by connecting to industrial emitters, it can enable providers to recover the costs through charges to multiple network users.
Ultimately, the key to making any GGR policies work effectively and efficiently is speed. In order to put in place accounting principles, test different methods, and begin courting investors, government needs to act now.
The Vivid Economics report “is further confirmation of the vital role that BECCS will play in reaching a net zero-carbon economy and the need to deploy the UK’s first commercial project in the 2020s,” Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner says.
“Our successful BECCS pilot is already capturing a tonne of carbon a day. With the right policies in place, Drax could become the world’s first negative emissions power station and the anchor for a zero carbon economy in the Humber region.”
It will be significantly more cost efficient to begin deploying GGR in the next decade and slowly increase it up to the level of 130 MtCO
2
per year, than attempting to rapidly build infrastructure in the 2040s in a last-ditch effort to meet carbon neutrality by 2050.

Investment programme in biomass capacity expansion and cost reduction
19 November 2019
Investors

Highlights
Targeting biomass self-supply capacity of five million tonnes by 2027
1.5 million tonnes of existing capacity, plus 0.35 million tonnes of low-cost capacity announced at the 2019 half year results
Evaluating options for a further three million tonnes over the next seven years
Supports target to reduce biomass cost by c.30 percent to c.£50/MWh
Targeting returns significantly in excess of the Group’s cost of capital
Trading update – in-line with expectations
Acquired assets performing strongly
Capacity Market restored and included in 2019 Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Drax’s purpose is to enable a zero-carbon lower cost energy future. We believe sustainable biomass has a long-term critical role to play. That’s why we plan to supply 80 percent of our biomass from our own sources – a significant increase on the 20 percent we currently self-supply. Supplying more of our own biomass will cut costs and reduce supply chain risks, ensuring our biomass power generation remains viable in the long term. When combined with carbon capture it will also enable negative emissions, helping the UK on its path to net zero by 2050.”

Capital Markets Day
Drax is today hosting a Capital Markets Day for investors and analysts.
Will Gardiner and his management team will update on how the Group is delivering on its purpose. The day will outline the significant opportunities Drax sees in growing its biomass supply and renewable generation businesses.
Investment in biomass to increase capacity and reduce cost
As a part of the Group’s key strategic objective of building a long-term future for sustainable biomass, Drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce its cost of biomass to a level which is economic without subsidy in 2027.
These savings will be delivered through further optimisation of existing biomass operations and greater utilisation of low-cost wood residues; an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other renewable fuels and; a significant expansion of self-supply capacity.
Drax is targeting five million tonnes of self-supply capacity by 2027 (1.5 million today, plus 0.35 million tonnes in development), with greater scope for operational leverage and cost reduction. Drax will continue to work with its current suppliers to develop its portfolio.
At the 2019 half year results, Drax announced an investment in low-cost capacity at its existing three sites in the US Gulf, adding 350k tonnes of new capacity by 2021. The capital cost is in the region of £50 million, enabling targeted fuel cost savings in excess of £15/MWh on the additional capacity once commissioned.
Drax is evaluating options to deliver an additional three million tonnes of capacity. These options are expected to deliver returns significantly in excess of the Group’s cost of capital, with strong cash flow generation and a fast payback.
These activities would enable Drax to develop an unsubsidised biomass generation business by 2027, with the option to service wood pellet demand in other markets – Europe, North America and Asia.
Biomass sustainability is at the heart of the Group’s activities and Drax has implemented industry leading processes which support this expansion, encourage forest growth and make a positive contribution to climate change.

Options for gas generation
Drax continues to see flexible gas generation as an enabler of greater renewable and low carbon generation, in addition to supporting the development of hydrogen.
Any investment decision would reflect Drax’s objective of delivering earnings visibility and be underpinned by a 15-year capacity agreement to support a low double-digit rate of return. Drax would consider a range of funding options, including partnerships, consistent with Drax’s balance sheet objective of around 2 x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
over time.
Capital allocation and dividend
Drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017.
Trading and operational performance
The performance of the assets acquired from Iberdrola in December 2018 has been strong, particularly the pumped storage business which has performed well, driven by the system support market. Drax reiterates the Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
guidance provided at the time of acquisition, of £90-£110 million in the 2019 financial year.
In July, Drax completed the refinancing of the acquisition bridge facility used to acquire these assets. These facilities now extend the Group’s debt maturity profile to 2029, adding an ESG
(2)
facility with a mechanism that adjusts the margin based on Drax’s carbon emissions against an annual benchmark. The Group’s cost of debt is now below four percent and below three percent on the new facilities, reflecting the Group’s reduced business risk. The Group continues to identify opportunities to optimise its balance sheet and cash flow.
During the summer, Drax completed major planned outages on two biomass units. Following a delayed return to service, the plan is to run all four ROC
(3)
units at high utilisation levels in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The outlook for coal generation remains challenging and Drax continues to monitor the situation with regards to future operation, noting that all unabated UK coal generation must close by 2025.
Following formal confirmation from the UK Government, Drax expects the Capacity Market to be re-instated shortly, with full retrospective payments made for the capacity provided. Capacity payments due to Drax for 2019 and since the suspension of the Capacity Market in 2018 are £75 million. Drax expects these to be included in 2019 Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
, with cash settlement in January 2020.
These factors underpin the Group’s expectations for full year Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
, which remain unchanged and around 2 x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
when adjusted to reflect cash payment of retrospective capacity payments received in January 2020.
Capital Markets Day webcast and presentation material
The event will be webcast from 9.30am and the material made available on the Group’s website at the same time. Joining instructions for the webcast and presentation are included in the links below.

Further statement in relation to the AGM vote on political donations
15 October 2019
Investors

In the lead up to the 2019 AGM, the Company undertook initial consultation with major shareholders and received a variety of feedback on both the Resolution and the Company’s approach to engagement with regulators and policymakers including political parties and governments.
Following the AGM, the Board of Directors initiated further engagement to facilitate a clear understanding of the reasons underpinning the votes cast against the Resolution. This included writing to the Company’s largest shareholders and offering to discuss how the Company proposed to respond to points raised during the initial consultation and policy on stakeholder engagement. The Company is grateful to those shareholders that provided feedback at that time.
The Company regularly engages with regulators and policymakers in the UK, Europe and USA (including those associated with political parties and governments) to understand and contribute to discussions on a wide range of matters which are associated with our business and delivering increased value to our shareholders. This approach is detailed on pages 32 and 33 of the
2018 Annual Report
as a fundamental aspect of our stakeholder engagement. Political and regulatory risk has been identified by the Board as one of the nine principal risks that the business faces. Activities of this nature are not designed to support any political party or to influence public support for a particular party and would not be thought of as political donations in the ordinary sense of those words.
Reflecting the feedback received from shareholders, it has been determined that within future Annual Reports additional disclosure will be provided. This will describe the forms of engagement that have taken place with regulators and policymakers in the financial year as well as additional disclosure regarding the oversight of that engagement. To assure shareholders of the governance associated with managing engagement and transparency, the Company has also developed and published a
policy explaining how stakeholder engagement is undertaken, including oversight and associated reporting
.
The term ‘political donation’ is widely defined in the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”). For clarity, the Company has not made, and does not intend to knowingly make, political donations. The Company continues to believe it is in the best interests of the business and shareholders to renew the authority most recently granted at the 2019 AGM to avoid any inadvertent infringement of the Act.
Prior to 2019, the Company had proposed an authority to spend up to £50,000 under each of the three categories covered by the Act. At the 2019 AGM, Drax sought an authority to spend up to £100,000 under the same three categories which was approved by a majority of shareholders.Nonetheless and reflecting feedback received in connection with the Resolution, at the 2020 and future AGMs the Company will propose an authority to spend up to £100,000 in each of the three categories but will introduce an aggregate cap of £125,000.
Further explanation on these matters, and our ongoing engagement with shareholders, will be included in the 2019 Annual Report and notice of the 2020 AGM.

28 July 2019
Opinion

Climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and Drax has a crucial role in tackling it.
All countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies. Creating enough
clean, secure energy for industry, transport and people’s daily lives
has never been more important.
Drax is at the heart of the UK energy system. Recently the UK government committed to delivering a net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and Drax is
equally committed
to helping make that possible.
We’ve recently had some questions about what we’re doing and I’d like to set the record straight.
How is Drax helping the UK reach its climate goals?
At Drax we’re committed to a zero-carbon, lower-cost energy future.
And we’ve accelerated our efforts to
help the UK get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass
. And now we’re the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
We’re exploring how Drax Power Station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary
technologies to capture carbon
in the North of England.
And we’re
creating more energy stability
, so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid.
And finally, we’re helping our customers take control of their energy – so they can use it more efficiently and spend less.
Is Drax the largest carbon polluter in the UK?
No. Since 2012 we’ve reduced our CO2 emissions by 84%. In that time, we moved from being western Europe’s largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
And we want to do more.
We’ve
expanded our operations to include hydro power, storage and natural gas
and we’ve continued to bring coal off the system.
By the mid 2020s, our
ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time
.
Does building gas power stations mean the UK will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come?
Our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to
use more wind and solar power
.
At the same time, we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining.
A
new, more efficient gas plant
can fill that gap and help make it possible for the UK to come off coal before the government’s deadline of 2025.
Importantly, if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that there’s a route through for making that zero-carbon over time by being able to capture the CO
2
or by converting those power plants into hydrogen.
Are forests destroyed when Drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions?
No.
Sustainable biomass from
healthy managed forests
is helping decarbonise the UK’s energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth.
Biomass has been a critical element in the UK’s decarbonisation journey. Helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible.
The
biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests
that supply industries like construction. We use residues, like sawdust and waste wood, that other parts of industry don’t use.
We support healthy forests and biodiversity. The biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station.
What’s exciting is that this technology enables us to do more. We are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station. Which could enable us to become the first carbon-negative power station in the world and also the
anchor for new zero-carbon cluster across the Humber
and the North.
How do you justify working at Drax?
I took this job because Drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the UK. But I also believe passionately that there is more that we can do.
I want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change.
I also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing.
