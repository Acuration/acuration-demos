carbon capture what is carbon transportation carbon transportation is the movement of carbon from one place to another in nature carbon moves through the carbon cycle  in industries like energy however carbon transportation refers to the physical transfer of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from the point of capture to the point of usage or storage why does carbon need to be transported anthropogenic manmade co 2 released in processes like power generation leads to the direct increase of co 2 in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming  however these emissions can be captured as part of carbon capture and storage ccs  the co 2 is then transported for safe and permanent storage in geological formations deep underground capturing and storing co 2 prevents it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming processes that can deliver negative emissions  such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage dacs  aim to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere through ccs in ccs carbon must be transported from the site where its captured to a site where it can be permanently stored this means it needs to travel from a power station or factory to a geological formation like a saline aquifer or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as of september 2021 there were 27 operational ccs facilities around the world with the combined capacity to capture around 40 million tonnes per annum mtpa of co 2  its estimated that the uk alone has 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space in sandstone rock formations under the north sea how is carbon transported co 2 can be transported via trucks or ships but the most common and efficient method is by pipeline moving gases of any kind through pipelines is based on pressure gases travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure compressing gas to a high pressure allows it to flow to other locations gas pipelines are common all around the world including those transporting co 2  in the us there are for instance more than 50 co 2 pipelines  covering around 6500 km and transporting approximately 68 million tonnes of co 2 a year  gas takes up less volume when its compressed and even less when it is liquefied solidified or hydrated therefore before being transported captured co 2 is often compressed and liquefied until it becomes a supercritical fluid  in a supercritical state co 2 has the density of a liquid but the viscosity thickness of a gas and is therefore easier to transport through pipelines its also 5080 less dense than water with a viscosity that is 100 times lower than liquid this means it can be loaded onto ships in greater quantities and that there is less friction when its moving through pipes and subsequently into geological storage sites how safe is it to transport carbon its no riskier to transport co 2 via pipeline or ship than it is to transport oil and natural gas  and existing oil and natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to transport co 2  to enable the safe use of co 2 pipelines ccs projects must ensure captured co 2 complies with strict purity and temperature specifications as well as making sure co 2 is dry and free from impurities that could impact pipelines operations whilst there are a growing number of ccs transport systems around the world ccs is still is a relatively new field but research is underway to identify best practises materials and technologies to optimise the process this includes research around potential risks and techniques for leak mitigation and remediation in the uk the health and safety executive regulates health safety and integrity issues for all natural gas pipelines which are covered by legislation the legislation ensures the safety of pipelines pressure systems and offshore installations and can serve as a strong foundation for co 2 transport regulation fast facts globally ccs projects have been operational since the 1980s with more than 260 million tonnes of co 2 being captured and stored over 40 years the global capacity of ccs projects in development in september 2021 was 111 million tonnes per year  this was a 48 increase compared to the end of 2020 the uks existing gas transmission network is made up of some 7660 km of highpressure gas pipelines the price of reusing offshore oil and gas pipelines to transport co 2 could be just 1 to 10 of the cost of building a new pipeline go deeper catch up on how a range of carbon capture transport and storage projects around the world are progressing here are the details of five proposed carbon capture projects in the uk read the full story of how carbon is captured transported and stored how governments can implement the policies needed to enable ccs at scale
