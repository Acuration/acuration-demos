electricity trading is the process of power generators selling the electricity they generate to power suppliers who can then sell this electricity on to consumers the system operator  national grid eso in great britain  oversees the flow of electricity around the country and ensures the amounts traded will ultimately meet demand and do not overwhelm the power system who is involved in electricity trading there are three main parties in a power market generators  thermal power plants and energy storage sites  sources such as wind turbines and solar panels producing electricity consumers hospitals transport homes and factories using electricity and suppliers in the middle from whom you purchase electricity electricity is generated at power stations then bought by suppliers who then sell it on to meet the needs of the consumers electricity trading refers to the transaction between power generators who produce electricity and power suppliers who sell it on to consumers how are electricity contracts made electricity trading occurs in both long and shortterm time frames ranging from years in advance to deals covering the same day generation and supply must meet exact demand for every minute of the day which means that traders must always be ready to buy or sell power to fill any sudden gaps that arise when trading electricity far in advance factors such as exchange rates the cost and availability of fuel changing regulations and policies all affect the price shortterm price is more volatile and factors such as weather news events and even whats on television having the biggest impact on price traders analyse live generation data and news reports  to predict ahead of time how much electricity will be needed during periods of high demand and then determine a price traders then make offers and bids to suppliers and strike a deal  these deals then dictate how and when a power stations generators are run every day why is electricity trading important running a power station is an expensive process and demand for electricity never stops the electricity market ensures the countrys power demands are met while also aiming to keep electricity businesses sustainable through balancing the price of buying raw materials with the price at which electricity is sold to ensure the grid remains balanced and meets demand the systems operator also makes deals with generators for ancillary services  either far in advance or lastminute this ensures elements such as frequency voltage and reserve power are kept stable across the country and that the grid remains safe and efficient electricity trading ensures there is always a supply of power and that the market for electricity operates in a stable way electricity trading fast facts the history of modern electricity trading can be traced back to chile in 1980  when the country privatised its power industry this led to traders jostling to supply consumers with energy the uk was the first european nation to take up this model in 1990 electricity prices in the uk have actually occasionally gone negative  this happens when demand is low but weather conditions such as high winds or prolonged sunshine lead to an abundance of power ie through wind and solar generation this can lead to consumers being paid to use electricity  up to 4p per unit used  or to generators being paid to turn their output down or even switch off go deeper how the market decides where great britain gets its electricity from how to calculate gas and electricity prices the night shift how a power station keeps the lights on when all the lights are off what is it that makes a countrys electricity system stable  in energy storage timing is everything electricity trading agreements explained could great britain go off grid take a closer look at the supply demand price and environmental impact of britains electricity in electric insights  share related stories carbon capture what is the carbon cycle
