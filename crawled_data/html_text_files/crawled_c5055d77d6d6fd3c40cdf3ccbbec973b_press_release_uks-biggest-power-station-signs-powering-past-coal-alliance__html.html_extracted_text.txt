UK’s biggest power station signs up to Powering Past Coal Alliance
Drax Group, owner of the largest power station in Western Europe, has today signed up to the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a global coalition of counties, states, cities and businesses committed to ending coal generation.
9 April 2018
The company, which has already
upgraded half of its power station in North Yorkshire to use sustainable wood pellets instead of coal
, has signed up to the UK-Canadian initiative which seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries.
The company’s involvement in the initiative was announced by the Rt Hon Claire Perry MP, UK Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth, on Monday April 9 at the
Bloomberg Future of Energy Summit
in New York.
Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth, Claire Perry, said:
“The UK leads the world in tackling climate change – we have reduced emissions by more than 40% since 1990. By phasing out traditional coal power, we are not only taking active steps to tackle climate change, we are also protecting the air we breathe by reducing harmful pollution. The Powering Past Coal Alliance sends a clear signal that the time for unabated coal fired electricity has well and truly passed.”
Will Gardiner
, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Unabated coal does not have a long term role to play in our low carbon future. The government made it very clear earlier this year that it wants the UK’s power sector to be coal free in 2025 – and we will achieve that, and possibly even beat it.
“We’re exploring options for repowering our remaining coal units to use sustainable biomass and gas which we believe could help us to become coal free even earlier than the 2025 deadline.”
In the UK there has already been a dramatic fall in power generation from coal – an 84% reduction in the last five years, and a major shift towards lower carbon technologies. Friday (April 6 2018) saw Great Britain have its
second coal-free 24-hour period
since 1882.
Drax Power Station has transformed itself to become the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. It is the largest single site renewable power generator in the UK since it started using biomass instead of coal in three out of its six generating units.
65% of the power it produces is now renewable
– enough for four million households.
It will
convert a fourth generating unit from coal to biomass
later this year using a low cost solution developed by its world class engineers.
This will leave just two remaining coal generating units which it plans to replace with up to
3.6GW of gas power as well as 200MW of battery storage
.

Notes to editors
The UK’s Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth Claire Perry MP will attend the Bloomberg Future of Energy Summit conference in New York on Monday April 9, 2018, when she will announce Drax’s decision to sign up to the
Powering Past Coal Alliance
.
Drax Power Station
announced
its intention to convert its fourth generating unit to use biomass instead of coal earlier this year following the publication of the government’s response to its consultation on cost controls for further biomass conversions.
The company is
also planning
to submit a Development Consent Order (DCO) this year for permission to repower its two remaining coal units with up to 3.6GW of gas power and 200MW of battery storage.
Subject to securing a DCO and depending on the outcome of future Capacity Market Auctions, the power station could stop using coal in 2023.
