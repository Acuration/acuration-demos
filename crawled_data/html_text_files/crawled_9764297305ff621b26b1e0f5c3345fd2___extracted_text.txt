vital role in our departure from coal enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future as a responsible forwardthinking business it is essential that we source from certified and sustainable suppliers and take actions to combat the climate change crisis where do our wood pellets come from how do they get to yorkshire and what role do they play in ensuring more productive healthy forests and a

carbon lower cost energy future we source from forests in the us south where more carbon is absorbed than removed us south growing stock 100 million cubic metres 00 billion cubic metres although the area of many of our source forests has remained around the same size for years active management of these resources increases growth and carbon storage thinning operations increase the growth of the biggest and best trees ensuring more carbon is stored in longer term solid wood products such as those used in furniture and construction opening the forest floor and clearing debris reduces the risk of fire and increases the growth of ground flora responsible active management also boosts carbon stock as the stands of younger faster growing trees that are reestablished after felling absorb even more carbon dioxide than stands of older overmature trees with these practices in use the volume of trees in our us source forests which we refer to as growing stock has significantly increased since the 1950s annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million cubic metres in 1953 to 408 million cubic metres in 2015 during that same 62year period inventory more than doubled from 4 billion cubic metres in 1953 to 84 billion in 2015 us south growing stock 100 million cubic metres 00 billion cubic metres  historical perspective on the relationship between demand and forest productivity in the us south forest2market 2017 there is now more surplus growth in the forests of the us south than ever before in modern times the more sustainable wood we use the more forests can be encouraged to grow increased demand for wood in the us south has been statistically correlated with increased annual tree growth and more wood volume available in the forest but this increased growth has also created excess supply over the last 25 years the us south has not only increased its total wood supply â the surplus annual growth compared to removals each year has quadrupled surplus

growth rates have increased five fold over the last 70 years us south states forest growth far exceeds harvesting and removals sustainable forest biomass complements the land ownerâs ability to make a living from other wood industries drax does not take high quality wood from other industries sustainable biomass is largely made up of low grade wood and low value residues produced as a biproduct of the production and processing of higher value solid wood products eg sawtimber for construction and furniture these feedstocks can be used for renewable low carbon energy the primary proportions of a wood harvest are broken into four distinct categories proportional use of wood harvest in the usa 2016 sawlogs and veneer 166 million cubic metres pulpwood 177 million cubic metres wood fuel 4545

wood pellet compared to pulp and paper production in the us south almost one third of the earthâs land mass is covered by forests thatâs an area of around 4 billion hectares or roughly four times the size of the us in addition to being a prominent feature across the global landscape forests and trees also play a significant role in how we live they make the air cleaner in cities and absorb carbon from the atmosphere they provide biodiversity and habits for wildlife they also provide essential forest products such as paper building materials and wood pellets for energy forests and wood fuel are
