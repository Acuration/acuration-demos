What is climate change?
21 August 2020
Sustainable business

What is climate change?
Climate change refers to the
change in weather patterns
and global temperature of the earth over long periods of time. In a modern context, climate change describes the rise of global temperatures that has been occurring since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s.
What causes climate change?
While there have been natural fluctuations in the earth’s climate over previous millennia, scientists have found that
current-day temperatures are rising quicker than ever
due to the excessive amount of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and other greenhouse gasses being released into the atmosphere.
An excess of CO
2
in the atmosphere accentuates something called the
‘greenhouse effect’
. As CO
2
traps heat in the earth’s atmosphere, it warms the planet and causes a rise in average global temperature. International efforts, such as the Paris Climate Accords, are dedicated to ensuring temperatures do not rise 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which could lead to
catastrophic conditions on the planet
.
In the modern context, climate change describes the rise of global temperatures occurring since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s.
How do humans contribute to climate change?

Industries such as transport, agriculture, energy and manufacturing have traditionally relied on the use of coal, oil and other fossil fuels. These fuels, when combusted or used, emit large amounts of CO
2
into the atmosphere, further advancing the greenhouse effect and contributing to climate change.
Human reliance and consumption of these products mean today CO
2
levels are the highest they’ve been in
800,000 years
.
Why are rising temperatures harmful to the planet?
Our planet has a history of experiencing periods of extreme weather conditions – for example the last
Ice Age
, which finished 12,000 years ago. However, the rapid rise in temperatures seen today is harmful because a hotter planet
completely affects our natural environment
.
A steep rise in global temperature can
melt ice sheets
and cause higher sea levels which can, in turn, contribute to more extreme storms and even threaten
entire islands and coastal communities
. As the planet warms, extreme weather events, such as bushfires could become more common, which can destroy homes, impact agriculture and degrade air quality, while entire ecosystems, habitats and animal and insect species could also be
threatened by climate change
.

What can be done to mitigate the effects of climate change?
Reducing CO
2
emissions is a key way of slowing down the pace of climate change. To do so, industries across the global economy must decarbonise to become less dependent on fossil fuels, such as coal and petrol, and adopt new lower carbon energy sources.
Decarbonisation will rely on a number of factors, including a technological response that sees the development and implementation of carbon neutral and
carbon negative
ways of creating heat, electricity and fuels, including the use of innovations such as carbon capture and storage (CCS).
There is also a need for a policy and governmental response that promotes investment in new cleaner technologies and disincentivises dirtier industries through mechanisms like the
carbon tax
. Countries and economies will need to work collaboratively to achieve common, climate-oriented goals that will also enable smaller scale action to be taken by individuals around the world.

What are ancillary services?
Power generation

What are ancillary services?
Ancillary services are a
set of processes
that enable the transportation of electricity around the grid while keeping the power system operating in a stable, efficient and safe way.
Why do we need ancillary services?

When electricity makes its way through the country, it needs to be managed so that the power generation and electricity useage levels are equal.
The regulating of elements such as frequency and voltage has to be carefully managed, so that the massive amounts of electricity moving – or transmitted – are able to be used safely in homes,  businesses, schools and hospitals around the country.
Ancillary services enable the power system to operate in a stable, efficient and safe way.

What do ancillary services offer?
Ancillary services include a wide variety of electrical efficiency and safety nets, all focussed on ensuring the power system delivers enough output to meet demand yet remains stable:
Frequency:
The UK’s power system runs at a
frequency of 50 hertz
– to stay balanced, it has to remain at that frequency. Turbines and generators adjust the speed at which they spin automatically to increase or decrease power in line with demand and ensure that the system is kept stable.
Voltage:
Different parts of the UK’s transmission system use voltages of either 400, 275 or 132 kilovolts. To ensure that voltage remains
within 5% of those figures at all times
, to be safe for domestic electricity use, power stations can produce or
re-absorb excess energy as reactive power
, keeping the overall system reliable.
Inertia:
Turbine use is important in keeping the system operating in its current state, even with disruptions and sudden changes. The electricity system uses the weight of heavy
spinning turbines to create stability
, acting as dampeners and smoothing out unexpected changes in frequency across the network.
Reserve:
An important part of ancillary servicing is making sure that there are no surprises – so
holding back power
to release if something unexpected happens means that the network can function confidently, knowing that there are generators and other power providers such as
pumped hydro storage
waiting ready to back it up.
Who manages ancillary services?
In the UK the grid’s stability is managed by
National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO)
– a  separate company of
National Grid Electricity Transmission (ET)
. The ESO works with ancillary service providers to either sign long-term contracts or make short term requests for a service.
These partners are often power stations, such as Drax Power Station, which have large spinning turbines capable of controlling voltage, frequency, providing inertia and serving as a source of reserve power.

What is the future of ancillary services, as we move to a more renewable system?
As the UK’s electricity system continues to change, so to do its requirements for different ancillary services. The switch from a few very large power stations to a greater variety of different electricity sources, some of which may be dependent on the weather, as well as changes in how the country uses electricity, means there is a greater need for ancillary services to keep the grid stable.
These services have historically been delivered by thermal power stations, but new innovations are enabling
wind turbines
to
provide inertial response
and overcome changes in frequency, and
batteries
to store
reserve power
that can then be supplied to the power system to ensure balance.
Ancillary services fast facts

Batteries can in some cases be cheaper ancillary alternatives to conventional sources of energy. The Hornsdale Power Reserve, which runs on a Tesla battery in South Australia,
lowered the price of frequency ancillary services by
90%
after just four months of use.
Ancillary services usually work from habit; knowing when to slow electricity production, or increase supply based around the
general public’s standard working hours
, dinner time and the early morning rush.
But during the
COVID-19 lockdown
, electricity consumption on weekdays fell by
13%
and so National Grid ESO had to intervene with ancillary services to keep the lights on.
Every year, the ESO’s ancillary services move
300 terawatt hours
(TWh) of electricity, which is equal to
4 trillion kettles
boiling at once
.
With recent innovations around renewable energies, there are a wider variety of ways for ancillary services to generate power.

What is reforestation and afforestation?
Sustainable bioenergy

What is reforestation and afforestation?
Reforestation is the process of planting trees in a forest where the number of trees has been decreasing.
Afforestation is when new trees are planted or seeds are sown in an area where there were no trees before, creating a new forest.
Why carry out reforestation and afforestation?
Reforestation and afforestation are two of the leading nature-based solutions for tackling the effects of climate change. For commercial foresters and landowners, these two practices are essential to ensuring they can grow wood for wood products and continuously meet demand in a sustainable way.
Reforestation is crucial in combating or preventing deforestation or forest degradation, where forests shrink in size or are completely removed. As well as reducing a forest’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO
2
), deforestation can destroy wildlife habitats and contribute to the likelihood of flooding in certain areas.
Afforestation can also help avoid desertification, where fertile land turns into a desert as a result of drought or intensive agriculture.
Reforestation is the process of planting native trees in a forest where the number of trees has been decreasing.
How does reforestation and afforestation limit the effects of climate change?
Forests are a natural way of keeping the earth’s CO
2
levels in check. The more trees there are, the more CO
2
is captured and converted into oxygen through photosynthesis.
By absorbing CO
2
, forests help to lower the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and reduce the effects of climate change.
Reforestation and afforestation help maximize these abilities of forests by increasing the overall amount of forested land on the planet.
Did you know?
Different types of forests, such as tropical,
swamps
or
mangroves
, all absorb CO
2
at different rates.
The age of a forest also impacts absorption.
Young, rapidly growing, trees absorb CO
2
at a faster rate
than more mature ones, which have large amounts of carbon locked in already.
Afforestation is when new trees are planted or seeds are sown in an area where there were no trees before.
What roles does reforestation play in commercial forestry?
The global wood products industry depends on sustainable forests to supply the wood needed to make furniture, create
construction materials
and provide fuel for energy.
The supply chain will often start with what’s called a ‘
working forest
’ – a commercially-run forest which is often privately owned. The landowner will grow a working forest to a certain stage of maturity and then harvest some or all of the trees to sell the wood. Once the wood has been sold for use as lumber, wood products or fuel, the landowner will reforest the areas to regrow the trees.
Foresters will typically do this in stages across their land to ensure there are multiple stands of forest at different stages of growth across their land, which ensures there is consistent, sustainable growth at all times.
Fast facts
In July 2019
Ethiopia planted more than
353 million
trees in
12 hours
, which is believed to be an afforestation world record
There are
7 billion
hectares of treeless land on earth
, where
1.2 trillion
native tree saplings could naturally grow through afforestation
Increasing the earth’s forest cover by
25%
could absorb
200 gigatonnes
more CO
2
from the atmosphere, without infringing on existing cities or agricultural land

There’s a long history of sustainable thinking behind healthy, productive
working forests.
Forests have long been a source of mystery and
new discoveries are still being made today
.
Reforestation and afforestation are both
helping countries around the world to revive their forests
.

What is decarbonisation?
Carbon capture

What is decarbonisation?
Decarbonisation is the term used for the process of removing or reducing the carbon dioxide (CO
2
) output of a country’s economy. This is usually done by decreasing the amount of CO
2
emitted across the active industries within that economy.

Why is decarbonisation important?
Currently, a wide range of sectors – industrial, residential and transport – run largely on
fossil fuels
, which means that their energy comes from the combustion of fuels like coal, oil or gas.
The CO
2
emitted from using these fuels acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping in heat and contributing to global warming. By using alternative sources of energy, industries can reduce the amount of CO
2
emitted into the atmosphere and can help to slow the effects of climate change.
Why target carbon dioxide?

There are numerous greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, however CO
2
is the most prevalent. As of 2018, carbon levels are the highest they’ve been in
800,000 years
.
The Paris Agreement was created to hold nations accountable in their efforts to decrease carbon emissions, with the central goal of ensuring that temperatures don’t rise 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level.
With
195 current signatories
, economies have begun to factor in the need for less investment in carbon, with the
UK leading the G20 nations
in decarbonising its economy in the 21
st
century.
How is decarbonisation carried out?
There are numerous energy technologies that aim to reduce emissions from industries, as well as those that work towards reducing carbon emissions from the atmosphere.
Decarbonisation has had the most progress in electricity generation because of the growth of renewable sources of power, such as wind turbines,
solar
panels and coal-to-
biomass upgrades
, meaning that homes and businesses don’t have to rely on fossil fuels. Other innovations, such as
using batteries
and allowing homes to generate and share their own power, can also lead to higher rates of decarbonisation. As the electricity itself is made cleaner, it therefore assists electricity users themselves to become cleaner in the process.
Other approaches, such as reforestation or
carbon capture and storage
, help to pull existing carbon from the air, to
neutralise carbon output
, or in some cases, help to make electricity generation – and
even entire nations
– carbon negative.
Alternative power options means that homes and businesses don’t have to rely on traditional carbon fuels.
What is the future of decarbonisation?
For decarbonisation to be more widely adopted as a method for combating climate change, there needs to be
structural economical change
, according to Deloitte Access Economics. Creating more room for decarbonisation through investing in alternative energies means that “there are a multitude of job-rich, shovel-ready, stimulus opportunities that also unlock long-term value”.

Decarbonisation fast facts
A study by
Carbon Brief
in 2019 found that the UK’s carbon emissions have decreased by
38%
since 1990, which is faster than any other major developed nation
The UK has committed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by
enshrining this goal as law
, and announcing
a
£3 billion
investment in low carbon technologies
in 2019
Currently, heavy industry (cement, steel and chemicals) and heavy-duty transport (mainly shipping and aviation)
account for
30%
of CO
2
emissions
, worldwide
Energy consumption over a large range of sectors – including transport, heating, construction, and production – is the biggest source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, providing
73%
of global carbon output
Iceland is the only nation to currently have
100%
of its energy derived from natural sources
, with 73% sourced from hydropower, and 27% coming from geothermal power
