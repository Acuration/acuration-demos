ensuring security of supply during a challenging year for the uks energy system our renewable generation  biomass hydro and pumped storage  are a major source of power in the uk and during periods of peak demand when there was low wind and solar power these assets collectively supplied up to 70 of the uks renewable power in certain periods we believe that beccs can become a worldleading solution for largescale highquality carbon removals and we are seeing increasing global policy support for its delivery drax stands ready to invest billions of pounds in the development of this technology and following the introduction of the us inflation reduction act we are increasingly excited about the opportunities to deploy beccs in the us in response the uk government should accelerate its policy support for beccs to make the uk a world leader in carbon removals while attracting investment and delivering its net zero targets drax is a growing international business with strong cash returns
