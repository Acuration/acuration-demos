very british way to save the planet with america now at the table the question for the uk is can we write the next chapter in time writes drax ceo will gardiner 9 june 2023 four weeks after passing the inflation reduction act president biden gathered a crowd of 1500 activists ceos politicians and celebrities on the south lawn of the white house to mark his most significant political win to date  ushering into law the largest programme of clean energy investment in history the inflation reduction act comprises an eye watering 370 billion to kickstart investment in technologies like carbon removals and renewables according to researchers at princeton university it will reduce americas emissions by more than 6 billion tonnes by 2030 while incentivising around 120gw of clean energy projects each year goldman sachs estimates it could spur as much as 11 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2050 bidens approach has turned heads overseas for businesses including my own the investment opportunities are transformative for both companies and the climate at drax we are pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs  a technology that generates renewable power while removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere we have now selected our first two sites in the us which will remove 6 million tonnes of carbon from atmosphere each year by 2030 and we have a further 9 sites in development the provisions in the inflation reduction act namely that to award companies that capture and store carbon dioxide with an 85 per ton credit make the us an attractive place to be governments have been far less enthusiastic about the legislation driven by a concern that the lure of bidens tax incentives will syphon away domestic industries the uk has been particularly robust in its response with chancellor jeremy hunt stating he wont go toetotoe with america in a distortive global subsidy race instead he said he will focus on creating a progrowth regulatory regime which will be different and better what that means he promised will be spelled out at his forthcoming autumn statement as an american who has lived and worked in london for the past 26 years i have become accustomed to the british way of doing things if in america the squeaky wheel gets the grease then in the uk the tallest poppy is sure to be cut down which is to say the chancellor has a point there is no use in nor any need for the uk to go toetotoe in a subsidies war with america firstly even in the best of economic circumstances it will never win but secondly and more importantly the uks long term disciplined approach to driving climate action while preserving energy security has resulted in a regulatory rulebook rich with opportunity to make britain a clean energy powerhouse if we choose to make it so researchers from imperial college london have estimated that if the uk is to claim that mantle it must unlock 80bn in clean energy infrastructure investment according to the climate change committee a similar level of investment could deliver more than 1 trillion of economic value better still britain is bursting with potential projects in hydrogen long duration energy storage and carbon removals to name a few and by tweaking our existing regulatory rulebook we can make them a reality take for example the contract for difference cfd while it will never grab headlines it has helped britains power system decarbonise faster than any other g7 nation expanding cfds to new technologies like beccs would enable companies like drax get on an invest more than 2bn in beccs technology here in the uk the concept of a cfd is simple and has been used extensively in the generation of renewable power government enables upfront capital investment in large infrastructure projects by stabilising the revenue companies receive for the power these projects produce if the market price of power is below the government stabilised level companies receive the difference if it is above companies pay back being a private law contract the cfd provides high levels of investor certainty while helping guard consumers against spikes in energy prices delivering a public good that is a good deal for the public according to think tank onward from november 2021 to january 2022 cfds paid back 114 million to consumers  a figure that could rise as high as 105 billion per year by 2027 then there is our emissions trading system or ets the uk was among the first nations in the world to put a price on carbon emissions back in 2002 last year alone the treasury netted over 14 billion from the uks ets by charging emitters for every tonne of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the coming months government will set out how it intends to reform the ets providing an opportunity to restructure it with green infrastructure investment at its core one option is to enable negative emissions to play a role inside the system by allowing companies to purchase credits from companies that remove carbon dioxide instead of simply paying government to emit doing so would mean meeting our climate change targets more efficiently and more affordably while creating and sustaining thousands of british jobs britains strategic advantage rests in 15 years of political consensus that tackling climate change can both benefit our planet and our economy the climate change act of 2008 which put in place legally binding carbon reduction targets passed in the house of commons with near unanimity since then successive governments have introduced progressive law and regulation such as the cfd and ets to reduce britains emissions while keeping our economy growing and our energy supplies secure across the atlantic however america has been unable to develop the same policy options  held back by a deepseated political divide on climate change and a seemingly inseverable relationship with fossil fuels the inflation reduction act has the potential to change that when joe biden spoke on the south lawn of the white house he was keen to position the law as something more than just a package of subsidies for him it is a fundamental restatement of what matters to modern america  today offers proof that the soul of america is vibrant the future of america is bright and the promise of america is real in britain tackling climate change has always mattered weve literally written the rulebook on it with america now at the table the question for the uk is can we write the next chapter in time share most read electrification
