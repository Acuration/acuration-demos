Press Release
Negative emissions pioneer Drax announces new CCUS projects during Energy Minister’s visit
30 January 2020
Press releases

Cleantech companies Econic Technologies and Deep Branch Biotechnology are the latest businesses to begin work with world-leader in negative emissions, Drax Group.
The projects have the potential to use carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies to enable other sectors to decarbonise, making a significant contribution to UK efforts to address the climate emergency.
UK Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth, Kwasi Kwarteng, visited Drax to hear more about its ambitious plan to become carbon negative by 2030 using ground-breaking bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology – and met with some of the businesses it is working with on CCUS.
(Click to download) Clare Harbord, Jason Shipstone (both Drax) with Kwasi Kwarteng MP, and Will Gardiner Drax Group CEO and Andy Koss, Drax CEO Generation.
Negative emissions pioneer, Drax Group is continuing to develop ground-breaking carbon capture technologies through new partnerships and pilot projects, putting UK businesses at the forefront of efforts to tackle the climate crisis.
Drax has announced a new partnership with cleantech company Econic Technologies to explore the potential for using captured carbon dioxide from its biomass power generation to displace oil in the production of plastic products, using its pioneering catalyst technology.
The partnership marks a major step towards enabling other businesses, including in the automotive, consumer and construction sectors, to produce more sustainable polyurethane products. Econic’s catalyst technology could save as much as the equivalent of four million petrol cars’ worth of CO
2
per year in this first market alone.
A new pilot plant has also been installed at the power station in North Yorkshire, by Deep Branch Biotechnology to
explore the feasibility
of using Drax’s CO
2
emissions to make proteins for sustainable animal feed products – technology which could enable the agricultural sector to decarbonise.
The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP, UK Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth visited the CCUS Incubation Hub at Drax Power Station, to see for himself the pioneering work taking place.
Drax was
the first company in the world
to announce an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 when CEO Will Gardiner spoke at COP 25 in Madrid. By applying BECCS technology to its biomass generating units Drax would remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces across the whole of its operations, creating a negative carbon footprint for the company.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO said:
“Drax’s ambition is to be carbon negative by 2030.  Having pioneered the use of sustainable biomass, Drax now produces 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity. With the right negative emissions policy for BECCS, we can do much more, removing millions of tonnes of emissions from the atmosphere each year.
“By working with innovative tech companies like Econic and Deep Branch Biotechnology, we are exploring new opportunities for clean growth, which could be critical not only for beating the climate crisis, but also in enabling a just transition, protecting jobs across the North – delivering for the economy and the environment.”
Econic Technologies will test the CO
2
being captured from Drax’s successful one tonne a day BECCS pilot at its own industrial pilot facility, to assess its suitability for producing polymers used in polyurethane plastics.
(Click to download) Leigh Taylor from Econic Technologies discussing the polyurethane products made using waste CO2 with Kwasi Kwarteng MP and Jason Shipstone, Drax VP Innovation
Dr Rowena Sellens, Econic Technologies CEO, said:
“Tackling climate change requires collaboration at all levels, and the Econic and Drax partnership is a significant step forward as industries establish viable, sustainable solutions. This project has the scope to unlock the endless potential of CO
2
across a vast number of sectors. We’re confident that the CO
2
being captured by Drax will be suitable for use in our process, meaning that we could move forwards to explore potential commercial opportunities together and accelerate the roll-out of both our technologies and their positive climate impact.”

Drax is also working with a number of businesses to deliver
a Zero Carbon Humber
by 2040 – CO
2
from Drax and other industrial emitters across the region, could be captured, transported and then stored under the North Sea creating the UK’s first zero carbon industrial cluster in line with UK government targets.

Editor’s Notes
Econic Technologies has pioneered a catalyst that allows bespoke amounts of CO
2
to replace up to 50% of the traditional fossil fuel-based materials used in polymer production.
The polyurethanes produced have a wide range of uses, such as in producing products for the automotive sector, consumer goods, home furnishings as well as insulation for buildings.
Drax has installed storage cylinders to compress and store small quantities of the CO
2
being captured from its successful BECCS pilot, which will enable Econic to test its suitability for use in its processes. These will be commissioned in the coming weeks. Once running they have the capacity to store up to 6kg of CO
2
to enable testing to be carried out.
Businesses across the Humber region are
supporting the Zero Carbon Humber campaign
. As the most carbon intensive region in the country – the Humber would be able to make a more significant impact on addressing the climate emergency than anywhere else in the UK.
Drax is continuing work with C-Capture, using funding from the government’s CCUS innovation fund for
work to test and validate
the BECCS technology it is piloting. This is due to be completed later this year.
By applying BECCS technology to all four of its biomass generating units, Drax could capture and store 16 million tonnes or more of CO
2
a year – a significant proportion of the UK’s target.
The UK Committee on Climate Change’s ‘
Net Zero
’ report states that BECCS could generate up to 173 TWh of electricity by 2050, capturing up to 51 million tonnes of CO
2
– around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the UK will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.
About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Its 2,900-strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation

About Econic Technologies
Econic Technologies is a British cleantech company that has pioneered catalyst technologies for utilisation of Carbon Dioxide (CO
2
) in place of conventional oil-based feedstocks. Its tailored catalyst systems enable the utilisation of captured CO
2
as a feedstock for manufacturing polyols, a precursor of plastics like polyurethanes, on an industrial scale.
In 2018, Econic Technologies received investment from OGCI Climate Investments, a voluntary initiative led by CEOs of 13 global oil and gas companies, which invest in promising technologies and business models that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that are commercially viable and scalable. In 2019, Econic was also named on the prestigious Global CLEANTECH 100 list. These developments follow investment from the likes of IP Group plc and Jetstream Capital, as well as a Horizon 2020 SME award secured in 2016, which have helped the company accelerate the commercialisation of its catalyst technologies.
The company operates globally from Alderley Park, near Manchester, UK and its state-of-the-art customer demonstration facility in Runcorn, UK, which has seen 60 customers visit since opening in March 2018. Econic Technologies is working with global polyol producers across North America, Europe and Asia as part of a programme to accelerate adoption of its catalyst technologies across these territories.
Founded in 2011 by Charlotte Williams, now Professor at Oxford University, and David Morgan, formerly Executive Director of FTSE 100 catalyst company Johnson Matthey plc, Econic’s unique technologies allow bespoke amounts of CO
2
to be used (up to 50%) as a raw material in the manufacture of polyols with enhanced properties for value added products. This enables producers to benefit from substantial raw material feedstock cost savings and achieve significant environmental benefits from both CO
2
utilisation and reduced CO
2
emissions, while also enabling the potential for economic gain via an ability to offer enhanced product performance to users.
About polyols
Polyols are the building block for polyurethanes and are used in the production of flexible and rigid foams, elastomers, adhesives, sealants and coatings. Industry sectors include: automotive, footwear & apparel (e.g. sports trainers), furniture (sofas, mattresses etc), appliances (e.g. fridges) and construction (insulation panels, coatings etc). The global polyols market is valued at $24Bn and is growing.

Drax’s Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station wins six year contract to keep electricity system stable
29 January 2020
Press releases

National Grid has awarded ‘synchronous compensation’ contract to Drax’s Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station
The contract is to provide system services to keep the national grid stable
The contract means Drax will provide services such as inertia, which keeps the system stable, and reactive power which helps move power around the grid, for the next six years.
Andy Koss, CEO Generation, Drax, at Cruachan Power Station. Click to view/download in high res.
System services such as inertia and reactive power were readily available in the past due to the number of large ‘spinning’ power stations on the electricity system, but the rise of non-synchronous generators such as solar, wind and interconnectors mean
these services are now more important and have to be procured separately
.
Andy Koss, CEO Drax Generation, said:
“Provision of these crucial services is central to Drax’s purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Our strategic aim is to be a leading provider of system services which support the deployment of more renewable power – it could also help to bring us a step closer to our ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030.”
This is the first tender National Grid ESO has run under phase one of its System Stability Pathfinder. Under the terms of the provisional contract, one of the four turbines at the 440MW Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in Argyll and Bute, will no longer generate power. Instead the turbine will only be used to provide the services needed to support the system.
National Grid currently plans further stability tenders to take place, both nationally and regionally, which provide an opportunity to secure further contracts for some of Drax’s other power generation assets.
Notes to editors
National Grid ESO’s System Stability Pathfinder tender is separate to the Capacity Market Auctions starting tomorrow and units are able to take part in both processes provided they are available to provide the contracted services.
Inertia is a system support service which acts like a shock absorber helping to control changes in frequency, to ensure the grid maintains a frequency of 50Hz. Without having enough inertia available to reduce the rate of frequency changes which occur on the system, the grid is more vulnerable to power cuts.
National Grid
made an announcement
about its new approach to stability services today.

Drax responds to Chatham House report
Press releases

“Both the UK Committee on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change agree that BECCS, a ground-breaking negative emissions technology which Drax is pioneering, will play a critical role in addressing the climate emergency. It is the only negative emissions technology which can produce renewable electricity whilst removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

“By applying BECCS to Drax’s biomass generating units, we could deliver 16 million tonnes of negative emissions a year – a significant proportion of what’s required in the UK to address the climate crisis. This could be done sustainably using low-grade wood from the working forests we already source from, which have a large surplus of this material.”




Drax’s new biomass policy paves the way for world-leading sustainability standard
24 January 2020
Press releases

An Independent Advisory Board (IAB), led by former UK government chief scientific adviser Sir John Beddington, was appointed by Drax in October when it published a strengthened sourcing policy to ensure the biomass it uses to produce 12% of Britain’s renewable electricity meets the highest sustainability standards.
In its first report the IAB has found that Drax’s sustainable biomass sourcing reflects the recommendations made by Forest Research – the research agency of the Forestry Commission, which is widely considered to be the industry gold standard.
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner said:
“The work of the IAB is vital in guiding and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be. I am reassured to know that our existing policies reflect the Forestry Commission’s recommendations and we’ll continue to work with the Board to strive for greater excellence across our operations.
“We recently announced our ambition to become the world’s first carbon negative company by using sustainable biomass with carbon capture and storage technology. To achieve this, we need to go further in our efforts to lead the world on biomass sustainability standards, positively contributing to our climate, the environment and the communities in which we operate.”
The IAB also recommended consideration is given to a review of existing evidence on sustainable biomass to advance understanding among academics, policy makers and environmental groups.
Such a “restatement of evidence” would be aimed at fostering agreement amongst scientists and environmental groups on the role of sustainable biomass, sharing information with third parties on Drax’s operations and using scientific evidence to identify points of agreement, disagreement and areas which need further study.
The IAB’s chair John Beddington said:
“It’s a complex area to navigate and if some common ground based on the scientific evidence can be agreed, it creates a framework to help ensure the right types of biomass are used which make the greatest contribution towards addressing the climate emergency.”
The UK’s Committee on Climate Change has said that biomass will play a critical role in achieving the UK’s 2050 net zero target.
The IAB, which meets twice a year, will produce a written report of its conclusions and recommendations for Drax after its meetings and a summary of these will be published on the Drax
website
. The IAB held its first meeting on November 15, 2019.

Editor’s Notes
Forest Research (2018)
Biomass Carbon Impacts
, report for the European Climate Foundation has been cited by a number of organisations including the UK Committee on Climate Change in its
Biomass in a Low Carbon Economy
report.
Drax
set up the IAB in 2019
alongside its new strengthened biomass sustainability policy, which goes beyond existing regulations, to ensure the company’s biomass sourcing continues to improve with the latest science and best practice.
The “restatement of the evidence” the IAB has suggested is an independently run process based on input from scientists with varying points of view, consultation with industry, non-governmental organisations and policy makers.
Sir John Beddington also said in his letter to Drax that the board wanted to explore how science regarding the use of early thinnings and small roundwood can further develop. Drax has initiated a programme of independent analysis on the environmental and economic impacts in the areas where it sources its wood. It will be sharing this with the IAB for its scrutiny and insight.
The IAB acts as a forum for engagement between sustainable biomass experts and Drax and is tasked to advise and give feedback on feedstock options, sourcing decisions, procurement practices, forest science and forest carbon science.
The IAB also advises on the role of biomass in Drax’s climate change mitigation activities and in supporting the transition to a net zero energy system, as well as providing insight on society’s expectations for responsible and sustainable biomass.
Members of Drax’s Independent Advisory Board are:
Professor Sir John Beddington (Chair) – former UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser
Professor Lord John Krebs (Vice Chair) – Emeritus Professor of Zoology, University of Oxford and crossbench member of the House of Lords
Virginia Dale – Adjunct Professor, University of Tennessee
Professor Sam Fankhauser – Director of the LSE Grantham Institute
Elena Schmidt – Standards Director, Roundtable on Sustainable Biomass
Forest Research (Ex-Officio) – A representative from Forest Research, the UK’s primary organisation for forest science will also join the Board in an ex-officio capacity
The Board provides independent advice to Drax on:
The role of biomass in Drax’s climate change mitigation activities and in supporting the transition to a net zero energy system
Feedstock options, sourcing decisions, forest science, forest carbon science and how Drax can optimise carbon impacts
Procurement practices
Societal expectations for responsible and sustainable biomass
And gives feedback and recommendations on Drax’s sustainable biomass approach and performance

Waltham Leas Primary Academy visits Europe’s biggest carbon saving project
Press releases

The group of 32 students aged between eight and nine, visited Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, which has upgraded two thirds of its generating capacity to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal.
This has transformed the plant to become the UK’s largest renewable power generator – producing enough electricity for four million homes – and Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
It has also paved the way for Drax to pioneer ground-breaking bio energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology. If BECCS can be used across all four of its biomass generating units, Drax could become the world’s first negative emissions power station, helping it to make an even greater contribution towards tackling the climate emergency.
Pupils were taken on a full tour of the site including the innovative BECCS pilot plant which is capturing a tonne of CO2 each day, the 427-metre turbine hall that houses the six huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity.
They also enjoyed a close-up view of the UK’s first wood pellet storage domes, each large enough to fit The Royal Albert Hall inside, and the 12 cooling towers, which at 115 metres high are taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Drax Group’s Head of Business Sustainability, Vicky Bullivant, said:
“By providing tours at Drax Power Station we want to further students’ understanding of how electricity is produced and hopefully fire their imaginations and inspire them to study STEM subjects by showing them some of the pioneering technologies we’re trying, like BECCS, which could play a vital role in addressing the climate crisis.”
During the tour, pupils learnt how renewable electricity is generated and discovered how sustainable, compressed wood pellets have enabled Drax to reduce its carbon emissions by more than 80% compared to when those generating units used coal.
Chetna Taylor, from Waltham Leas Primary Academy, who organised the visit, said:
“The students had a great day at Drax, learning about how the electricity system works and where our electricity is generated. Visits like this are so valuable because seeing the power station and the scale of the operations is impossible to replicate in a classroom – it really brings the subject to life.”
Drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the engineers of the future by encouraging greater interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. Earlier this year it invested £35,000
in the GreenPower initiative
involving seven local schools and colleges in building and racing electric vehicles.
The Waltham Leas Academy students are among over 12,000 visitors to Drax every year. Tours are free to all primary and secondary schools and can be tailored to suit the area of the curriculum teachers are interested in.

Drax pledge to lead the energy industry on social mobility
22 January 2020
Press releases

The former Secretary of State for Education visited Drax Power Station – the UK’s largest renewable electricity generator, in North Yorkshire, to hear more about the energy company’s work to improve education and skills within the communities local to its UK operations.
The Social Mobility Pledge is a cross party campaign aimed at encouraging businesses to develop relationships with colleges and schools, to increase access through apprenticeships, work experience and other career enhancing schemes which help to level the playing field and ensure opportunities are created for all.
Close up of Justine Greening in the electric vehicle.
Justine Greening, Social Mobility Pledge founder, said:
“By removing barriers to STEM learning and opening up employment opportunities within the energy industry, Drax is giving young people the skills needed to forge successful careers in a sector which has an important role to play in the transition to a net zero economy.”
During her time in North Yorkshire, Justine Greening visited Selby College – one of Drax’s educational partners – and Drax Power Station, where she met post-graduate students from Staffordshire University who were visiting to see how it has become Europe’s largest decarbonisation project by converting two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal.
Drax
recently announced
plans to become a carbon negative company by using innovative bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology. Negative emissions technologies like BECCS are critical to the UK to achieve its net zero carbon targets whilst also creating new jobs and opportunities for clean growth.
Andy Koss, Drax CEO Generation, said:
“Companies like Drax are developing and innovating using new technologies which will help to combat the climate crisis. It’s important that communities are not left behind during the transition to a more sustainable future – making sure people have the right skills is a key part of that.
“At Drax we work with schools and colleges to provide exciting activities and experiences which help to boost education, inspiring students by giving them access to new technologies from within the energy sector, like electric vehicles, which provides invaluable experience.”
In 2019, Drax worked with schools and colleges in the Selby area, to encourage more people to study Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects by providing them each with an EV kit car for students to build and race.
Liz Ridley, Deputy Principal, Selby College said:
“Our students have got involved in some incredible projects with Drax, such as building and then racing their own electric vehicle.
“Having the chance to work with such experienced and skilled engineers from Drax on an exciting project like that, was inspiring – it opened the students’ eyes to new possibilities and gave them some of the skills they’ll need in the future to grasp the opportunities which come their way. We’re looking forward to repeating the project again with more of our students this year.”
Justine Greening discussing STEM learning with Drax Generation CEO, Andy Koss; Head of Sustainable Business, Vicky Bullivant; and staff and students of Selby College.
Drax has a significant network of partnerships with schools and colleges across its operations which encourages access to STEM learning. It also provides work experience opportunities, apprenticeships and graduate recruitment schemes.
Through its commitment to the Social Mobility Pledge, Drax will publish a report later this year about its performance in delivering a positive social impact, which will be used as an example of best practice in the energy industry.

How Highland snow helps power Scotland
14 January 2020
Press releases

Towering over Loch Awe, Ben Cruachan is one of many Munros that spend much of the winter blanketed in snow. Cruachan is unlike any other Scottish mountain, however. On its slopes lies a dam which stores water in a reservoir that is then transported into a power station built inside the hollowed-out centre of the mountain to generate power by spinning turbines.
“On a few occasions the snowfall has been so extreme that we’ve been unable to access the dam for a few weeks at a time,” says Gordon Pirie, a Civil Engineer at Cruachan. “Thankfully, we have enough controls in place where we are still able to monitor and operate things remotely.”
When there is excess power on grid, the turbines reverse and use it to pump water from Loch Awe up to the reservoir. In this way it is storing the excess electricity, in the form of water – like a battery – and holding it in the top reservoir, ready to be used by the power station when demand for power increases.
Built on the shores of Loch Awe in Argyll and Bute in the mid-1960s, Cruachan was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on its scale to be built in the world and is still one of only four power stations in the whole of the UK that can operate in this way, making it a vital component of Britain’s generation network.
The power station is very responsive, and able to react quickly to changes on the system – it can achieve full load (440MW) in just 30 seconds and can operate continuously at full output for around 15 hours if necessary.
Thanks to Scotland’s wet weather, 70 million cubic metres of water flowed into Cruachan’s reservoir from surface water from the mountainside, melting snow and rainfall in 2018. That’s enough to fill 28,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
This water is collected and delivered through a complex series of aqueducts which stretch for some 14km and brings water from 75 intakes across the mountain. The intakes range from pipes no larger than small street drains to some large enough for a jeep to drive through.
Keeping these aqueducts in working order so melt water from snow can continue to flow into the reservoir is one of Pirie’s main tasks.
“Even in freezing conditions the water will still flow through the aqueduct system, the intakes have a built-in feature which allows the water to flow into them even if the surface is frozen solid,” he explains. “Any snow or frost on the ground eventually thaws and makes its way to the reservoir.”
Cruachan shows that with a bit of ingenuity and determination, Scotland’s dreich weather needn’t be a negative. The rain and snow which fall across the Highlands helps produce renewable electricity that powers our homes and moves us closer to a net-zero future.
The Hollow Mountain shows that every cloud really does have a silver lining.

Editor’s Notes
You can read about the men who built Cruachan and the complex construction of the power station on the Drax
website
.
Drax acquired Cruachan power station at the end of 2018, when it bought a portfolio of flexible, renewable and low-carbon power stations located across Scotland and England.
Since then, the visitor centre has been renovated and Drax has also introduced free school tours during term time as part of the company’s efforts to boost STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) skills.
50,000 people visit Cruachan Power Station each year and take guided tours inside the subterranean world of the power station, where they can see the machine hall and learn about its history and the feat of engineering required to build it.
Cruachan is one of four pumped hydro storage stations in the UK and has a capacity of 440 MW – enough to power more than 880,000 homes during peak demand.
The turbine hall is located 1 km within the hollowed-out mountain of Ben Cruachan and houses four generators, supplying a range of vital balancing and ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency control, spinning and operating reserves, helping to maintain secure power supplies.
Drax’s Scottish operations include hydro facilities in Galloway and Lanark and a biomass-from-waste plant at Daldowie, near Glasgow, along with Cruachan, all of which were acquired at the end of last year.

Trafford College visits Europe’s biggest carbon saving project
10 January 2020
Press releases

The group of 23 students aged between 18 and 25, visited Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, which has upgraded two thirds of its generating capacity to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal.
This has transformed the plant to become the UK’s largest renewable power generator – producing enough electricity for four million homes – and Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
It has also paved the way for Drax to pioneer ground-breaking bio energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology. If BECCS can be used across all four of its biomass generating units, Drax could become the world’s first negative emissions power station, helping it to make an even greater contribution towards tackling the climate emergency.
Students were taken on a full tour of the site including the innovative BECCS pilot plant which is capturing a tonne of CO2 each day, the 427-metre turbine hall that houses the six huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity.
They also enjoyed a close-up view of the UK’s first wood pellet storage domes, each large enough to fit The Royal Albert Hall inside, and the 12 cooling towers, which at 115 metres high are taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Drax Group’s Head of Business Sustainability, Vicky Bullivant, said:
“By providing tours at Drax Power Station we want to further students’ understanding of how electricity is produced and hopefully fire their imaginations and inspire them to study STEM subjects by showing them some of the pioneering technologies we’re trying, like BECCS, which could play a vital role in addressing the climate crisis.”
During the tour, pupils learnt how renewable electricity is generated and discovered how sustainable, compressed wood pellets have enabled Drax to reduce its carbon emissions by more than 80% compared to when those generating units used coal.
Bertin Speaks, from Trafford College, who organised the visit, said:
“The students had a great day at Drax, learning about how the electricity system works and where our electricity is generated. Visits like this are so valuable because seeing the power station and the scale of the operations is impossible to replicate in a classroom – it really brings the subject to life.”
