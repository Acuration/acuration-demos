inspire students to study science technology engineering and maths stem subjects 15 july 2022 at an event attended by over 170 year 9 pupils from four different local schools the teenagers had the opportunity to participate in a range of fun informative and challenging activities provided by drax including an electrical circuit problem solving session bruce heppenstall drax plant director said through events like these we can engage young people in fun stem activities introducing them to future skills training and employment opportunities its important for innovative companies like drax to work with schools and colleges to engage with and inspire the next generation because they will eventually become our workforce of the future a group of draxs graduate engineers and analysts delivered an its all about energy session where students explored and debated the pros and cons of new energy technologies jane breach drax visitor centre and community engagement team leader who organised the activities said it was great to see everyone enjoying the activities and using their problemsolving and analytical thinking skills it builds on what theyve already learnt in their school curriculum and gives them an insight in the wide range of applications for stem subjects students also had the opportunity to try out virtual reality headsets use electromagnetics and have a go at coding in sessions run by selby college tutors they also spent time in the colleges stateoftheart institute of technology laboratory where they were able to see firsthand how an automated manufacturing line works lorraine cross group executive director of external relations  development at the heart of yorkshire education group said encouraging young people to excel in stem subjects is high on our agenda so its fantastic that we are able to work with leading employers like drax to facilitate events such as this they give students a unique opportunity to further explore stem subjects and the career options and opportunities which they can open doors too at a crucial stage in their learning we hope the students enjoyed the event and left feeling inspired to pursue their progression in stem areas

including providing laptops with free internet access free tours of draxs power stations virtual stem workshops in schools virtual work experience about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 17 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers
