decarbonisation supporting the deployment of bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs in the uk business model options 8 april 2021 carbon capture click to viewdownload the report pdf drax power station is currently exploring the option of adding carbon capture and storage equipment to its biomassfired generating units the resulting plant could produce at least 8 million tonnes mt of negative co 2 emissions each year as well as generating renewable electricity drax is planning to make a final investment decision fid on its bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs in power 1  investment in q1 2024 with the first beccs unit to be operating by 2027 the potential of beccs as part of the path to net zero has been widely recognised beccs in power is an important part of all of the climate change committee cccs net zero scenarios contributing to negative emissions of between 16 39mt co 2 e per year by 2050 2  investment needs to occur early by 2035 the ccc sees a role for 34gw of beccs as part of a mix of low carbon generation 3  the governments energy white paper commits by 2022 to establishing the role which beccs can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy and setting out how the technology could be deployed the government has also committed to invest up to 1 billion to support the establishment of carbon capture usage and storage ccus in four industrial clusters 4  national grids 2020 future energy scenarios fes indicate that it is not possible to achieve net zero without beccs 5  however at present a business model 6 which could enable this investment is not in place a business model is required because a number of barriers and market failures otherwise make economic investment impossible there is no market for negative emissions there is currently no source of remuneration for the value delivered by negative emissions and therefore no return for the investment needed to achieve them positive spillovers are not remunerated  positive spillovers that would be delivered by a firstofakind beccs power plant but which are not remunerated include providing an anchor load for carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage ts infrastructure that can be used by subsequent ccs projects delivering learning that will help lower the costs of subsequent beccs power plants and delivering learning and shared skills that can be used across a range of ccs projects including hydrogen production with ccs beccs relies on the presence of co 2 transport and storage infrastructure  where this infrastructure doesnt already exist or where the availability or costs are highly uncertain this presents a significant risk to investors in beccs in power ccus incubation area drax power station click image to viewdownload frontier economics has been commissioned by drax to develop and evaluate business model options for beccs in power that could overcome these barriers and help deliver timely investment in beccs business model options we started with a long list of business model options after eliminating options that are unsuitable for beccs in power we considered the following three options in detail power contract for difference cfd the strike price of the cfd would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillover benefits carbon payment a contractual carbon payment would provide a fixed payment per tonne of negative emissions the payment level would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillovers carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two options above the carbon payment would provide remuneration for negative emissions and learnings and spillovers while the power cfd would support power market revenues for the plants renewable power output we first considered if committing to any of these business model options for beccs in power now might restrict future policy options for a broader ggr support scheme we assessed whether these options could over time be transitioned into a broader ggr support scheme ie one not just focused on beccs in power and concluded that this would be possible for all of them we then considered how these business model options could be funded and whether the choice of a business model option is linked to a particular source of funds for example power cfds are currently funded by a levy paid by electricity suppliers to the low carbon contracts company lccc we concluded that business models do not need to be attached to specific funding sources all of the options can be designed to fit with numerous different funding options so the two decisions can be made independently this means that the business model options can be considered on their own terms with thinking about funding sources being progressed in parallel we then evaluated the three business model options against a set of criteria developed from principles set out in the beis consultation on business models for ccs summarised in the figure below figure 1 principles for design of business models instil investor confidence  attract innovation  attract new entrants  instil supply chain confidence cost efficiency  drive efficient management of investment costs  drive efficient quantity of investment  drive efficient dispatch and operation  risks allocated in an efficient way taking into account the impact on the cost of capital feasibility  limit administrative burden  practicality for investors  requirement for complementary policy  wider policy and state aid compatibility  timely implementation fair cost sharing  allows fair and practical cost distribution ease of policy transition  ease of transition to subsidy free system  ease of transition to technology neutral solution source frontier economics click to viewdownload graphic all three business model options performed well across most criteria however our evaluation highlighted some key tradeoffs to consider when choosing a business model investor confidence the power cfd and the twopart model with a cfd performed better than the carbon payment on this measure as they shield investors from wholesale power market fluctuations feasibility the power cfd performed best on this measure because it is already established in existing legislation and is well understood it will be quick to implement introducing a mechanism to provide carbon payments may require new legislation however this will be needed in any case to support other ccus technologies 7  and could be introduced in time before projects come online and potential to become technology neutral and subsidy free all three options could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral however the standalone power cfd performed least well as it does not deliver any learnings around remunerating negative emissions overall the twopart model performed well across the criteria and would offer a clear path to a technology neutral and subsidy free world delivering learnings that will be relevant for other ggrs as well conclusions the uks net zero target will be challenging to achieve and will require investment in negative emissions technologies to offset residual emissions from hardtoabate sectors as highlighted by the ccc 8  beccs in power is a particularly important part of this picture and represents a costeffective means of delivering the scale of negative emissions needed early investment in beccs is also important in insuring against the risk and cost of back ending significant abatement effort however market failures most notably the lack of a market for negative emissions lack of remuneration for positive spillovers and learnings and reliance on availability of ts infrastructure mean that without policy intervention the required level of beccs in power is unlikely to be delivered in time to contribute to net zero there are a number of business options available in the near term to overcome these barriers in our view a twopart model combining a power cfd and a carbon payment is preferable this measure addresses identified market failures can be implemented relatively easily and in time to capture benefits of early beccs in power investment and can be structured to ensure an efficient outcome for customers including with reference to investors likely cost of capital and in a way that allocates risks appropriately viewdownload the full report pdf  1 biomass can be combusted to generate energy typically in the form of power but this could also be in the form of heat or liquid fuel or gasified to produce hydrogen the resulting emissions can then be captured and stored using ccs technology the focus of this report is on biomass combustion to generate power with ccs which we refer to as beccs in power we refer to biomass gasification with ccs as beccs for hydrogen 2 ccc 2020  the sixth carbon budget greenhouse gas removals

account to share their experiences so far working in the energy industry and their roles at drax the yep forum consists of a network of energy industry professionals with less than 10 years experience and aims to provide them with opportunities to collaborate develop and recognise successes the following insights from employees at drax show the importance of our workforce in achieving our ambition and what they have learnt so far about starting a career in the energy industry engineer working in the turbine hall at drax power station north yorkshire meet samuel the apprentice one of our technical apprentices samuel plumb explains why he decided to kickstart his career with a drax apprenticeship plus what the selection process involves i applied for this role because its a mix of practical skills and problemsolving drax has a large site with a huge range of equipment and processes so no two days are the same working here appealed to me because im really interested in the power industry and drax plays a key role in generation i found out about this apprenticeship through online research submitted an application completed aptitude tests online sat another aptitude test onsite and then eventually attended an interview meet richard the policy manager richard gow explains that with the right policies in place drax could become a carbon negative power station enabling a zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region the drax group policy and government relations manager outlines how his role helps to develop the necessary frameworks i engage with policymakers advisors and experts across the uk to understand the policy and political landscape and how this could impact draxs commercial objectives the energy sector is at the forefront of decarbonisation and its exciting to be involved in developing policies and market frameworks to support this transition to net zero by investing in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen and other green technologies in the humber industry can regain a competitive edge new jobs can help to rejuvenate communities and the wider region as evidenced by a recent report from vivid economics on the socioeconomic benefits of beccs this investment at drax supports the uks levelling up agenda and to build back better  emphasising the need for the uk to have a skilled workforce to achieve net zero will gardiner ceo of drax group has explained how our own ambitions will also boost our communities and local economies by helping to create a cleaner environment for future generations whilst creating new jobs and export opportunities for british businesses noting that beccs at drax is not just limited to new engineering or technician roles as a ukus company with sites from selby to the

communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated collaborative energy system the technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions such as the us south where our american communities operate carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help drax to be carbon negative by 2030  an ambition i announced at cop25  just over a year ago in madrid will gardiner announcing draxs carbon negative ambition at cop25 in madrid december 2019 our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but are also a vital economic force as the world begins to recover from the effects of covid19 engineer inside the turbine hall of drax power station we all want the uks recovery to be a green recovery  one which benefits the north along with the whole of the country government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station  for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south  we are also partnered with 11 other organisations in the uks humber region to develop a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200000 jobs around the uk in 2039 the expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for ccus and biomass sustainability  clear longterm policies are essential here not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment these are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact co 2 emissions and lives of people engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station at drax we directly employ almost 3000 people in the us and uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this

energy policy  biomass energy charge recharge the evolution of batteries 23 december 2020 electrification from watches to toothbrushes mobile phones to cars batteries are a power source for many of our everyday belongings and while their beginnings can be traced back to the 19 th century their innovation has transformed industries technology use and society at large today energy storage systems such as pumpedhydropower have long played an important role in balancing electricity systems but as the uk and countries around the world seek to decarbonise industries and make greater use of intermittent renewable sources there is a need for greater levels of storage  while pumpedhydro storage requires the right kind of terrain  batteries can theoretically be built wherever there is the space and investment but what actually is a battery and how does it work turning chemicals to electrical flow batteries are comprised of one or more cells which store chemical energy and are able to convert that energy into electricity in most batteries there are three main components an anode cathode and electrolyte the anode and cathode are terminals for the flow of energy and are typically made of metal the electrolyte is a chemical medium that sits between the terminals allowing an electrical charge to pass through this is often a liquid but increasingly research points to the potential to use solids and create what are known as solidstate batteries how a lithium ion battery works its only when a battery is connected to a device that it completes a circuit and chemical reactions take place that allow the flow of electrical energy from the battery to the device but how much electrical energy a battery can dispense has always been a hurdle to using them as a power source making rechargeable batteries an important breakthrough the same reaction backwards a key element in battery development was the exploration of rechargeable cells these have long provided mobility and reliability in small scale outputs but are now being looked to as a source of largescale energy storage  invented by physician gaston planté in 1859 rechargeable batteries are possible because the chemical reactions that take place are reversible once the initial stored charge has been depleted via chemical reaction these reactions occur again but this time backwards to store a new charge battery charger with aa rechargeable batteries using a leadacid system plantés composition was similar to that found in rechargeable batteries used in cars and motorbikes today although the characteristics of these cells such as their heavy weight meant they were not convenient for many other uses as a result a journey of continuous research and optimisation to decrease the size and weight of rechargeable batteries began this includes investigation into the alternative chemical compositions found in batteries today  nickelmetal hydride and lithiumion to name two recharging in a lowcarbon energy system just as we have seen the size and capacity of batteries bettered throughout history the application and optimisation of modernday lithiumion cells looks to continue too powering the worlds move towards a low carbon renewable energy future from electric vehicle batteries with a million mile lifespan to a 200 megawatt battery farm in south africa  lithiumion allows reasonably largescale energy storage it can also play a key role in power grid stabilisation over short durations of time such as a few hours tesla gigafactory for the uk to run on 100 renewable electricity sources batteries would be imperative in complimenting other flexible renewables such as biomass and hydropower as a support technology batteries can help ensure a continuous supply of electricity to homes and cities even when cloud cover and low wind prevents other sources generating conversely charging and recharging batteries can also be used to absorb and store electricity when there is more sun and wind generation than needed avoiding surges in electric current or wasted generation changing charging woman charging smartphone using wireless charging pad alongside the advancements of battery capacity and composition the way we use them to charge is also changing just as bluetooth and wifi avoid the tethering required of wired connections wireless charging can increase mobility and remove physical limitations smallscale wireless charging is in use today many mobile phones toothbrushes smartwatches and earbuds now have wireless charging pads these use nearfield charging meaning the device must be in close proximity to the charger to receive power however efficient farfield charging is in development with companies like energous and ossia developing overtheair charging solutions for wearable tech medical products smart homes and industrial equipment this would mean devices could be powered and charged from many metres away the implications of this are vast for example your devices could be charged just by entering your home or office there could be less need for invasive surgery to change the batteries for pacemakers neurotransmitters and other implanted medical equipment this type of technology could also provide passive charging for electric vehicles the uk department for transport has announced a trial in nottingham  where charging plates will be placed on parts of the towns roads allowing electric taxis to charge while waiting briefly to pick up passengers as charging technology and speed continues to increase this might mean vehicles could charge wirelessly not only while parked but when stopped at traffic lights 3d rendered illustration of an elderly man with a pace maker as the world shifts away from fossil fuels to renewable sources batteries with continued improvement in performance and capacity will be crucial in supporting our connected lives transport systems and electrical grids tags electric vehicles evs  battery energy storage  decarbonisation what is renewable energy 17 december 2020 sustainable bioenergy these differ to nonrenewable energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric insights the cost of electricity from solar panels dropped by 82 between 2010 and 2019 while the cost of onshore wind fell 40 and offshore wind 29 the worlds largest power station of any kind  the three gorges dam in china runs on a renewable energy source hydropower and has a generation capacity of 225 gigawatts gw the total capacity of the worlds installed renewable electricity generation is forecast to reach 3978 gw in 2025 up from 849 gw in 2000 go deeper the magician the prince and the inventors

frequently asked questions the uk is the leader the world needs to tackle climate change will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 11 december 2020 opinion december 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of the paris agreement it represented a landmark moment in the global effort to combat climate change and build a better future  however global progress is not moving at the speed it needs to in order to meet the treatys target of keeping global warming below 152 degrees celsius explore carbon capture by drax countries have set their own decarbonisation targets and many companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative  as we at drax intend to achieve by 2030  while these leading ambitions are important for the uk and the world to meet the goals of the paris agreement real action polices and investment are needed at scale we have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago we know from the recent 6 th carbon budget that renewable energy as well as carbon capture usage and storage ccus are essential for the uk to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in that detailed 1000page report  the climate change committee ccc was clear that progress must be made immediately  the country as a whole must be 78 of the way there by 2035 by investing where its needed the uk can lead the world in a whole new industry one that may come to define the next century  leading the world in decarbonisation it was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the uk to launch the industrial revolution some 250 years ago today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world as a country  one that i moved to over 20 years ago now  we have decarbonised at a greater pace than any other over the past decade investing in renewable generation such as wind solar and biomass has allowed the uk to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for net zero emissions  to remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future power grids will require vastly increased support from energy storage systems such as pumped hydro  as well as flexible reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation however the urgency of climate change means the uk must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing negative emissions technologies which remove more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit the ccc as well as national grids future energy scenarios report have emphasised the necessity of negative emissions for the uk to reach net zero  by removing co 2 not just from energy but other industries too the uk can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cuttingedge green technology that can take the country to net zero establishing it as a world leader for others to follow creating an industry exporting it to the world when the paris agreement was signed i was just joining drax i had been
