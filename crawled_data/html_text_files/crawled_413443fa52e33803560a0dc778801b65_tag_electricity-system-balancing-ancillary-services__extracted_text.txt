power station tag electricity system balancing and ancillary services the role of biomass in securing reliable power generation 5 december 2022 power generation  sustainable bioenergy key takeaways since 2021 there has been a sharp rise in the price of electricity driven by a steep increase in wholesale gas prices in europe in particular a number of factors including the impact of covid19 and the effects of the war in ukraine have contributed to driving gas prices to record highs the volatility of gas prices means the uk needs to find replacements for the role of gas in helping to balance the electricity grid biomass and pumped storage hydro have the capacity to provide reliable renewable energy to uk homes and businesses while contributing to keeping the grid stable great britain and many other parts of the world are in a phase of energy uncertainty since 2021 soaring power prices have caused energy bills to escalate as much as fivefold and led to a string of collapses of uk energy suppliers as of october 2022 the annual energy bill for a uk household with typical energy consumption has been capped at 2500 a year  96 higher than the winter 202122 price cap  the upper limits the rates suppliers can charge for their default tariffs the costs of energy to end consumers would be even higher were it not for this energy price guarantee introduced by the uk government on 1 october and currently due to be in place until 31 march 2023 in germany the government has committed 200 billion towards a defensive shield against surging energy prices while france has capped energy price increases at 4 for 2022 and 15 from january 2023  the primary factor in this change is the rise in natural gas prices periods of turbulence driven by commodity prices emphasises the need for a diverse secure supply of power generation available to the uk grid as the energy system works through the necessary transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources the need for a reliable lowcarbon affordable power becomes even greater whats driving up gas prices as the world went into lockdown in 2020 the demand for energy including gas dropped  and so did supply when countries began to emerge from lockdown in 2021 and economies started to reboot supply struggled to keep up with renewed demand triggering a rise in the price of wholesale gas and other fuels the cold winter in 20202021 and unusually hot summers in 2021 and 2022 also dented european gas storage levels further contributing to rising gas prices an already uncertain energy market was further destabilised by russias invasion of ukraine this was particularly true in europe most notably germany where russian gas at the time accounted for around 40 of total gas consumption  gas prices began increase rapidly as a result of factors including fears that russia would restrict the supply of gas to europe in response to sanctions against the country or that an embargo on russian gas would be introduced constrained gas supplies also increased global demand for alternative sources like liquified natural gas lng imports which account for about 22 of the uks gas this increase in demand has pushed up the price of these alternatives forcing countries to compete to attract supplies there are several reasons why higher gas prices have such a significant impact on uk energy prices firstly a considerable proportion of uk electricity comes from gas in the second quarter of 2022 gas represented 42 of the uk energy mix  making it the countrys single largest source of electricity the uk also relies heavily on gas to heat its homes and with those homes being some of the oldest and least energyefficient in europe it takes more gas to heat them up and keep them warm click to viewdownload the role of biomass and pumped storage hydro in ensuring security of supply in addition to the pressures placed on gas and electricity supplies since 2021 the uks journey to net zero depends on increasing reliance on intermittent sources of power such as wind and solar as such there is a renewed need to ensure a diverse range of power generation sources to secure electricity supply globally as gas becomes less economical biomass offers a renewable reliable dispatchable source of power that can balance the grid and supply baseload power regardless of weather conditions the turbine hall at cruachan power station our four 645 mw biomassfuelled generating turbines at drax power station make it the largest single renewable source of power in the uk the plant can produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of five million homes come rain or shine draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in the scottish highlands also offers national grid the capacity to store 440 mw of renewable power by absorbing excess electricity from zero carbon sources like wind and solar cruachan can store and deploy power when the grid needs it most the ability of pumped storage hydro and biomass plants to store energy and quickly adjust output as required will become ever more important as the uks use of renewables grows and there are fewer spinning turbines connected to the grid as renewable nonintermittent sources of electricity biomass and pumped storage hydro are central to a safe economic and stable electricity grid  and to the uks lowcarbon energy future tags biomass energy  electricity generation  flexibility and stability and power system security  electricity system balancing and ancillary services the cost of staying in control iain staffell imperial college london 31 august 2020 opinion the cost of keeping britains power system stable has soared and now adds 20 onto the cost of generating electricity the actions that national grid takes to manage the power system have typically amounted to 5 of generation costs over the last decade but this share has quadrupled over the last two years in the first half of 2020 the cost of these actions averaged 100 million per month supplying electricity to our homes and workplaces needs more than just power stations generating electricity supply and demand must be kept perfectly in balance  and flows of electricity around the country must be actively managed to keep all the interconnected components stable and prevent blackouts national grids costs for taking these actions have been on the rise as we reported over the previous two summers  but recently they have skyrocketed at the start of the decade balancing added about 1mwh to the cost of electricity but last quarter it surpassed 5mwh for the first time see below balancing prices have risen in step with the share of variable renewables the dashed line below shows that for every extra percent of electricity supplied by wind and solar adds 10 pence per mwh to the balancing price last quarter really bucks this trend though and balancing prices have risen 35 above the level expected from this trend the uk energy research centre predicted that wind and solar would add up to 5mwh to the cost of electricity due to their intermittency  and britain has now reached this point albeit a few years earlier than expected this is partly because keeping the power system stable is requiring more interventions than ever before with low demand and high renewable generation national grid is having to order more wind farms to reduce their output at a cost of around 20 million per month they even had to take out a 50 million contract to reduce the output from the sizewell b nuclear reactor at times of system stress left the quarterlyaverage cost of balancing the power system expressed as a percentage of the cost of generation right balancing price shown against share of variable renewables with dots showing the average over each quarter a second reason for the price rise is that national grids costs of balancing are passed on to generators and consumers who pay per mwh as demand has fallen by a sixth since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic the increased costs are being shared out among a smaller base  ofgem has stepped in to cap the balancing service charges at a maximum of 10mwh until late october their covid support scheme will defer up to 100 million of charges until the following year for a quarter of a century the electricity demand in gb ranged from 19 to 58 gw   historically demand minus the intermittent output of wind and solar farms never fell below 14 gw however in each month from april to june this year this net demand fell below 7 gw just as a mclaren sports car is happier going at 70 than 20 mph the national grid is now being forced to operate well outside its comfort zone this highlights the importance of the work that national grid must do towards their ambition to be ready for a zerocarbon system by 2025 the fact we are hitting these limits now rather than in a few years time is a direct result of covid running the system right at its limits is having a shortterm financial impact and is teaching us lessons for the longterm about how to run a leaner and highlyrenewable power system  minimum net demand demand minus wind and solar output in each quarter since

or simply the grid is the network of powerlines pylons gas lines and interconnectors that makes up great britains electricity and gas systems  and the engineers technology and rules responsible for their seamless operation it ensures electricity generated anywhere by any source can be transmitted to meet the demand for power wherever its needed across the country it heats homes and businesses it helps us to cook our food the national electricity grid consists of a high voltage transmission system which connects electricity from power stations to substations and smaller local networks  called distribution network operators or dnos  which transport electricity into homes and businesses how does it work transporting electricity around the grid is more complicated than just connecting cables to power generators in order to move power around the country things like voltage and frequency of electricity must be balanced and kept uniform at all times without this unstable electricity could damage equipment and ultimately lead to blackouts the national grid electricity system operator eso is a separate entity from the national grid company and is responsible for maintaining the correct voltage frequency and reserve power levels to ensure electricity is transmitted safely and efficiently at all times it does this by working with power generators and energy storage facilities to provide what are known as  ancillary services   a set of processes that keep the power system in operation stable and balanced the national grid is the network of power stations powerlines and electricity infrastructure that allows electricity to be generated transported and used across the country who controls it in great britain the national grid company owns and operates the transmission systems which ensure electricity is delivered safely and reliably across the country the local distribution system is made up of 14 regional dno companies which deliver electricity at a lower voltage from substations to homes and businesses great britains grid incudes england scotland wales and several surrounding islands northern ireland is part of an islandwide electricity system with the republic of ireland national grid fast facts great britains grid is made up of more than 7000 kilometres of cables 90000 pylons 346 substations and 1500 kilometres of underground cables construction of the grid began on 14 july 1928 and was completed on 5 september 1933 it was originally designed to operate as 7 separate connected grids before a group of rebellion engineers attempted to run it as one on 29 october 1938  it has run as one grid ever since a decade ago britain had 80 individual points of generation to manage today there are nearly one million all electricity in great britain operates at a frequency of 50hz  a deviation of just 1 above or below could cause damage how is the grid changing as the sources that generate great britains electricity change to include more renewables  the grid has also changed the grid was built to work with large power stations that operate huge spinning turbines with decarbonisation its evolved to include a greater variety of intermittent weather dependent sources such as wind solar and decentralised power sources that serve individual buildings or communities this makes managing the grids stability more complicated and requires the use of more ancillary services usually delivered by flexible generators such as thermal power stations go deeper could great britain go off grid  the great balancing act what it takes to

are ancillary services power generation what are ancillary services ancillary services are a set of processes that enable the transportation of electricity around the grid while keeping the power system operating in a stable efficient and safe way why do we need ancillary services when electricity makes its way through the country it needs to be managed so that the power generation and electricity useage levels are equal the regulating of elements such as frequency and voltage has to be carefully managed so that the massive amounts of electricity moving  or transmitted  are able to be used safely in homes businesses schools and hospitals around the country ancillary services enable the power system to operate in a stable efficient and safe way what do ancillary services offer ancillary services include a wide variety of electrical efficiency and safety nets all focussed on ensuring the power system delivers enough output to meet demand yet remains stable frequency the uks power system runs at a frequency of 50 hertz  to stay balanced it has to remain at that frequency turbines and generators adjust the speed at which they spin automatically to increase or decrease power in line with demand and ensure that the system is kept stable voltage different parts of the uks transmission system use voltages of either 400 275 or 132 kilovolts to ensure that voltage remains within 5 of those figures at all times  to be safe for domestic electricity use power stations can produce or reabsorb excess energy as reactive power  keeping the overall system reliable inertia turbine use is important in keeping the system operating in its current state even with disruptions and sudden changes the electricity system uses the weight of heavy spinning turbines to create stability  acting as dampeners and smoothing out unexpected changes in frequency across the network reserve an important part of ancillary servicing is making sure that there are no surprises  so holding back power to release if something unexpected happens means that the network can function confidently knowing that there are generators and other power providers such as pumped hydro storage waiting ready to back it up who manages ancillary services in the uk the grids stability is managed by national grid electricity system operator eso  a separate company of national grid electricity transmission et  the eso works with ancillary service providers to either sign longterm contracts or make short term requests for a service these partners are often power stations such as drax power station which have large spinning turbines capable of controlling voltage frequency providing inertia and serving as a source of reserve power what is the future of ancillary services as we move to a more renewable system as the uks electricity system continues to change so to do its requirements for different ancillary services the switch from a few very large power stations to a greater variety of different electricity sources some of which may be dependent on the weather as well as changes in how the country uses electricity means there is a greater need for ancillary services to keep the grid stable these services have historically been delivered by thermal power stations but new innovations are enabling wind turbines to provide inertial response and overcome changes in frequency and batteries to store reserve power that can then be supplied to the power system to ensure balance ancillary services fast facts batteries can in some cases be cheaper ancillary alternatives to conventional sources of energy the hornsdale power reserve which runs on a tesla battery in south australia lowered the price of frequency ancillary services by 90 after just four months of use ancillary services usually work from habit knowing when to slow electricity production or increase supply based around the general publics standard working hours  dinner time and the early morning rush but during the covid19 lockdown  electricity consumption on weekdays fell by 13 and so national grid eso had to intervene with ancillary services to keep the lights on every year the esos ancillary services move 300 terawatt hours twh of electricity which is equal to 4 trillion kettles boiling at once  with recent innovations around renewable energies there are a wider variety of ways for ancillary services to generate power go deeper balancing for the renewable future ancillary services  greening the grid maintaining electricity grid stability through rapid decarbonisation

transformers work 17 july 2020 power generation getting electricity safely and efficiently from generators through power lines and across the country into our devices is a careful balancing act one of the vital aspects of this is the voltage an electrical substation with transformers the national grids transmission lines work at a voltage of 400000 volts v and 275000v but if electricity were to enter homes at this voltage it would quickly damage anything it powered instead regional distributors deliver electricity into homes at a much lower level of 230v achieving a voltage level thats safe to use requires stepping it up or down through transformers  huge pieces of electrical grid equipment that use a simple idea to have a big impact why we need transformers voltage is like water pressure having high voltage transmission lines means the charged electrons that make up electricity are moving very efficiently through the system with less energy being lost as heat along the way however that same pressure is too much for just charging a phone it would likely overload the devices circuits and leave the user with a smouldering mess thats where transformers step in electricity is produced at a variety of voltages around great britain depending on different types of generation in order to send it to where the demand is without losing too much energy as heat along the journey  a transformer attached to large power generators such as draxs biomass power plant or beatrice offshore wind farm increases the voltage to 400000v or 275000v the voltage depends on what part of the national transmission system the power station is connected to when the electricity arrives via pylons at a particular region of great britain another transformer brings the voltage down to 132000v for the regional distribution system subsequently another reduces it to 11000v in towns and villages before a final transformer reduces the voltage to a safe 230v for use in homes and businesses keeping the voltage high is useful in preventing energy loss to heat but it also does something else important to the electricity shooting around the country keeping voltage high to cut down current if voltage is the water pressure then current is the actual water particles moving through the pipes in electrical terms the current is the charged electrons that actually power our lights and devices when these electrons travel along the electricity grids cables they face resistance imagine a partial blockage in a water pipe this causes some electrical energy to be lost to heat getting the right amount of electricity needed around the country means keeping energy loss as low as possible if the current is lower fewer charged electrons are bumping into resistance at any one point in the system and less electrical energy is being lost conveniently for the grid raising the voltage of electricity causes the current to decrease and vice versa how transformers actually do this is all a matter of coils transformer at cruachan power station winding voltage up and down transformers work using the principal of electromagnetic induction something the british scientist michael faraday first realised in 1831 he noticed that when a magnet moved through a coil of copper wires a current flowed through those wires its this same principal that enables spinning turbines to generate electricity today  michael faraday similarly when a current flows through a copper coil wrapped around an iron core the core becomes magnetic  faraday did experiment with running currents through multiple copper coils but it was scientist and irish priest father nicholas callan who in 1836 discovered the underlying principal of many of the worlds transformers today he found if two separate sets of copper wires were wound around each end of an iron core and an electrical current was passed through one of them the primary winding then a magnetic field is created that causes an electric current to flow in the secondary winding however things change depending on how many times each wire is wound around the core if there are more turns in the secondary winding than the primary one then when a current is induced the voltage increases when there are fewer turns in the secondary winding than the primary the voltage decreases callans induction coil 1845 moreover father callan discovered that the increase or decrease in voltage is directly proportional to the number of turns in the windings so theoretically if an electrical current with a voltage of 5v is passed through a primary winding with 10 turns and creates a current in a secondary winding with 20 turns the voltage will also double in this case to 10v father callans invention is known as an induction coil where the two sets of windings share a long thick iron rod since then the transformer has undergone continual revision optimisation and specialisation for different use cases however the underlying principal of using electromagnetic induction to increase and decrease voltage remains the same from homes to power stations one of the most common types of transformers are distribution transformers  the kind often found on utility poles near homes these transformers perform the final step down from local distribution systems to 230v as the electricity enters homes and businesses these often use an iron core that takes the form of a hollow square with windings wrapped around both ends when a current passes through and magnetises the core it causes it to expand and contract in a process known as magnetostriction which sometimes causes enough vibration to produce an audible hum  a transformer being moved from longannet to cruachan power station in 2019 in these type of transformers its safe for the current to be transferred through the air between the two windings but when higher voltages are being used such as at cruachan power station  the biggest pumped storage facility in scotland  different approaches are needed large power stationscale transformers are submerged in a special insulating oil inside a metal container  the oil provides electrical insulation to prevent short circuits while also cooling the core and windings preventing damage and failure even as the main sources of great britains electricity change from coal and nuclear power stations to wind farms and solar panels transformers will remain an essential part of the grid in getting the right amount of power to where we need it  fast tags electricity generation  electricity system balancing and ancillary services under lockdown every day is a sunday iain staffell imperial college london 21 may 2020 opinion on march 23rd the uk took an unprecedented move to tackle the coronavirus most business that had not already closed moved online with millions of people now working from home this had a huge impact on electricity demand consumption on weekdays fell by 13 to its lowest levels since 1982  a time when there were 10 million fewer people in the country and gdp was a third lower than today other regions have seen a similar collapse in electricity demand spain italy and france have all seen electricity demand fall by 1015 according to analysis by ember  across the atlantic new york city has seen similar reductions demand has fallen for a simple reason with schools and workplaces now closed or running with a greatly reduced staff  machinery computers lights and heaters are not drawing power electric rail tram and tube systems are also running a reduced service on the contrary with more people at home household electricity consumption has increased octopus energy estimate that during social distancing before the stricter lockdown came into effect homes were consuming up to a third more electricity adding 20 per month to the typical bill the impact of lockdown on britains electricity demand is much like living through a month of sundays  the average profile for a march weekend day in previous years looks very similar to the daily profile for weekdays since lockdown begun  both in the amount of electricity consumed and the structure postlockdown weekends have even lower demand tracking 11 below weekday demand people no longer have to get up at the crack of dawn for work on a typical weekday morning demand would rise by 10 gw over two hours from 530 to 730 am now it takes more than twice as long  until midday  for this rise to occur at the other end of the day there would normally be a small peak in demand around 8 pm from people gathering in pubs and restaurants up and down the country both on weekdays and weekends demand begins falling earlier in the evening as the sofa has become the only available social venue with lower demand comes lower power prices wholesale electricity prices are typically 7 lower on sundays than on weekdays for this reason march saw the lowest monthlyaverage power price in 12 years down onethird on this month last year prices were already heading downwards because of the falling price of gas but the lockdown has amplified this and negative prices have become commonplace during the middle of the day there was not a visible impact on carbon emissions during the first quarter of the year as only the last week of march was affected however as lockdown continued into april and may emissions from power production in britain have fallen by 35 on the same period last year the effect is slightly stronger across europe with carbon emissions falling almost 40 as dirtier coal and lignite power stations are being turned down will some of these effects persist after lockdown restrictions are eased it is too early to tell as it depends on what longlasting economic and behavioural changes occur electricity demand is linked with the countrys gdp which is set to face the largest downturn in three centuries  whether the economy bounces back or is afflicted with a lasting depression will be key to future electricity demand it will also depend on behavioural shifts people are of course craving their lost freedoms many may appreciate not going back to a lengthy daily commute  and the rise of

services  covid19 what makes a countrys electricity system stable 23 december 2019 power generation how reliable is great britains electricity system across the country electricity is accessible and safe to use for just about everyone every day widescale blackouts are very rare but they do happen on 9 august 2019 a power cut saw more than 1 million people and services lose power for just under an hour it was the first largescale blackout since 2013 although this proves the network is not infallible the fact it was such an outlier in the normal performance of the grid highlights its otherwise exemplary stability and reliability but what is it exactly that makes an electricity system stable and reliable at its core system stability comes down to two key factors a country or regions ability to generate enough electricity and its ability to then transport it through a transmission system to where its needed when everything is running smoothly an electricity system is described as being balanced  in this state supply meets demand exactly and all necessary conditions  such as voltage and frequency  are right for the safe and efficient transport of electricity any slight deviation or mismatch across any of these factors can cause power stations or infrastructure to trip and cut off power a recent report by electric insights identified the countries around the world with most reliable power systems in which the uk was fourth it offers an insight into what factors contribute to building a stable system as well as those that hold some countries back generation and reliable infrastructure according to the report france has the most reliable electricity system of any country with a population of more than five million people having gone a decade without a power outage one reason for this is the countrys fleet of 58 statecontrolled nuclear power stations which generate huge amounts of consistent baseload power in 2017 nuclear power made up more than 70 of frances electricity generation while hydropower accounted for another 10 of the 475 terawatt hours twh consumed across the county that year penly nuclear power station near dieppe france now as its nuclear stations age france is increasing its renewable power generation as these sources are often weather dependent imports from and exports to its neighbours are expected to become a more important part of keeping the french network stable at times when there is little sunlight or wind  or too much importing and exporting electricity is also key to switzerlands power system third most reliable network on the list with 41 bordercrossing power lines allowing the country to serve as a crossroads for power flowing between italy and germany it means its total imports and exports can often exceed electricity production within the country electricity pylons in switzerland switzerlands mountainous landscape also means ensuring a reliable electricity system requires a carefully maintained transmissions system the swiss grid is 6700 kilometres long and uses 40000 hitech metering points along it to record and process around 10000 data points in seconds  the key to the stability of south korea  the second most stable network on the list  is also its imports but rather than actual megawatts it comes in the form of oil gas and coal the country is the worlds fourth biggest coal importer and its coal power stations account for 42 of its total generation seoul south korea however in the face of urban smog issues and global decarbonisation goals it is pursuing a switch to renewables this can come with repercussions to stability so south korea is also investing in transmission infrastructure including a new interconnector from the east of the country to seoul its main source of electricity consumption it highlights that if decarbonisation is going to accelerate at the pace needed to meet paris agreement targets then many of the worlds most stable and reliable electricity systems need to go through significant change balance will be needed between meeting decarbonisation targets with overall system stability however there are many countries around the world that focus less on ensuring consistent stability through decarbonisation and are instead more focused on how to achieve stability in the first place stalling generation the democratic republic of congo is the eleventhlargest country on earth it is rich with minerals and resources yet it is the least electrified nation just 9 of people have access to power in rural areas that number drops to just 1 and the country suffers blackouts more than once a month as a result of load shedding when there isnt enough power to meet demand so parts of the grid are deliberately shut down to prevent the entire system failing currently the country has just 27 gw of installed electricity capacity 25 gw of which comes from hydropower  the countrys inga dam facility on the congo river has the potential to generate more electricity than any other single source of power on the planet its thought the proposed grand inga site could produce as much as 40 gw  twice that of chinas three gorges dam and provide electricity to a massive part of southern africa a legacy of political instability in the country however has so far made securing financing difficult congo river democratic republic of congo nigeria is one of the worlds fastest growing economies and with that comes rapidly rising demand for electricity however just 45 of the country is currently electrified and of these areas many still suffer outages at least once a month the country has 125 gw of installed capacity most of which comes from thermal gas stations but technical problems in power stations and infrastructure mean it is often only capable of generating as much as 5 gw to transmit on to end consumers this limited production capability means it often fails to meet demand resulting in outages the problem has been prolonged by struggling utility companies that are unable to make the investments needed to stabilise electricity supply keen to resolve what it has referenced as an energy supply crisis the nigerian government recently secured a 1 billion credit line from the world bank to improve access to electricity across the country the investment will focus in part on securing the transmission system from theft thus allowing the private utility companies to generate the revenue needed to improve generation transmission holding back emerging systems balancing transmissions systems is a crucial part of stable electricity networks maintaining a steady frequency that delivers safe usable electricity into homes and businesses is at the crux of reliability even countries that can generate enough electricity are held back if they cant efficiently get the electricity to where it is needed brazil has an abundance of hydropower installed its 97 gw of hydro accounts for more than 70 of the countrys electricity mix  however the countrys dams are largely concentrated around the amazon basin in the north west whereas demand comes from cities in the south and eastern coastline transporting electricity across long distances between generator and consumer makes it difficult to maintain the correct voltage and frequency needed to keep a stable and reliable flow of electricity as a result brazil suffers a blackout every onetothree months hydropower plant henry borden in the serra do mar brazil the country is tackling its transmissions problems by diversifying its electricity mix to include greater levels of solar and wind off its east coast  closer to many of its major cities the country has also looked to new technology for solutions at the start of the decade as much as 8 of all electricity being generated in brazil was being stolen  reaching as high as 40 in some areas these illegal hookups both damage infrastructure making it less reliable as well as blur the true demand making grid management challenging brazil has since deployed smart meters to measure electricitys journey from power stations to end users more accurately allowing operators to spot anomalies sooner electricity theft is a major problem in many developing regions with as much as 10 billion worth of power lost each year in india which suffers blackouts as often as brazil it highlights that even when there is generation to meet demand maintaining stability at a large scale requires constant attention and innovation as new challenges arise this looks different around the world some countries might face challenges in shifting from stable thermalbased systems to renewables others are attempting to build stability into newly connected networks but no matter where in the world electricity is being used ensuring reliability is an everongoing task electric insights is commissioned by drax and delivered by a team of independent academics from imperial college london

rapid decarbonisation 13 november 2019 power generation great britains electricity system is in the middle of a revolution where power supply was once dominated by some big thermal coal gas and nuclear power stations  it now comes from an array of sources thousands of new individual points have been added to the mix ranging from large interconnectors that bring in power from neighbouring countries through to wind farms solar panels small gas and diesel engines the energy mix has been changing radically with low carbon sources expected to provide 58 of great britains power by 2020  up from 22 in 2010 and 53 in 2018  however the security standards at which the electricity grid needs to be operated remain the same these are predominantly voltage and frequency and nominally 230 v and 50hz for a domestic consumer the operation of the transmission system including maintaining these standards is overseen by the national grid electricity system operator eso using a set of vital tools it needs to have available known as ancillary services some of this capability was inherent in large generators which could provide the ancillary services required to keep a stable transmission system maintaining system stability with thousands of generation points  a large part of which are not directly controllable  is increasingly challenging click graphic to viewdownload ancillary services enable electricity to reach the end customer when and where it is required in a safe manner within acceptable quality standards in addition to managing voltage and frequency levels these standards also include maintaining adequate reserves to accommodate demand forecast uncertainties generator breakdown and system faults 1 as the electricity mix changes so must the process by which these services are secured a diverse set of existing and genuinely new solutions will be needed to keep the lights on in the net zero carbon future three steps to creating the right environment for a stable resilient future grid 1 make the value of ancillary services transparent in order for companies to help the eso be they generators or other service providers it must be open and transparent about whats needed to maintain grid stability and build resilience for the future the eso is the only buyer in the ancillary services market and is wellpositioned to understand how the system is evolving it should be proactively flagging how its needs may evolve in the future so that the market can develop solutions to meet them says marcelo torres draxs regulation manager  markets certain ancillary services still dont have their own competitive markets and are provided as a byproduct of the generation of electricity an example is reactive power  for which there are no developed functioning regional markets yet generally all power stations connected to the transmission network with a generation capacity of over 50mw are required to have the capability to provide this service at a default price that may not reflect its real value to the system another example is inertia  provided today largely through the heavy spinning turbines of thermal and pumpedstorage hydro stations which serve as stored energy that can slow down or smooth out sudden changes in network frequency if ancillary services were valued explicitly market participants would have an insight into how much they are actually worth to the eso and the grids stability which would in turn incentivise new competitive products to reach the market torres points to technologies such as synchronous compensators  which are machines capable of providing ancillary services including inertia and reactive power without generating potentially unneeded electricity click graphic to viewdownload these solutions will enable more renewables to connect safely to the network at a lower cost to consumers for these solutions to come forward ascribing the right value to ancillary services will be key without clear price signals there is a risk of underinvestment in those technologies that provide the services needed potentially resulting in price shocks for consumers the eso is moving in the right direction with its recent network development pathfinder projects it has accelerated this work launching its first ever tender for inertia and should roll out similar initiatives gbwide such procurements should align with existing investment signals such as those provided by the capacity market  this should allow for the right type of capacity to be built where it is most needed delivering a secure and resilient grid 2 create market confidence constructing the machinery and infrastructure that will enable the eso to operate a carbonfree system will require major financial investment as well as years to plan and build says torres this can only be achieved if ofgem designs the esos incentives in a way that rewards it for taking bold strategic initiatives that have the potential to deliver good value for money to consumers in the longterm evidence of this working is shown in the success of offshore wind which now provide around a sixth of great britains electricity at record low prices this is partly due to the government providing offshore wind developers with revenue stabilisation mechanisms known as  contracts for difference  cfds this is not a new concept for government and regulators around the world looking to enable investment in energy infrastructure financing renewables to achieve decarbonisation is enabled through cfds or marketled hedging tools like power purchase agreements  investment to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet peak demand is secured through longterm contracts competitively awarded through the capacity market similarly investment in interconnection is supported through ofgems cap  floor regime subsidy isnt required for investment in ancillary services whats needed says torres is a clear and stable market framework designed around the systems needs which provides a mix of short and longterm signals more certainty over the market landscape and the expected returns will lower the risk of these investments and get the solutions needed at a lower overall cost to consumers longterm procurement is not the right answer everywhere where there is already a mature and liquid market such as the case for frequency response buying services closer to real time makes sense for two reasons first it allows prices to reflect more accurately the market conditions and therefore the real value of a service at the time when it is needed second it allows a wider range of resources to participate in the market increasing competition striking the right balance between short and longterm procurement is key to create a sustainable ancillary services market currently the eso requests that electricitygeneration firms commit to supplying a certain amount of power for the purpose of frequency response a month ahead of time for resources such as wind farms or solar which are dependent on the weather this makes it extremely difficult for them to enter this market even for conventional large thermal generators it can be a problem as many of them do not know how or if they will be running beyond a few days the eso is currently conducting some trials procuring frequency response one week in advance while this is an improvement it is still too long a lead time for intermittent sources or demandside response which ideally need dayahead or almost real time auctions to unlock their full potential says torres the ancillary services market has been through a prolonged period of change since the eso published its system needs and product strategy in 2017  without knowing how the market landscape will look like by the end of these reforms its difficult for providers to develop the right solutions a shift in thinking which considers what the electricity network might require in the future  and how to provide the market with financial incentives to make it a reality is needed a resilient stable future system is to the advantage of consumers 3 diversify there will be no silver bullet that can solve all the challenges the energy transition poses maintaining system reliability in a high renewables world will require large amounts of dispatchable power with different response time and duration from small batteries and demandside response that will manage instantaneously frequency fluctuations  through to large pumped storage hydro plants that will provide backup power during the days when the wind wont blow and the sun wont shine a framework structured around the systems different needs should aim at harnessing flexibility across a range of technologies and sizes source the road to 2050 the need for flexibility in a high renewables world  by ana barillas aurora 2019 truly diversifying will also involve unlocking the flexibility potential on the distribution grid to achieve this the way that access to the distribution network is managed and paid for will need to evolve today with big parts of the distribution network being congested small flexible assets are asked to wait in the queue for several years or face disproportionate amount of network reinforcement costs to get connected machine hall cruachan power station the ongoing review of the network access and forwardlooking charging arrangements needs to address these barriers soon if we are serious about making use of flexibility to foster the energy transition while keeping consumer bills as low as possible since 2018 gbs distribution network operators dnos have been tendering and procuring for various flexibility services to manage congestion in regional electricity grids in 2019 they published a roadmap setting out the steps they intend to take to enable a smarter and more flexible energy system as we transition from dnos towards distribution system operation  a wider set of functions and services to run a smart distribution grid  the regional networks will be open to marketbased flexibility solutions dsos will be able to compete on a level playing field offering options for network reinforcement as dnos move from trials to more structured flexibility procurement harmonisation and effective coordination with the national markets will be the key prerequisites to reveal the true value that flexibility can bring to the energy system argues torres to build a modern and resilient grid we will need a wider lens on whats possible its going to be an exciting journey on the road to net zero this story is part of a series
