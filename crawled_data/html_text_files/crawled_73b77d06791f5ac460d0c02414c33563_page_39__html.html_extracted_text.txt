New tech to tackle climate change could fuel UK economy post-Brexit
28 March 2019
Press releases

Speaking at the ‘Fuelling an economy fit for the future’ panel event at the British Chambers of Commerce
annual conference
in London on Thursday March 28, Mr Gardiner said that we can create the zero-carbon economy that provides sustainable jobs and new opportunities in areas that have suffered industrial decline, whilst at the same time meeting our climate change objectives.
Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group. Click to view high resolution photo.
Mr Gardiner said:
“Climate change is the greatest challenge the world now faces – but it is also creating major new investment and job opportunities, which could be transformational after Brexit.
“Globally, by 2030, estimates show that the economic opportunity from creating a zero-carbon economy is upwards of £20 trillion – and the UK is ideally placed to drive the innovation required to take advantage of this.
“We’re already leading the world when it comes to decarbonising power generation – we’ve done more than any other country to remove coal from the grid. We must continue to drive innovation, to deliver further social, economic and environmental benefits through new technologies like carbon capture and storage, smart meters and electric vehicles.”
Drax has converted two thirds of the UK’s biggest power station at Drax in North Yorkshire from coal to use sustainable biomass, making it the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe – delivering carbon savings of more than 80%.
Wood pellet storage dome at Drax Power Station (centre) and chimney (left). A BECCS pilot is underway to show that 90% of the carbon dioxide emissions could be captured, stored or re-used. Click to view high resolution photo.
It now has ambitions to become the world’s first negative emissions power station by using bioenergy carbon capture and storage technology. Its BECCS pilot plant
is the world’s first to capture carbon dioxide from a 100% biomass feedstock
. If it can be scaled up, the power produced could help reduce the harmful gases accumulating in the atmosphere which cause climate change.
Humber Bridge
Mr Gardiner explained that Drax is working with the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership, and other interested parties to explore the role carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) can play in turning the Humber Estuary into the world’s first ‘net-zero-carbon cluster’ by 2040.
“The Humber is strategically important – it is the most carbon intensive industrial cluster in the UK. The deployment of a new technology like CCUS could be most transformational there – reducing carbon emissions, extending the life of carbon intensive businesses, protecting jobs and creating growth,”
Mr Gardiner explained.
“New technologies are already transforming the way we live and work – they are changing businesses and communities, and have the potential to improve everyone’s quality of life as well as Britain’s ability to compete in a global economy.
We are funding a PhD at Sheffield University — customer interaction with vehicle to grid systems using smart technology.
“Electricity demand could increase by around 25% compared to today, as households and businesses switch to electric vehicles and electric heating. We need to ensure that this electric revolution is powered by clean, green electricity that provides a more sustainable economy for future generations.”
Drax Group is also the UK’s biggest supplier of renewable electricity to businesses through Haven Power and Opus Energy, its B2B energy supply businesses.
It supplies electricity to 396,000 business premises and is looking at ways in which batteries, smart technologies and EVs can deliver economic benefits for its customers.

Editor’s Notes
Will Gardiner is speaking at the
British Chambers of Commerce annual conference
panel event at 11.40am on Thursday March 28, 2019, titled:
“Fuelling an economy fit for the future’.
The British Chambers of Commerce includes 53 accredited Chambers which make up its network representing tens of thousands of businesses of all shapes and sizes, which employ almost six million people across the UK.
The New Climate Economy
report by
The Global Commission on the Climate and Economy states that analysis showed that ‘bold action could yield a direct economic gain of US$26 trillion through to 2030 compared with business-as-usual. And this is likely to be a conservative estimate’.
BECCS is a vital technology in the fight against climate change. The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering have estimated that BECCS could enable the UK to capture approximately 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050 – around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that we will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.
Power generation with BECCS could also provide essential system services to the UK power grid, meaning a more secure, cost-effective electricity system.
The Humber is ideally located for accessing offshore stores for carbon dioxide in the North Sea such as the Endurance field, which is roughly 60 miles off the coast.
AS well as working with the Humber LEP Drax is in discussions with the BBPA about the possibility of its members using the carbon captured to help keep the fizz in the drinks industry and it is looking at how its CO
2
could be used in the creation of synthetic fuels.
Drax Power Station is the largest renewable power generator in the country – producing enough renewable electricity for more than four million households.
The conversion of two thirds of the power station from coal to use sustainable biomass has played an important role in enabling the UK’s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world, whilst maintaining secure supplies for the millions of homes and businesses which rely on it.
More renewables, like wind and solar, are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and helping us to meet our climate targets – but flexible, lower carbon generation, is also vital for controlling the costs of maintaining a stable, low carbon power system.
The IPCC recognised in its
special report
last year that to meet our climate change targets, up to 85% of global power generation needs to come from renewables by 2050. This means the remainder will have to be provided by flexible sources, which can support the system and help to keep costs down – such as biomass, hydro, pumped storage as well as high efficiency gas.
About Drax
Drax Group’s ambition is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Its 2,600-strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies six percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
B2B supply:
Drax owns two B2B energy supply businesses:
Haven Power, based in Ipswich, supplies electricity and energy services to large Industrial and Commercial sector businesses.
Opus Energy, based in Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, provides electricity, energy services and gas to small and medium sized (SME) businesses.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.

STEM subjects get revved up with electric cars from Drax
25 March 2019
Press releases

School pupils and college students from Selby could move into pole position when it comes to boosting their skills by taking part in a city centre electric car race – thanks to an exciting new initiative from the UK’s biggest power station.
Teams from six schools and a college from Selby, North Yorkshire, will build and race their own electric cars as part of Drax Group’s initiative to encourage young people to study STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) subjects, helping create the skilled workforce businesses need for the region’s economy to thrive.
Drax is investing £35,000 to support the schools and college near its North Yorkshire power station, including providing them with the car kits, as well as the tools and equipment needed to build them.
Engineers from the power station will also spend time with each of the seven teams to help assemble the cars and learn how to drive them ahead of a city centre race in Hull, on April 28, organised by the Greenpower Education Trust and sponsored by Drax.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“Inspiring young people to study STEM subjects is the key to ensuring the next generation of potential employees has the skills that businesses like ours need. A skilled workforce will enable Drax and other businesses in the North to continue to grow, building a strong regional economy with thriving communities.
“We’re really excited about working with the schools on their electric vehicles. Seeing all the students from Selby with their cars on the starting grid in Hull is going to be a really proud moment for us – and who knows, maybe one or two of them will see the chequered flag.”
The Northern Powerhouse Partnership has published reports on social mobility including its
Educating the North
and
Next Steps for the Northern Powerhouse
.
Northern Powerhouse Partnership Director Henri Murison welcomed Drax’s latest scheme. He said:
“This initiative by Drax to inspire students of all ages is a brilliant way to bring STEM subjects to life and make their studies even more relevant to the highly-skilled jobs available in industries here in the North.
“Our research and that by the Children’s Commissioner, Anne Longfield, has shown that too many children in the North are falling behind their counterparts in other areas of the UK, leading to a serious skills shortage for employers.  Talents are not being fulfilled when those growing up in the North enter the world of work. We need more Northern Powerhouse employers and their employees to give their time to provide inspirational experiences for young people, like this one at Drax, keeping working class boys engaged by what they are learning whilst breaking the glass ceiling for girls and young women.”
Four primary schools – Barwic Parade, Camblesforth, Selby Community and Selby Abbey – receive a 15mph Goblin G2 battery-powered car, which will arrive in flat-pack form ready to be assembled by the students and teachers.
Older students from Selby High School, Holy Family Catholic High School and Selby College will build the more powerful Formula 24 car, which can reach speeds of up to 30mph.
Both types of car take around 15 hours to build, with the teams also being required to design their own bodywork.
They will all have assistance from Drax employees, who will help the students to learn about battery power, engine gearing and how a car works.
Liz Ridley, Deputy Principal, Selby College said:
“Being able to give some of our students the opportunity to build their own electric vehicle and then race it is incredibly exciting and a great way to get them engaged in STEM learning.
“Meeting people from Drax and working alongside them to build the cars is giving the students important insights, bringing the world of work to life. The race day will be a fantastic experience for everyone involved.”
Once the schools have built their electric vehicles, the students will take on competitors from across the country, in the race around the streets of Hull in April.
The project is part of Drax’s education programme, which aims to encourage more people, including female students, to study STEM subjects and increase the opportunities they have to secure skilled jobs.

Editor’s Notes
The race in Hull will take place on April 28, when there will be two sets of events featuring the Selby school teams:
The primary school teams will take part in a series of drag and slalom races in their Goblin cars. The top drivers from each team will then race against each other in a final 1km circuit through the city centre.
Students from the secondary schools and colleges will race the F24 cars around the same circuit in an endurance test, with the winner being the team which can complete the most laps in 90 minutes. The teams will need to switch between three drivers and maintain their cars during the race.

New rapid response gas power station approved in Bedfordshire
Press releases

The 299MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) power station, at Rookery South Pit near the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook and Marston Moretaine will be able to go from cold to full load in less than 20 minutes, enabling it to respond quickly to support the grid.
Once operational, it will run for up to 1,500 hours a year, providing flexible, reliable power, when it’s needed most and system support services – contributing to a balanced and cost-effective electricity system, maintaining supplies for up to 150,000 homes.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“Securing this approval from the Secretary of State is a crucial step in ensuring development of the new gas generation the UK needs to provide flexible power and system support services to the electricity grid as part of the country’s transition to a low carbon economy.
“Rapid response gas power stations are agile enough to ramp up quickly and support the grid at times of peak demand, making them highly complementary to intermittent renewable sources of power, like wind and solar. Flexible, reliable power stations like this are essential to provide the power Britain’s homes, businesses, transport and infrastructure need.”
Millbrook Power Station will cost up to £90m to build, with around 150 jobs created during the two-year construction phase. It could be generating power as soon as 2022, subject to it securing a capacity market agreement from the government.
Drax applied for a Development Consent Order for Millbrook Power in 2018 with extensive community consultation as part of the planning and consenting process. Drax Group will continue to engage with communities local to the project as the project progresses.

Giant airship’s centenary inspires celebratory STEM event
6 March 2019
Press releases

The huge R33 airship took to the skies for the first time on March 6, 1919 after being built at Barlow, next to Drax Power Station, near Selby.
It was the last of three giant airships to be built in the village, which was at the forefront of the British aviation industry for ten years from the First World War.
The R33 was one of a small number of so-called ‘gas bags’ flown by the Royal Naval Air Service – it clocked up more than 237 hours of flying time and was in service for 10 years, completing military and civilian tasks including being used by the police to monitor traffic.
Leading the way in aviation technology, the R33 took innovation to new levels when it was used to trial launching pilotless biplanes from underneath its huge canopy.
The site of the workshop where the R33 was designed and built is now known as the Barlow Mound, which is on the edge of the 350-acre Skylark Nature Reserve created by Drax, next to the power station.
On April 24 youngsters will be able to build a replica R33 airship at a special workshop being held at the Skylark Nature Reserve. The event is part of the energy company’s efforts to encourage young people to consider studying science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).
Andy Koss Drax Power CEO said:
“Barlow is a small village, but it played a vital role in developing and building these airships a century ago.
“We want to use this anniversary to inspire a new generation to consider studying STEM subjects and develop the skills businesses like ours need to continue to grow, helping to build a strong regional economy in the north.”
To find out more about the replica airship event – follow
Drax Group on Facebook
As well as encouraging more people, including female students, to study STEM subjects, Drax has also announced that it will increase the number of apprentices it is taking on this year to 12 – doubling the number of apprenticeships available in the past two years.

.
The R33 earned itself a reputation for being the luckiest airship after it survived two almost disastrous incidents: Firstly it was ripped open during a flight in 1921 and then was torn free from its moorings in high winds, drifted out to sea and had to be guided back to land by its crew.
Its luck ran out when the airships’ popularity declined. It was dismantled in 1928
The Barlow workshop and site was sold by the airship’s builders, Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co Ltd in 1920 and was turned into a military site, before it became part of Drax in 1980.

Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
B2B supply:
Drax owns two B2B energy supply businesses:
Haven Power, based in Ipswich, supplies electricity and energy services to large Industrial and Commercial sector businesses.
Opus Energy, based in Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, provides electricity, energy services and gas to small and medium sized (SME) businesses.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.

Environmental Permit issued for Millbrook Power
4 March 2019
Press releases

The permit gives Millbrook Power licence to operate its proposed gas project, subject to complying with the relevant national and European directives that set the requirements for environmental protection.
The decision was reached following consultation with the public and relevant stakeholders and is another step forward in the development of the project.
A separate decision to grant a Development Consent Order for the project is expected in later this month.
Further details on the Environmental Permit granted to Millbrook Power can be found on the
UK government’s website

New opportunities created by multi award-winning power station rail project
Press releases

The partnership between Drax Power Station, near Selby, in North Yorkshire and Davis Wagon Services saw a new fleet of freight wagons designed and built by WH Davis Ltd to deliver the biomass needed to produce renewable electricity for millions of homes.
It also enabled Davis Wagon Services, a North Lincolnshire-based rail firm, to invest £850,000 in revamping a mothballed Ferrybridge rail yard as a dedicated site to rebrand and maintain the power station’s fleet of 225 unique freight wagons, securing local jobs in the process.
The project has now won the Asset Management and Excellence category in the Rail Business Awards – its second accolade in the last six months – and the Managing Directorof Davis Wagon Services says that, due to the backing from Drax, there are now opportunities to extend the maintenance work at Ferrybridge, creating more jobs.
“I’m immensely proud of the team here and at Drax for what we have achieved working together,”
said John Hall, MD of Davis.
“The success of the project has given huge confidence to our people and the business. We can now look at fully utilising the yard and taking on heavier maintenance, which could reduce the need to outsource work.
“That would bring immediate benefits both in reducing our carbon footprint, as we could do the work on-site, so we wouldn’t have to send wagons elsewhere, and also in securing the employment we currently have and creating more roles in the future.”
L-R Jake Berry, Andy Koss and John Hall.
Drax Power CEO Andy Koss said:
“I’m delighted this project is receiving the industry recognition it deserves.
“Not only has it supported a local business and revitalised a disused facility within the Northern Powerhouse region, but these rail wagons also play a vital role in helping to ensure Drax receives the biomass we need to produce renewable electricity for millions of homes and businesses.”
The Rail Business Award is the second accolade the project has won, having been named Project of the Year by industry body the Rail Freight Group last September.

Editor’s Notes
The rail project – described as a ‘
Northern Powerhouse success story’
last year by government minister Jake Berry – began in 2011 when Drax appointed WH Davis, along with Lloyds Register Rail (Ricardo) to design and develop bespoke rail wagons to ferry biomass to the power station, the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
It also saw Davis Wagon Services take on the work to maintain the 225 wagons and the firm is now rebranding the fleet over the next 18 months with new livery featuring both Drax and the Northern Powerhouse logos.
Since converting two thirds of its generators to use biomass instead of coal, Drax Power Station has become the largest decarbonisation project in Europe – it now produces enough renewable electricity for four million homes.
The majority of the biomass Drax uses comes from North America and Europe on ships to ports on the east and west coasts of the UK (Immingham, Hull, Port of Tyne and Liverpool). It is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail.
Drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day (over a six-day working week) in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 15 per cent of the UK’s renewable electricity.
Each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the UK with enough electricity for a year.
The fuel is transported to Drax via rail rather than road, to further reduce carbon emissions, as it is more efficient than road transportation. Using rail saves approximately 270,000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 32,622.50 tonnes of C02 per year.
Independent research by Oxford Economics using 2017 data showed that Drax supported over 17,500 jobs across the country – more than 6,000 of which were across the North of England (Yorkshire and Humber, North West and North East). In addition Drax generated £600m for the Northern Powerhouse regional economy and £1.6 billion for the whole of the UK.
