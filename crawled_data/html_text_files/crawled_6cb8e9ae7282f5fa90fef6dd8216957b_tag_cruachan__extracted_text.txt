cruachan getting britain ready for the next generation of energy projects 15 july 2022 power generation key takeaways as the uk continues to expand its renewable capacity the cost of curtailing wind generation at times of low demand is increasing adding 806 million to bills over the last two years curtailment costs arise from the grid paying to turn down generation due to energy balancing or system balancing issues longduration storage such as pumped storage hydro offers a way to absorb excess wind power reducing the cost of keeping the system balanced draxs plans to expand cruachan power station would increase the amount of excess power it can absorb from 400 mw to over one gigawatt and rapidly deliver the same amount back to the grid when needed new financial mechanisms such as a cap and floor regime are needed to enable investors to back capitalintensive longterm projects that will save consumers and the grid millions meeting big ambitions takes big actions and therere few ambitions as big or as urgent as achieving a net zero power sector by 2035 this energy transition must mean more low carbon power sources and fewer fossil fuels but delivering that future requires new ways of managing power balancing the grid and a new generation of technologies innovation and thinking to make big projects a reality as the system evolves and more renewables particularly wind come online the uk is forecast to need 10 times more energy storage to deliver power when windlevels drop as well as absorb excess electricity when supply outstrips demand and to maintain grid stability pumped hydro storage offers a tried and tested solution but with no new longduration storage projects built for almost 40 years in the uk the challenges of bringing longterm projects to fruition are less engineering than they are financial draxs plan to expand cruachan power station to add as much as 600 megawatts mw of additional capacity will help support a renewable more affordable net zero electricity system but government action is needed to unlock a new generation of projects that deliver electricity storage at scale reigning in excess wind power wind is the keystone power source in the uks renewable ambitions wind capacity increased from 54 gw in 2010 to 257 gw in 2021  enough to provide renewable power for almost 20 million homes  and the government aims to increase this to 50 gw by 2030 however wind comes with challenges the volume of electricity being generated must always match the level of demand if there is a spike in electricity demand when there are low windlevels other technologies such as electricity storage or carbonemitting gas power are required to make up the shortfall conversely if there is too much wind power being generated and not enough demand for electricity the grid often has to pay windfarms to stop generating this is known as wind curtailment and its becoming more expensive growing from 300 million during 2020 to more than 500 million in 2021 an independent report by lane clark  peacock lcp by drax found that over the last two years curtailing wind power added 806 million to energy bills in britain there can also be a carbon cost to curtailing wind power as more intermittent renewables come onto the system the grid can become more unstable and difficult to balance in such an event the national grid is required to turn to fossil fuel plants like gas generation that can deliver balancing and ancillary services like inertia voltage control and reserve power that wind and solar cant provide its loselose for everyone says richard gow senior government policy manager at drax consumers are paying money to turn off wind and to turn up gas generation because therere not enough sources of ancillary services on the system or renewable power cant be delivered to where its needed curtailment costs have spiked this year because of gas prices and while they might dip in the next two or three years curtailment costs are only ever going to increase if theres wind power on the system without an increase in storage the cost of managing the system is only going to go up and up source the lcps renewable curtailment and the role of long duration storage report click to viewdownload here  the proposed cruachan 2 expansion would help the grid avoid paying to turn off wind farms by increasing the amount it would be able to absorb from 400 mw to over 1000 mw and rapidly deliver the same amount of zero carbon power back to the grid should wind levels suddenly drop or the grid need urgent balancing adding this kind of capability is a huge engineering project involving huge new underground caverns tunnels and waterways carved out of the rock below ben cruachan however the challenge in such a project lies less with the scale of the engineering than with its financeability from blueprints to real change the original cruachan power stations sixyear construction period began in 1959 the work of digging into the mountainside was carried out by a team of 1300 men known affectionately as the tunnel tigers  armed with hand drills and gelignite explosives in an era before modern health and safety practices engineer working at cruachan power station expanding cruachan in the 21 st century will be quite a different and safer process and one thats practically straightforward there is no reason why we physically couldnt build cruachan 2 says gow detailed engineering work has indicated that this is a very feasible project theres no technological reason or physical constraint that would prevent us it has a large upfront cost and requires drilling into a mountain but the challenge is much more on the financial particularly securing the investment side of the project pumped storage hydro facilities today generate their revenues from three different markets the capacity market where they receive a flat rate per kilowatt they deliver to the grid the wholesale and balancing market where they buy power to store when its abundant and cheap and sell it back to the grid when its needed more valuable and used to support the electricity system operator in matching supply and demand on a secondbysecond basis and through ancillary services contracts dedicated to specific stability services  these available markets present challenges for ambitious capitalintensive projects designed to operate at scale with the exception of the capacity market revenues from these markets are often volatile and difficult to forecast with no longterm contracts available sourcing the investment needed to build projects on the scale of cruachan 2 requires mechanisms to attract investors comfortable with long project development lead times that offer stable low risk rates of return in the longterm cap and floor an approach that can provide sufficient certainty to investors that income will cover the cost of debt and unlock finance for new projects is known as a cap and floor regime with cap and floor a facilitys revenues are subject to minimum and maximum levels if revenues are below the floor consumers would topup revenues while earnings above the cap would be returned to consumers this means investors can secure upfront funding safe in the knowledge of revenue certainty in the long term whilst also offering protection to consumers such an approach wont attract investors looking to make a fast buck but the vital role that it could play in the ongoing future of the uk energy system offers a longterm stable return at the same time the system would save both the grid and energy consumers hundreds of millions of pounds the cap and floor system is also not unique with a similar approach currently used for interconnectors  the submarine cables that physically connect the uks energy system to nearby countries allowing the uk to trade electricity with them this means investors are already familiar with cap and floor structures how they operate and what kind of returns they can expect its not just pumped storage hydro that this could apply to explains gow there are other different largescale longduration storage technologies that this could also apply to it would give us revenue certainty so that we can invest to support the system and reduce the cost of curtailment while ensuring consumers get value for their money the turbine hall inside cruachan power station cruachan was originally only made possible through the advocacy and actions of mp and wartime secretary of state for scotland tom johnston then it was needed to help absorb excess generation from the countrys new fleet of nuclear power stations and release this to meet short term spikes in demand today its renewable wind the system must adapt to for the uk to continue to meet an everchanging energy system the government must be prepared to act and enable projects at scale that bring longterm transformation for a net zero future tags pumped storage  cruachan  cruachan power station  hydroelectric power  energy storage  wind power cruachan power station protecting biodiversity while generating power 1 april 2022 sustainable business key points the scottish highlands are home to a wide variety of landscapes with a wealth of biodiversity that must be preserved cruachan pumped storage hydro station sits within ben cruachan and has operated for nearly 60years without damaging wildlife regular surveys and reporting allow drax to understand the health of different fauna and species over time its promising that even species of bird and insects that are declining in other parts of the uk are regularly spotted around cruachan the expansion of the power station has required and will continue to need careful assessment of the areas biodiversity to minimise any impact the project could cause the scottish highlands are home to some of the uks most stunning natural wonders from dramatic plunging lochs to the craggy ice capped munros the varied landscape holds some of the most biodiverse areas in the uk the regions fauna ranges from red deer to golden eagles while its flora includes the ancient oak and mosscovered forests that make up the temperate rainforest of the atlantic coast preserving these landscapes and the life that thrives in them is crucial to both the environment and economy of the region its the job of roddy davies health safety and environmental advisor at draxs cruachan power station to ensure operations at the site do not damage the natural environment this is a very biodiverse rich environment there are a lot of different species a large variety of natural habitats and plant life says davies its good that we can say weve operated here for nearly 60 years and all of that is still there its testament that we dont have a demonstrable negative effect on the wildlife that lives around us source blue leaf nature energy storage inside a mountain the pumped storage hydro station sits a kilometre inside ben cruachan a munro peak in the western highland region of argyll and bute its not an area you would normally associate with power generation but its perfect for pumped storage hydro the site has two bodies of water at differing elevations loch awe at the bottom and a reservoir at the top allowing cruachan to generate power when its needed as well as absorb electricity when there is an excess on the grid by pumping water back up the mountain storing it until power is needed and helping to keep the grid balanced the subterranean nature of the power station means the massive machinery including the four reversible turbines and the heat and noise they generate is hidden underground features on the surface are limited to a few buildings by the entrance tunnel at the banks of loch awe and the dam which contains the upper reservoir on the slopes of ben cruachan as well as several pylons and cables transporting electricity even the 316metre buttress dam takes the landscape into account when cruachan was built in the 50s and 60s the visual impact of it was very much in the minds of the people who built it and the authorities who approved it the dam is almost impossible to see from a public place explains davies our presence on the surface is very limited all the busy goingson are underground theres lots of noise underground but it doesnt travel outside ensuring that the area surrounding draxs operation continues to function without damaging the surrounding environment is an ongoing process davies deploys annual biodiversity surveys and reporting that gives drax over a decade of information and analysis to help identify trends the wildlife of ben cruachan the cruachan power station biodiversity survey for 2021 is the 11 th completed by blue leaf nature a biodiversity service provider the comprehensive report highlights the incredible diversity of fauna surrounding cruachan some of which are declining in other parts of the country while the majestic red stags found in other parts of the highlands are extremely uncommon around cruachan 2021 was a particularly exciting year for other types of large mammals pine martens  a catsized relative of the weasel  are relatively common appearing alongside red squirrels red foxes and otters badgers were also added to the sites list of species for the first time source blue leaf nature mammals however are exceeded by the range of birds found around cruachan with 53 different species spotted in 2021 of these 17 species appear on the birds of conservation concern fives red list the highest threat status to the uks bird population including the ring ouzel yellowhammer and tree pipet a further 27 appear on the regional international union for the conservation of nature iucn red list of threatened species additionally six of the spotted species are considered endangered including herring gull and northern wheatear and 11 vulnerable by the iucn sightings of these threatened species around cruachan come despite particularly unfavourable weather in 2021 one of the driest aprils on record followed by an exceptionally wet may disrupted the bird breeding season this in turn resulted in a difficult nesting season exacerbated by food shortages due to the weathers effect on insect life in the reports survey of invertebrates 150 different species were recorded in 2021 down from 170 in 2018 however its promising that among cruachans creepycrawlies are many that are in decline elsewhere in the uk with the numbers of some important insect types are increasing dragonfly and damselfly species for example increased from five in the previous survey to nine in 2021 moths and butterflies are particularly important to monitor as davies explains theyre a very strong indicator species for the health and quality of an ecosystem theyre also very sensitive to climatic changes and react quickly to temperature change source blue leaf nature in 2021 78 moth species were recorded around cruachan including one of butterfly conservations noted priority species yellowringed carpet as well as six species that feature on iucns red or amber lists there were 11 butterfly species recorded in 2021 including four priority species as well as two newly spotted species the small copper and the chequered skipper that species in decline around the country are increasingly thriving at cruachan is further testament to the power stations lack of disruption to the environment and as the uks electricity system continues to evolve and cruachan power station with it closely observing the surrounding environment and its inhabitants will become even more important expanding cruachan while preserving nature while cruachan first started generating and storing power in the 1960s its capabilities are becoming ever more critical as the national grid decarbonises and power generation becomes increasingly decentralised this is why drax is undertaking an ambitious project to expand cruachan cruachan 2 would add a further 600 mw of generation capacity to the plant for a total of 104 gw of power by providing stability services to the grid the expansion could enable an additional 300gigawatt hours of renewable power to come online source blue leaf nature the project is epic in scale new underground tunnels and subterranean caverns will house the reversible pumpturbines and will be carved out of the mountain vastly increasing the size of the power station but as with any activity in such a landscape careful planning is essential detailed surveys and assessments of the area are a key requirement for planning approval we need to acknowledge whats here and show that we understand what surveys have found says davies then we have to present our proposals for how we will protect them and mitigate any potential disturbance an advantage of pumped storage hydro is that much of the intensive excavating and construction work will take place underground with little disturbance on the surface cruachan 2 has the added benefit of utilising cruachans existing infrastructure for example it would not require flooding a valley to create a new upper reservoir ultimately cruachans half centuryplus of operation has not damaged or degraded the biodiversity of the western highlands landscape and davies is keen to ensure that legacy is preserved as a company its not just something we have to do we have a moral responsibility to be a responsible operator and look after whats around us view the cruachan power station biodiversity survey 2022 here and find out more about green tourism at cruachan

energy storage plays a crucial role in the uk electricity system by not only providing reserve power for when demand is high but also absorbing excess power when demand is low the uks electricity systems growing dependency on intermittent renewables means the amount of energy storage needed will increase to as much as 30 gw by 2050 there are three different durations of energy storage needed to help balance the grid shortterm daytoday and long term it will take a range of technologies including batteries pumped storage hydro and new approaches to meet the storage demands of a net zero grid when you turn on a lightbulb  in 10 20 or 30 years  the same thing will happen electricity will light up the room but where that electricity comes from will be different as the country moves toward net zero emissions  low carbon and renewable power sources will become the norm however its not as simple as swapping in renewables for the fossil fuels the grid was built around weather dependant sources like wind and solar are intermittent  meaning other sources are needed at times when theres little wind or no sunshine to meet the countrys electricity demand equally as challenging to manage however is what to do when theres an excess of power being generated at times of low demand energy storage offers a low carbon means of delivering power at times of low supply as well as absorbing any excess of generated power when demand is low helping to balance and stabilise the grid as the electricity system transforms through a range of lowcarbon and renewable technologies the amount of energy storage on the uk grid will need to expand from 3 gw of today to over 30 gw in the coming decades  the storage solution even as the uks electricity system transforms from fossil fuels to renewables the way the grid operates remains primarily the same central to that is the principle that the supply of electricity being generated must always match the demand on a secondbysecond basis too little or too much power on the system can cause power outages and damage equipment national grid needs to be able to call on reserve power sources to meet demand when supply is low or pay to curtail renewable sources output when demand drops during the summer of 2020 for example lower demand due to covid19 coupled with high renewable output resulted in balancing costs 40 above expectations  there is a lot of offshore wind coming online in scotland as much as 11 gw by 2030 and a further 25 gw planned explains steve marshall a development manager at drax offshore wind farm along the coast of scotland its great because it increases the amount of renewable power on the system but the transmission lines between scotland and england can become saturated as much as 3040 of the time because there is too much power electricity storage can provide a source of reserve power as well as absorb excess electricity these capabilities are crucial for balancing the grid and ensuring that frequency remains within a stable operating range of 50 hertz as well as providing other ancillary services  whether its absorbing power or delivering electricity needed to keep the grid stable in energy storage timing is everything  there are three main time periods electricity storage needs to operate over fastacting short term electricity because electricity supply must always match demand sudden changes mean the grid needs to respond immediately to ensure frequency and voltage remain stable and electricity safe to use batteries are considered the fastest technology for responding to a sudden spike in demand or an abrupt loss of supply battery technology has evolved rapidly in recent decades as innovations like lithiumion batteries such as those used in electric cars and emerging solidstate batteries become more affordable and more commonplace this makes it more feasible to deploy largescale installations that can absorb and store excess power from the grid batteries are good for nearinstantaneous responses it can be a matter of milliseconds for a battery to deploy power says marshall if theres a sudden problem with frequency or voltage batteries can respond  its something thats quite unique to them the speed at which batteries can deploy and absorb electricity makes them useful grid assets however even very large battery setups can only discharge power for around two hours if for example the wind dropped off for a long period the grid needs a longerduration supply of stored power powering daytoday changes in supply demand and the grid when it comes to managing the daily variations of supply and demand the grid needs to be able to call on reserves of power for when there are unexpected changes in the weather or electricity demand from users pumped storage hydro power offers a low carbon way to provide huge amounts of electricity quickly and for periods that can last as long as eight or even 24 hours the technology works by moving water between two reservoirs of water at different elevations when there is demand for electricity water is released from the upper reservoir which rushes down a series of pipes spinning water turbines generating electricity however when there is an excess of power on the electricity system the same turbines can reverse and absorb electricity to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir storing it there as a massive water battery pumped storage hydro is a longestablished technology having been developed since the 1890s in italy and switzerland in the uk today there are four pumped storage hydro power stations in scotland and wales with a total capacity of 28 gw among those is the draxowned cruachan power station in the scottish highlands the plant is made up of four generatingpumping turbines located inside ben cruachan between loch awe and an upper reservoir holding 10 million cubic metres of water turbine hall at cruachan power station pumped hydro storage facilities can rapidly begin generating large volumes of power in as little as 30 seconds or less the ability to switch their turbines between different modes  pump generate and spin mode to provide inertia to the gird without producing power  make pumped storage hydro plants versatile assets for the gird how cruachan operates depends on weather says marshall we make as many 1000 mode changes a month thats how frequently cruachan is called on by national grid as the electricity system transforms there will be a greater need for flexible energy storage like pumped storage hydro this is why drax is kickstarting plans to expand cruachan power station however the specific conditions needed for such facilities can make new projects difficult and expensive cruachan 2 to the east of the original power station will add up to 600 mw in generating capacity  more than doubling the sites total capacity to more than 1gw by increasing the number of turbines operating at the facility it increases the range of services that the grid can call upon from the site longterm electricity solutions however storage technologies as they exist today cannot alone offer all the solutions the uk will need to achieve its net zero targets while technologies like pumped storage can generate for the better part of a day longer periods of unfavourable conditions for renewables will need new approaches in march 2021 for example the uk experienced its longest cold and calm spell in more than a decade with wind farms operating at just 11 of their capacity for 11 days straight  according to electric insights the shortfall in the countrys primary source of renewable power was made up for by gas power stations but in a net zero future such responses will only be feasible if theyre part of carbon capture and storage systems or replaced by other carbon neutral or energy storage solutions generating enough power to supply an electrified future as well as being able to take pressure off the grid and provide balancing services will require a range of technologies working in tandem over extended periods interconnectors with neighbouring countries for example can work alongside storage solutions to shed excess power to where there is greater demand similarly rather than curtailing wind or solar power extra electricity could be used for electrolysis to produce hydrogen  other functions may include demand side response where heavy power users are incentivised to reduce their electricity usage during peak periods helping to reduce demand to achieve stable reliable net zero electricity systems the uk needs to act now to not only replace fossil fuels with renewables but put the essential energy storage and balancing solutions in place that means electricity is there when
