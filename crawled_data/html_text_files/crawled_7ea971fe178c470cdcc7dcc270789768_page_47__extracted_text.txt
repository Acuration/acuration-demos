could be expected in the early part of 2019 we stand on the precipice of an electric revolution  drax group ceo will gardiners speech to the british chambers of commerce 8 march 2018 uncategorized good morning everyone i would like to begin by thanking the british chambers of commerce for inviting me to speak today adam marshall and his team at the bcc do so much to represent british business  and events like this one today help bring together business leaders from across the country to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing uk plc having been with drax for two years as cfo i became the groups ceo at the start of this year in a few short weeks i went from navigating the companys finances to being captain of the ship drax is a company that has gone through fundamental transformation a transformation that is unprecedented for a company so critical to the uks infrastructure almost 50 years ago  drax began generating electricity from its power station in selby yorkshire it provided more than enough electricity to power all the homes in london twice over  helping to power a resurgence in industrial output and an explosion in demand from consumers for white goods  for three decades the company continued in the same vein burning coal to power the countrys seemingly insatiable demand for electricity but as the world welcomed in the new millennium everything changed simmering and justifiable disquiet about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment gathered momentum and reached a nadir resulting in climate change rising up the political agenda  both in the uk and internationally it sounded the death knell for old king coal and ushered in a wave of new low carbon renewable power generators rather than trying to hold back the tide  and with the support of government  drax reinvented itself  and set about changing the uks energy landscape in the process out went our dependence on coal and in came biomass  sustainable and renewable wood pellets that emit 80 per cent fewer carbon emissions than its predecessor drax went from being the uks largest polluter to the largest single site renewable power generator in the country but from supporting a renaissance in the industrial revolution we now stand on the precipice of a whollydifferent revolution an electric revolution and more specifically a people and businesspowered renewable electric revolution a revolution that wont seem so revolutionary to my daughter and her peers in 2035  as electric vehicles cruise clean streets without the need for a driver and our household appliances are all connected and communicate with one another a revolution that will see the electrification of transport and heating where at a larger scale the introduction of artificial intelligence will allow the entire grid to connect and work in harmony with every one of the billions of devices taking energy from it a revolution that will not be driven solely by largescale power generators but by prosumers  individuals businesses and institutions that not only consume electricity but produce it too  spurred by falling costs that will make technologies like rooftop solar panels and domestic battery storage more affordable prosumers will change the dynamic between energy suppliers and energy users for good from disengaged to engaged from passive to active from consumers to producers prosumers want a reliable and flexible selfsupply of energy  and to call upon a mix of renewable technologies just as the national system does they want  and will have  the capacity to generate their own energy via a mix of solar wind and biomass and then crucially sell back their excess electricity to an energy supplier in fact new measures have already been put in place to encourage people to generate their own electricity these will make it easier for prosumers to generate store and sell back their power to the grid  something ofgem estimates could save consumers up to 40 billion by 2050 but what could this mean for the business of electricity some including national grid suggest multiple commercial models will operate together to facilitate a decentralised prosumerbased energy system these would include homes and businesses that wholly own their energy systems as well as systems owned and operated by third parties such as aggregators managing energy or solarrental schemes this isnt tomorrows world its todays similar schemes are already in place in both the business and consumer retail markets last year for example opus energy  a drax group company supplying energy to uk businesses  bought almost one terawatt of power from more than 2000 small renewable generators  these businesses use technologies such as solar onshore wind and hydro opus energy then sells that power onto its predominantly small business customer base and its here where perhaps the success or otherwise of the electric revolution will be determined most business owners are extremely time poor with a very broad range of responsibilities  all of them pressing although important especially if they want it to be renewable energy supply is unlikely to get much of their attention far too frequently energy is just confusing and unnecessarily complex the agenda is set by the supplier seldom by the customer for the most part businesses just want an energy supplier that can satisfy their particular energy needs and preferences simply intelligently and accurately thats why we want our customers to be able to make better and more informed choices not only because thats what they want but also because it means renewable power and the way it is used will become a real part of the uks energy future but why does this make sense well think of your rubbish or rather think back to your rubbish a decade ago ten years ago everything  paper plastic or glass  ended up in one bin and it all went to the same place until that is people realised that to make daily recycling a more realistic proposition it needed to be simple and easy so councils set about providing better facilities and services from bins to collection now when we throw away our rubbish we sort it and separate it what once seemed too difficult and overcomplicated isnt any more now recycling and its contribution to greater sustainability is second nature we believe there needs to be a similar approach and attitude in energy supply of course all energy supply should be easy and straightforward  especially renewable energy it might have been difficult and complicated in the past but it certainly isnt now so perhaps the biggest barrier to largescale adoption of prosumerism is technology although research and innovation pounds dollars and euros have been pouring into the technologies that make decentralised power generation possible there are still developments to be made solar is one of the most prominently used renewables by prosumers thanks to the relative affordability of rooftop solar systems even homeinterior giant ikea now offers solar panels and battery systems through a partnership with the uks largest solar company solarcentury but like wind turbines which are a more costprohibitive solution solar is an intermittent energy source which means domestic users may still need to access the grid to fill gaps in their own generation that is unless battery technology advances to a point where it can store enough solar  or windgenerated electricity to fully power homes and businesses affordably  allyear round including in the dark still days of midwinter along with small scale generators largescale power producers have a crucial role to play here if we can store renewable electricity from intermittent sources when they are able to generate it could then be utilised at times when theyre not however the problem is the technology capable of storing electricity at scale doesnt exist  yet but the race to develop it is well under way and several companies are working on building ever bigger more efficient electricity storage methods and drax is at the front of this race were planning to develop two giant 100 megawatt batteries at our site in selby these batteries would store electricity to enable our proposed gasfired power generation to ramp up faster when needed  making our power station purposebuilt for a more flexible future together they would be the largest batteries of their kind anywhere in the world but whether it be batteries or biomass solar or electricity supply what all parties need is certainty like all largescale energy producers we need certainty of longterm policy to enable us to make investment decisions investment decisions that will bring forward projects to make the electric revolution a reality and businesses looking to invest in renewable technologies need certainty to ensure their longterm investments will be economically viable the certainty government provided energy suppliers more than a decade ago brought forward unprecedented investment in renewable power generation investment that not only is helping to decarbonise the countrys energy supply but has also created thousands of new jobs and empowered supply chains up and down the country suppliers  and drax included  also need certainty to help support small businesses to realise the full benefit of the electric revolution we must work harder to make systems easy to use and manage we must create attractive tariffs and we must provide a service that gives peace of mind i am committed to doing all of this  because it makes sense for all of us but i am not just committed to changing what we do but also how we do it and i have spent much of my first two months as ceo looking at this a more diverse workforce is a stronger workforce if drax is to achieve what weve set out to achieve we need to embrace this  because quite simply what weve been doing so far has not been good enough without doubt the energy sector as a whole must do more to attract women into the industry but speaking personally i am committed to taking a lead and changing draxs practices policies and culture to ensure we are an employer of choice for women who see their future in energy as i stand here today i can reflect proudly on draxs transformation but i hope that my successors will reflect more proudly on the role they played to transform the entire energy sector not just for drax but for you too  the businesses that really power uk plc  thank you britain now produces enough renewable electricity to power the entire country 60 years ago 21 february 2018 uncategorized britains renewable output grew 27 last year to 96 twh 92 of electricity came from coal in 1958 compared with just 7 in 2017 50 of power generation in 2017 came from low carbon sources the renewable electricity produced in 2017 could have powered the whole of britain in 1958  the year that brought us blue peter the hula hoop and paddington bear 60 years ago 52 million brits used 91 twh of electricity  all of which could have been powered by the 96 twh of renewable electricity produced last year according to the latest electric insights report  published by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax the report also showed that half of britains electricity come from lowcarbon sources in 2017 coal and gas output fell by a tenth and wind farms posted a record year carbon emissions from electricity consumption fell 12 last year a saving which amounts to taking one in seven of britains cars off the road of all grid electricity supplied last year 25 came from biomass hydro wind and solar wind generation was the major factor in helping to increase britains renewable output  it produced 15 of the countrys electricity up from 10 in 2016 and more than twice the output of coal wind generation grew 45 between 2016 and 2017 and higher wind speeds and the completion of several onshore and offshore wind farms contributed to recordbreaking wind output over the year electrical appliances which typically make up 25 of domestic demand were considered luxury items in 1958 when a washing machine cost around 60 this was a big outlay considering that the average salary was 569 and the average family home cost 2253 dr iain staffell from imperial college london explained generation from coal continues to fall and is now the preserve of colder months as opposed to being the mainstay of generation as it was in 1958 60 years ago the power system emitted 93 million tonnes of co 2  in 2017 renewables managed to produce the same amount of electricity by emitting just three million tonnes the share of fossil fuels on the system has fallen from 80 to 50 since 2010 and the effect that shift in the balance of power is having in terms of lowering our carbon emissions is striking andy koss drax power ceo said this report shows the great progress we have made in terms of decarbonising the energy sector we can expect more days without coal on the system as we gear up to the uk coming off coal in 2025 and we are proud of the work that we have done to support this as the largest decarbonisation project in europe as the share of fossil fuels falls and more intermittent renewables come onto the system we need to think about how we maintain stable secure power supplies flexible responsive technologies such as biomass help to support and balance the grid as more renewables come on to the system drax has upgraded half of its power station in north yorkshire from coal to use sustainable biomass with plans to convert a further generating unit this year it is now the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe ends

marran scooping three of the top five accolades at the ceremony james aged 23 won 4 th year apprentice of the year in his role as an electrical craftsperson apprentice at drax power station in north yorkshire younger brother lewis 19 was awarded business apprentice of the year for his work as a procurement and business support apprentice in addition to being crowned 4 th year apprentice of the year james also won the newlycreated paul chambers overall outstanding achievement award the brothers from doncaster both impressed the judges who described lewis as a great role model for other business apprentices and james as one of the most competent apprentices of recent times with the potential to develop into one of draxs best craftspeople james said completing my apprenticeship is one of my greatest achievements and be rewarded further as an outstanding apprentice was an even greater one it was an honor to have worked alongside paul chambers and so im incredibly proud to receive the paul chambers overall outstanding achievement award lewis added drax has offered me a brilliant grounding as an apprentice allowing me to develop new skills and abilities which has led to a successful appointment within the procurement team to be the recipient of this award is most rewarding and i consider this as an excellent achievement in what i hope is a long and prosperous career at drax the year 2 apprentice of the year was 21yearold josh orourke 21 from goole who works as an electrical technical apprentice judges described josh as mature with a real focus and a drive to succeed year 3 winner daniel riley 19 also from goole was praised for the quality and accuracy of his work and his positive response to instruction and quick learning in his position as a mechanical technical apprentice the awards were presented to the winners by bbc look north presenter clare frisby and drax power ceo andy koss at a ceremony at drax sports and social club near selby clare frisby added it was a real pleasure to play a part in recognising the talent skill and determination of all of the apprentices  it was a very inspiring event well done to everyone involved  but especially the winners and james in particular andy koss drax power ceo said james lewis daniel and josh have all excelled  demonstrating enthusiasm drive positivity and professionalism in every aspect of their work as apprentices special congratulations go to james as the winner of the paul chambers award  he has consistently received outstanding feedback about his work and i know he will go on to make a brilliant craftsperson drax will be offering apprenticeships over the course of the year in business support areas such as finance and business administration technical apprenticeship applications are closed for 2018 all opportunities are advertised online  more information about apprenticeships at drax is available on the website  northern powerhouse minister and selby mp visit drax to find out more about drax repower 13 february 2018 uncategorized the plans would complement draxs existing coaltobiomass conversion which has seen three units repowered to run on sustainable biomass pellets with a fourth biomass conversion to follow this year if the drax repower plans go ahead in their entirety the development would include two combinedcycle gas turbines ccgts with a combined capacity of up to 3600 megawatts mw of electricity as well as battery storage of up to 200mw andy koss drax power ceo said we were delighted to welcome nigel adams and jake berry to drax our repowering project represents a really exciting time for us the options were exploring could reuse some of the existing infrastructure from the remaining coal assets at drax and extend their operation as gas plant into the 2030s we hope the repower project will secure the future of the power station beyond 2025 when the government says coal must come off the system the north of england has a rich heritage in providing energy to the rest of the uk and drax has an important role to play in delivering a low carbon economy as the uk comes off coal drax power station employs around 900 people and generated 16 of the countrys renewable electricity in 2016  enough for four million households the equivalent of leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool jake berry minister for the northern powerhouse and local growth added drax plays a hugely important role in the northern economy and its truly impressive how it has continued to innovate in recent years to move away from coal power i enjoyed learning more about draxs gas conversion project and its wider plans to support britains transition to a low carbon future based on an electric economy nigel adams member of parliament for selby  ainsty said thousands of jobs in selby and across yorkshire directly or indirectly rely on drax power station draxs proposal to convert its remaining coal units to gas to extend the life of the power station comes as welcome news at a time when other power stations in my constituency are closing their doors with significant consequences for the employees working there drax group contributed almost 17
