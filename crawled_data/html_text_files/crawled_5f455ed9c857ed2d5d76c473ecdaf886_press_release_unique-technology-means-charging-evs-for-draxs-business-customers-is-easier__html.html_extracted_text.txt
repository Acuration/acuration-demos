Unique technology means charging EVs for Drax’s business customers is easier
Energy supply business Drax has partnered with EV charging payment experts, Mina, to offer award-winning technology solutions to its business customers.
15 February 2023
The two new payment products that Drax now offers will help businesses, whose employees drive company EVs which they charge either at home or on the road, by automatically directing the expenses to the company, thus reducing admin time and ensuring payment accuracy.
When charging at home, Mina Homecharge® accurately pays driver’s charging costs direct to their energy supplier. For business drivers charging on the road, Mina Chargepass® allows them to charge at no cost to the individual and combine the costs in a single monthly invoice sent directly to their employer.
Business drivers will no longer have to pay to charge or claim any expenses, as all costs will be charged back to their employer each month. This helps businesses maximise efficiency as it cuts out the need to manage multiple expense claims, significantly reducing admin time for both the business and driver.
Adam Hall, Director of Energy Services, Drax, said: “We’re always looking for ways to improve our business customers’ experience and offer them access to the services they’ve told us they need. Mina Homecharge and Chargepass are excellent solutions that allow organisations to give their EV drivers flexibility when it comes to where they charge their vehicles.”
For fleet drivers who need to charge on the road, Chargepass offers the fastest dedicated charging network to businesses, with 44% of chargers being either rapid or ultra-rapid. The network currently offers access to over 11,000 public EV chargers across the UK, with plans to grow considerably over the coming months.
Ashley Tate, CEO and Co-Founder, Mina said: “Working with credible partners such as Drax is really important to ensure we’re able to reach more      businesses. Drax offers businesses an extensive range of services for the fleet and workplace charging markets and we’re delighted to be part of that product mix.
“One of the biggest challenges businesses face      is how to pay for their drivers’ EV charging costs fairly and that can be a very complex area to navigate. By offering Mina, Drax can simplify the process for their business customers enabling companies to transition to electric vehicles with ease.”

About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.
Drax’s around 3,000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties. For more information visit
www.drax.com
Customers
Drax supplies renewable electricity to UK businesses, offering a range of energy-related services including energy optimisation, as well as electric vehicle strategy and management.
Drax’s Electric Vehicles team works with organisations to electrify their fleets and business premises. They can help businesses whether they’re looking to transition their delivery and operational fleets, implement destination charging to generate revenue, or workplace charging – offering employees the convenience of charging at work.
They also offer their customers a range of payment options, including mobile payment using the Charge Assist app and Payment free card via Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Cards. My Electric Vehicles is their innovative user-friendly EV fleet management system that gives customers insight into their EV fleet, charge stations and energy consumption in one platform.
About Mina
Mina is a multi-award winning payment solution for EV charging and is the UK’s only platform which allows fleet and business electric vehicles to be charged at home and on the road, resulting in a single monthly invoice for the business.
Powering some of the largest fleets in the UK, Mina’s unique solution means drivers don’t ever have to pay upfront for their EV charging costs and businesses don’t have to rely on the inaccuracies in the Government’s Advisory Electricity Rate as a way of reimbursing them.
Instead, with Mina Homecharge®, EV charging costs consumed at home are paid accurately and direct to each employee’s energy supplier, and when charging on the road with a Mina Chargepass®, employees have access to the UK’s fastest EV charging network dedicated to businesses – including all charge points within the Allstar and InstaVolt networks.
Businesses are able to see key insights including carbon intensity and emissions, cost per kWh, location and duration of each charge across their fleet in our easy-to-use Fleet Portal.
This makes paying for EV charging transparent, accurate and simple for employers and employees.
