transport contact us tag railways and trains working towards carbon negative reducing supply chain emissions 17 march 2023 sustainable bioenergy key takeaways draxs ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 means were always working to reduce our supply chain emissions further were partnering with different organisations to explore innovative solutions to lowering shipping emissions through our experience of carbon capture and storage we can deploy the technology to decarbonise operations at our pellet mills using rail wagons specifically designed to transport biomass wood pellets helps us reduce transport on land emissions by developing a new beccs power station in the us we can help decarbonise electricity systems while removing emissions from the atmosphere and tackling climate change at drax we have ambitious plans to not only help countries around the world replace fossil fuels with renewable biomass but to become a carbon negative company by 2030 for the world to achieve its net zero targets and meet the paris agreement goals of keeping global temperature rises below 15c its essential to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than is produced drax is leading in this effort through pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology beccs is the process of generating renewable power using sustainably sourced biomass while capturing and permanently storing co2 developing beccs at scale and achieving our own carbon negative objective means working to decarbonise the technologys entire supply chain its a responsibility weve been committed to for decades even before the drax power station was converted to run on sustainable biomass  and we continue to look for new innovations here are three of the ways were working to optimise our supply chains to make them as energy efficient and lowcarbon as possible 1 shipping emissions harnessing the wind around 90 of the worlds goods are transported by sea  including the wood pellets produced at our pellet mills and used to generate renewable power at drax power station in the uk and while shipping has a lower carbon footprint than road or air transport the sector still accounts for around 3 or 1 billion tonnes of global greenhouse gas ghg emissions initiatives to reduce the emissions associated with shipping are an important part of our efforts to decarbonise our supply chain and become carbon negative in 2022 we signed a memorandum of understanding with japanese shipping company mol drybulk  together were exploring installing mols proven wind challenger hard sail technology on vessels transporting wood pellets on routes such as british columbia to biomass customers in japan wind challenger which reduces fuel consumption and emissions by harnessing wind power through modern sails could be ready to be fitted onto newly built vessels for drax from 2025 the environmentally friendly bulk carrier efbc projects use of new and more efficient windpower could contribute to reducing emissions associated with shipping biomass by around 20 at a later stage the project could also incorporate the use of other lowcarbon technologies as well as loweremission fuels such as liquefied natural gas ammonia and synthetic fuels we previously partnered with the smart green shipping alliance dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design for a feasibility study that looked at reducing shipping emissions  the study examined the potential to retrofit an innovative sail solution known as fastrig onto ultrabulk ships importing biomass into the uk fastrigs made from 100 recycled and recyclable material are designed to considerably reduce ghg emissions and the use of fuel the feasibility study found that the fastrig solution could help lower fuel use and ghg emissions on one of our export routes  from baton rouge louisiana to liverpool in the uk  by at least 20  2 reducing emissions through carbon capture and storage biomass pellet plants are a key part of draxs supply chain by producing renewable sustainable biomass feedstock we can help countries around the world to replace fossil fuels our pellet mills in canada and the us south use a mix of fibre sources  all of which are unsuitable for lumber or other solid wood products globally in the first half of 2022 almost 70 of the fibre for our biomass came from sawmill residues like sawdust and wood chips fibre for biomass also comes from lowgrade wood thats rejected by the lumber industry slash left over from lumber industry harvests and trees removed in forest management processes like thinning and wildfire mitigation the pelletisation process uses power from local grids  wedding us to regional power sources in areas like the us where 61 of electricity is still generated from fossil fuels this adds to our scope 2 emissions  however our pioneering development of carbon capture technology offers the potential to decarbonise emissions connected to pelletisation its one of the ways that the experience and technology we put into action at a new us beccs plant can decarbonise other facilities whole industrial clusters and our own supply chains 3 rail the lowcarbon road option for incountry transportation drax utilises rail freight as much as possible as rail offers the capacity we need as well as having a lower carbon footprint than road transport in the uk we own 225 rail wagons  specifically designed to transport biomass wood pellets and will be taking delivery of 30 more in 2023 the bespoke wagons carry a greater volume of compressed wood pellets than traditional wagons are capable of delivering around 20000 tonnes of renewable biomass to drax power station every day train carrying sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets arriving at drax power station in north yorkshire click to viewdownload optimising the volume of biomass on each train allow us to run fewer trains to the power station keeping emissions minimal using rail rather than road transport is estimated to save around 270000 truck journeys and more than 32000 tonnes of co2 a year in 2020 a new rail link was opened to connect our lasalle bioenergy biomass pellet plant in louisiana to the regional rail network enabling the delivery of around 7000 tonnes of biomass per week to the port of greater baton rouge the rail link replaced the 27 tonnes that was previously transported by each individual truck helping countries around the world achieve net zero and working towards becoming a carbon negative company is only possible if we continue our practice of examining our supply chain and developing new innovative ways to reduce emissions even further tags emissions  railways and trains  shipping  supply chain  supply chain emissions how sustainable biomass crosses the atlantic to power the nation 21 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels manufactured in china  imports that ensure we have readily available access to power
