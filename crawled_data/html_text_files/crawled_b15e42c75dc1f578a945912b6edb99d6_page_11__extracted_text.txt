technology how do you build a dome bigger than the albert hall 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the most iconic sight at drax power station has been its large grey cooling towers but thats changing today the most striking image on the selby skyline is four white domes each larger in volume than the royal albert hall these are draxs biomass storage domes standing 50 metres high and holding 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets between them  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool for more than 12 days theyre an integral part of draxs ongoing transition from coal to renewable biomass electricity generation but while biomass is a far cleaner source of energy than coal  reducing carbon emissions by more than 80  it comes with its own challenges a key one is storage thats where the domes come in the need for a new storage space storing coal is a relatively simple task with some management by heavy vehicles to reduce the occurrence of air pockets coal can quite happily sit outside in the rain and still work efficiently as fuel compressed wood pellets are different if a wood pellet gets wet it can degrade and become unusable the main reason to compress wood into high density pellets in the first place is to take its moisture content down saving weight for transportation and increasing its efficiency as a fuel for power station boilers more than that because the biomass pellets are made from wood  a living and breathing organic material  they have to be stored in sensitively calibrated environments to keep them in a safe and usable state each storage dome had to be carefully designed engineered and constructed to ensure it was fit to maintain this environment construction began back in 2013 and required a drax engineering team working closely with idahobased dome technology and yorks shepherd construction at more than 50 metres tall theyre the largest of their kind in the world  a new approach to construction had to be considered there were three key steps involved in the build blowing up a giant balloon the first stage is to prepare the foundation which takes the form of a massive concrete circular ring beam a giant pvc airform dome is laid out over the ring beam and inflated using fans that are about the size of a doctor who telephone box to form the outside of the dome insulating the inside with the dome still airinflated a thin 15mm layer of polyurethane foam is sprayed to the inside serving to both insulate the structure and provide purchase for the first layers of steel reinforcements completing the shell once the first steel reinforcing grid is attached to the polyurethane the concrete spraying process begins the dome wall is built up to a thickness of up to 350mm by adding further layers of steel reinforcement grid and reinforced concrete under pressure the challenge the team now face following construction is maintaining a safe atmosphere inside the domes the pellets are stored inside the domes in vast quantities and weight which collectively create high amounts of pressure as the pressure builds up the pellets release oxygen which can cause a buildup of heat and potentially an explosion but by addressing the cause of the increase in heat  the oxygen  the team found they could limit the danger potential the solution was a speciallydesigned system that releases nitrogen into the dome the gas forms nonflammable compounds with the oxygen which keeps the inside of the dome stable the drax cooling towers are still visible in and around selby and while theyre still an essential part of the power station emitting steam not smoke used in the generating process theyre no longer its most iconic image the four storage domes sitting beside them more closely represent the future of drax a renewable one built on biomass technology now that the domes have been built find out how their atmosphere is controlled  tags power station  visit us  careers  technology protecting the uks power from cyberattacks power generation at the heart of all aspects of modern life is a common resource electricity we need it to power our homes and our devices to do our jobs and increasingly with electric trains trams and cars to get from a to b for that electricity to be generated we need power stations theyre a critical part of the uks infrastructure and so for terrorists and foreign states that have much to gain from disrupting the country electricity generators are an obvious target drax power station is the uks largest with the capability to generate enough electricity to power every home in the north of england with this mantle comes a higher risk of security threats  notably cyberattacks protecting the plant from these attacks is not only essential for draxs business but for the safety of the country the threat of cyberattacks cyberattacks exist in the digital space but can have a very real and tangible effect on the physical world between 200710 a computer virus later called stuxnet attacked the iranian nuclear programme damaging a number of the centrifuges  a key part of the nuclear manufacturing process as a result iran was forced to decommission roughly 1000 centrifuges  in a separate attack 35000 computers belonging to the saudi energy company saudi aramco were partially wiped and destroyed disrupting saudi arabias ability to supply 10 of the worlds oil over the past few years the threat of malicious entities has only increased  an alleged nation state attack on ukraines power grid in late december 2015 left thousands of homes without electricity drax is not immune to similar attempts  every month the security team investigates about 1000 issues on an average month two of the 1000 are judged to be serious enough to warrant further investigation this is where darktrace comes in identifying the threats darktrace is an incredibly powerful system that identifies and deals with threats to drax it starts by getting to know you it learns every single device on the network its speed of traffic and the patterns of each users daily work behaviour for example if a user logs in to the work systems at 8pm but has never done so before darktrace will identify this behaviour and flag it as different from the norm flagging each of these events depending on its assessed severity it maps the devices into a graphic that looks like a galaxy of stars of different colours draxs security team use this to see at a glance which devices need attention and action the result is a view across the whole power station  both the corporate environment and our industrial control systems  those security experts can then see where there have been issues with password protection software updates with errors and where any breaches come from more importantly they can see viruses infecting devices in real time when the system thinks it might see one there are three possible outcomes ignore throttle kill once darktrace identifies any abnormal activity that could be a threat the system offers three options ignore throttle or kill ignore means allowing the system to continue as normal this option would be used if the system flagged something as a threat which human investigation found was harmless the throttle option is designed for a situation when a virus is affecting one part of the operation of one device but shutting down the device entirely would disable a critical function the throttle option slows the affected part of the device down to a virtual standstill but allows the device to continue the rest of its operations while the system investigates kill means removing the unit from the network immediately if a machine behaves in a way that suggests it could be infected it can be shut down almost immediately every day a live dashboard of variables is available to identify problems investigate breaches fix any infected devices and then rebuild those systems its a daily schedule that not only ensures the power station can continue uninterrupted but that the entire country can too tags technology  power station summer in the station power generation bees buzz and heat haze fizzes on the tarmac its summer and since the days are warm and long demand for electricity sinks as lights are left off and life is lived outdoors electricity demand is lower so the assumption would be that activity at the uks power stations is minimal the reality however is far different instead the fall in demand is an opportunity to perform crucial maintenance work  to upgrade and extend the life of power stations across the world in many ways summer in the station is the busiest time of the year slowing the beating heart of the country to get up close and personal with the equipment and carry out major repairs large sections of the power station need to come offline  this is a procedure called an outage at drax power station there are six units which together supply around 78 of the uks supply taking one offline is a big project but a necessary one many years ago we use to do a mixture of major and minor outages but we have reconfigured the outage cycle so all we do now are major outages now we run a schedule where each unit has an outage every four years says andrew squires outage manager at drax this year each of our six units have come offline  five outages have already been completed and one is set to be back in service at the beginning of november with two of these being major outages and the other four taken off the system for essential high pressure hp turbine module repair works to ensure this all operates smoothly planning starts early the process starts a minimum of a year in advance during which time scoping planning parts and materials are ordered for the outage its a necessary advance given the challenging timescales projects and numbers of people that are needed to carry out the work required calling in the helping hands drax drafts in engineering contractors in large numbers to carry out the huge scale of work required to shut down and maintain units at the power station 2016 was a particularly busy year  at peak points 3500 people were on site carrying out the work its a number weve never seen previously squires says main projects delivered during the outage timescale in 2016 include changing the generator stator core generator transformer oil burner system and hp turbine module the main steam pipework replacement being the largest of all this pipework runs from the boiler to the turbine and is the first time this had been done in the lifetime of the plant now complete this is set to last the life of the station industry pioneers drax uses compressed wood pellets in three of its six units and this pioneering step brings implications for how theyre maintained in the industry its a whole new challenge for which drax engineers are still writing the rulebook were understanding the engineering implications of using biomass in our boilers and developing strategies for maintenance says squires as europes largest decarbonisation project maintaining and consistently learning comes with the territory its just another challenge for the team to tackle during summer in the station and beyond tags technology  power station  engineering  careers  visit us black start the most important back up plan youve never heard of power generation movies where major cities are razed to the ground or overrun by zombies are good fun when watched safe in the knowledge that such disasters are never likely to happen in the uk but how prepared would britains infrastructure be if faced with a real disaster if for example something were to happen that caused the national electricity grid to shut down what would happen next of course the chance of this ever happening is remote in the extreme nonetheless britain has had a contingency plan in place for decades britains ultimate power back up first things first  if the whole of the network including the power stations supplying the national high voltage electricity distribution network the grid loses power you would need to restart those individual power stations before they can get the grid powered up again the challenge normally all power stations need electrical supply to start up but with a total electricity blackout theres no electricity to restart the system thats why the reboot procedure is called black start  and its one the most important yet littleknown back up plans in the uk the good news there has never been a blackout so widespread that drax has been asked to do a black start preparing for the unlikely but thats not to say that such a procedure may never be needed in october 1987 there was a regional black start in the wake of the powerful hurricane that hit the south of the country the storm damage left kent and sussex disconnected from the national grid  but thanks to black start contingency plans most people barely noticed kingsnorth power station restored power to the area and it ran independently cut off from the rest of the grid until repairs enabled it to be connected up again a total nationwide grid blackout may be unlikely but that doesnt mean its not prepared for tests happen regularly to assess how long it would take to restart an individual generation unit at a major power station bring it up to capacity and make sure that any black start would run smoothly the most recent test took place at drax in july 2011 with representatives from the national grid witnessing the procedure to simulate blackout conditions three of the generating units were disconnected from the grid in that test it took 83 minutes to return one unit back to service a simple plan not all power stations can do a black start  some simply do not have control ability to be the starting point of a system reboot but modern coal gas and biomass power plants are able to restart rapidly on demand this is why drax  first operational in the 1970s  is modern and responsive enough to be a key part of todays black start planning the way it works is actually relatively simple using smaller power sources to start ever bigger ones scaling up and up until the entire country is powered up again draxs auxiliary generating units consist of three gas turbines which can be started from batteries these would in turn generate enough power to restart one or two main generating units the restarted generating units would be used as the backbone of an island network  a network operating independently of the national grid  that would be grown by adding pockets of supply the generating units would match the speed and frequency to create normal grid conditions and to restore supplies fast locally finally the affected areas island networks would be hooked up to each other so electricity can be distributed around the country with the reliability and stability we have become accustomed to staying prepared when the electricity market was privatised there was a risk that such nationwide plans as black start could have fallen apart to prevent this formal contracts were put in place to continue to restart from scratch if necessary drax recently renewed its contract this makes black start  and drax  as important as ever if a disaster scenario ever struck for real the most important back up plan youd never heard of until now will

balancing for the renewable future and maintaining electricity grid stability during rapid decarbonisation  tags technology  investors  national grid  power station this is how you make a biomass wood pellet sustainable bioenergy wood has been used as fuel for tens of thousands of years but this wood  a compressed wood pellet  is different its the size of a childs crayon and weighs next to nothing but when combined with many more it is a smart solution to generating cleaner electricity compared to coal wood pellets like these are being used at drax power station to generate electricity and power cities not only are they renewable and sustainable but because they are compressed dried and made from incredibly fine wood fibres theyre also a very efficient fuel for power stations this is how a compressed wood pellet is made at the drax biomass amite bioenergy pellet plant in mississippi the wood arrives to the yard wood arrives at the plant via truck and is sent to one of four places the wood storage yard the wood circle where wood is primed for processing the piles of sawdust and woodchip or straight into processing bark is removed and kept for fuel logs are fed into a debarker machine which beats the logs together inside a large drum to remove the bark the bark is put aside and used to fuel the woodchip dryer used later in the process thinned wood stems become small chips the logs  lowvalue fibre from sustainably managed working forests  need to be cut down into even smaller pieces so they can then be shredded into the fine material needed for creating pellets inside the wood chipper multiple blades spin and cut the logs into chips roughly 10mm long and 3mm thick the resulting chips are fed into the woodchip pile ready for screening chips are screened for quality and waste is removed chipped down wood can include waste elements like sand remaining bark or stones that can affect pellet production the chips are passed through a screener that removes the waste leaving only ideal sized wood chips the biggest hairdryer youve ever seen the wood chips need to have a moisture level of between 115 and 12 before they go into the pelleting process anything other than this and the quality of the resulting pellets could be compromised the chips enter a large drum which is blasted with hot air generated in a heater powered by bark collected from the debarker the chips are moved through the drum by a large fan ready for the hammer mill small woodchips become even smaller woodchips inside the hammer mill theres a spinning shaft mounted with a series of hammers the wood chips are fed into the top of the drum and the spinning hammers chip and shred them down into a fine powdery substance that is used to create the pellets putting the chips under pressure  a lot of pressure the shredded woodchip powder is fed into the pellet mill inside a rotating arm presses the powdered wood fibre through a grate featuring a number of small holes the intense pressure heats up the wood fibre and helps it bind together as it passes through the holes in a metal ring dye forming the compressed wood pellets resting and cooling down fresh pellets from the mill are damp and hot and need to rest and cool before transporting off site theyre moved to large storage silos kept at low temperatures so the pellets can cool and harden ready for shipping one of the biggest domes youve ever seen this is the final stage before shipping specially designed and constructed storage domes are used to store the wood pellets after they are transported to the mississippi river louisiana and before they make their way across the atlantic to the uk tags technology  power station  wood pellets  about us  biomass energy inside the dome sustainable bioenergy there are four storage domes at drax power station and each of them can hold 80000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets its these biomass pellets a sustainable fuel that drax is being upgraded to run on and produce renewable electricity wood pellets are an incredible fuel that can match coal for efficiency  the challenge is you just need more of them as the density and calorific value of coal is greater however storing such large quantities in a confined space presents risks that have to be managed 247 atmospheric control the crucial difficulty with storing the pellets is their chemical volatility wood which the pellets are made from emit carbon monoxide co in a confined space such as the storage dome this co can build up and  due to cos extreme flammability  require the entire internal atmosphere to be regulated by a set of highly sophisticated engineering solutions as long as materials are emitting more heat into the atmosphere than they are storing in themselves there is no risk of combustion a single wood pellet in a fuel store poses no fire risk nor does a small pile but when thousands upon thousands are piled together the pressure builds up and causes the pellets to heat up gradually the rate of temperature increase speeds up and before you know the flashpoint threshold has been crossed and theres potential for danger however remove or limit the oxygen supply in the silo and purge the co thats emitted from the pellets and the risk of a thermal event is substantially reduced the challenge for the engineers at drax constructing the domes was finding a way to manage temperatures within the dome neutral nitrogen to do this they created a system to automatically inject nitrogen into the storage dome while nitrogen isnt a truly inert gas it is much less reactive than co and oxygen with this pumped into the domes atmosphere it is a much safer environment to get a steady supply of nitrogen regular air from our atmosphere  which is 78 nitrogen  is passed through a molecular filter which removes the larger oxygen molecules the gas collected at the other end is 96 nitrogen this nitrogenrich air is then injected from underneath the dome and continually distributed around it not only is this a fire prevention method but also a firefighting one that can be pumped in larger quantities in the event of combustion separate to the above measures which are there to manage fuel temperatures the dome is also fitted with a carbon dioxide co2 injection system and water deluge system which are there as fire extinguishing precautions the big ear inside the dome the next problem facing the designers was how to accurately monitor the quantity of compressed wood pellets inside the dome to achieve this each dome is fitted with a sonar system  which sounds a bit like a chirping bird  that provides continuous feedback on how full the dome is the sonar monitoring system provides level profile and volume information which is translated into a 3d image of the stored biomass this method of volumunetric measurement allows the operators to view and monitor in real time the effects of their actions when filling and unloading domes so they can target specific areas particularly when unloading and for fuel accounting purposes other tools and tricks five thermocouple arrays measure the pile temperature and provide feedback in real time to the operators to allow them to assess the status of the dome and effectively plan material filling and reclaim gas monitors measure the levels of co and co2 as well as o2 depletion within the head space of the dome a dome breather vent a two way acting valve which as its name suggests allows the dome to breathe is fitted to the top of the dome and acts as a vacuum breaker maintaining a relatively even pressure allowing air in during unloading and releasing head space gasses during nitrogen inserting the final piece of the atmospheric control puzzle is regulating pressure at the top of each dome is a controllable aperture called a slide gate which is closed unless the dome is being filled to allow material to enter a dome aspiration system is installed here to filter and remove displaced air from within the head space during filling but also allow a route for co and other offgassing products to escape all the hidden systems within these four huge white domes allow the operator to effectively control their atmospheric conditions and crucially to store massive amounts of potentially volatile biomass safely on site find out more about these giant storage domes  read the story about how they were constructed  tags wood pellets  biomass energy  technology  engineering the single biggest transformation of our century sustainable bioenergy at the turn of the millennium drax was facing a serious issue demand for electricity was high and increasing but so was the desire for sources of power that were less harmful to the environment than coal at that time draxs fuel to continue to meet demand in a cleaner and more sustainable way an alternative approach was needed drax had a legacy in this field  in 1988 it was the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions in the two decades that followed however the sustainability conversation moved beyond how to make coal cleaner instead the focus was finding a truly viable alternative fuel finding a new fuel in those early days the idea of converting a fully coalfired station to another fuel seemed outlandish to say the least we made a lot of peoples heads hurt with this project says drax strategic projects engineering manager jason shipstone no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going back then it was all about experimentation jim price alternative fuel manager at the time explains initially we found a few distressed cargos of wood pellets and sunflower husks that someone had ordered but didnt want we mixed that with coal at very low concentration price and his team found they could use the plantbased fuel alongside coal at low percentages without it detrimentally affecting the boilers it was a long way from being a new business model but it was a start they spent the next year working with willow wood a subsidized energy crop that proved difficult to turn into a fuel that could be used efficiently to power a boiler then in 2005 after building a prototype plant and finding a way to pulverise the willow into a fine powder  called wood flour  and combine it with coal dust the team hit its first key milestone it was able to power a drax boiler that was the eureka moment says price no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going a change in attitude the response to the success was immediate senior management support for the project had been in place from the beginning but now there was a change across the whole company people started to think maybe it can be done says price work continued on the project and  after more experiments  drax eventually settled on compressed wood pellets this form of biomass ultimately required investment in four vast storage domes that between them store 80000 tonnes of pellets then there was the issue of supply and delivery materials were sourced from the us shipped to the uk then freighted to the plant in specially designed covered train wagons each carrying up to 7600 tonnes everything else had to carry on as normal this had to be seamless we had to work the same as drax has always worked  reliable and available says shipstone jason shipstone drax strategic projects manager played an instrumental role in upgrading drax the final hurdle in 2009 the team overcame one of the final challenges and successfully adapted the boilers to combust the new fuel proving that cofiring the process of using two fuels powering one boiler  in this case wood pellets and coal could work it was enough to show there was a future in wood pellets and it could work at scale although nothing was fully built yet but dorothy thompson ceo of drax was convinced shipstone remembers the conversation after thompson signed the contract to begin the transition in earnest so we can do 10 what does it take to get to 50 she asked recalls shipstone his response no problem it was the right answer he says toward a coalfree future fast forward to 2016 and drax is europes largest decarbonisation project  reducing emissions by at least 80 of the 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide that the three now converted former coal generation units would have released per year although only half of draxs six units have been upgraded from coal to use compressed wood pellets  65 of the electricity generated at the power station is the result of a renewable rather than a fossil fuel its three biomass units produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of four million homes  or more than half of all residential properties in northern england given the challenges the world faces regarding the future of energy production decisive action is required if were to meet carbon reduction targets in the uk the government has voiced ambitions of phasing out coal by 2025 drax has aims of doing it quicker thompson has spoken of plans that see all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before the story of energy since the dawn of the industrial revolution has been one of fossil fuels this simply has to change by finding a way to ease the transition away from coal drax is helping to write the next chapter tags technology  power station  engineering  wood pellets  history the biggest balls of electricity generation power generation when making a cup of tea its unlikely you consider the industrial equipment kicked into action the moment you switch on your kettle and of all of the activity going on behind the scenes its even more unlikely you think about a 12tonne steel ball but without a number of 12tonne balls and the electricity they help generate your kettle would be nothing more than a fancy jug how do giant balls help to generate power the answer lies in the way fuels like coal and compressed wood pellets are used to power boilers and generate electricity drax started its life as a coal power station but today it is in the process of upgrading to run on biomass progress has already been made  three of the stations six units already run on compressed wood pellets draxs biomass fuel generating around 20 of the uks renewable electricity to generate enough power to supply 8 of the uks demand  as drax does  a lot of fuel is needed hundreds of thousands of wood pellets are delivered to drax every day arriving on custombuilt trains travelling from the ports of tyne hull immingham and liverpool the pellets pass through a system of conveyor belts until they arrive at one of four massive conical storage domes  located on site in yorkshire before the wood pellets can be converted into fuel they need to be crushed this is where the balls come into play the pulveriser the wood pellets used at drax are compressed and dried wood that is formed into small capsules the size of a childs crayon  but like with coal to get the best results in the power stations huge boilers the material needs to be turned into a very fine powder in pulverising mills when very fine the fuel burns as efficiently and as quickly as a gas inside each mill are 10 giant steel balls that grind down either the wood pellets or coal each ball is three quarters of a metre in size made of hollow cast steel alloy and weighs roughly 12 tonnes  equivalent in weight to britishmade jaguar xe midsized saloon car or an entire football team and to make sure that each one is up to the task of extreme pulverisation they need to be hard each one is heat treated during manufacture to make sure theyre up robust enough to consistently crush raw fuel the benefit of this durability is that they can readily pulverise fuel to feed drax boilers to power kettles across the country  a big responsibility for a big ball tags technology  power station  engineering  wood pellets  visit us how to plug the electricity gap andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 26 january 2016 opinion by 2025 the uk will face a 4055 per cent gap between electricity supply and demand according to a report from the institute of mechanical engineers  the government has disputed imeches projection but its own forecasting suggests that uk electricity demand will be 19 higher in 2035 vs 2015  the alleged 2025 gap will be caused by the closure of coalfired power stations to meet targets for carbon reduction according to the imeche current plans to plug the gap by building new gasfired capacity are unrealistic it would require a staggering 30 new power stations to be planned and built from scratch within the next 10 years at drax we have already developed a solution we can do it quickly cheaply and safely in fact it would drastically reduce the time and money involved in building all of those 30 new gas power stations from scratch weve already adapted three of our coalfired generating units to use highdensity pellets made from compressed lowgrade wood and were using worldbeating technology developed by our own engineers here in the uk to do it in all around four or five per cent of the uks entire electricity needs every single day of the year are already being met thanks to our unique biomass technology at drax its an approach that could be adopted elsewhere in the country providing a huge contribution to plugging the electricity gap our highdensity compressed wood pellets are the only nonfossil fuel that can bring about these changes in the time we have left given the right support within two or three years we could convert the remaining three units at drax power station to run on biomass wood pellets with all six units converted plus lynemouth power station  which already has that future secured  and one or two other smaller biomass power stations around 10 per cent of the uks electricity could be generated using this technology well before 2025  long before new gasfired capacity could come on stream the costs involved would be dramatically lower too we invested around 650 million to convert three generating units develop a supply chain and build new storage at drax it is estimated that the equivalent in new combined cycle gas turbine power stations would cost more as it would be new rather than repurposed infrastructure energy hierarchy the imeche has developed an energy hierarchy listing five sustainabilityrelated priorities against which to judge any future energy strategy the two that focus on energy generation are a perfect fit in terms of coaltobiomass conversions at drax and lynemouth priority 3  utilisation of renewable sustainable resources high density compressed wood pellets are made from lowgrade wood sourced according to the highest levels of forestry conservation priority 5  utilisation of conventional resources as we do now using worldleading engineering skills and avoiding the need to build brand new
