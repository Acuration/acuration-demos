 community scottish energy minister calls on uk government to support new pumped storage hydro plants 16 august 2023 press releases mr gray gave his backing to the industry while visiting draxs iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station near oban in argyll where the renewable energy giant is progressing plans to build a new 500m underground pumped storage hydro plant at the site expanding the uks pumped storage hydro capacity is crucial to integrating more wind and solar power onto the energy grid enhancing the nations energy security while tackling climate change pumped storage plants act like giant water batteries by using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from sources such as wind farms when supply outstrips demand these same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when the country needs it despite the critical need for them no new plants have been commissioned in the uk since 1984 with existing support schemes for other technologies unsuitable for the unique needs of these largescale infrastructure projects a report by kpmg found that a cap and floor mechanism like the regime used to incentivise investment in crossborder interconnectors could overcome the hurdles currently blocking investment in long duration storage technologies ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said to achieve a safe and secure net zero power grid we need to have a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants to balance our grid as the uk increasingly relies on intermittent renewables to keep our lights on there is a growing need for flexible power sources to plug the gap when the wind doesnt blow or the sun doesnt shine with its reversible turbines cruachan can also store excess power from scotlands wind turbines when they are generating more renewable electricity than we need helping to stop valuable green power from going to waste with the right support from the uk government drax will invest 500m to more than double cruachans generating capacity and support almost 1000 jobs across the supply chain during construction scottish government energy secretary neil gray msp said scotland is a global leader in the production of renewable energy which will play an increasingly important role in the transition to a net zero electricity system by 2045 however pumped hydro storage an important low carbon technology is currently ineligible for uk government support uk government inaction on this issue represents a significant obstacle to progress and risks failing to secure economic benefits such as creating thousands of good quality green jobs earlier this year a report commissioned by the influential trade body scottish renewables found that a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants in scotland could create almost 15000 jobs across the uk with draxs cruachan expansion generating almost half a billion pounds for the uk economy drax acquired cruachan alongside the galloway and lanark hydro schemes in 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible renewable power generation ends media contacts aidan kerr senior media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes drax applied for development consent from the scottish government under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 in may 2022 the plans received consent through the section 36 process in july 2023 the uk government has pledged to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in largescale longduration storage projects by 2024 a report by kpmg for drax found that a cap  floor regime was the standout solution to unlock private investment in the technology while incentivising system needs to be met efficiently no investment decision has yet been taken by drax and development remains subject to an appropriate regulatory framework among other considerations

white rose projection on draxs 350ft tall cooling tower will be visible for miles around notes to editors electricity has been generated at drax since 1974 when it was developed by the central electricity generating board in an area of yorkshire known as megawatt valley due to a fleet of coalfired power stations built there in the 1960s 70s and 80s drax was the biggest and one of the most advanced and efficient coalfired power stations ever built in the uk nearly five decades on the power station is the largest dispatchable renewable power station in the uk through its pioneering decarbonisation project to use biomass instead of coal in march this year almost 50 years of coal generation ended at drax power station in a landmark moment for the plant yorkshire and the whole of the uk giving back to yorkshire and the humber the drax foundation was established in 2023 to provide grant funding for nonprofit organisations and social enterprises that deliver lasting
