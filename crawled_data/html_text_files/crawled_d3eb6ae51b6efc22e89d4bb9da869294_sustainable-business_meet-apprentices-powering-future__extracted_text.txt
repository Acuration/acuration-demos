the apprentices powering our future meet the next generation of change makers and independent thinkers who are doing things their way 4 march 2019 sustainable business different people do things different ways says sam stocks an apprentice engineer at drax power station its a sentiment echoed by corporate administration apprentice chloe carpenter at opus energy asked to describe her role she says its a very different kind of job chloe and sam are just two of a number of apprentices at drax group who are working across the uk and while theyre proud to do things differently they do have something in common  theyre all handson practical people who would rather get stuck in on a project than sit still and hear about it in the classroom i chose an apprenticeship over higher education because im more of a doing person says molly fensome a corporate administration apprentice sam agrees i like to be handson he says i dont like being sat in a classroom they are doing things their way  engineering their own futures while growing personally and professionally and ensuring the future of our energy supply in the process finding a strong sense of identity for sam working at drax wasnt just a sensible career move it was also following in his familys footsteps my grandad worked in the power station industry all his life my family know exactly what im like and they knew what type of place this was to work draxs transformation from a coalpowered plant to a modern sustainable electricity company means sams work is building a power framework for future generations while also paying homage to his grandads career jake dawson an electrical engineer apprentice followed a similar path into the power industry being born and bred in the area drax power station has always been a part of his geography because im such a local lad it was perfect for me he says in his role jake can play a key part in the region where he grew up a recent oxford economics report shows that drax contributes 431 million to yorkshire and the humber economy and supports over 3200 jobs a role in a team drax is a large organisation but for chloe finding role models within her team she can look up to and take guidance from has been easy mentoring sessions are relaxed and you build a special bond with that person she says you can talk to them about work outside of work  anything theyll always be there for you corporate administration apprentice matt donnelly has had a similar experience adding that hes seen his confidence grow and feels he has made lifelong friends in his role ultimately its not just that they are given the right support but that apprentices are integrated as a part of the company from day one my favourite part of my apprenticeship so far is being part of the team says chloe because you feel like youre not just an apprentice but youre also one of them  being part of something bigger sam remembers his first day at drax power station it was overwhelming you dont actually realise how big it is and realise how many people work here its just normal now if i go anywhere else im thinking thats not as big as at work its not just its size that makes the uks biggest single site renewable power station stand out but the potential for career development there its this that jake had on his mind when he first made the decision to become an apprentice he was working in an unskilled job with little opportunity but he knew he had it in him to find something bigger his outlook today as a drax apprentice is very different my aim after the four years is to carry on growing as a person increasing all my skills that i have and maybe eventually becoming a supervisor or an engineer who knows this mindset of striving for better is evident across apprentices its what drove them to join the programme in the first place instead of going somewhere like uni and then possibly coming out without a job youve got a job and youre actually learning as youre doing it says sam the skill set that ive learnt now  ill probably go anywhere in the world with it find out more about apprenticeships at drax share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get
