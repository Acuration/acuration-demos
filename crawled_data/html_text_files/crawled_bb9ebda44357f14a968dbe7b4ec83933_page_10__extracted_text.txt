decarbonisation beyond the bottom line  why businesses need a purpose jonathan kini ceo customers 18 october 2018 opinion electricity like so many industries today is changing at a rapid pace technology and data are transforming both the industry itself and its relationship with consumers while renewables are shifting where electricity comes from and how the system operates  in eras of transition when few have clear views of the future its crucial that businesses remain focused on their goals and values beyond just revenue to steer them through times of disruption and change this is often referred to as a companys purpose and it acts as a guiding north star for businesses in meeting challenges or opportunities in any industry draxs purpose is helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future this strong sense of purpose was one of the key factors for me personally in moving into the electricity industry we have an unprecedented chance to be a part of the zero carbon future and the purpose we share across the business is key to grasping that but for drax purpose is not just about what drives us as the largest supplier of renewable electricity to uk businesses  we are in the unique position of being able to help other companies follow their purpose and meet their own sustainable business goals why purpose pays off business today is about more than just the bottom line  there is a growing recognition in the role companies play in the lives of their employees and consumers in wider society and the wellbeing of the planet the hardnosed business people of the past might ask why does this matters how does a companys stance on social issues for example impact revenue or value to shareholders however evidence shows that businesses with a strong sense of purpose foster more engaged employees are more innovative retain more customers and even make more money and it starts with people  a sense of being a part of something bigger than yourself is a strong influence on people it attracts the best talent and enables them to deliver with passion this not only inspires a greater level of engagement in employees but drives them to go further for clients as well as fostering creativity and innovation at a time when innovation and ability to adapt to changes are more and more valued by businesses purpose unites workforces and enables companies to implement new ideas and transform themselves more quickly it was the desire for a strong guiding purpose that brought me into the electricity industry the paris climate agreement brought greenhouse gas emissions into the forefront of global thinking and the opportunity to be a part of meeting this monumental challenge and creating a netzero future still plays a strong role in what drives me every day of course sustainability is not just part of draxs purpose more people than ever around the world care deeply about our planet many believe climate change is our biggest threat as a result sustainable business is now an important part of many different types of companies purpose helping others follow their purpose drax is in a position to not only help move the uk towards much lower carbon electricity generation  but to also enable other businesses to meet their own sustainability goals an increasing number of businesses are generating their own electricity from renewable sources these socalled prosumers can also sell electricity back to the grid when they have excess power offering an opportunity for new revenue  one such business is a farm outside of solihull in the west midlands where since 2014 it has generated its own electricity from solar panels this is now the site of drax retails first power purchase agreement ppa batteries it means that rather than just selling electricity back to the grid via opus energy in real time the farm can store electricity and sell it to grid when it needs it most and the price is higher it is just one example of a commercial benefit for a business that make sustainability a part of its purpose and research by haven power found that 78 of small businesses want to use energy efficiency as a means of saving money having a purpose inspires the people who make businesses successful and gives the business direction our purpose of helping to decarbonise the uk allows us to help other businesses follow their purposes too tags decarbonisation acquisition of flexible lowcarbon and renewable uk power generation from iberdrola 16 october 2018 investors rns number  1562e drax group plc

blackburn 60mw and a 50k tonne biomassfromwaste facility in daldowie which benefits from a firm offtake contract agreement with scottish water until 2026 benefits of the acquisition a leading provider of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility increased earnings potential aligned with generation strategy and uk energy needs the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility high quality earnings two thirds of the gross profits of the portfolio is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs in addition to power generation activities due to the expected growing demand for these assets and the contractbased nature of many of these services drax expects to improve longterm earnings visibility through structured noncommodity earnings streams whilst retaining significant opportunity to benefit from power price volatility when combined with renewable earnings and system support from existing biomass generation the acquisition is expected to lead to an increase in the quality of earnings diversified generation and portfolio benefits wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the acquisition accelerates draxs development from a singlesite generation business into a multisite multitechnology operator with the acquisition of this portfolio a fall in gas prices could be mitigated by an increase in gasfired generation reflecting the relative dispatch economics of the different technologies drax expects to benefit from the management of generation across a broader asset base leveraging the groups expertise in the operation trading and optimisation of large rotating mass generation drax believes that the team operating the portfolio has a strong engineering culture which is closely aligned with the drax model and will enhance the groups strong capabilities across engineering disciplines around 260 operational roles will transfer to drax as part of the acquisition complementing and reinforcing draxs existing engineering and operational capabilities financing and capital structure drax has entered into a fully underwritten 725 million secured acquisition bridge facility to finance the acquisition with a term of 12 months from the

group appendix 2 profit forecast profit forecast for the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 including bases and assumptions the portfolio is expected based on recent power and commodity prices to generate ebitda in a range of 90110 million profit forecast and gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs pumped storage and hydro activities represent a significant proportion of the earnings associated with the portfolio for the purpose of the profit forecast ebitda is stated before any allocation of group overheads as these will be an allocation of the existing drax group cost base which is not expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the portfolio basis of preparation the profit forecast has been compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and on the basis of the accounting policies of the drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to change the ebitda results of the portfolio it also does not reflect the impact of ifrs16 which would apply in respect of the 2019 annual report and accounts the profit forecast has been prepared with reference to unaudited 2017 financial statements based on the audited financial statements of scottish power generation limited and smw limited adjusted to exclude results of assets that do not form part of the portfolio and restated in accordance with drax accounting policies the audited financial statements of the entities forming the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2017 the unaudited management accounts of the portfolio for the nine months ending 30 september 2018 and on the basis of the projected financial performance of the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 the profit forecast is a best estimate of the ebitda that the portfolio will generate for a future period of a year in respect of assets and operations that are not yet under the control of drax accordingly the degree of uncertainty relating to the assumptions underpinning the profit forecast is inherently greater than would be the case for a profit forecast based on assets and operation under the control of drax andor which covered a shorter future period the profit forecast has been prepared as at today and will be updated in the shareholder circular the forecast cost base reflects the expectations of the drax directors of the operating regime of the portfolio under draxs ownership and the central support it will require principal assumptions the profit forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions assumptions within managements control there is no change in the composition of the portfolio there is no material change to the manner in which these assets are operated there are no material changes to the existing running costs  operating costs of the portfolio there will be no material restrictions on running each of the assets in the portfolio other than those that would be envisaged in the ordinary course no material issues with the migration of services including trading and information technology from scottish power to drax no hedges are transferred as part of the transaction transaction costs and oneoff costs associated with the integration are not included assumptions outside of managements control the acquisition of the portfolio is completed on 31 december 2018 there is no material change to existing prevailing uk macroeconomic and political conditions prior to 31 december 2019 there are no material changes in market conditions in electricity generating market and no change to the uk energy supply mix there are no material changes in legislation or regulatory requirements eg rocs capacity market grid charges impacting the operations or accounting policies of the portfolio there are no changes to recent market prices for clean spark spread power carbon and other commodities there is no material

will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 1 october 2018 opinion the uk has come a long way in its efforts to decarbonise greenhouse gas emissions last year were 43 below 1990 levels  while increasing renewable electricity generation and a strengthening carbon price means the country could soon go coalfree for an entire summer  there is still however much work needed to reach the uk target of reducing emissions to 20 of 1990 levels by 2050 and meeting the paris agreements aim of keeping temperature increases below two degrees celsius as ambitious as these goals may be recent research by the energy transitions commission etc believes they can be met by 2050 with the right government policies and action from businesses to help to mitigate man made climate change all industries across all sectors must cut carbon emissions its a big challenge but a clear first step must be the decarbonisation of electricity generation this step will enable other industries to reduce their emissions in turn through electrification since 2000 we have been building our experience in decarbonising electrical generation transforming what was once western europes largest coalfired power station into the uks biggest decarbonisation project this puts us in a unique position to offer the leadership and innovation needed  across the electricity industry and other sectors  to reach a zerocarbon world electricity generation will lead decarbonisation the electrification of carbonintensive sectors such as transport and heating will only contribute to reducing overall emissions if the electricity comes from mostly low or zerocarbon sources the etcs research suggests wind and solar will be capable of providing 85 of the worlds electricity generation by 2050 when these intermittent sources are unable to generate electricity the remaining 15 will come from a combination of nuclear hydro biomass and storage including batteries pumped storage and new technologies in fact biomass alone could provide as much as half of that 15 but it is critical that this flexible renewable low carbon fuel must be sustainably sourced for the wood biomass we use at drax power station its sourcing should contribute to growing and healthy forests which will be another key part of the climate change solution will gardiner ceo drax group at drax we have a long history of finding ways to cut emissions and improve the efficiency of our own biomass pellet supply chain  from bigger ships to more efficient rail freight loading and unloading the skills and experiences gained from these efforts serve not only to decarbonise our business but will benefit other supply chainbased industries along the path to lowercarbon emissions more than this it is far from the only way we are working towards doing this from here to zerocarbon one of the biggest hopes for removing carbon from industry lies in carbon capture and storage were leading the charge on bringing this technology to the fore by running a sixmonth pilot of a bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs system which will capture a tonne of carbon every day from one of our four 600 megawatt mw biomass units capturing emissions not only further reduces the carbon intensiveness of electricity generators of all kinds but also opens new revenue streams for businesses through utilising captured carbon  for drax beccs takes us another step towards becoming a carbon negative operation  where we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit it is also an opportunity to further expand the knowledge and experience of our team and become leading experts in a field which will be essential in meeting climate change goals  alongside this our plans to repower the last of our coalfired units to highlyefficient combined cycle gas turbines ccgt and build four rapidresponse open cycle gas turbines ocgt will give the electricity system the flexibility needed to support more intermittent renewable sources  the abilities of gas plant in balancing and system services can help to complete the journey away from coal before 2025 in subsequent decades gas can play a pivotal role assisting the transition to a zerocarbon power system our retail businesses haven power and opus energy  also allow us to help companies and the public sector outside of electricity generation to reduce their carbon footprint beyond just supplying renewable electricity were also looking at ways through closer customer partnerships to help businesses leverage new technologies to use electricity more efficiently and in turn lower their costs reaching a zerocarbon future is a monumental task for electricity producers that depends on innovative thinking and new technologies we have the experience in developing transformative ideas and making them a reality  all of which will be essential in guiding us into a brighter more stable decarbonised future tags decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with

september 2018 opinion 10year high gas prices 1 have prompted a resurgence in coalfired power across britain  and with it a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation if coalfired electricity remains cheaper than gasfired  as analysts predict  we could see the first yearonyear rise in carbon emissions from britains power sector in six years this highlights the importance of retaining a strong carbon price if we are to ensure the successful decarbonisation of the power system is not reversed after dropping to a historic low of just 02 gw during june and july britains coal power generation doubled in august and has shot up to 2 gw during the first week of september the last time coal output was this high was during the beast from the east  when temperatures plummeted in march with these coal power stations running instead of more efficient gas plants britain is producing an extra 1000 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  every hour 2 carbon emissions from electricity generation are up 15 as a result these coal plants are not running solely because they are needed to meet peak demand but because gas prices have risen sharply and carbon prices have not kept up making coal power stations more economic to run than gasfired ones it became cheaper to generate power from coal than from gas see thick lines chart below in late august even though carbon prices now double the cost of generating electricity from coal 3 coal plants are consistently in the money at the moment meaning they can generate power profitably all day and night estimated cost of generating electricity from coal and gas in quarter 3 thick lines and the output from coal power stations in britain thin line the cost of emitting co 2 has increased sharply up 45 so far this year due to the ongoing rally in european emissions trading scheme eu ets prices rising carbon prices should make gas more economical to burn as it emits less than half the co 2 of coal however wholesale gas prices have also risen 40 since the start of the year as supplies and storage are squeezed in the run up to winter  gas prices are at a tenyear high currently 14 above their previous quarterlyaverage peak back in 2013 see chart below  these rising costs are feeding through into wholesale power prices which have risen by a third over the past year to hit 60mwh the estimated cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels over the last 20 years along with the cost of emitting co 2  britains carbon price strengthened dramatically through 201415 due to the government implementing a carbon price support scheme this caused gas to become competitive against coal for power generation leading to carbon emissions from the power sector halving  unless britains carbon price can once again make up the gap between coal and gas prices we risk rolling back some of the worldleading gains made on cleaning up our electricity system  the committee on climate change has made it clear that power is the only sector that is pulling its weight when it comes to decarbonising the uk clean electricity could power lowcarbon vehicles and heating but this opportunity will be wasted if the electricity comes from highcarbon coal so what can be done the sharp rise in gas prices hints at a lack of flexibility in the energy system britain came uncomfortably close to gas shortages in march in part due to the closure of the countrys largest gas storage site with nearly half of the electricity generated in britain coming from gas plus fivesixths of household heat diversifying into other  cleaner  energy sources would help insulate consumers and businesses from price spikes no one country has the power to determine international fuel prices several factors have come together to push up gas prices  including a lack of transmission capacity depleted stores of gas after the long hot summer and a lack of wind power increased output from gasfired stations suppliers which dont wish to be caught short after the beast from the east are also stocking up on gas any kneejerk reaction to try and lower the cost of electricity for example slashing the cost of carbon emissions may only have a shortterm impact and could easily lead to longerterm damage such as the resurgence of coal which would require further interventions in the future britain does have control over its carbon price its power stations and industry currently pay the emissions trading system price determined on the europewide market which has fluctuated wildly over the past week between 25 22 and 19 17 per tonne plus 18 per tonne in carbon price support which goes to the treasury this needs to be maintained or strengthened further to save the power system from backsliding and to show strong climate leadership on

the co 2 captured can be used as a raw material from which to create the concrete effectively locking in carbon and storing it for the long term teams of engineers material scientists and economists

generation for more than 50 years great britain has been electrically connected to europe the first undersea interconnector between british shores and the continent was installed in 1961 and could transmit 160 megawatts mw of power today there is 4 gigawatts gw in interconnector capacity between great britain france ireland and the netherlands  and theres more on the way by the mid2020s some estimates suggest interconnector capacity will reach 18 gw thanks to new connections with germany denmark and norway the government expects imports to account for 22 of electricity supply by 2025 up from 6 in 2017  this increased connectivity is often held up as a means of securing electricity supply and while this is largely true it doesnt tell the full story in fact this plan could risk creating a dependency on imported electricity at a time when flexibility and diversity of power sources are key to meeting demand in an increasingly decentralised  decarbonising system great britain needs to be connected and have a close relationship with its european neighbours but this should not come at the expense of its power supply power price or ongoing decarbonisation efforts yet these are all at risk with too great a reliance on interconnection to secure a long term stable power system tomorrow these issues need to be addressed today unfair advantage at their simplest interconnectors are good for the power system they connect the relatively small british isles to a significant network of electricity generators and consumers this is good for both helping secure supply and for broadening the market for domestic power but the system in which interconnectors operate isnt working since 2015 interconnectors have had the right to bid against domestic generators in the governments capacity market auctions the government uses these auctions to award contracts to generators that can provide electricity to the grid through existing or proposed facilities the original intention was also to allow foreign generators to participate as an interim step the transmission equipment used to supply foreign generators power into the gb market  interconnectors  have been allowed to take part in practice interconnectors end up with an economic advantage over other electricity producers firstly interconnectors are not required to pay to use the national transmission system like domestic generators are this charge is paid to national grid to cover the cost of installation and maintenance of the substations pylons poles and cables that make up the transmission network plus the cost of system support services keeping the grid stable  interconnectors are exempt from paying these despite the fact imported electricity must be transported and balanced within england scotland and wales in the same way as domestic electricity secondly interconnectors dont pay carbon tax in the gb energy market the carbon price floor is one of the cornerstones of great britains decarbonisation efforts and has enabled the countrys electricity system to become the seventh least carbonintense of the worlds most power intensive systems in 2016 up from 20 th in 2012 interconnectors themselves do not emit carbon dioxide co 2  in great britain but this does not mean they are emissionfree frances baseload electricity comes largely from its lowcarbon nuclear fleet but the netherlands and ireland are still largely dependent on fossil fuels for power because the european grid is so interconnected even countries which dont yet have a direct link to great britain such as germany with its high carbon lignite power stations also contribute to the european grids supply the neuconnect link is planned to connect germany and gb in the late 2020s not being subject to the uks carbon tax  only to the european unions emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on co 2  imported power can be offered cheaper than domestic lowercarbon power this not only puts great britain at risk of importing higher carbon electricity in some cases but also exporting carbon emissions to our neighbours when their power price is higher to that in the gb market this prevents domestic generators from winning contracts to add capacity or develop new projects that would secure a longerterm stable future for great britain in fact introducing more interconnectivity could in some cases end up leading to supply shortages be they natural or market induced under peak pressure the contracts awarded to interconnectors in the capacity market auctions treat purchased electricity as guaranteed but any power station can break down  any intermittent renewable can stop generating at short notice supply from neighbouring countries is just the same research by aurora found that historically interconnectors have often delivered less power than the system operator assumed they would and on occasion exported power at times of peak demand this happened recently during the beast of the east  when low temperatures across the continent drove electricity demand soaring this europeanwide cold spell meant ireland and france which has a largely electrified heating system experienced huge electricity demand spikes driving power prices up as a result for much of the time between 27 and 28 february great britain exported electricity to france to capitalise on its high prices this not only led to more fossil fuels being burned domestically but it meant less power was available domestically at a time when our own demand was exceptionally high even when the interconnectors do flow in our direction they cannot provide crucial grid services like inertia so our large thermal power stations are often still needed it is difficult to say for certain how interconnectors will function during times of high demand in the future due to a lack of longterm data but that which we do know and have seen suggests they dont always play to the countrys best interests there is still an important role for interconnectors on the great britain grid but to deliver genuine value the system needs to be fairer so they dont skew the market where interconnectors fit into the future interconnectors bring multiple benefits to our power system they can help with security of supply by bringing in more power at times of systems stress with the right system in place they can help reduce the need to rely on domestic fossil fuels and enable more renewable installation and if electricity is being generated cheaper abroad they can also create opportunities to reduce costs for consumers however the correct framework must be put in place for interconnectors to bring such benefits while allowing for domestic projects that can help secure the countrys electricity supply as a start interconnectors should be reclassified  known as derating  to compete with technologies on an equal footing draxs proposed ocgt plants which can very quickly start up and provide the grid with the power and balancing services it needs  before switching off again could offer a more reliable route to grid stability than such overwhelming dependence on interconnectors will in addition the coaltogas and battery plans at drax power station would prove to be a highly flexible national asset new gas and interconnectors should be able to compete fairly with one another policymakers should facilitate a system that allows competing technologies to exist in a cost beneficial way both interconnectors and domestic thermal power generators can play their part in creating stability transitioning towards a decarbonised economy and fitting within the uks industrial strategy in 1961 when the first interconnector was switched on it marked a new age of continental cooperation five decades on we should not forget this goal in an ever more complex grid what we need is different technologies systems and countries working together to achieve

generation grew five times from 23 twh to 119 twh and biomass jumped from 129 twh to 196 twh by contrast coal and lignite fell from 818 twh to 669 twh these renewable electricity sources along with hydropower now account for 30 of eu countries collective electricity generation and while coal generation continues to drop other low carbon energy sources particularly nuclear still play essential

while it currently counts 65 gw of wind capacity installed and has already exceeded its 2020 renewable generation goals  the countrys 10 nuclear reactors still make up 40 of its electricity output
