exhausts has long been hailed as crucial in mitigating the climate crisis and getting the uk and the rest of the world to net zero  after a number of false starts and policy hurdles the technology is now growing with more momentum than ever carbon capture use and storage ccus is finally coming of age increasing innovation and investment in the space is enabling the development of ccus schemes at scale today there are over 19 largescale ccus facilities in operation worldwide while a further 32 in development as confidence in government policies and investment frameworks improves once co 2 is captured it can be stored underground in empty oil and gas reservoirs and naturally occurring saline aquifers in a process known as sequestration it has also long been used in enhanced oil recovery eor a process where captured co 2 is injected into oil reservoirs to increase oil production  drax power station is already trialling europes first bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs project this combination of sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year and put drax power station at the centre of wider

vest was the worlds first ever offshore carbon capture and storage ccs plant and has been active since 1996 the facility separates co 2 from natural gas extracted from the sleipner field as well as from at the utgard field about 20km away this method of carbon capture means co 2 is removed before the natural gas is combusted allowing it to be used as an energy source with lower carbon emissions snøhvit  located offshore in norways northern barents sea operates similarly but here natural gas is pumped to an onshore facility for carbon removal the separated and compressed co 2 from both facilities is then stored or sequestered in empty reservoirs under the sea the two projects demonstrate the safety and reality of longterm co 2 sequestration  as of 2019 sleipner has captured and stored over 23 million tonnes of co 2 while snøhvit stores 700000 tonnes of co 2 per year petra nova who nrg mitsubishi heavy industries america inc mhia and jx nippon a joint venture with hilcorp

edinburgh the race to the top has taken a sharp turn downwards instead theyre in a race to the bottom to earn the title of the first net zero carbon city in the uk while they might be battling to be the first in the uk to reach net zero they are far from the only cities with net zero in their sights in the wake of the growing climate emergency cities companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting net zero it has become a global focus based on necessity  for the world to hit the paris agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees celsius its predicted the world must become net zero by 2070  yet despite its ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and societys drive for real change across the uk drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030  removing more carbon from the atmosphere than produced in our operations creating a negative carbon footprint track our progress at towards carbon negative   in this article weve simplified our explanation of net zero carbon dioxide co 2  is the most abundant greenhouse gas ghg it is also a longlived ghg that creates warming that persists in the long term although the land and ocean absorb it a significant proportion stays in the atmosphere for centuries or even millennia causing climate change it is therefore the most important ghg to abate other longlived ghgs include include nitrous oxide n 2 o lifetime of circa 120 years and some fgasses eg sf 6 with a lifetime of circa 3200 years ghgs are often aggregated as carbon dioxide equivalent abbreviated as co 2 e or co 2 eq and it is this that net zero targets measure in this article carbon is used for

emissions  technology  transport  zero carbon humber what is lng and how is it cutting global shipping emissions 5 july 2019 sustainable business shipping is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways tags decarbonisation  engineering  supply chain

the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomuswpcontentuploadssites10201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of

cooking made possible by civilisations utilising this plentiful natural resource what you might not think of is the complex construction of chemicals and matter that make up the trees of a forest  nor of the countless ways these can be broken down and used yet this is the reality of forests from essential oils to sturdy packaging to powerful adhesives trees are used to create a range of products that make daily life possible and as awareness of the need to reduce plastic consumption grows research into forest products and how they can replace the lessenvironmentally friendly objects is growing here we look at five of the most common products used today and maybe in the future that owe something to forests adhesives from tall oil anyone who has encountered tree sap can attest trees are made up of some pretty sticky stuff and its because of this that they have long been a source for adhesives production  from glue to cement the substance that makes this possible is known as tall oil named after the swedish word tallolja  meaning pine oil it is a byproduct of pulping coniferous trees tall oil has been produced commercially since the 1930s when the invention of the recovery boiler made it possible to extract it from the kraft pulping process  however the resins and waxes tall oil is made up of have a longer history these are also known as naval products due to their historic use in ship building and can be tapped directly from living trees today tall oil is also used in asphalt roofing as well as medical and cosmetic applications one of tall oils most exciting uses is as bioverno  a renewable alternative to diesel made in the worlds first commercialscale biorefinery in finland disinfectants and detergents from turpentine tapping trees has historically been a means of extracting multiple useful substances and one of the most versatile of these is turpentine this yellowish liquid is produced from distilled tree resin and has a long history of uses turpentine has been used since roman times as torch or lamp fuel but its antiseptic properties also means it was often used as medicine while doctors today would advise against drinking turpentine as was prescribed in the past it is still used today in disinfectants detergents and cleaning products giving off a fresh pinelike odour fuels to replace fossils biomass pellets from working forests are just one of the ways trees are providing renewable energy one other form is cellulosic ethanol a new second generation of liquid biofuel rather than competing with food supply often a concern in the

lignin an important resource in the face of an impending vanilla pod shortage  futurelooking research however aims to unlock much more from the 50 million tonnes of lignin produced every year globally  one of the most promising of these is as an alternative source of a family of organic compound known as phenylpropanoids  these are normally extracted from petroleum and are hugely useful in producing plastics and carbon fibre as well as drugs and paint nanocellulose and the future of forest products cellulose is already one of the most important products to come from forests thanks to its role in paper production however this abundant substance  which is also the primary material in the cell walls of all green plants  holds even more potential by shrinking cellulose down to a nano level it can be configured to be very strong while remaining very light  this opens it up as a product with many possibilities including using it as a source of bioplastics  some bioplastics  polylactic acid pha pbs and starch blends  are biodegradable alternatives to fossil fuelbased plastics and could potentially help solve some of the worlds mostpressing waste issues not all biobased plastics are biodegradable however the property of biodegradation doesnt depend on the resource basis of a material  it is linked to its chemical structure in other words 100 biobased plastics may be nonbiodegradable and 100 fossilbased plastics can biodegrade biobased plastics that are not biodegradable include polyethylene terephthalate polyurethanes polyamide polyethylene polyethylenefuranoate or pef is recyclable can be manufactured without fossil fuels and while not biodegradable has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to the oilbased plastic used to make water bottles

2018 sustainable bioenergy humans have used wood as a source of fuel for over a million years  modern biomass power however is a far cry from humans early taming of fire and this is down to constant research and innovation in fact today its one of the most extensively researched areas in energy and environmental studies with biomass accounting for 64 of total renewable energy production in the eu in 2015 the development isnt likely to stop ongoing advancements in the field are helping the technology become more sustainable and efficient in reducing emissions here are seven of the projects businesses ideas and technologies pushing biomass further into the future torrefaction  supercharging biomass pellets when it comes to making biomass as efficient as possible its all down to each individual pellet improving whats known as the calorific value of each pellet increases the overall amount of energy released when they are used in a power station one emerging process aiming to improve this is torrefaction which involves heating biomass to between 250 and 300 degrees celsius in a lowoxygen environment this drives out moisture and volatiles from woody feedstocks straw and other biomass sources before it is turned into a black biocoal pellet which has a very high calorific value this year estonian company baltania is constructing the first industrialscale torrefaction plant in the country with the target output of 160000 tonnes of biocoal pellets per year if its successful power stations worldwide may be able to get more power from each little pellet biobean  powered by caffeine biofuels dont just come from forest residues every day more than two billion cups of coffee are consumed globally as people get themselves caffeinated for the day ahead in london alone this need for daily stimulation results in more than 200000 tonnes of coffee waste produced every year more often than not this ends up in landfills biobean aims to change this by collecting used coffee grounds from cafes offices and factories and recycling them into biofuels and biochemicals the company now recycles as much as 50000 tonnes of coffee grounds annually while one of its products b20 biodiesel has been used to power london buses biobean also produces briquettes and pellets which like woody biomass can serve as an alternative to coal biomass gasification  increasing the value of biomass waste biogas is often seen as a promising biofuel with fewer emissions than burning fossil fuels or biomass pellets its an area undergoing significant research as it points to another means of creating highervalue products from biomass matter the finnish town of vaasa is home to the worlds largest gasification plant  the facility is part of a coal plant where cofiring biogas with coal has allowed it to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions by as much as 230000 tonnes per year as well as reducing emissions cofiring allows the power plant to use 25 to 40 less coal and when demand is low in the autumn and spring months the plant runs entirely on biogas more than that the forestry residues which are used to produce the biogas are sourced locally from within 100 km of site as part of our transition away from coal cofiring biomass with that fossil fuel took place at drax power station from 2003 until full unit conversions became a reality in 2013 lynemouth power station  powering the move away from coal after 44years the coalfired lynemouth power station in northumberland is the latest uk power producer converting to biomassfuel set for completion this year the plant will supply 390 mw of lowcarbon electricity to the national grid enough to power 700000 homes  every new power station conversion poses different challenges as well as the opportunity to develop new solutions but none are as crucial as the conversion of the materials handling equipment from coal to biomass pellets while coal can sit in the rain for long periods of time and still be used biomass must be kept dry with storage conditions constantly monitored and adjusted to prevent sudden combustion at lynemouth the handling of 14 million tonnes of biomass annually has required the construction of three 40metre high concrete storage silos as well as extensive conveyor systems to unload and transport biomass around the plant biotrans  two birds with one stone energy and food are both undergoing serious changes to make them more sustainable danish startup biotrans is tackling both challenges by using one of the food industrys key pain points  wastage  to create energy with its biogas systems the company installs systems that collect leftover food from restaurants and canteens and stores it in odourproof tanks before collecting and turning it into biogas for heating and electricity production more than just utilising this waste stream the byproduct of the gasification process can also be sold as a fertiliser drax and ccapture  cutting emissions from the source carbon capture usage and storage ccus is one of the most important fields in the energy sector today the technologys ability to capture co 2 from the electricity generation process and turn it into a revenue source before it can enter the atmosphere means its attracting significant investment and research drax is partnering with ccapture  a company spun out of the university of leeds chemistry department to trial a new form of ccus the pilot scheme will launch in november and aims to capture a tonne of co 2 per day from one of draxs biomass units ccaptures technology could make the process of capturing and storing co 2 less costly and energy intensive it does this using a specially developed solvent capable of isolating co 2 before being recycled through the system and capturing more if the pilot proves successful the technology could be implemented at an industrial scale seeing up to 40 of the co 2 in the flue gases from draxs biomass units captured and stored if the technology tested at drax leads to the construction of a purposebuilt carbon capture unit elsewhere scientists and engineers at ccapture believe the co 2 captured could exceed 90 back in north yorkshire the eventual goal is negative carbon emissions from drax power station  its biomass units already deliver carbon savings of more than 80 compared to when they used coal and if a new revenue stream can be developed from the sale of the carbon captured then the power produced from biomass at the power station could become even more cost effective with thanks to biomass uk and the european biomass association  aebiom   tags biomass energy  technology  wood pellets the wooden buildings of the future 22 january 2018 sustainable bioenergy when we think of modern cities and the buildings within them we often think of the materials theyre constructed from  we think of the concrete jungle since the 19 th century steel glass and concrete enabled the building of bigger and more elaborate buildings in rapidlygrowing cities and those materials quickly came to define the structures themselves but today that could be changing new technologies and building techniques mean wood a material humans have used in construction for millennia is making a comeback and reducing the carbon footprint of our buildings too return of the treehouse civilisation has been building structures from wood for longer than you may realise the 32metre tall pagoda of horyuji temple in japan was built using wood felled in 594 and still stands today the sakyumuni pagoda of fogong temple in china is nearly twice as tall with a height of 67 metres it was built in 1056 today wood is once again finding favour the 30metre tall wood innovation and design centre of the university of british columbia unbc in canada was completed in october 2014 and is among the first of this new generation of wooden buildings and theyre only getting bigger this year the completion of the 84metre 24storey hoho tower in vienna will make it the tallest wooden building in the world but this will be far surpassed if plans for the oakwood tower in london are approved designed by a private architecture firm and researchers from the university of cambridge the proposed building will be 300metres tall if construction goes ahead making it londons second tallest structure after the shard and it would be made of wood falling back in love with wood wood construction fell out of favour in the 19 th century when materials like steel and concrete became more readily available but new developments in timber manufacturing are changing this researchers in graz austria discovered that by gluing strips of wood with their grains at right angles to each other the relative weakness of each piece of wood is compensated the result is a wood product known as crosslaminated timber clt which is tougher than steel for its weight but is much lighter and can be machined into extremely precise shapes think of it as the plywood of the future allowing construction workers to build bigger quicker and lighter glued laminated timber commonly known as glulam is another technology technique enabling greater use of wood in more complex construction manufactured by bonding highstrength timbers with waterproof adhesives glulam can also be shaped into curves and arches  pushing woods usage beyond straight planks and beam these dense timbers dont ignite easily either they are designed to act more like logs than kindling and feature an outer layer that is purposefully designed to char when exposed to flame which in turn insulates the inner wood susceptibility to mould insect and water damage is indeed a concern of anyone building with wood but as the centuriesold pagodas in japan and china demonstrate care for wood properly and theres no real limit to how long you can make it last so wood is sturdy but so is steel  why change green giant construction with concrete and steel produces an enormous carbon footprint concrete production on its own accounts for 5 of all our carbon emissions but building with wood can change that unbcs innovation and design centre saved 400 tonnes of carbon by using wood instead of concrete and steel on top of that building with wood freezes the carbon captured by the trees as they grow when trees die naturally in the forest they decompose and release the carbon they have absorbed during growth back in the atmosphere but wood felled and used to construct a building has captured that carbon for as long as it stands in place a city of wooden buildings could be a considerable carbon sink this can have further ripple effects the more timber is required for construction the more it increases the market for wood and the responsiblymanaged forests that material comes from and the more forests that are planted and managed with proper governance the more carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere  according to research from yale university a worldwide switch to timber construction would on its own cut the building industrys carbon emissions by 31  granted that will be a difficult task but if even a fraction of that can be achieved it could mean a future of timber buildings and greener cities tags decarbonisation  engineering  technology whats next for bioenergy 11 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy discussions about our future are closely entwined with those of our power today when we talk about electricity we talk about climate change about new fuels and about the sustainability of new technologies theyre all inexplicably linked and all hold uncertainties for the future but in preparing for whats to come it helps to have an idea of what may be waiting for us researchers at universities across the uk including the university of manchester and imperial college london have put their heads together to think about this question and together with the supergen bioenergy programme theyve created a unique graphic novel on bioenergy that outlines three potential future scenarios based on their imagined views of the future theres plenty to be optimistic about but it could just as easily go south future one failure to act on climate change in the first scenario our energy use and reliance on nonrenewable fuels like oil coal and gas continues to grow until we miss our window of opportunity to invest in renewable technology and infrastructure while its affordable neither the beginning nor the end of the supply chain divert from their current trends  energy providers produce electricity and end users consume it as they always have governments continue to pursue growth at all costs and industrial users make no efforts to reverse their own rates of power consumption in response electricity generation with fossil fuels ramps up which leads to several problems attempts to secure a dwindling stock of nonrenewable fuels lead to clashes over remaining sources as nations vie for energy security as resources run out attempts to put in place renewable alternatives are hampered by a lack of development and investment in the intervening years the damages caused by climate change accelerate and at the same time mobility for most people drops as fuel becomes more expensive future two growing a stable centralised bioenergy a future of dwindling resources and increasing tension isnt the only way forward bioenergy is likely to play a prominent role in the energy mix of the future in fact nearly all scenarios where global temperature rise remains within the two degrees celsius margin recommended by the paris agreement rely on widespread bioenergy use with carbon capture and storage beccs but how far could the implementation of bioenergy go a second scenario sees governments around the world invest significantly in biomass energy systems which then become major centralised features in global energy networks this limits the effects of a warming climate particularly as ccs technology matures and more carbon can be sequestered safely underground this has knockon effects for the rest of the world large tracts of land are turned over to forestry to support the need for biomass creating new jobs for those involved in managing the working forests in industry largescale ccs systems are installed at sizeable factories and manufacturing plants to limit emissions even further future 3 the right mix bioenergy a third scenario takes a combined approach  one in which technology jumps ahead and consumption is controlled instead of relying on a few concentrated hubs of beccs energy renewables and bioenergy are woven more intimately around our everyday lives this relies on the advance of a few key technologies widespread adoption of advanced battery technology sees wind and solar implemented at scale  providing the main source of electricity for cities and other large communities these communities are also responsible for generating biomass fuel from domestic waste products which includes wood offcuts from timber that makes up a larger proportion of building materials as wooden buildings grow more common whether future three  or any of the above scenarios  will unfold like this is uncertain these are just three possible futures from an infinite range of scenarios but they demonstrate just how wide the range of futures is its up to us all  not just governments but businesses individuals and academics such as those behind this research project too  to to make the best choices to ensure the future we want tags climate change  energy policy  investors  technology this is how you unload a wood chip truck 30 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy a truck arrives at an industrial facility deep in the expanding forestland of the southeastern usa it passes through a set of gates over a massive scale then onto a metal platform the driver steps out and pushes a button on a nearby console slowly the platform beneath the truck tilts and rises as it does the trucks cargo empties into a large container behind it two minutes later its empty this is how you unload a wood fuel truck at drax biomass compressed wood pellet plants in louisiana and mississippi  what is a tipper some people call them truck dumpers but it depends on who you talk to says jim stemple senior director of procurement at drax biomass we just call it the tipper regardless of what its called what the tipper does is easy to explain it lifts trucks and uses the power of gravity to empty them quickly and efficiently the sight of a truck being lifted into the air might be a rare one across the atlantic however at industrial facilities in the united states its more common tippers are used to unload trucks carrying cargo such as corn grain and gravel stemple explains basically anything that can be unloaded just by tipping both of drax biomass two operational pellet facilities a third is currently idle while being upgraded use tippers to unload the daily deliveries of bark  known in the forestry industry as hog fuel which is used to heat the plants wood chip dryers  sawdust and raw wood chips which are used to make the compressed wood pellets  how does it work the tipper uses hydraulic pistons to lift the truck platform at one end while the truck itself rests against a reinforced barrier at the other to ensure safety each vehicle must be reinforced at the very end where the load is emptying from so they can hold the weight of the truck above it as it tips each tipper can lift up to 60 tonnes and can accommodate vehicles over 50 feet long once tipped far enough each platform tips to a roughly 60degree angle the renewable fuel begins to unload and a diverter guides it to one of two places depending on what it will be used for one way takes it to the chip and sawdust piles  which then goes through the pelleting process of the hammer mills the dryer and the pellet mill says stemple the other way takes it to the fuel pile which goes to the furnace the furnace heats the dryer which ensures wood chips have a moisture level between 115 and 12 before they go through the pelleting process if everything goes right you can tip four to five trucks an hour says stemple from full and tipping to empty and exiting takes only a few minutes before the trucks are on the road to pick up another load efficiency benefits using the power of gravity to unload a truck might seem a rudimentary approach but its also an efficient one firstly theres the speed it allows multiple trucks can arrive and unload every hour and because cargo is delivered straight into the system theres no time lost between unloading the wood from truck to container to system secondly for the truck owners the benefits are they dont need to carry out costly hydraulic maintenance on their trucks instead its just the tipper  one piece of equipment  which is maintained to keep operations on track however there is one thing drivers need to be wary of what they leave in their driver cabins open coffee cups food containers  anything not firmly secured  all quickly become potential hazards once the tipper comes into play i guess leaving something like that in the cab only happens once stemple says the first time a trucker has to clean out a mess from his cab is probably the last time tags biomass energy  investors  technology  transport  wood pellets  1 2 3  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to
