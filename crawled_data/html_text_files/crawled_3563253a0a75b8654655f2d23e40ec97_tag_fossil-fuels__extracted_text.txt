global demand renewable energy could become a global export with a future favouring zerocarbon and even negative emissions innovation here are some countries that are not only harnessing their natural resources to make more renewable energy but are making progress in storing and exporting it could these new opportunities lead us to one day deem them renewablerich could europe import its solar power supply with the largest concentrated solar farm in the world  morocco is already streets ahead in its ability to capture and convert sunlight into power the 3000 hectare solar complex known as noorouarzazate  has a capacity of 580 megawatts mw which provides enough power for a city twice the size of marrakesh noorouarzazate power plant morocco image source acwa power its uses curved mirrors to direct sunlight into a singular beam that creates enough heat to melt salt in a central tower this stores the heat and  when needed  is used to create steam which spins a turbine and generates electricity this has helped keep morocco on course to achieve its goal of deriving 42 of its power from renewable sources by the end of 2020 which potentially means a surplus in the coming years morocco already has 14 gigawatts gw of interconnection with spain  and another 700 mw is scheduled to come online before 2026 the countrys close proximity to europe could make its solar capacity a source of power across the continent africas geothermal potential olkaria ii geothermal power plant in kenya kenya was the first african nation to embrace geothermal energy and has now been using it for decades in 1985 kenyas geothermal generation produced 45 mw of power  30 years later the country now turns over 630 mw  kenyas ample generation of geothermal electricity is due to an abundance of steam energy in the underground volcanic wells of olkaria in the great rift valley in 2015 the region was responsible for providing 47 of the countrys power currently the olkaria region is thought to have a potential capacity of 2 gw of power which could help to provide a source of clean energy for kenyas neighbours however there is potential for the rest of east africa to generate its own geothermal power in this region of the continent there is an estimated 20 gw of power generation capacity possible from stored geothermal energy while the demand for the creation of usable grids that can connect multiple countries is high kenya is currently expanding its own grid installing a planned 3600 miles of new electrical wiring across the country winds of change chinas position in the renewable energy market is already up top with continuous investment in solar and hydro power giving it a renewable capacity of more than 700 gw the country is also home to the worlds largest onshore wind farm in the form of the gansu wind farm project which is made up of over 7000 turbines  it is set to have a capacity of 20 gw by the end of 2020 bringing the nationwide installed wind capacity to 250 gw with china exporting more than 20000 gigawatthours gwh of electricity in 2018  large scale renewable projects can have a widereaching effect beyond its borders southasia is the primary market but excesses of power in western china have stoked ideas of exporting power as far away as germany  can the us store the worlds carbon in the quest for zerocarbon energy it wont just be nations that can export excess energy that could stand to profit  those that can import emissions could also benefit while many countries are developing the capabilities to capture carbon dioxide co 2  storing it safely and permanently is another question  having underground facilities that can store co 2 creates an opportunity to import and sequester carbon as a service for other nations norway is already doing it but the us has the greatest potential thanks to its abundance of large underground storage capabilities the global ccs institute highlights the us as the country most prepared to deploy carbon capture and storage ccs at scale thanks to its vast landscape history of injecting co 2 in enhanced oil recovery and favourable government policies the petra nova plant in texas is also known as the worlds largest carbon capture facility  the coalpower station captured more than 1 million tonnes of co 2 within the first 10 months of operating as a 654 mw unit carbon capture facility at the petra nova coalfired power plant texas usa chiles hydrogen innovation hydrogen is becoming increasingly relevant as an energy source thanks to its ability to generate electricity and power transport while releasing far fewer emissions than other fossil fuels chile was an early proponent of energy sharing with its hydrogen programme the country uses solar electricity generated in the atacama desert which sees 3000 hours of sunlight a year to power hydrogen production in a process called electrolysis which uses electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen chile plans to export the gas to japan and south korea  but with global demand for hydrogen set to grow highervolume furtherreaching exporting of the countrys hydrogen could soon be on the way going forward these green innovations  from carbon storage to geothermal potential  could increasingly be shared between countries and continents in an attempt to lower the overall carbon footprint of the worlds energy this could create a global power shift toward nations which rather than having high capacity for fossil fuel extraction can instead use a different set of natural resources to generate store and export

symboldrx rns number  2747e following a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with national grid ofgem and the uk government the board of drax has determined to end commercial coal generation at drax power station in 2021  ahead of the uks 2025 deadline commercial coal generation is expected to end in march 2021 with formal closure of the coal units in september 2022 at the end of existing capacity market obligations will gardiner drax group ceo said ending the use of coal at drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a worldleading carbon negative company by 2030 draxs move away from coal began some years ago and im proud to say were going to finish the job well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline by using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on we have also played a significant role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world having pioneered groundbreaking biomass technology were now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030 making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis stopping using coal is the right decision for our business our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees which will be difficult for them and their families in making the decision to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy its vital that the impact on people across the north is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that people have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future coal in front of biomass storage domes at drax power station 2016 drax will shortly commence a consultation process with employees and trade unions with a view to ending coal operations under these proposals commercial generation from coal will end in march 2021 but the two coal units will remain available to meet capacity market obligations until september 2022 the closure of the two coal units is expected to involve oneoff closure costs in the region of 2535 million in the period to closure and to result in a reduction in operating costs at drax power station of 2535 million per year once complete drax also expects a reduction in jobs of between 200 and 230 from april 2021 the carrying value of the fixed assets affected by closure was 240 million in addition to 103 million of inventory at 31 december 2019 which drax intends to use in the period up to 31 march 2021 the group expects to treat all closure costs and any asset obsolescence charges as exceptional items in the groups financial statements a further update on these items will be provided in the groups interim financial statements for the first half of 2020 as part of the proposed coal closure programme the group is implementing a broader review of operations at drax power station this review aims to support a safe efficient and lower cost operating model which alongside a reduction in biomass cost positions drax for longterm biomass generation following the end of the

probably havent heard the phrase flygskam before but you might have felt it the recently coined swedish term refers to the a shame or embarrassment caused by flying and its effect of the environment its not an uncommon feeling either with 23 of people in the country now claiming to have abstained from air travel in the past year to lessen their climate impact from electric cars to cleaner shipping  transport is undergoing dramatic change however aviation is proving more difficult to decarbonise than most forms of transportation as airports cargo and the number of passengers flying every day continues to expand the need to decarbonise air travel is more pressing than ever if aviation is to avoid becoming a barrier to climate action for other transport sectors facing a similar dilemma electrification has proved a key route forward could the electrification of aeroplanes be next the problem with planes aeroplanes still rely on fossil fuels to provide the huge amount of power needed for takeoff globally flights produced 859 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  in 2017  the aviation industry as a whole accounts for 2 of all emissions derived from human activity and 12 of all transport emissions despite growing awareness of the contribution co 2 emissions make to causing the climate change emergency estimates show global air traffic could quadruple by 2050  electrification of air travel presents the potential to drastically cut plane emissions while also offering other benefits electric planes could be 50 quieter with reduced aircraft noise pollution potentially enabling airports to operate around the clock and closer to cities electric planes could also be as much as 10 cheaper for airlines to operate by eliminating the massive expense of jet fuel and fewer moving parts making electric motors easier to maintain compared to traditional jets these cost savings for airlines could be passed on to passengers and businesses needing to move goods in the form of cheaper flights but while the benefits are obvious the pressing question is how feasible is it the race to electric planes start ups are now racing to develop electric planes that will reduce emissions  such ampaire and wright electric the latter has even partnered with easyjet to develop electric planes for shorthaul routes of around 335mile distances which make up a fifth of the budget carriers routes easyjet going electric source easyjetcom  easyjet has highlighted london to amsterdam as a key route they hope wright electrics planes will operate with potential for other zeroemission flights between london and belfast dublin paris and brussels the partners aim to have an electric passenger jets on the tarmac by 2027  ahead on the runway however is israeli firm eviation which recently debuted a prototype for the worlds first commercial allelectric passenger aircraft  named alice the craft is expected to carry nine passengers for 650 miles and could be up and running as early as 2022 the challenge these companies face however is developing the batteries needed to power electric motors capable of delivering the propulsion needed for a plane full of passengers and luggage to take off currently batteries dont have anywhere near the energy density of traditional kerosene jet fuel  60 less  alices battery is colossal weighing 38 metric tons and accounting for 60 of the planes overall weight by contrast traditional planes allocate around 30 of total weight to fuel as conventional jets burn fuel they get lighter whereas electric planes would have to carry the same battery weight for the full duration of a flight closer to home on scotlands orkney islands electric planes could be perfectly suited to replace expensive jet fuel on the regions supershort island hopping service  theres little need for rangeanxiety with the longest flight from kirkwall to north ronaldsay lasting just 20 minutes and the shortest taking less than two minutes between the tiny islands of papa westray and neighbouring westray orkney is already known for its renewable credentials exporting more windgenerated power to the grid than it is able to consume the local council plans to investigate retrofitting its eightseater aircraft which carried more than 21000 passengers last year with electric motors as early as 2022 taking electric long haul the planes currently under development by ampaire wright electric and eviation are small aircraft only capable of short distance flights this is a long way behind the lengths capable of traditional fossil fuelpowered jets built by airline industry stalwarts airbus and boeing which are making their own move into electrification ampaire electric but only for short distances source ampairecom  even with drastic developments in battery technology however airbus estimates its longhaul a320 airliner which seats between 100 and 240 passengers would only be able to fly for a fifth of its range as an electric plane and only manage to carry half its regular cargo load elsewhere french jet enginemaker safran predicts that fullsize batterypowered commercial aircraft wont become a reality until 2050 at the earliest however if going fully electric may not yet be possible for large longhaul planes hybrid aircraft which use both conventional and electric power offer a potential middle ground a team comprising rollsroyce airbus and siemens are working on a project set to launch in 2021 called efan x which would combine an electric motor with a bae 146 aircrafts jet engine airbus say they may have to reduce their cargo to go electric source wwwairbuscom  hybrid models aim to use electric engines as the power source for the energyintensive takeoff and landing processes saving jet fuel and reducing noise around airports then while the plane is in the air it would switch to conventional kerosene engines which are most efficient when the plane reaches cruising altitude airbus aims to introduce a hybrid version of their bestselling singleaisle a320 passenger jet by 2035 while start ups and established jet makers jostle to get electric and hybrid planes off the ground there are other ideas around reducing aviation emissions technology of the future for decarbonising planes the university of illinois is working with nasa to develop hydrogen fuel cells capable of powering allelectric air travel hydrogen fuel cells work by combining hydrogen and oxygen to cause a chemical reaction that generates an electric current while the ingredients are very light the problem is they are bulky to store and on planes making effective use of space is key researchers are combatting this by experimenting with cryogenically freezing the gases into liquids which makes them more spaceefficient to store but makes refuelling trickier as airports would need the infrastructure to work with the freezing liquids there have also been experiments into solarpowered planes in 2016 a team of swiss adventurers succeeded in flying around the world in an aircraft that uses solar panels on its wings to power its propellers with a wingspan wider than a boeing 747 but weighing just a fraction of a traditional jet the solar impulse 2 is capable of staying airborne for as long as six days though only able to carry a lone pilot solar impulse 2 has great staying power while the feat is impressive the solar impulse team says the aim was to showcase the advancement of solar technology rather than develop solar planes for mainstream usage elsewhere mit engineers have been working on the first ever plane with no moving parts in its propulsion system instead the model uses ionic wind  a silent but hugely powerful flow of ions produced aboard the plane ionic wind is created when a current is passed between a thick and thin electrode with enough voltage applied the air between the electrodes produces thrust capable of propelling a small aircraft steadily during flight mit hope that ionic wind systems could be paired with conventional jets to make hybrid planes for a range of uses a general blueprint for an mit plane propelled by ionic wind source mit electric aircraft initiative newsmitedu  like any emerging technology it will take time to develop these alternative power sources to reach the point where they can safely and securely serve the global aviation industry however its clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is underway flying as we know it has been slow to adapt but with a growing awareness and levels of flygskam among consumers there

global electricity go next 12 december 2018 power generation since the paris agreement came into effect in november 2016 its fair to say many countries have taken up the vital challenge of decarbonisation in earnest however not all are making progress at the same rate many are not implementing the agreement at the pace needed to mitigate climate change and keep the average global temperature increase well below 2 o c of preindustrial levels certainly not enough to limit the increase to 15 o c by 2050 which the majority of climate scientists believe is necessary for the planet is to avoid dire consequences last year even saw renewable energy investment fall 7  while the money going into fossil fuels grew for the first time since 2014 and data released by the international energy agency iea at the beginning of this months un climate change conference cop24 in katowice poland found that 2017 was also the first for five years seeing an increase in advanced economies carbon emissions  despite this there is much positive work towards decarbonisation a new report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax looks into the core areas and activities required to decarbonise the global energy system  and which countries are performing them to good effect in doing this the report also looks at how the uk stands in comparison and what steps countries need to take to truly decarbonise here are the key indicators of decarbonisation and how countries around the world are performing towards them dam in hardangervidda norway clean power at the forefront of reducing emissions and curbing climate change is the need to decarbonise electricity generation and move towards renewable sources last year the global average carbon intensity was 440 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatthour gkwh out of the 25 major countries the report tracks 16 came in below average with seven of these falling under the longterm 50 gkwh goal leading the rankings are norway france and new zealand which have a nearzero carbon intensity for electricity generation thanks to extensive hydro and nuclear power capacity at the other end of the table china india poland and south africa remain wedded to coal producing up to twice the global average co 2 for electricity generation this comes despite china having installed two and a half times more renewables than any other country  it now boasts 600 gigawatts gw of renewable capacity per person germany is leading the renewablesdrive with almost 1 kw of wind and solar capacity installed per person over the last decade despite this as much as 40 of its electricity still comes from coal part of the challenge in moving away from coal to renewables is economic as many countries continue to subsidise their coal industries to keep electricity affordable phasing out these subsidies is therefore key to switching to a lowcarbon generation system doing this works as demonstrated by the example of denmark which cut its fossil fuel subsidies by 90 over the past decade in turn successfully cutting its coal generation by 25 the uks carbon pricing strategy  which adds 16 per tonne of co 2 emitted on top of the price set by the european emissions trading system eu ets has led the carbon intensity of great britains electricity to more than halve in a decade it highlights how quickly and effectively these kinds of fees can make fossil fuels uneconomical since 2008 the uk has removed more than 250 gkwh from its electricity production carbon capture and storage in many future looking climate scenarios keeping the earths temperature below a 2 o c increase depends on extensive deployment of carbon capture technology  capturing as much as 100 billion tonnes of co 2 per year storing and using carbon is clearly forecast to be a major part of any attempt to meet the paris agreement but at present there are few facilities carrying it out at scale around the world today there are 18 largescale carbon capture and storage ccs units running across six countries with a total capacity to capture 32 million tonnes of co 2 per year mtco 2 pa another five facilities are under construction in three countries to add another 7 mtco 2 pa of global capacity in the uk drax power station is piloting a bioenergy carbon capture and storage programme that could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station  the usa has the greatest total installed capacity at 20 mtco 2 pa but per person it ranks behind norway canada and australia their smaller populations give them more than 200 kg of carbon capture capacity per person per year oil platform off the coast of australia these figures are well below the 100 billion tonnes the iea estimates need to be stored by 2060 to prevent temperatures reaching 2 o c more however considering the us alone has a potential storage capacity of more than 10 trillion tonnes of co 2  the potential of storage is not expected to be a problem using depleted oil or natural gas fields as storage for captured carbon is being explored in a number of regions with the us establishing several projects with more than 1 million tonnes in capacity in 2019 australia will open the worlds largest co 2 store with the capacity to capture between 34 million and 4 million tonnes a year from chevrons gorgon gas facility  considering the storage capacity available globally its a matter of deploying the necessary technology for ccs to have a significant impact on emissions and global warming the uk is perhaps a typical example of where ccs is at present with estimated storage capacity of 70 billion tonnes as much as half of the entire eu combined by repurposing north sea oil and gas fields in partnership with norway the uk could pool its carbon storage capacity electrification electricity generation is one of the main targets for emissions reductions globally as a result of the progress thats been made in this field many futurelooking scenarios highlight the important of electrification in other sectors such as transport in turn making them less carbon intensive transport is leading the charge globally  there are now 10 different countries where one of every 50 new vehicles sold is electric in norway this ratio is almost one in two thanks in part to generous tax exemptions as well as nonfinancial incentives like access to bus lanes and halfprice ferries perhaps surprisingly china is the worlds largest electric vehicle ev market it may still use significant amounts of coal but its commitment to reducing urban air pollution has seen it push evs heavily and it now accounts for 50 of the global battery ev market on its own chinese electric car charging stations of course adoption of evs requires the supporting infrastructure to be truly successful in conjunction with its high sales norway leads the way in charging points per capita with one for every 500 people this compares to one charger for every 5000 people in the uk and one for every 10000 people in china electrification also affects the energy intensity of countrys transport systems and while it may be the largest ev market chinas rise in private vehicles has been largely driven by petrol and diesel models the result is the largest increases in transport energy intensity and emissions has taken place in china indonesia and india respectively domestic energy intensity is also rising in china indonesia and south africa as greater numbers of people gain access to appliances and home comforts conversely in europe portugal germany and the netherlands have all seen their domestic energy intensity drop in the last decade however this may be the lingering effect of the 2008 recession rather than longterm efficiency improvements the efficiency of industrial processes is also an important barometer in decarbonisation activities like mining and manufacturing require heavyduty dieselpowered machinery and often coalpowered generators especially in bric nations the exception is china where plans to get the 1000 most energyintensive companies to reduce their energy consumption per unit of gdp produced by 20 over the last five years has proved fruitful norways heavilyelectrified industries however are still energy intensive and its level of carbon intensity is vulnerable to fluctuations in power generation prices electrification and reduced emissions require government policies to put in motion behavioural changes that can lead to lasting decarbonisation  robust carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future  drax group ceo will gardiner commented recently  welcoming a november

author and director at robertsbridge a consultancy helping advise drax on its sustainability programmes back in 2006 while working as director at friends of the earth i approved a new report to be published in support of our then campaign for a new climate change act we wanted to show uk government ministers how it would indeed be possible to make cuts in emissions so that by 2050 the uk could progressively have reduced greenhouse gas pollution by 80 per cent compared with emissions in 1990 it was a radical and demanding agenda that wed adopted and it was important to show the practical steps that could be made in achieving it the analysis we presented was based on an electricity sector model that we had developed different data and assumptions could be inputted and using this we set out six possible lower carbon futures in our best case scenario we foresaw how it would be feasible to slash emissions by about 70 per cent by 2030 this was based on an ambitious energy efficiency programme and a shift away from fossil energy and toward renewables including wind and solar power in that renewables mix was also an important role for biomass to replace coal in the countrys largest power station  drax this was not only crucial for backing up intermittent renewable sources but also a key piece in a future electricity sector that we believed should avoid the construction of new nuclear power stations in november 2008 our campaign succeeded and the uk was the first country in the world to adopt a new national law for the sciencebased reduction of greenhouse gas emissions since then ive been working as an independent sustainability advisor including with the advisory group robertsbridge of which i was a cofounder my work has included assisting various companies in meeting the targets set out in that new law for example i was the chair of the industry campaign action for renewables which sought government and public support for the largescale expansion of wind tidal and wave power different campaigners tried to stop the expansion of these renewable sources of electricity however and succeeded in derailing support for onshore wind power developments although in its infancy concerns were also raised about proposals for different kinds of tidal power in the years after the climate change act i was encouraged to see that drax began to switch over to wood pellets to generate power but concerned to see that this too had come under attack the broadly agreed view that sustainable biomass could have a role in the phase out of coal had gone and in its place were claims that it was actually worse than burning coal it was against this backdrop of changed perspectives that myself and robertsbridge colleagues were pleased to be invited to help drax in devising a new sustainability plan early on in our conversations with drax it became clear that part of the challenge with biomass  deciding the extent to which it is a rational choice to help with the process of decarbonisation is how the answer to that touches so many different issues for example when it comes to the exit from coal cleaner alternatives must be brought forward to replace it including wind and solar power but although these sources of renewable energy are growing rapidly they still come with their own challenges especially because wind cant generate on still days and solar ceases at night this intermittency raises issues about what the best electricity storage or complementary clean power sources might be to back them up when needed there are important questions about the best sources of biomass and the extent to which longdistance transport of that fuel is desirable on top of that are issues linked with the management of the forests from which the raw material is sourced and whether the extraction of wood to generate power can be compatible with carbon neutrality there is the matter of nature conservation and the extent to which wood fuel demand will affect the status of species and habitats of conservation concern for example to what extent might the wood pellet industry be driving the conversion of seminatural woodlands to plantations all of this is bound up with the economic and social conditions prevailing in the landscapes from which the wood is derived and the extent to which those buying wood fuel can pursue positive outcomes for the environment even when carbon and wildlife are at best of marginal concern to the local forest owners growing the wood then there is the extent to which economic incentives might be linked with the carbon stocks held in the forest for example strong demand for wood is held to be the main reason why since the 1950s the volume of carbon stored in standing timber in the forests of the us south has increased by over 100 demand for wood might seem counterintuitive as a positive factor in maintaining tree cover but in the us south it has been a big part of the picture on top of all this is the question of what would happen if there were no demand for wood fuel in landscapes that have seen volatility in demand arising from the decline in newsprint in favour of digital devices and the slowdown in us house building following the 2008 financial crisis this is not easy to answer although seeking answers is a complex task our advice to drax was that it should work with its many stakeholders in finding the best possible fit between its business planning and these and other questions one way of doing that would be to set out the different issues in an accessible manner and hence the production of the film that can be seen here  its called  the biomass sustainability story  and while most of us can agree with the basic idea that we have to stop burning coal it seems the big questions are about what might be the best ways to do it might biomass have a role i believe it does have a look at the film and see what you think especially if you feel as though youve already made up your mind tags biomass energy  sustainability  wood pellets  coal  fossil fuels  climate change  renewable energy 3 ways decarbonisation could change the world 27 june 2017 sustainable business mitigating climate change is a difficult challenge but its one well within the grasp of governments companies and individuals around the world if we can start thinking strategically on the behalf of the german government the internal energy agency iea and the international renewable energy agency irena have jointly published a report outlining the longterm targets of a worldwide decarbonisation process and how those targets can be achieved through longterm investment and policy strategies at the heart of the report is a commitment to the 66 two degrees celsius scenario which the report defines as limiting the rise in global mean temperature to two degrees celsius by 2100 with a probability of 66 this is in line with the paris agreement which agreed on limiting global average temperature increase to below two degrees celsius here are three of the findings from the report that highlight how decarbonisation could change the world the energy landscape will change  and thats a good thing decarbonisation will by definition mean reducing the use of carbonintensive fossil fuels today 81 of the worlds power is generated by fossil fuels but by 2050 that will need to come down to 39 to meet the 66 two degrees celsius scenario according to the report but this doesnt mean all fossil fuels will be treated equally coal will be the most extensively reduced while other fossil fuels will be less affected oil use in 2050 is expected to stand at 45 of todays levels but will likely still feature in the energy landscape due its use in industries like petrochemicals gas will likely also remain a key part of the energy makeup thanks to its ability to provide auxiliary grid functions like frequency response and blackstarting in the event of grid failure renewables like biomass will likely play an increasing role here as well particularly when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs technology overall renewable energy sources will need to increase substantially in the reports global roadmap for the future renewables make up two thirds of the primary energy supply reaching this figure will be no mean feat  it will mean renewable growth rates doubling compared with today everyday electricity use will become more efficient the report highlights the need for enduse behaviour to change this can mean everyday energy users choosing to use a bit less heat power and fuel for transport in our daytoday activities but a bigger driver of change will be by investment in better more efficient enduse technology  the technology devices and household appliances we use every day  in fact the study argues that net investment in energy supply doesnt need to increase beyond todays level  what needs to increase is investment in these technologies for instance by 2050 70 of new cars must be electric cars to meet decarbonisation targets infrastructure design could also be improved for energy efficiency  smart grids battery storage and buildings retrofitted with energy efficient features such as led lighting will be essential theres also the possibility of increased use of cleaner building materials and processes  for example constructing large scale buildings out of wood rather than carbonintensive materials such as concrete and steel decarbonisation will cost but not decarbonising will cost more the upfront costs of meeting temperature targets will be substantial a case study used in the report estimates that 119 trillion would need to be spent on lowcarbon technologies between 2015 and 2050 but it also suggests another 29 trillion may be needed to meet targets however failure to act could mean the world will pay out an even higher figure in healthcare costs or in other economic costs associated with climate change such as flood damage or drought therefore the sum for decarbonisation could end up costing between two and six times less than what failing to decarbonise could cost on top of this the new jobs including those in renewable fuel industries that will replace those lost in fossil fuels and opportunities that will be created between 2015 and 2050 could add 19 trillion to the global economy more than that global gdp could be increased by 08 in 2050 thanks to added stimulus from the low carbon economy achieving a cleaner future wont be easy  it requires planning effort and the will to see beyond shortterm goals and think about the longterm benefits but as the report demonstrates get it right and the results could be considerable tags decarbonisation  investors  fossil fuels name email comment sign up for updates from
