power station tag beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage can the eu lead certification of carbon removals globally 20 september 2023 opinion by kasia wilk head of public affairs and policy for e urope and asia drax key takeaways certification of carbon removals provides a mechanism to verify and ensure the credibility of carbon removal projects and their outcomes eus proposed certification mechanism is first of its kind but does not fully reflect the international dimension of carbon markets it is unclear how removals outside of the eu and certificates issued outside of the eu will be treated this might be problematic in the longer run  in particular in light of the foreseen enduses of the certified carbon removal units if the eu recognises and handles this challenge it could lead the world in carbon removals certification eu climate policies should prioritise support for carbon removal solutions that are technically ready economically feasible permanent and have additional cobenefits bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously sustainability of biomass is heavily regulated by the renewable energy directive red it is one of the strictest set of sustainability criteria for forest biomass used in the world it applies equally to domestic and imported biomass and protects against oversourcing why do we need carbon removals july was the hottest month ever recorded the impact of climate change is being felt here and now tackling the causes of global warming is now more pressing than ever we are currently on track for a 14 rise in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 this could lead to temperatures increasing by more than double the paris climate agreements 15 degrees target and bringing about even more extreme weather urgent action is needed now to revert this catastrophic trend its increasingly clear that carbon dioxide removal cdr will be essential to reach net zero by 2050 as these technologies balance out those emissions that are difficult to avoid as well as help companies remove their historic emissions they do so by capturing carbon dioxide co2 that is already in the atmosphere and removing it and storing it permanently according to the sixth assessment report of the uns ipcc nearly all pathways to net zero by 2050 will require a significant scaleup of carbon removals carbon removal technologies are developing at pace and can make a significant contribution to climate policies nevertheless to get the sector to where it needs to be by midcentury requires the right policies and investment to support deployment the eu has already taken a number of steps to support the development of carbon removals in the region the ccs directive establishes a regulatory framework for the geological storage of co2 and the proposal for a carbon removal certification framework crcf will support the development of a voluntary carbon market which is a cornerstone for the development of cdr however to support the scaling up of the sector it is essential to 1 assess the scale of removals required 2 define binding eu targets and 3 develop roadmaps for the scale up of carbon removals in europe it is also important to coordinate member state commitments ensuring their plans for deployment can be realised through greater cooperation the importance of certification certification of carbon removals is essential for driving technological development and deployment it provides a mechanism to verify and ensure the credibility of carbon removal projects and their outcomes we need transparent and robust rules and procedures to ensure that only highquality removals and removals that would not have taken place are credited and to prevent the same activity from being certified twice or using the same certificate twice this is what the eu proposal for a regulation establishing a union certification framework for carbon removals aims to do the proposed certification mechanism is a worldfirst and positions the eu as the leader in the field addressing the need for removals in climate policy and providing a stringent transparent regulatory oversight on certification it has the potential to set highquality criteria create much needed standards for growing the carbon removal market and address many of the shortcomings that hamper its growth today yet the scope of the eu certification proposal does not go far enough it is currently limited to removals within the eu and it is unclear how removals outside of the eu and certificates issued outside of the eu will be treated despite the important international dimension of climate policy the european commission has said that international carbon markets can play a key role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions costeffectively although specifics are still under development the paris agreement provides a robust and ambitious basis for the use of international markets and reinforces international targets transparency and the accountability recognising the importance of international carbon markets article 6 of the agreement allows parties to use international trading of emission allowances to help achieve emissions reduction targets establishes a framework for common robust accounting rules and creates a new more ambitious market mechanism the lack of international consideration in the commissions proposals for certifying carbon removals could be challenging in the long run  particularly in light of the foreseen end uses of certified removal units including their international exchange through voluntary carbon markets to mitigate this the commission should consider two additional scenarios as part of the discussions on the scope of this voluntary certification framework credits generated outside the eu  eu businesses will still be able to use voluntary markets to purchase credits from projects in other jurisdictions outside of the eu these could not be subject to the same high standards unless they are being given the option to comply with the voluntary framework linking compliance markets  while integration of carbon removals with the ets framework is only being discussed and will be assessed by the european commission over the next few years this proposal should take account of future potential linking of compliance markets should removals be fungible in those linked ets markets it will be within the eus interest to ensure removals outside the eu are subject to the requirements and standards of the eu crcf how to assess and compare the existing cdrs methods all carbon removal methods will have a role to play however they all differ in terms of process permanence and technological readiness to reach its net zero targets eu climate policies should prioritise support for carbon removal solutions that are technically ready economically feasible and permanent they should take into account additional cobenefits for local communities power systems and the environment as well as the potential to be deployed at scale to ensure these technologies can make maximum contribution to the achievement of eu climate goals beccs is one of the best examples of this when compared to other technologies beccs is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneously whilst generating thousands of jobs across its value chain it is also very well regulated sustainability of biomass is already covered by the renewable energy directive red the sustainability criteria for biomass in red were updated in 2023 and has been formally adopted by the european parliament it is one of the strictest set of sustainability criteria for forest biomass used in the world it applies equally to domestic and imported biomass and protects against oversourcing it also safeguards biodiversity ensures forest regeneration and sets strict limits on all supply chain emissions including transportation the 2023 revision of the red specifically took account of the projected growth in biomass demand to 2050 including for beccs and amended the sustainability criteria appropriately beccs projects will see carbon capture equipment installed in plants that will also produce power heat or fuels in many cases the technology will be retrofitted to existing plants regulatory consistency here will be paramount the detailed methodologies that will be developed under the certification framework will need to reflect the vast array of existing regulations such as red to support deployment of these technologies stimulate investment  and ascertain eu climate leadership  supporting domestic technologies or technologies in the region tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  beccs  carbon removal biomass and beccs are essential in the uks journey to net zero 10 august 2023 opinion the strategy provides an important steer on the short medium and longterm use of biomass in the uks 2050 net zero target with the governments strategy in hand i am more certain than ever on two things first that there remains a clear and powerful role for biomass and beccs in helping the uk balance harder to abate sectors like aviation and reach net zero and secondly that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs has a vital role to play in our global energy transition  and that drax is well placed to deliver why we should be confident in developing the strategy the government has considered several factors including availability of biomass and the priorities for end use impacts on air quality the sustainability of biomass use as well as the role of beccs in helping to reach our longterm climate goals the priority use framework evaluates where biomass would be most sustainably and efficiently used across sectors given supply constraints this framework is an important tool which has been developed with four key principles in mind sustainability air quality the circular economy and resource efficiency and ability to support us getting to net zero critically the priority use framework states that in the shortterm 2020s government will continue to facilitate sustainable biomass deployment through a range of incentives and requirements covering power heat and transport in the mediumterm to 2035 government intends to further develop biomass use for utilities such as heat and power with a view to where possible transition to beccs biomass for use in beccs should be prioritised in the long term to 2050 its very encouraging to see government recognise the important role that biomass plays in our energy transition in both the short and medium term as well as its prioritisation of beccs in the long term although there are various routes for deploying beccs across different industries the strategy further prioritises the deployment of beccs on existing biomass generation plants with established supply chains further supported by the development of the powerbeccs business model for the first beccs projects the strategy is also promising as it presents an evidencedriven basis for longterm policy stability and i believe if the government continues in this direction it will draw investment to the uks bioenergy industry why this is critical for the country biomass has already played an important role in supporting energy security while helping the uk decarbonise displacing fossil fuels with a source of renewable dispatchable power our work has also made a significant contribution to the uk economy adding an estimated 18 billion to the uk gdp and supporting 17800 jobs in 2021 alone and looking to the future beccs presents an enormous opportunity to the uk early investment in this critical technology has the potential to support energy security and climate targets whilst creating jobs and making the uk a leader in the potentially trilliondollar global cdr market this work needs to happen now  nearly all realistic pathways to limit warming to 15c require the carbon removal technology and renewable power beccs offers and expert voices at the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change the uks climate change committee and forum for the future have said that carbon removals will be needed to address the climate crisis todays strategy is a clear signal from government that they recognise the importance of beccs and the urgency with which we must employ it within the uk why this is encouraging for drax drax is an international growing sustainable business at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security and i believe the strategy we have seen from government today is a clear indication of their support for the work that we do with beccs drax has the ability to become a global leader in carbon removals technology we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in transforming drax power station into the worlds largest carbon removals project the prioritisation of beccs within the priority use framework shows the government is aligned to this vision as we look forward we welcome the governments biomass strategy and will continue to unpack what it means for our business over the coming days and weeks with a mind to our next steps government must now ensure that as it progresses its consultation on biomass sustainability that that process is equally evidencedriven and ensures that sciencebased methods drive the policy forward we hope to continue to work alongside government to support these efforts our formal discussions with the uk government on beccs and a bridging mechanism to support the transition to beccs have been productive but to realise the scale of the ambition included in the governments strategy we need commitment through the delivery of a clear business model that supports beccs todays support from government brings us a big step closer and we look forward to continuing the work will gardiner ceo drax read rns here  tags drax power station  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  biomass  beccs uk biomass strategy  highly supportive of biomass and a priority role for beccs investors the strategy outlines the potential extraordinary role which biomass can play across the economy in power heating and transport including a priority role for bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide largescale carbon removals will gardiner drax ceo said will gardiner drax group ceo we welcome the uk governments clear support for sustainably sourced biomass and the critical role that beccs can play in achieving the countrys climate goals the inclusion of beccs at the top of a priority use framework is a clear signal that the uk wants to be a leader in carbon removals and drax is ready to deliver on this ambition we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in delivering beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire simultaneously providing reliable renewable power and carbon removals we look forward to working alongside the government to ensure biomass is best used to contribute to net zero across the economy through further progression of plans for beccs and ensuring an evidencedriven best practice approach to sustainability a priority role for beccs the strategy reiterates the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 with the potential for this to increase to 23mt by 2035 and up to 81mt by 2050 with beccs expected to provide the majority of the total in 2050 in the period to 2035 government intends to facilitate the use of biomass for power and heating whilst supporting projects transitioning to beccs beccs projects which includes drax power station are seen as a priority use of biomass given existing generation assets with established supply chains and carbon capture and storage ccs technology ready to be deployed beyond 2035 there will remain a role for biomass without beccs in harder to decarbonise sectors and in supporting energy security the strategy notes the active work in government to support beccs including the development of business models biomass availability and sustainability the strategy considers the global availability of sustainable biomass finding that by using domestic and imported biomass sources there is sufficient material to meet estimated future demand in the 6 th carbon budget alongside the increased use of sustainable biomass government will continue to develop sustainability criteria and drax supports the development of robust standards across sectors a link to the strategy can be found here  scientific assessment of carbon removals from beccs alongside publication of the strategy the government has published an evidencebased assessment of beccs as a route to negative emissions the report sets out how well regulated beccs can deliver negative emissions and ensure positive outcomes for people the environment and the climate beccs at drax power station in march 2023 the government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of largescale powerbeccs projects by 2030 and that the drax power station beccs project had passed the deliverability assessment for the powerbeccs project submission process formal bilateral discussions with the government are ongoing to move the project forward and help realise the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 these discussions include a bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of beccs at drax power station drax believes that beccs at drax power station is the only project in the uk that can enable the government to achieve this ambition in addition to the largescale renewable power and system support services it provides to the uk power system in july 2023 the government designated the viking ccs cluster as a track 2 cluster progressing a co 2 transport and storage network in the humber represents a significant step toward helping the region meet its net zero ambitions and ensuring that it remains a source of highskilled jobs and energy security for decades to come along with the east coast cluster viking creates an additional potential pathway to support

beccs were progressed in parallel with the track 1 process for gas hydrogen and industrial ccs projects while power beccs and other shortlisted projects are not included in the immediate track 1 process the government has confirmed that in 2023 it will set out a process for the expansion of track 1 and has today launched track 2 beccs is eligible for both separately the government has stated that it will work closely with electricity generators currently using biomass to facilitate a transition to power beccs the government has also confirmed that its response to the power beccs business model consultation which took place in 2022 will be published imminently providing further clarity on the delivery of beccs as soon as possible drax group ceo will gardiner said delivery of beccs at drax power station will help the uk achieve its net zero targets create thousands of jobs across the north and help ensure the uks longterm energy security we note confirmation that our project has met the governments deliverability criteria and government remains committed to achieve 5mtpa of engineered greenhouse gas removals by 2030  a goal that cannot be achieved without beccs at drax power station we will immediately enter into formal discussions with government to take our project forward with the right engagement from government and swift decision making drax stands ready to progress our 2bn investment programme and deliver this critical project for the uk by 2030 the government recognises the important role which beccs will play in delivering net zero and aims to deploy 5mt of engineered co 2 removals per annum from beccs and other engineered ggr technologies by 2030 rising to 23mt in 2035 and up to 81mt in 2050 to keep the uk on a pathway to meet its legislated climate targets the sixth carbon budget and net zero drax power station is the uks largest single source of renewable electricity and beccs is the only technology that can produce reliable renewable power provide system support services and permanently remove co 2 at scale coal closure drax continues to expect to close its two legacy coal units at the end of march 2023 notes 1 in its energy white paper government noted that biomass is unique amongst renewable technologies in the wide array of applications in which it can be used as a substitute for fossilfuel based products and activities along with its ability to deliver permanent carbon removals government recognises that biomass is one of the uks most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions while maintaining energy security biomass is the only largescale source of dispatchable renewable electricity and drax power station in yorkshire is the largest provider of secure supply in the uks electricity system its renewable biomass generation provides 26gw of electricity representing 4 of the uks dispatchable capacity and supplies millions of homes and businesses with dispatchable reliable power the project at drax power station is expected to be the worlds biggest engineered carbon removal project permanently removing 8mt of co 2 from the atmosphere every year by 2030 the project would see the addition of post combustion carbon capture to two of the existing biomass units using sustainable biomass and technology from draxs technology partner mitsubishi heavy industries captured co 2 would be transported and permanently stored by the groups partners in the east coast cluster vivid economics concluded that it could deliver 370 million of economic benefit for the uk during construction creating and supporting more than 10000 jobs during peak construction recent baringa research also demonstrates that drax is the uks largest source of energy security and will continue to play a vital role in the uk security of supply in to the late 2020s drax aims to source 80 of materials and services for the project from british businesses and is also working with british steel to explore opportunities for

net zero  we must ensure they support high standards 9 november 2022 carbon capture angela hepworth commercial director drax in brief the voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage dacs at scale the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is developing a set of core carbon principles ccps drax support proposed principles if theyre applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals standards around additionality and the permanence of carbon removals may apply very differently to naturebased and engineered removals something that needs to be addressed explicitly theres growing recognition in governments and environmental organisations of the urgent need to develop highintegrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective parisaligned climate goals bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  and direct air carbon capture and storage  dacs  are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely the technology is proven developers are bringing forward projects and the most forwardthinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from beccs and dacs developers yet theres a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals drax is a worldleader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of highintegrity permanent co 2 removals by 2030 from its beccs projects in the uk and the us we support the development of rigorous standards for co 2 removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the co 2 removals theyre buying such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to however the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits rather than removals to create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale rethinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency core carbon principles the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is in the process of developing a set of core carbon principles ccps and assessment framework af intended to set new threshold standards for highquality carbon credits at drax we welcome and support the principles proposed by the integrity council however its crucial theyre applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals and support rather than prevent their development many ccps are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies among the most important principles include those stating removals must be robustly quantified with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity while safeguarding commercially sensitive information removal credits should be subject to robust independent thirdparty validation and verification credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits registries must be subject to appropriate governance to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability taking account of impacts on nature the climate and society there should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates or between countries bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel and that the article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldnt trigger corresponding adjustments to countries carbon inventories however as pioneers in the field we believe that two of the core carbon principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals supporting additionality and development incentives the ccps state the greenhouse gas ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional ie they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues engineered carbon removal credits such as beccs and dacs are by their nature additional they are developed for the specific purpose of removing co 2 from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere they also rely on revenue from carbon markets  largely the voluntary market at present but potentially compliance markets such as the uk and eu ets in the future however most early projects are likely to have some form of government support eg 45q in the us or contracts for difference in the uk from outside carbon credit revenues but that support isnt intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment  project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets engineered carbon removals have high upfront capital costs and its clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable additionality assessments should be riskbased if its clear that a technologytype is additional a technologylevel assessment should be sufficient this should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects compensating against nonpermanent storage on the topic of permanence that ccps state the ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent or if they have a risk of reversal any reversals shall be fully compensated a key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small  the risk of reversal for naturebased credits by contrast is much greater schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for naturebased credits are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool potentially as much as 10 are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a wellmanged geological store they also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators similarly where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with co 2 storage risk which place liabilities on storage owners operators or governments the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers at drax we believe the ccps provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals if applied pragmatically they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product theyre buying and provide a clear framework for project developers they can ensure that standards support rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as beccs and dacs which are essential to achieving our global climate goals tags technology  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture carbon removals is a global need the us is making it possible will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 20 october 2022 carbon capture key takeaways removing carbon from the atmosphere is urgent if we are to meet global climate targets the uss commitment to supporting carbon removal technologies creates an opportunity for new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs power stations the market for carbon credits is gaining increasing credibility and verification making it a source of financing for ambitious decarbonization projects carbon markets are needed now to make investment into vital removals projects possible in the us and globally after a summer of soaring temperatures across the northern hemisphere the global nature of climate change is more obvious than ever forest fires around the world in 2021 resulted in double the loss of tree cover than in 2001 while today more than 23 billion people face water stress from drought its clear that the action we take to help tackle the global climate emergency must be international too we believe that carbon dioxide co 2  removals will be crucial in addressing this global challenge experts and governments agree that in addition to economywide decarbonization removing carbon from the atmosphere is critical to meeting the goal of net zero co 2 emissions by midcentury the ipcc says 10 billion tons per year of removals will be needed in 2050 for the world to get to net zero thats a huge step up from the 40 million tons captured globally in 2021 but also a significant investment opportunity our ambition is to remove 4 million tons of co 2 through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs outside the uk per year while generating renewable baseload electricity and supporting healthy sustainable forests the likely contender for our first location the united states we already operate in communities across the us south employing more than 1200 people in our sustainable biomass pellet production  now we are preparing to build a new beccs power station in the region its clear to us that the us is an ideal market for beccs with its longrunning sustainable forest industry and range of suitable sites for permanent co 2 storage we see the countrys efforts to retire coal by 2030 and commitment to innovation as an opportunity to build one of the largest carbon removal projects in the us our first plant could be capable of permanently removing 2 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year while also generating 2terawatt hours of 247 renewable power the uss newly legislated commitment to tackling climate change through the inflation reduction act as well as the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent scenario planning for 100 clean electricity system are establishing it as the leading market to deploy new environmental technologies and a new frontier for permanent highquality emissions removals the need for high quality permanent emissions removals a net zero future is only possible through the widespread implementation of highintegrity carbon removals beccs offers this by combining low carbon renewable biomass power generation with carbon capture technology and secure permanent carbon sequestration beccs works by generating renewable electricity using biomass sourced from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 as they grow co 2 released in the generation process is captured and stored permanently and safely in geological rock formations the overall process removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it emits resulting in negative emissions this allows us to offer decarbonizing industries highquality carbon removals credits given the scale of co 2 that must be removed from the atmosphere and the importance for countries and companies around the world to reach net zero i believe this market for verified co 2 removal credits is a trilliondollar opportunity voluntary carbon markets have historically suffered from a lack of sustained and reliable investment due to fluctuating market prices and varying quality of the carbon credits they contain however increased oversight from investors ngos and independent bodies is encouraging credibility and integrity prompting sustained adoption by businesses will gardiner drax group ceo weve demonstrated the growing appetite for carbon removals by signing the worlds largest carbon removals deal to date at new york climate week the agreement with respira an impactdriven carbon finance business  will allow it to purchase 400000 metric tons of co 2 removals cdrs a year from our north american operations this would enable other corporations and financial institutions to achieve their own co 2 emissions reduction targets by purchasing cdrs from respira deals like these make voluntary carbon markets a more effective means of reducing net co 2 emissions by securing commitments and driving investment in projects that deliver independently verified highquality emissions reductions as the global economy works towards its net zero targets co 2 removals will be crucial in reducing the still dangerously high levels of carbon in our atmosphere today beccs stands to be a powerful tool in a net zero future as the only technology capable of delivering both high quality permanent carbon removals while also delivering baseload renewable power the ability to generate power with negative emissions will be crucial for increasingly electrified economies as they move away from fossil fuels the potential for the us driven by a dynamic mix of markets investors and engaged consumers some of the most prominent us companies are pledging to reach net zero investing in 247 renewable power and other means to do so technology companies like alphabet apple and microsoft have laid out ambitious plans to decarbonize operations supply chains and even remove historic emissions other organizations like the first movers coalition include us companies from a range of sectors committing corporate purchasing power to solving difficult decarbonization challenges  this industry readiness is increasingly backed up by legislative policy action the recent inflation reduction act substantially increases the availability of the 45q tax credit for carbon capture and storage projects increasing their value from 50 a ton of carbon removals to 85 per ton helping to further support the business case needed to deploy technologies like beccs we believe the us is on the right track to create a market in which beccs can thrive the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent 100 clean electricity system report includes beccs in three of the four possible scenarios explored it forecasts the us will need between 714gw of installed beccs capacity by 2035 to achieve an electricity system with net zero co 2 emissions that equates to removals of approximately 55120 mt co 2 per year by 2035 the uss established forestry commercial industry with its credible commitment to sustainable management offers ample lowgrade wood and wood industry residues to power beccs the countrys longrunning exploration of co 2 capture and transport and history of industrial innovations means there are the skills supply chains and regulatory environment to undertake ambitious new infrastructure projects beccs is a proven technology and one that can scale up sooner than any other technology but action is needed now to make these markets that can deliver large scale carbon removals projects a reality action is needed now for responsible businesses with the desire to go further faster or for sectors still developing viable decarbonization routes carbon removals from beccs deliver real verifiable and permanent progress towards net zero and beyond to net negative its encouraging to see the us pass legislation that can facilitate investment into carbon removal technologies and develop the carbon credit market however carbon markets must have standards that are credible both in the business community and in the environmental and civil society collaboration between governments corporations and ngos will be critical to ensure we create systems that can tackle the climate emergency we cant afford to contemplate theoretical net zero futures buying and selling highquality permanent removals is the action we need today now is the time to capture the opportunity and be part of the solution together tags technology  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  united states  carbon

cluster contributes 18 billion a year to the uk economy and supports 360000 jobs in heavy industry and manufacturing as demand for industrial products with green credentials rises and net zero targets demand decarbonisation businesses in the humber need to begin implementing carbon capture at scale the size of the humber and diversity of industries make it a significant challenge but if we get it right the humber will be a world leader in decarbonisation without investment in decarbonisation infrastructure the region risks losing its status as a world leading industrial cluster putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk when the iconic humber bridge opened in june 1981 it did more than just set records for its size it connected the region uniting both communities and industries and allowing the humber to become what it is today a thriving industrial hub that contributes more than 18 billion to the uk economy and supports some 360000 jobs as the uk works towards a lowcarbon future the shift to a green economy will require new regional infrastructure that once again unites the humbers people and businesses around a shared goal while the humber bridge connected the region across the estuary waters a new subterranean pipeline that can transport the carbon captured from industries will unify the regions decarbonisation efforts its infrastructure that will be crucial in helping the uk reach its net zero goals but also cement the humbers position as a global decarbonisation leader the humber bridge capturing carbon across the humber capturing carbon  preventing emissions from entering the atmosphere and storing them safely and permanently is a fundamental part of decarbonising the economy and tackling climate change aside from the chemical engineering required to extract carbon dioxide co 2  from industrial emissions one of the key challenges of carbon capture is how you transport it at scale to secure storage locations such as below the north sea bed where the carbon can be permanently trapped and sequestered  click to viewdownload engineers at drax power station at drax were pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology but carbon capture will play an important role in decarbonising a wide range of industries the humber region not only produces about 20 of the uks electricity its also a major hub for chemicals refining steel making and other carbonintensive industries the consequence of this industrial mix is that the humbers carbon footprint per head of population is bigger than anywhere else in the country at an international level its the second largest industrial cluster by co 2 emissions in the whole of western europe if the uk is to reach net zero the humber must decarbonise and carbon capture and storage will be instrumental in achieving that the scale of the challenge in the humber also makes it an opportunity to significantly reduce the countrys overall emissions and break new ground implementing carbon capture innovations across a wide range of industries these diverse businesses can be united in their collective efforts and connected through shared decarbonisation infrastructure  equipment to capture emissions pipelines to transport them and a shared site to store them safely and permanently economies of scale through shared infrastructure the idea of a co 2 transport pipeline traversing the humber might sound unusual but largescale natural gas pipelines have crisscrossed the region since the late 1960s when gas was dispatched from the easington terminal on the east yorkshire coast under the humber to killingholme in north lincolnshire further the uks existing legislation creates an environment to ensure they can be operated safely and effectively co 2 is a very stable molecule compared to natural gas and there are already thousands of miles of co 2 pipelines operating around the us where its historically been used in oil recovery a shared pipeline also offers economies of scale for companies to implement carbon capture allowing the humbers cluster of carbonintensive industries to invest in vital infrastructure in a costeffective way the diversity of different industries in the region from renewable baseload power generation at drax to cuttingedge hydrogen production  also offers a chance to experiment and showcase whats possible at scale the humbers position as an estuary onto the north sea is also advantageous its expansive layers of porous sandstone offer an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space the humber estuary but this isnt just an opportunity to decarbonise the uks most emissionsintensive region its a stage to present a new green industrial hub to the world a hub that could create as many as 47800 jobs including high quality technical and construction roles as well as other jobs throughout supply chains and the wider uk economy british innovation as a global export as industries of all kinds across the world race to decarbonise theres an increasing demand for products with green credentials if we can decarbonise products from the region such as steel  it will give uk businesses a global edge failure to follow through on environmental ambitions however will not just damage the clusters status it will put hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk breaking new ground is difficult but there are firstmover advantages the products and processes trialled and run at scale within the humber offer intellectual property that industrial hubs around the world are searching for creating a new export for the uk but this vision of a decarbonised humber that exports both its products and knowledge to the world is only possible if we take the right action now we have a genuine global leadership position if we dont act now that will be lost through projects like zero carbon humber and the east coast cluster  alongside net zero teesside the regions businesses have shown our collective commitment to implementing decarbonisation at scale through collaboration as a track 1 cluster  the humber presents one of the uks greatest opportunities to level up  attracting global
