biomass energy the 8 biggest things in renewable energy 18 july 2018 power generation powering a whole country is a big task the equipment that make up power stations and electricity systems are measured in tonnes and miles and pump gigawatts gw of electricity around the country with the worlds electricity increasingly coming from renewables this big thinking is key to powering longterm change from taller wind turbines to bigger batteries these are the massive structures breaking energy records germanys giant wind turbine and the plan to beat it as wind power becomes ever more prevalent one of the key questions that needs answering is how to get more out of it one way is to build taller turbines and longer blades  putting turbines higher into the air sets them into stronger wind flows while longer blades increase their generating capacity the worlds tallest wind turbines are currently in gaildorf germany and stand at 178 metres with the blades tips reaching 2465 metres  built by max b√∂gl wind ag the onshore turbines house a 34 megawatt mw generator that can produce around 105 gigawatt hours gwh per year however turbines continue to grow and ge has announced plans for the haliadex turbine  which will ship in 2021 at 259 metres in total the offshore turbine is almost double the height of the london eye and will spin 106 metre blades generating 67 gwh per year chinas great wall of solar china has pumped substantial investment into solar power including the worlds biggest solar plant in electricity generation and sheer size dubbed the great wall of solar the tengger desert solar park has a capacity of more than 15 gw and covers 43 km 2 of desert the next largest by comparison is indias kurnool ultra mega solar park which covers just 24 km 2 and generates 1 gw however rampant investment by the country means there are several projects in the pipeline that will break the 2 gw mark and will set new records for solar power plants morocco takes solar to new heights concentrated solar power csp takes the technology skywards by using thousands of mirrors known as heliostats and focusing the suns rays towards a central tower this heats up molten salt within the tower which is then combined with water to create steam and power a turbine  like in a thermal power plant moroccos noor ouarzazate facility pictured in the main photo of this article is home to the worlds tallest csp towers at 250 metres tall 7400 heliostats beam the sunlight at each tower which have a capacity of 150 mw and can store molten salt for 75 hours its record will soon be matched by israels 121 mw ashalim solar thermal power station when it begins operating this year however never one to be outdone when it comes to tall structures dubai plans to build a 260 metre csp tower in 2020 as part of the mohammed bin rashid al maktoum solar park which at 700 mw will be the worlds largest singlesite csp facility three gorges dam chinas monster mountain dam the three gorges dam on chinas yangtza river might be the worlds most powerful hydropower dam with its massive 225 gw capacity but a different chinese dam holds the title of the worlds tallest jinpingi hydropower station is a 305metretall arch dam on the yalong river it sits on the jinping bend where the river wraps around the entire jinping mountain range the project began in 2005 and was completed with the commissioning of a sixth and final generator in 2014 which brought its total capacity to 36 gw itaipu dam and hydropower station brazil and paraguays river arrangement while it may be tall at 568 metreslong jinpingi is far from the longest that mantle belongs to the 7919 metrelong itaipu dam and hydropower station that straddles brazil and paraguay and has an installed capacity of 14 gw the power station is home to 20 700 mw generators however as brazils electricity system runs at 60hz and paraguays at 50hz  10 of the generators run at each frequency  biomass domes that could hide the albert hall using a relatively new material such as compressed wood pellets as a renewable alternative to coal in large thermal power stations creates new challenges  biomass ecostore domes help tackle storage problems by keeping the materials dry and maintaining the right temperatures and conditions unlike cylindrical concrete silos domes also offer greater resistance to hurricanes and extreme weather this is important in areas such as louisiana where this low carbon fuel is stored at the drax biomass port facility in 357 metre high 616 metre diameter domes before it is shipped to drax power station the power station itself is home to four of the worlds largest biomass domes each is 503 metres high and 63 metres in diameter  enough to hold the albert hall or in draxs case 71000 tonnes of biomass  south korean coastline takes the most from the tides beginning operation 1966 the rance tidal power station  in france was the first and largest facility of its kind for 45 years the power station made use of the 750 metrelong rance barrage on frances northern coast with a 330metrelong section of it generating electricity through 24 10 mw turbines it was overtaken however in 2011 with the opening of the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea the facility generates power along a 400metre section of the 127 km sihwa lake tidal barrage and generates a maximum of 254 mw through ten 254 mw submerged turbines the battle to beat teslas giant battery south australia has become a battlefield in the race to build the worlds biggest grid scale storage solution tesla constructed a 10000 m 2  football pitchsized 100 mw lithiumion battery outside of adelaide at the end of 2017 which is connected to a wind power plant and can independently supply electricity to 30000 homes for an hour however rival billionaire to teslas elon musk sanjeev gupta plans to take on the storage facility with a 140 mw battery to support a new solarpowered steelworks also in south australia the excitement around battery technologys potential means the title of worlds biggest will likely swap hands plenty more times over the next decade this contest wont just be confined to batteries as countries increasingly move away from fossil fuels bigger wider and taller renewable structures will be needed to power the world these are the worlds largest renewable structures today but they probably wont stay in those positions for long tags biomass energy  tidal power  renewable energy  hydroelectric power 6 startups ideas and power plants shaping biomass 4 june 2018 sustainable bioenergy humans have used wood as a source of fuel for over a million years  modern biomass power however is a far cry from humans early taming of fire and this is down to constant research and innovation in fact today its one of the most extensively researched areas in energy and environmental studies with biomass accounting for 64 of total renewable energy production in the eu in 2015 the development isnt likely to stop ongoing advancements in the field are helping the technology become more sustainable and efficient in reducing emissions here are seven of the projects businesses ideas and technologies pushing biomass further into the future torrefaction  supercharging biomass pellets when it comes to making biomass as efficient as possible its all down to each individual pellet improving whats known as the calorific value of each pellet increases the overall amount of energy released when they are used in a power station one emerging process aiming to improve this is torrefaction which involves heating biomass to between 250 and 300 degrees celsius in a lowoxygen environment this drives out moisture and volatiles from woody feedstocks straw and other biomass sources before it is turned into a black biocoal pellet which has a very high calorific value this year estonian company baltania is constructing the first industrialscale torrefaction plant in the country with the target output of 160000 tonnes of biocoal pellets per year if its successful power stations worldwide may be able to get more power from each little pellet biobean  powered by caffeine biofuels dont just come from forest residues every day more than two billion cups of coffee are consumed globally as people get themselves caffeinated for the day ahead in london alone this need for daily stimulation results in more than 200000 tonnes of coffee waste produced every year more often than not this ends up in landfills biobean aims to change this by collecting used coffee grounds from cafes offices and factories and recycling them into biofuels and biochemicals the company now recycles as much as 50000 tonnes of coffee grounds annually while one of its products b20 biodiesel has been used to power london buses biobean also produces briquettes and pellets which like woody biomass can serve as an alternative to coal biomass gasification  increasing the value of biomass waste biogas is often seen as a promising biofuel with fewer emissions than burning fossil fuels or biomass pellets its an area undergoing significant research as it points to another means of creating highervalue products from biomass matter the finnish town of vaasa is home to the worlds largest gasification plant  the facility is part of a coal plant where cofiring biogas with coal has allowed it to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions by as much as 230000 tonnes per year as well as reducing emissions cofiring allows the power plant to use 25 to 40 less coal and when demand is low in the autumn and spring months the plant runs entirely on biogas more than that the forestry residues which are used to produce the biogas are sourced locally from within 100 km of site as part of our transition away from coal cofiring biomass with that fossil fuel took place at drax power station from 2003 until full unit conversions became a reality in 2013 lynemouth power station  powering the move away from coal after 44years the coalfired lynemouth power station in northumberland is the latest uk power producer converting to biomassfuel set for completion this year the plant will supply 390 mw of lowcarbon electricity to the national grid enough to power 700000 homes  every new power station conversion poses different challenges as well as the opportunity to develop new solutions but none are as crucial as the conversion of the materials handling equipment from coal to biomass pellets while coal can sit in the rain for long periods of time and still be used biomass must be kept dry with storage conditions constantly monitored and adjusted to prevent sudden combustion at lynemouth the handling of 14 million tonnes of biomass annually has required the construction of three 40metre high concrete storage silos as well as extensive conveyor systems to unload and transport biomass around the plant biotrans  two birds with one stone energy and food are both undergoing serious changes to make them more sustainable danish startup biotrans is tackling both challenges by using one of the food industrys key pain points  wastage  to create energy with its biogas systems the company installs systems that collect leftover food from restaurants and canteens and stores it in odourproof tanks before collecting and turning it into biogas for heating and electricity production more than just utilising this waste stream the byproduct of the gasification process can also be sold as a fertiliser drax and ccapture  cutting emissions from the source carbon capture usage and storage ccus is one of the most important fields in the energy sector today the technologys ability to capture co 2 from the electricity generation process and turn it into a revenue source before it can enter the atmosphere means its attracting significant investment and research drax is partnering with ccapture  a company spun out of the university of leeds chemistry department to trial a new form of ccus the pilot scheme will launch in november and aims to capture a tonne of co 2 per day from one of draxs biomass units ccaptures technology could make the process of capturing and storing co 2 less costly and energy intensive it does this using a specially developed solvent capable of isolating co 2 before being recycled through the system and capturing more if the pilot proves successful the technology could be implemented at an industrial scale seeing up to 40 of the co 2 in the flue gases from draxs biomass units captured and stored if the technology tested at drax leads to the construction of a purposebuilt carbon capture unit elsewhere scientists and engineers at ccapture believe the co 2 captured could exceed 90 back in north yorkshire the eventual goal is negative carbon emissions from drax power station  its biomass units already deliver carbon savings of more than 80 compared to when they used coal and if a new revenue stream can be developed from the sale of the carbon captured then the power produced from biomass at the power station could become even more cost effective with thanks to biomass uk and the european biomass

sustainability  biomass energy how great britains breakthrough year for renewables could have powered the past 21 february 2018 power generation after a year of smashing renewable records  great britains electricity system is less dependent on fossil fuels than ever before over the course of 2017 lowcarbon energy sources including nuclear as well as renewables accounted for half of all electricity production the finding comes from electric insights  a quarterly research paper on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the latest report highlights how great britains electricity system is rapidly moving away from fossil fuels with coal and gas dropping from 80 of the electricity mix in 2010 to 50 in 2017 its an impressive change for eight years but its even more dramatic when compared to 60 years ago powering the past with renewables in 2017 renewable output grew 27 over 2016 and produced 96 terawatt hours twh of electricity  enough to power the entire country in 1958 back then great britain was dependent on one fuel coal it was the source of 92 of the countrys power and its highcarbon intensity meant emissions from electricity generation sat at 93 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  compare that to just three million tonnes of co 2 emissions from roughly the same amount of power generated in 2017 just by renewables today the electricity system is much more diverse than in 1958 in fact with nuclear added to renewable generation 2017s total lowcarbon capacity produced enough power to fulfil the electricity needs of 1964s beatlemania britain but whats enabled this growth in renewable generation one answer as bob dylan explained a year earlier is blowin in the wind read the full article here powering the past  stormy weather powering great britain wind power experienced a watershed year in 2017 thanks to blusterier weather and a wave of new wind farm installations coming online wind generation grew 45 between 2016 and 2017 windfarms both onshore and offshore produced 15 of the entire countrys electricity output in 2017 up from 10 in 2016 the 45 twh it generated over the course of the year was almost double that of coal  and theres potential for this to increase in 2018 as more capacity comes online the 16 gigawatts gw of new offshore wind turbines installed in great britain last year accounted for 53 of the net 315 gw installed across europe  with large offshore farms at dudgeon and race bank still being commissioned the 32 gw of total new operating capacity registered in 2017 across offshore as well as onshore wind is on course to grow coauthor of the article renewableuks head of external affairs luke clark said these figures underline that renewables are central to our changing power system higher wind speeds and a jump in installed capacity drove a dramatic increase in the amount of clean power generated alongside breaking multiple records for peak output wind energy continued to cut costs as wind power is dependent on weather conditions it is intermittent in its generation but in 2017 more than one storm offered ideal conditions for wind turbines during q4 there were three named storms as well as the remnants of a hurricane all battering the british isles all of which helped push average wind speeds 5 higher than in 2016 while calculating wind power based on wind speed is complex  windier weather means more power  monthly average wind speed is proportional to monthly average power output from wind farms while the 2017 annual average wind speed of 101mph was in line with the countrys longterm average wind generation was not consistent across the year in q4 wind output was close to an average of 7 gw by contrast between may and august it was closer to 4 gw thankfully these calmer months saw longer hours of daylight allowing solar power to compensate read the full article here wind power grows 45 driving down carbon emissions the knockon effect of an increase in renewable generation is a drop in the carbon intensity of electricity production and in 2017 this reached a new low across the year carbon emissions including those from imported sources totalled 72 million tonnes down 12 from 2016 this decrease is equal to 150 kg of co 2 saved per person or taking 47 million cars off the roads the least carbon intensive period of the quarter came just after midnight in the early hours of monday 2 october when it measured a record low of 56 grammes per kilowatt hour gkwh thanks to low fossil fuel generation and high levels of renewables over the whole year there were 139 hours when carbon intensity dipped below 100 gkwh this generally required 50 of the electricity mix to come from renewable sources and demand to be lower than 30 gw for carbon intensity to dip under 100 gkwh on a more permanent basis greater renewable capacity will be required as demand rises read the full article here carbon emissions down 12 interconnectors meeting future demand electricity demand in great britain has been on the decline since 2002 primarily due to more efficient buildings and appliances  and a decline in heavy manufacturing however this is expected to change over the coming years as more electric vehicles are introduced and the heating system is electrified to help meet 2050 carbon emissions targets while installing greater renewable capacity will be crucial in meeting this demand with lowcarbon power interconnectors will also play a significant role particularly from france which boasts a large nuclear and lowcarbon capacity however electricity sales through interconnectors are often based on dayahead prices rather than the live market which can lead to trades that arent reflective of demand on each sides of the channel in q4 there were eight halfhours when demand was very high more than 50 gw yet power was being exported this occurred despite dayahead prices suggesting traders would lose money due to lower demand in france and the cost of using the interconnector it highlights the need for improvements in internetwork trading as great britain increases its intermittent renewable generation and looks to a greater reliance on importing and exporting power read the full article here moving electricity across the channel great britains electricity system continues to break its

tags wind power  decarbonisation  investors  electric insights  coal  biomass energy how do you keep a 12 tonne steel ball in prime condition 18 january 2018 power generation there are 600 giant balls at drax power station each one weighs 12 tonnes  roughly the same as a saloon car  and is designed for one simple but very specific purpose to pulverise every day thousands of tonnes of biomass and coal are delivered to the power station to fuel its generators but before this fuel can be combusted it must be ground into a powder in pulverising mills so it burns quicker and more efficiently its the giant balls that do the grinding and although these balls may be incredibly durable the constant smashing crushing and pulverising they go through on a daily basis can take its toll maintaining the 600 balls across the power stations 60 mills is a vital part of keeping the plant running as effectively as possible surviving the pulveriser each of the six generating units at drax three biomass and three coal has up to 10 mills that feed it fuel all of which operate at extreme conditions inside each one 10 metal balls rotate 37 times a minute at roughly 3 mph exerting 80 tonnes of pressure crushing all fuel in its path air is then blasted in at 190 degrees celsius to dry the crushed fuel and blow it into the boiler at a rate of 40 tonnes per hour to survive these extremities the balls must be tough drax works with a local foundry in scunthorpe lincolnshire to manufacture them first they are cast as hollow orbs of nickel steel or chrome iron and then smoothed to within one millimetre of being perfectly spherical after 8000 hours of use engineers check how rapidly theyre wearing down by measuring their thickness using ultrasound equipment and if deemed to be too thin which usually occurs after about 50000 hours of use replace them for this they must first remove the top of the mill  including the grinding top ring  and then individually lift out and replace each massive ball those that are removed are typically shipped back to scunthorpe to be recycled transforming for a decarbonised future when drax power station was first built in the 1970s  the mills were designed to only crush coal but since it was upgraded to run primarily on biomass in the form of sustainable wood pellets  they have been adapted to work with the new fuel for the most part this requires only minor changes  the primary difference is that coal is harder to fully pulverise coal typically does not get entirely ground down in the first cycle so a classifier is needed in the mill to separate the heavier particles and recirculate them for further grinding the process of switching one mill from biomass to coal takes about seven days and nights this work was carried out on unit 4s mills ahead of this winter following biomass trials in the spring and summer of 2017 now that the decision has been made to permanently upgrade that fourth power generation unit  converting one of its 10 mills from coal to biomass later in 2018 will take about twice as long using the same essential equipment and process for both fuels helps to quicken the pace of decarbonisation at drax power

2018 investors rns number  1114c drax group plc drax welcomes the uk government response to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme which will enable drax to convert a fourth unit to biomass the response proposes that rather than imposing a cap on roc 1 support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all roc 1 units this would protect existing converted units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum the response would enable drax to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax will now continue its work to deliver the low cost conversion of a fourth biomass unit accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply drax plans to complete the work on this unit as part of a major planned outage in the second half of 2018 before returning to service in late 2018 the capital cost is significantly below the level of previous conversions repurposing the existing cofiring facility on site to deliver biomass to the unit the unit will likely operate with lower availability than the three existing converted units but the intention is for it to run at periods of higher demand which are often those of higher carbon intensity allowing optimisation of roc 1 generation across three roc 1 accredited units the cfd 2 unit remains unaffected will gardiner chief executive of drax group commented we welcome the governments support for further sustainable biomass generation at drax which will allow us
