between electricity supply and demand by 2025 andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 26 january 2016 opinion by 2025 the uk will face a 4055 per cent gap between electricity supply and demand according to a report from the institute of mechanical engineers  the government has disputed imeches projection but its own forecasting suggests that uk electricity demand will be 19 higher in 2035 vs 2015  the alleged 2025 gap will be caused by the closure of coalfired power stations to meet targets for carbon reduction according to the imeche current plans to plug the gap by building new gasfired capacity are unrealistic it would require a staggering 30 new power stations to be planned and built from scratch within the next 10 years at drax we have already developed a solution we can do it quickly cheaply and safely in fact it would drastically reduce the time and money involved in building all of those 30 new gas power stations from scratch weve already adapted three of our coalfired generating units to use highdensity pellets made from compressed lowgrade wood and were using worldbeating technology developed by our own engineers here in the uk to do it in all around four or five per cent of the uks entire electricity needs every single day of the year are already being met thanks to our unique biomass technology at drax its an approach that could be adopted elsewhere in the country providing a huge contribution to plugging the electricity gap our highdensity compressed wood pellets are the only nonfossil fuel that can bring about these changes in the time we have left given the right support within two or three years we could convert the remaining three units at drax power station to run on biomass wood pellets with all six units converted plus lynemouth power station  which already has that future secured  and one or two other smaller biomass power stations around 10 per cent of the uks electricity could be generated using this technology well before 2025  long before new gasfired capacity could come on stream the costs involved would be dramatically lower too we invested around 650 million to convert three generating units develop a supply chain and build new storage at drax it is estimated that the equivalent in new combined cycle gas turbine power stations would cost more as it would be new rather than repurposed infrastructure energy hierarchy the imeche has developed an energy hierarchy listing five sustainabilityrelated priorities against which to judge any future energy strategy the two that focus on energy generation are a perfect fit in terms of coaltobiomass conversions at drax and lynemouth priority 3  utilisation of renewable sustainable resources high density compressed wood pellets are made from lowgrade wood sourced according to the highest levels of forestry conservation priority 5  utilisation of conventional resources as we do now using worldleading engineering skills and avoiding the need to build brand new power stations our coal units can be converted without the need for new national grid connections many of our european neighbours such as sweden and germany already use a far higher proportion of biomass to meet their energy needs catching up with the european average is the simplest quickest and most affordable way to avoid a shortfall between supply and demand predicted by 2015
