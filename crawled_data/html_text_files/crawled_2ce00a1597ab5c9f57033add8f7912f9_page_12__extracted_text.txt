of drax group and will gardiner  chief executive officer ceo of drax group will make the following comments philip cox cbe chairman said 2017 was an important year for the group with the development of our strategy a new dividend policy and the departure of dorothy thompson who announced her intention to stand down as ceo i would like to thank dorothy for her enormous contribution to the group over the last 13 years dorothy is succeeded by will gardiner who was previously group chief financial officer cfo and a key architect of our strategy his appointment follows a thorough review of internal and external candidates and is a natural progression after two years working alongside dorothy developing our strategy which remains clear and unchanged i am confident this strategy will create significant benefits for all draxs stakeholders will gardiner ceo said i am very pleased to have taken over as ceo of the drax group i have greatly enjoyed working alongside dorothy thompson for the past two years as cfo having worked closely with the board and executive team  i know that i will be leading a great team i have also worked closely on developing our strategy and i look forward to continuing to deliver it and taking advantage of the opportunities ahead in 2017 we made significant progress with the strategy we announced in december 2016  we completed the acquisition of opus energy  a leading challenger brand in the uk small and mediumsized enterprise sme energy market we acquired a third biomass pellet plant  lasalle bioenergy  which significantly increases our pellet production capacity and we continued to develop options for flexible gas generation at four sites around the uk as well as the exploration of coaltogas repowering at drax power station to support our strategy we completed a refinancing in may and announced a new dividend policy in june we have a major role to play in supporting the uk energy system as it becomes increasingly ambitious in decarbonising with confirmation of government support for further biomass generation at drax power station we are working on a fourth biomass unit conversion  through this flexible lowcarbon and customerfocused approach we aim to deliver higher quality earnings with a reduction in commodity exposure alongside opportunities for growth safety remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we have performed well in this regard although we continue to work to improve our performance across the group biomass is a challenging fuel to manage we work very hard to manage it carefully but unfortunately in december we had a fire at drax power station it cost us several weeks of production but most importantly no one was hurt we are currently incorporating the lessons learned from that incident in our operations to ensure that we operate as safely as we can our financial performance which we measure with reference to ebitda was 229 million in 2017 significantly ahead of 2016 140 million this increase was principally from producing high levels of renewable power from sustainable biomass and growth in our energy supply and pellet production businesses i am very pleased that all three of our businesses generated positive ebitda 1 last year for the first time in june we announced a new dividend policy this policy is to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected to grow as the implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows in determining the rate of growth in dividends the board will take account of contracted cash flows the less predictable cash flows from the groups commodity based business and future investment opportunities if there is a buildup of capital the board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders for 2017 we are recommending a total basic dividend of 50 million 123 pence per share inclusive of a final dividend of 30 million equivalent to 74 pence per share we are also currently undertaking a 50 million share buyback programme this is consistent with our capital allocation policy and commitment to returns to shareholders sustainability remains at the heart of the business both the specific sustainability of biomass and more broadly the longterm sustainability of the group biomass sustainability is in the financial and longterm interests of the business and we always strive to ensure all our pellets comply with our policy it is fundamental to us that the biomass we use is sustainable and meets statutory requirements we have a dedicated sustainability team whose role is to ensure the wood pellets we manufacture and use to generate electricity meet the requirements we have set ourselves in our sustainability policy and the criteria for sustainable biomass as established by the uk government philip cox cbe chairman added the board and its committees play an active role in guiding the company and leading its strategy we greatly value the contribution made by our nonexecutive directors and during a time of transition their role is especially important the board has been complemented by the appointment of two new nonexecutives firstly david nussbaum  whose indepth knowledge of sustainability will support our continued focus in this area and secondly nicola hodson  whose experience in technology business transformation and energy will provide real value as the group delivers its strategy as a board we are well aware that to achieve our strategic objectives our commitment to diversity is crucial and reducing our gender pay gap is an important part of this we must do more to attract retain and progress women to ensure were an employer of choice for everyone who sees their future in energy in this context we are supportive of the goals of hampton alexander  it only remains for me to say that your board remains totally committed to the complementary aims of delivering sustainable longterm value for the group

northernmost reaches of europe iceland already generates all its electricity from renewable sources this is split between 75 hydropower and 25 geothermal power  geothermal not only offers a renewable source of electricity but also hot water for heating the volcanic island nation a geothermal power station steams on a cold day in iceland hydropower is also a key contributor to norways renewable ambitions with more than 31 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower capacity norway is able to rely on it as a source of electricity and export its plentiful oil and natural gas reserves to countries still dependent on fossil fuels many parts of europe are well suited to hydropower with reliable rainfall and the mountainous topography necessary to construct dams and power stations parts of austria romania and georgia also make substantial use of hydropower as a source of electricity artificial lake behind the bicaz dam at sunset romania for countries without this access to largescale hydropower its the increased installation of renewables that holds the key to eliminating the need for coal growing renewable generation last year saw electricity generation from renewable sources overtake that from coal for the first time thanks to continuous expansion of wind solar and biomass capacity around the continent between 2010 and 2017 generation from wind solar and biomass installations in eu countries more than doubled from 302 terawatt hours twh to 670 twh according to eurostat  driven primarily by an increase in wind capacity as a source of renewable electricity wind has already proved capable of generating major portions of a countrys demand managing to meet 44 of denmarks overall demand in 2017  this was after previously producing a 40 electricity surplus one day for the country  allowing it to export the emissionfree electricity to neighbours wind turbines on the east coast of sweden across the eu generation from wind more than doubled from 150 twh to 364 twh from 2010 to last year while solar generation grew five times from 23 twh to 119 twh and biomass jumped from 129 twh to 196 twh by contrast coal and lignite fell from 818 twh to 669 twh these renewable electricity sources along with hydropower now account for 30 of eu countries collective electricity generation and while coal generation continues to drop other low carbon energy sources particularly nuclear still play essential roles in many european energy systems from coal to low carbon sweden is one of the leaders in renewable electricity generation setting 2040 as the date to move to totally renewable energy however while it currently counts 65 gw of wind capacity installed and has already exceeded its 2020 renewable generation goals  the countrys 10 nuclear reactors still make up 40 of its electricity output  sweden aims to phasenuclear out of its energy mix but this will force it to import more power from neighbours to meet demand  france is even more dependent with nuclear making up 75 of its electricity production and earning more than 3 billion a year for the country in exports it aims to reduce its nuclear generation to 50 with president emmanuel macron claiming continued nuclear generation offers  the most carbonfree way to produce electricity with renewables  fessenheim nuclear and hydroelectric power plants in alsace france as a reliable and lowcarbon source of electricity the most modern nuclear power stations add a certain amount of flexibility to grids enabling greater adoption of intermittent renewable sources across the eu nuclear made up a quarter of electricity generation in 2017  gas in the transition much more flexible than nuclear gas plays an essential role in many countries it accounted for 19 of electricity generation in the eu last year and produces around half the co 2 and just one tenth of the air pollutants of coal  gas turbines can begin generating electricity at full power in just 30 minutes from a cold start  or 10 minutes from warm standby allowing it to plug any gaps in demand left by intermittent renewables its ability to provide many system services such as reserve power and frequency response will see it play an important transition role over the coming decades until cleaner technologies are able to take over artists impression of a drax rapidresponse gas power station ocgt with planning permission coal is

spring day on record averaging 38c the six days from 26 february to 3 march highlighted in blue were the coldest britain has been since christmas 2010 this pushed electricity demand up 10 as people used more electric heating to keep warm the evening peak demand on 1 march was the highest in three years and so was not stretching the system to its limits electricity prices rose to five times the average for the quarter they peaked at 990 per megawatt hour mwh for half an hour and also fell to 150 per mwh as the market became volatile coal generation surged for the weeks surrounding the cold spell not because more output from conventional plants was needed but rising gas prices made it more economical to burn than gas total generation from fossil fuels remained around 2025 gw biomass and hydro ran solidly throughout the cold spell wind output was particularly high when it was most needed ranging from 118 to 138 gw during 1 march whilst wind certainly helped the lights would not have gone off without it as up to 19 gw of spare gas capacity was available if needed britains links to other countries were not so helpful we exported to france through much of the cold spell french electricity demand is more impacted by temperature than british as more french homes use electric heating looking in more detail at the uks links to other countries britain had been largely importing from france all year but then exported solidly through 2728 february when power prices were higher in france prices remained lower in the netherlands so britain continued importing from them britain

electrification with rapid technological improvements and falls in battery prices improving performance and reducing the cost experts predict that by 2050 90 of newbuild cars will be powered by electricity  however its not only roads where transport is decarbonising electricity may soon power more of the worlds trains plus its planes and boats taking trains forward the electrification of the rail industry has arguably been in the making for a lot longer than evs but theres still progress to be made trains are already one of the mostefficient modes of longdistance transport and network rail claims electric models carbon emissions are 20 to 35 lower than diesel trains electric trains also accelerate and brake faster than dieselpowered models and cause less wear to tracks electrified trains are already commonplace in many parts of the world  japans famously fast and reliable shinkansen railways are electric meanwhile in the uk less than 50 of the rail network is electrified  with transport secretary chris graylings recent pause on development casting doubts on previous ambitious plans to electrify 850miles of track nevertheless advancements are still being made to enable the sector to utilise solar energy as an alternative to the national power grid the concept would prove cost effective and reduce the carbon footprint of trains even further according to a report by climate change charity 1010 and researchers at imperial colleges energy futures lab rail companies could cut their annual running costs by millions of pounds through installing their own trackside solar panels to power electric trains directly with companies spending around 500 million a year on power  the savings on selfgeneration would enable them to cut fares for passengers as well as emissions take off for electric planes of all transport modes air travel has made the least progress in electrification but theres hope yet airbus rollsroyce and siemens recently teamed up to develop the technology needed to create electricallypowered aircraft the companies plan to fly a demonstrator aircraft with one of its existing jet engines replaced by an electric unit in 2020 paul stein chief technology officer at rollsroyce said aviation is the last frontier of the electrification of transport it could lead to a step change in the way we fly with greater efficiency and less noise these proposed hybridelectric aircraft are not powered by onboard batteries like evs but with a gas turbine that generates electricity to drive the propellers  this could reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 predicted mark cousin head of flight demonstration at airbus moving to electric aircraft would also help the aviation industry meet eu targets of a 60 reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  by 2020 as well as 90 less nitrogen oxides and a noise reduction of around 75 ukbased airline easyjet also announced it could be flying electric planes within a decade and is teaming up with us firm wright electric to build batterypowered aircraft according to easyjet the move would enable batterypowered aeroplanes to travel shorthaul routes such as london to paris and amsterdam and edinburgh to bristol wright electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of easyjet passengers the challenge comes in making lithiumion batteries light and safe enough for the air the airline said this was the next step in making air travel less harmful for the environment after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31 between 2000 and 2016  wright electric claims that electric planes will save up to 15 in fuel burn and co 2 emissions  be 50 quieter and 10 cheaper for airlines to buy and operate with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers testing new waters theres a lot of buzz coming out of the maritime industry too every year marine transport emits 1000 million tonnes of co 2  which is why the international maritime organization imo has agreed that a reduction of 50 should come by 2050 compared with 2008 levels although the deal fell short of more ambitious targets preferred by those ranging from the european union to environmental ngos the imo did also commit to pursue efforts toward phasing out co 2 emissions entirely as paris agreement goals to cut carbon dioxide emissions loom businesses around the world are innovating small fleets of batterypowered boats designed for fjords and inland waterways in norway belgium and the netherlands are preparing to set sail  including some able to run autonomously without a crew  dutch company portliner is also gearing up to launch the first fullyelectric emissionfree barges in europe dubbed tesla ships portliner chief executive officer ton van meegen claims these barges would be the first in the world to sail on carbonneutral batteries  the first six barges alone are expected to remove 23000 trucks from the roads annually in the netherlands replacing them with zeroemission methods of transport china also recently launched an electric cargo ship to haul coal which whilst not doing much for its ambitions to cut pollution will at least eliminate shipping emissions from diesel engines electric ships may not yet be the norm globally but progress is underway to cut the 25 of global greenhouse emissions that result from the

2018 sustainable bioenergy electricity systems around the world are decarbonising and increasingly switching to renewable power sources while intermittent sources such as solar and wind are the fastest growing types of renewables being installed globally the reliability and flexibility of biomass and its ability to offer grid stabilisation services such as frequency control and inertia make it an increasingly necessary source of renewable power according to the international energy agency biomass generation is forecast to expand as planned projects come online a versatile resource biomass comes in many different forms when looking to assess future demand and use it is important to recognise benefits that different types of biomass bring compressed wood pellets are just one small part of the biomass spectrum which includes many forms of agricultural and livestock residues waste and biproducts  much of which is currently discarded or underutilised maximising the use of these wastes and residues provides plenty of scope for expansion of the biomass energy sector around the world the global installed capacity for biomass generation is expected to reach close to 140 gigawatts gw by 2026  which will be fuelled primarily by expansion in asia using residues from food production and the forestry processing industry however the use of woody biomass can also provide many benefits too such as supplying a market for thinnings providing a use for harvesting residues encouraging better forest management practices and generating increased revenue for forest owners how much surplus exists in areas like the us south traditional markets for forest products have declined whilst forest growth has significantly increased according to the usda forest inventory and analysis fia data there is an average annual surplus of growth in the us south of more than 176 million cubic metres compared to removals  thats enough to make around 84 million tonnes of wood pellets a year from just one supply region of course not all of this surplus growth could or should be used for bioenergy much of it is suitable for high value markets like sawtimber or construction and some of it is located on inaccessible or protected sites however new and additional markets are essential to maintain the health of the forest resource and to encourage forest owners to retain and maintain their forest assets in the current wood pellet supply regions for europe pöyry management consulting has calculated that there is a surplus of low grade wood fibre and residues that could make an additional 140 million tonnes of wood pellets each year  wood pellets in context compressed wood pellets on a conveyor belt it is also necessary to look at the global production of all wood products to put wood pellet production into context in 2016 the global production of industrial roundwood the raw material used for construction furniture paper and other wood products was 187 billion cubic metres while the global production of wood fuel used for domestic heating and cooking was 186 billion cubic metres 1  only around 16 of this feedstock was used to make wood pellets both for industrial energy and residential heat the total production of wood pellets in 2016 was 284 million tonnes of which only 45 was used for industrial energy 2  while forestry consulting and research firm forisk predicts demand for industrial wood pellets those used in electricity generation rather than residential heating will grow globally at an annual rate of 15 for the next five years reaching 275 megatonnes mt by 2023 they are also clear that this growth in context will not impact forest volumes or other markets the wood pellet industry in the us south is not exploding it is a tiny component of the overall market forest volumes in the south in total will continue to grow for decades no matter what bioenergy markets or housing markets do the wood pellet sector simply and unequivocally cannot compete economically with us pulp and paper mills 80 of pulpwood demand in south for raw material on a headtohead basis 3  so while demand for wood pellets is likely to increase over the next 10 years this increase will be well within the scope of existing surplus fibre the question therefore is can suppliers keep up with this demand and can they do this while ensuring it remains sustainable reliable and renewable whats driving demand in the shortterm intelligence firm hawkins wright estimates global demand will increase by almost 30 during 2018 to reach 204 mt while forisk predicts a smaller jump an almost 5 mt increase compared to 2017 most of this will continue to come from europe 73 of global demand by 2021 more than 80 in 2018 where projects such as lynemouth power station s conversion from coal to biomass as well as five cofiring units in the netherlands are all set to come online very soon while smaller in number asia is also developing a growing appetite for biomass and in 2018 demand is forecast to grow by 198 mt these estimates might paint a picture of a continually soaring demand but forisks forecast actually expect this growth to plateau levelling off around 2023 at 275 mt hawkins wright expects a similar slow down forecasting manageable growth of under 15 between 2023 and 2026 a forestry specialist at drax group believes this plateau could come even sooner current and future forecasts in industrial wood pellet demand are based on a series of planned conversions and projects coming online he explains but once these projects are active demand in europe will likely plateau around 2021 and then gradually reduce as various eu support schemes for industrial biomass come to an end any long term use of biomass is likely to be based on agricultural residues and wastes but even with this expected slowdown the biomass demand of the near future will be substantially higher than it is right now so the question remains can suppliers meet the need for biomass pellets responding to todays growing demand meeting this growing demand depends on two factors sufficient raw materials and the production capabilities to turn those materials into biomass pellets in todays market theres no shortage of raw materials and low grade fibre instead what could cause challenges is the production of pellets hawkins wright reports the capacity for global industrial pellet production was roughly 214 mt a year at the end of 2017 and will increase by a further 3 mt by 2019 as facilities currently under construction reach completion it means that to meet even forisks conservative 275 mt prediction by 2023 pellet production needs to increase however draxs specialist points to the three to four years needed to complete pellet facilities and the relatively short period of time financial support programmes will remain in place as something that could lead to a slowdown in new plants coming online instead he says expansions of existing plants and the increased use of smallscale facilities will become crucial to increasing overall production however the biomass market changes and develops it remains critical that proper regulation is in place  efficiencies are found and that technological innovation continues within the forestry industry so forests are grown and managed sustainably as we move into a lowcarbon future we know that biomass demand will increase but for this to be truly beneficial and sustainable we need to ensure we are not only meeting the demand of today but also of tomorrow the day after tomorrow and beyond
