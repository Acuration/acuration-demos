capture and storage beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is the process of capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide co 2  from biomass organic matter energy generation why is beccs important for decarbonisation when sustainable bioenergy is paired with carbon capture and storage it becomes a source of negative emissions as co 2 is permanently removed from the carbon cycle experts believe that negative emissions technologies nets are crucial to helping countries meet the longterm goals set out in the paris climate agreement as beccs is the most scalable of these technologies this decade it has a key role to play in combating climate change how is the bioenergy for beccs generated most bioenergy is produced by combusting biomass as a fuel in boilers or furnaces to produce highpressure steam that drives electricitygenerating turbines  alternatively bioenergy generation can use a wide range of organic materials including crops specifically planted and grown for the purpose as well as residues from agriculture forestry and wood products industries energydense forms of biomass such as compressed wood pellets  enable bioenergy to be generated on a much larger scale fuels like wood pellets can also be used as a substitute for coal in existing power stations  how is the carbon captured beccs uses a postcombustion carbon capture process  where solvents isolate co 2 from the flue gases produced when the biomass is combusted the captured co 2 is pressurised and turned into a liquidlike substance so it can then be transported by pipeline  how is the carbon stored captured co 2 can be safely and permanently injected into naturally occurring porous rock formations for example unused natural gas reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers water permeable rocks saturated with salt water this process is known as sequestration  over time the sequestered co 2 may react with the minerals locking it chemically into the surrounding rock through a process called mineral storage beccs fast facts two 600 megawatt mw biomass units upgraded with carbon capture technology could deliver 40 of the negative emissions the climate change committee indicates will be needed from beccs for the uk to reach netzero by 2050 beccs has the potential to remove 2070 million tonnes of co 2 per year in the uk by 2050 all national grids net zero future energy scenarios fes deploy beccs by 2028 and see a rapid increase in capacity in the 2030s there are 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space around the uk according to the british geological survey is beccs sustainable bioenergy can be generated from a range of biomass sources ranging from agricultural byproducts to forestry residues to organic municipal waste during their lifetime plants absorb co 2 from the atmosphere this balances out the co 2 that is released when the biomass is combusted whats crucial is that the biomass is sustainably sourced  be it from agriculture or forest waste responsibly managed sources of biomass are those which naturally regenerate or are replanted and regrown where theres a increase of carbon stored in the land and where the natural environment is protected from harm biomass wood pellets used as bioenergy in the uk for example are only sustainable when the forests they are sourced from continue to grow sourcing decisions must be based on science and not adversely affect the longterm potential of forests to store and sequester carbon biomass pellets can also create a sustainable market for forestry products which serves to encourage reforestation and afforestation  leading to even more co 2 being absorbed from the atmosphere go deeper the triple benefits for the environment and economy of deploying beccs in the uk how beccs can offer essential grid stability as the electricity system moves to low and zerocarbon sources producing biomass from sustainable forests is key to ensuring beccs can deliver negative emissions 5 innovative projects where carbon capture is already underway around the world 7 places on the path to negative emissions through beccs tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  biomass energy  faqs frequently asked questions  forests  sustainability evaluating regrowth postharvest with accurate data and satellite imagery 13 may 2021 sustainable bioenergy drax has been using effective postharvest evaluations which includes remote sensing technology and satellite imagery alongside sustainable forest management monitoring can help support rapid regrowth after harvesting evidence shows healthy managed forests with no signs of deforestation or degradation as part of draxs worldleading programme of demonstrating biomass sustainability including ongoing work on catchment area analysis caa  responsible sourcing policy and healthy forest landscapes hfl  we have also been trialling the use of highresolution satellite imagery to monitor forest conditions on specific harvesting sites in the years after harvesting has taken place in addition to the catchment area level monitoring of trends and data postharvest evaluations phe are an essential part of an ongoing sustainability monitoring process ensuring that the future forest resource is protected and maintained and that landowners restore forests after harvesting to prevent deforestation or degradation the most effective form of phe is for an experienced local forester to walk and survey the harvesting site to check that new trees are growing and that the health and quality of the young replacement forest is maintained rapid regrowth the images below show some of the sites surrounding draxs amite bioenergy pellet plant in mississippi with trees at various stages of regrowth in the years after harvesting newly planted pine pine 23 years pine 612 months pine 45 years a full site inspection can therefore enable a forester to determine whether the quantity and distribution of healthy trees is sufficient to make a productive forest equivalent to the area that was harvested it can also identify if there are any health problems pest damage or management issues such as weed growth or waterlogging that should be resolved typically this will be the responsibility of the forest owner or their forest manager and is a regular part of ongoing forest management activity this degree of survey and assessment is not practical or costeffective where a thirdparty consumer of wood fibre purchases a small proportion typically 2025 tonnes per acre of the lowgrade fibre produced at a harvest as a oneoff transaction for its wood pellet plant it is time consuming to walk every acre of restocked forest and it is not always possible to get an owners permission to access their land forests from space therefore an alternative methodology is required to make an assessment about the condition of forest lands that have been harvested to supply biomass without the need to physically inspect each site one option is to use remote sensing and satellite imagery to view each harvested site in the years after biomass sourcing this helps to monitor restocking and new tree growth drax has been testing the remote sensing approach using maxars commercial satellite imagery maxar has four satellites on orbit that collect more than three million square kilometres of highresolution imagery every day drax accesses this imagery through maxars subscription service securewatch  to test the viability of this methodology drax has been looking at harvesting sites in mississippi that supplied biomass to the amite bioenergy pellet plant in 2015 and in 2017 as part of the sustainability checks that are carried out prior to purchasing wood fibre drax collects information on each harvesting tract this includes the location of the site the type of harvest the owners longterm management intentions and species and volume details this data can then be used at a later date to revisit the site and monitor the condition of the area thirdparty auditors for instance through sustainable biomass program sbp certification  do visit harvesting sites however this is typically during the year of harvest rather than after restocking maxar has historical imagery of this region from 2010 which is prior to any harvesting for wood pellets the image below shows a harvesting site near the pellet plant at gloster mississippi before any harvesting has taken place march 2010 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies the image below shows the same site in 2017 immediately following harvesting december 2017 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies if we look again at this same site three years after harvesting we can see the rows of trees that have been planted and the quality of the regrowth this series of images demonstrates that this harvested area has remained a forest has not been subject to deforestation and that the regrowth appears to be healthy at this stage august 2020 50m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies another site in the amite catchment area is shown below the image shows a mature forest prior to harvesting the site has been previously thinned as can be seen from the thinned rows that are evident in the imagery may 2010 200m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies looking at the same site in the year after harvesting the clear cut area can be seen clearly some green vegetation cover can also be seen on the harvested area but this is weed growth rather than replanted trees some areas of mature trees have been left at the time of harvesting and are visible as a grey colour in the 2010 image these are likely to be streamside management zones that have been left to maintain biodiversity and to protect water quality with the grey winter colouring suggesting that they are hardwoods september 2018 200m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies three years after the harvest in a zoomed in view from the previous image clear rows of replanted trees can be seen in the imagery this demonstrates that the owner has successfully restocked the forest area and that the newly planted forest appears healthy and well established august 2020 50m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies while examining different harvesting sites in satellite imagery drax noted that not every site had evidence of tree growth particularly within the first three years after harvesting deliberate conversion of land to nonforest use such as for conversion to pasture agricultural crops or urban development is likely to be evident fairly soon after harvesting preparing for planting some forest owners like to leave a harvested site unplanted for a couple of years to allow ground vegetation and weed growth to establish this can then be treated to ensure that trees can be planted and that the weed growth does not impede the establishment of the new forest this process can mean that trees are not visible in satellite imagery for three to four years after harvesting the image below shows a site three years after harvesting with no evidence of tree growth given that no conversion of land use is evident and that the site appears to be clear of weed growth this is likely to be an example of where the owners have waited to clear the site of weeds prior to replanting this site can be monitored in future imagery from the maxar satellites to ensure that forest regrowth does take place november 2020 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies drax will continue to use maxars securewatch platform to monitor the regrowth of harvesting sites and will publish more detailed results and analysis when this process has been developed further the platform allows ongoing comparison of a site over time and could prove a more efficient method of analysis than ground survey in conjunction with the caa and hfl work phe can add remote sensing as a valuable monitoring and evidencegathering tool to demonstrate robust

chief executive officer drax group 22 april 2021 opinion leaders from 40 countries are meeting today albeit virtually as part of president joe bidens leaders summit on climate  the event provides an opportunity for world leaders to reaffirm global efforts in the fight against climate change set a clear pathway to net zero emissions while creating jobs and ensuring a just transition since taking office president biden has made bold climate commitments and brought the united states back into the paris agreement ahead of the twoday summit he announced an ambitious 2030 emissions target and new nationally determined contributions the us joins other countries that have announced significant reduction goals for example the eu committed to reduce its emissions by at least 55 also south korea japan and china have all set netzero targets by midcentury here in the uk prime minister boris johnson this week outlined new climate commitments that will be enshrined in law the ambitious new targets will see carbon emissions cut by 78 by 2035 almost 15 years earlier than previously planned if delivered this commitment which is inline with the recommendations of the climate change committees sixth carbon budget will put the uk at the forefront of climate action and for the first time the targets include international aviation and shipping what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a global scale never seen before as a uknorth american sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic at drax we are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends borders creating a global opportunity for businesses and governments to work together towards a shared climate goal thats why we joined other businesses and investors in an open letter supporting the us governments ambitious climate actions collaboration between countries and industries its widely recognised that negative emissions technologies will be key to global efforts to combat climate change at drax were pioneering the negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at our power station in north yorkshire which when up and running in 2027 will capture millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per year sending it for secure storage permanently locking it away deep under the north sea experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for reaching net zero  the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in removing co 2 emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050 from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change and a recent report from baringa commissioned by drax showed it will be a lot more expensive for the uk to reach its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2031 without beccs a shared economic opportunity globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but will also be a key component of a postcovid economy government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy it would also act as an anchor project for the zero carbon humber initiative which aims to create the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster could spearhead the creation and support of tens of thousands of jobs across the humber region and more than 200000 around the uk in 2039 additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international

canadian biomass pellet producer pinnacle renewable energy im very excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the drax family  together we will build on what we have already achieved having become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and the uks largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal the deal positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business  making us a truly international business trading biomass from north america to europe and asia it also advances our strategy to increase our self supply reduces our biomass production costs and creates a longterm future for sustainable biomass  a renewable energy source that the uns ipcc says will be needed to achieve global climate targets its also an important milestone in draxs ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our pioneering negative emissions technology beccs  thats because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax negative emissions from beccs are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery inside a pinnacle pellet mill we already know pinnacle well  it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with drax our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so im looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together we will benefit from pinnacles scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues in 2019 pinnacles production cost was 20 lower than draxs completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 49 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets at 17 plants in locations across western canada and the us south  up from 16mt now it also expands our access to three major north american fibre baskets and four export facilities giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply this positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by demand in asia biomass wood pellet storage dome drax power station we believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with c67 billion of longterm contracts with high quality asian and european customers including drax and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027 drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio we believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics helping to reduce distance time carbon footprint and cost train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station importantly  there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group we recognise that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern us where we currently operate in line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with environmental groups indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing

second day of the chatham house energy transitions conference  watch his keynote address below or scroll down the page to read his speech in full the energy transition is central to our purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future drax has been at the heart of britains energy system for decades and we have played a key role in the decarbonisation of the power sector drax power station in selby north yorkshire is the uks largest power station and europes largest decarbonisation project cruachan our scottish pumped storage facility is a key complement to britains ever increasing supply of offshore wind our transition from coal to biomass has allowed us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 while providing clean and flexible energy to millions of homes and businesses across the uk this month saw the end of commercial coal generation at drax power station  a milestone in the history of our company and of the uk economy too but the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here which is why we have committed to a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  we will achieve this by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with ccs or beccs which will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon water outlet into loch awe from cruachan power station today we are pioneering beccs at drax power station as part of the zero carbon humber cluster a coalition of diverse businesses with one ambition to create the worlds first net zero emissions industrial cluster  the benefits are enormous beccs is a vital technology in the fight against climate change expert bodies such as the climate change committee here in the uk and the ipcc at a global level are clear that we need negative emissions technologies including beccs to reach net zero and beccs is central to the uk and europes decarbonisation plans as the worlds largest and most experienced generator and supplier of sustainable bioenergy there is no better place to pioneer beccs than at drax the economic social and environmental benefits are enormous beccs at drax will permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere and help heavy industry in the uks largest emitting area decarbonise quickly and cost effectively it will enable the creation of tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england levelling up the economy and delivering a green recovery from the covid crisis and it will put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to develop carbon removal technology in this the year that we host cop26 in glasgow the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here a proven technology we know that beccs works and that the technology is available now looking at cost projections from the ccc we also know that it is the best value negative emissions technology engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station we have already successfully run two beccs pilots at the power station in 2019 we demonstrated that we can capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock and in 2020 we began a second pilot working with mitsubishi heavy industries to further enhance the potential for delivering negative emissions we aim to deploy beccs at scale by 2027 to that end earlier this month we kickstarted the planning process for our proposals to build our first beccs units  marking a major milestone in the project and putting us in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 the support we need drax power station has a proud history of transformation and today we are making rapid progress in further decarbonising our operations and making bold commitments about our future the core of our successful decarbonisation has been a close partnership with government  and it is this partnership that will make beccs a reality and enable the multiple benefits that come with it an effective negative emissions policy and regulatory framework from government will enable further investments from companies such as drax we believe it is possible for such a policy framework to emerge in the coming months with cop26 later this year making that policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future here in the uk beccs in context but we know that there is no silver bullet solution to tackling climate change negative emissions technologies such as beccs will be needed alongside others for example more renewables electric vehicles  energy storage energy efficiency and hydrogen beccs will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon beccs complements  and does not  and should not  substitute for ambitious decarbonisation plans technologies such as beccs have a clear and unique role to play by helping harder to abate sectors such as heavy industry aviation and agriculture  decarbonise this is critically important if we are to meet our legally binding 2050 net zero target the ccc estimates that 51m tonnes of co 2 will need to be captured via beccs to meet net zero sustainability at our core we know that beccs can only make a meaningful contribution to tackling climate change if the bioenergy is sustainably sourced this has been fundamental to draxs transition from coal to biomass and it remains fundamental as we progress our plans for beccs biomass as the uk government has stated is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions so we need the right framework to ensure it is sourced sustainably as the worlds largest bioenergy producer and generator we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability too at drax we have invested in world leading policies tools and expertise to ensure that our biomass is sustainably sourced we go beyond regulatory compliance and have set up an independent advisory board  chaired by the uk governments former chief scientific advisor to help us and challenge us on sustainable biomass and its role in draxs transition to net zero click to read thanks to our independent catchment area analyses  we know more about the forests we source from than ever before we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests for example in the south east us where drax sources most of its biomass there is more than double the carbon stored in forests than there was 50 years ago a partnership with our stakeholders the purpose of todays session is to discuss all these issues and more our aim is clear to enable a successful energy transition at drax we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up beccs technology to put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to reach net zero emissions and to help create tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england but i want your help in making beccs as sustainable and successful as it can be we know and can demonstrate how

several of our employees from policy managers to apprentices took over the energy uk young energy professional yep forums twitter account to share their experiences so far working in the energy industry and their roles at drax the yep forum consists of a network of energy industry professionals with less than 10 years experience and aims to provide them with opportunities to collaborate develop and recognise successes the following insights from employees at drax show the importance of our workforce in achieving our ambition and what they have learnt so far about starting a career in the energy industry engineer working in the turbine hall at drax power station north yorkshire meet samuel the apprentice one of our technical apprentices samuel plumb explains why he decided to kickstart his career with a drax apprenticeship plus what the selection process involves i applied for this role because its a mix of practical skills and problemsolving drax has a large site with a huge range of equipment and processes so no two days are the same working here appealed to me because im really interested in the power industry and drax plays a key role in generation i found out about this apprenticeship through online research submitted an application completed aptitude tests online sat another aptitude test onsite and then eventually attended an interview meet richard the policy manager richard gow explains that with the right policies in place drax could become a carbon negative power station enabling a zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region the drax group policy and government relations manager outlines how his role helps to develop the necessary frameworks i engage with policymakers advisors and experts across the uk to understand the policy and political landscape and how this could impact draxs commercial objectives the energy sector is at the forefront of decarbonisation and its exciting to be involved in developing policies and market frameworks to support this transition to net zero by investing in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen and other green technologies in the humber industry can regain a competitive edge new jobs can help to rejuvenate communities and the wider region as evidenced by a recent report from vivid economics on the socioeconomic benefits of beccs this investment at drax supports the uks levelling up agenda and to build back better  emphasising the need for the uk to have a skilled workforce to achieve net zero will gardiner ceo of drax group has explained how our own ambitions will also boost our communities and local economies by helping to create a cleaner environment for future generations whilst creating new jobs and export opportunities for british businesses noting that beccs at drax is not just limited to new engineering or technician roles as a ukus company with sites from selby to the scottish highlands to louisiana and mississippi in the us south we continue

sustainable bioenergy these differ to nonrenewable energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric insights the cost of electricity from solar panels dropped by 82 between 2010 and 2019 while the cost of onshore wind fell 40 and offshore wind 29 the worlds largest power station of any kind  the three gorges dam in china runs on a renewable energy source hydropower and has a generation capacity of 225 gigawatts gw the total capacity of the worlds installed renewable electricity generation is forecast to reach 3978 gw in 2025 up from 849 gw in 2000 go deeper the magician the prince and the inventors who made renewable electricity possible  what if renewable energy is the new oil  renewable sources are capable of delivering power on a big scale  a really big scale  how different countries use their landscapes to generate energy  there are plenty of uses for fossil fuel power stations in
