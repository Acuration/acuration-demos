careers the people behind the power 7 march 2017 sustainable business drax group may have been built with drax power station at its core but today its a set of integrated companies helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used to build a better future at the heart of each part of the business  from creating the fuel to power the stations boilers to managing the supply of electricity gas and renewable heating fuel to customers  is people here we meet some of those people working behind the scenes robert gatlin operations supervisor amite bioenergy drax biomass i was a student in the process operations technology programme at southwest mississippi community college and drax came to the school to recruit new grads they were introducing a new technology id never heard of and it sparked my interest the idea of using biomass to produce electricity on such a large scale was fascinating so i joined drax biomass in 2014 i was unaware biomass was being used to produce electricity  its very exciting to be part of something this big and cutting edge one of the most interesting things ive discovered working here is the way moisture affects nearly everything in the pelletising process we really have to work diligently to ensure our moisture levels are where they need to be in every stage of producing a pellet rachel grima sustainability analyst drax group ive always wanted to work in renewable energy and i studied life cycle analysis during my degree i started looking for jobs in renewable energy and as the biggest generator of renewable energy in the uk drax was an obvious choice today my job involves assessing and interpreting sustainability data for all the biomass we use our team uses this data to assess if a supplier meets our sustainability policy and regulation id never looked very much at transport emissions so i find it really interesting you can move 30000 tonnes of wood pellets in one ship but it would take over 1000 trucks to move that many creating far more greenhouse gas emissions since joining the team ive been really surprised to see how driving small efficiencies in a supply chain can create real savings in greenhouse gas emissions stephen wilkinson turbine maintenance technician drax power station  ive always enjoyed building and fixing things given that my father and both grandfathers were in engineering  one of them even working at drax during its construction  i had a strong drive to get into engineering living locally it seemed the biggest and best place to work im a turbine maintenance technician so i act as the link between the turbine support group and the main station planning and maintenance teams i start the day early by looking through the list of overnight defects focusing on the turbine area after this im out of the office having a look at the issues to determine whether the station maintenance team or the turbine support group will carry out the repair work from this point on every day is different the recent changes drax has made to adapt to a rapidly changing energy market has affected most people at the station for me seeing the major turbine upgrades take place has been extremely interesting i started as an apprentice and then as a fitter working on the turbine outages seeing these upgrades firsthand this has moved on to the point where i have been lucky enough to visit a number of the turbine manufacturing facilities in the uk and germany gemma baker sme customer service delivery manager haven power i joined haven power in july 2007 as a customer service advisor id never worked in the energy industry before and thought it sounded interesting  haven caught my eye as it was a new company which excited me being part of and contributing to a growing company was right up my street now im responsible for delivering a consistent and valued account management service to our electricity customers across all the small to medium enterprise sme segments this includes everything from billing and cash collection to renewals and query and complaint resolution ive been at haven for nine and a half years now sam french customer service administrator apprentice opus energy before joining  opus energy  i didnt know anything about the energy industry  now i know about different supplier competitors how an electricity supply contract is agreed and registered and how we actually apply for a supply ive learnt so much about different aspects of the energy industry too i havent had that much involvement with the drax group yet but ive enjoyed looking into the business ive found it really interesting to learn how theyve managed to transition from a nonrenewable company to one that is now producing more renewable than fossil fuel power  which is amazing amy carton sales and marketing executive billington bioenergy im responsible for all aspects of internal and external marketing and communications at billington bioenergy  a company which supplies wood pellets to commercial and domestic customers who use them to heat their homes or businesses i try to be environmentally conscious and keep my carbon footprint as low as possible  renewable and sustainable heating comes into this its wonderful to spend my days promoting the merits of renewable heating its a relatively small industry in the uk in comparison to our european counterparts but this makes what we do here in billington bioenergy quite unique there was quite a bit of information to digest when i first started  for example en plus regulations  different types of pellets how wood pellet boilers work it was a big learning curve find out about careers and apprenticeships within drax group billington bioenergy drax biomass drax group and drax power haven power opus energy tags about us  careers  apprenticeships getting more from less 22 january 2017 power generation what can we do to ensure plant integrity increase plant efficiency and ultimately get more megawatts out of the door for less this is a question at the heart of luke varleys work varley is the lead engineer in the turbine section at drax power station  a team who look after arguably the heart of the plant the steam turbines that drive electricity generation as well as managing daytoday maintenance he and a team of engineers and craftspeople within tsg deliver the major overhaul activities on the turbines to keep them running efficiently and safely but as the uks largest power station its a site that needs to run all the time  any maintenance needs to fit around that consistent operation for the most part this happens in the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the station can be temporarily shut down to carry out repairs even though varley recognises theres a large cost involved in shutting part of the plant down it leads to longer term gains were taking on work to improve efficiency because the end result is were using less fuel to get more electricity he says a small percentage increase in biomass efficiency can represent huge cost savings he adds but as a relatively new fuel biomass  in draxs case compressed wood pellets  presents a unique challenge for the engineers working with it the biomass challenge in the days when drax ran only on coal at full load as part of a stable national grid turbine maintenance meant facing common problems where we had problems which were familiar from one hundred years of turbine history  we knew what to look for varley explains but now the plant generates within a far more demanding network that needs flexibility and produces more than half its power using compressed wood pellets theres a need for greater efficiency  it means more innovative thinking and new challenges for example most plants in the industry take each turbine offline to maintain it every eighttoten years but using wood pellets means the turbines need to be as efficient as possible and this means more regular inspections every four years we go back overhaul the module and maximise its efficiency again thats new to the industry within the uk nobody else is doing that he says despite the challenges varley isnt fazed the technical and management challenges they both come with experience he explains his engineering experience began before his start at drax as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game destined for grease my dads been in engineering all his life hed be building a car and id be dragged to a scrap man to help take an engine block out of an old car so he could use it at home varley says i was destined to always be covered in grease so when it came to beginning his career varley was set on what path he wanted to take two options presented themselves working as a trainee draftsman in an air conditioning company or taking an apprenticeship with national power an early visit to drax helped make his decision even though id been around engineering with my dad as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game he took the apprenticeship which led him to a number of power plants but the impression of the drax turbine hall never left him later in my career i spent a lot of my time going around different power stations and in grandness and scale ive never come across anything that matches what weve got at drax so when this job came about and i was asked to join i said sounds good to me today his position of getting more megawatts out of the door for less whilst ensuring safe operation of the plant is one that comes with a lot of responsibility and is built on a long history the guy who was doing this job before me took a lot of pride in it he used to say ive been here man and boy i was even here when it was built and i wouldnt have retired until i knew it was in safe hands varley says i suppose thats the best recognition i could get really tags technology  drax power station  careers  turbines the problem solver power generation one of the things i like about my job is working through the challenges we get on a daily basis and finding a solution explains adam nicholson process performance section head at drax power station  that eagerness to find solutions makes him the ideal candidate for his current job managing daytoday improvements at drax im responsible for the team which ensures the plant operates at optimum efficiency he says his team make sure the turbines boiler emissions combustion and mills are not just working but running as smoothly as possible its a job that brings up constant challenges its ultimately what i became an engineer for he says to follow that problemsolving thirst through earlier in his career nicholson was involved in one of the plants biggest problemsolving missions converting it from running exclusively on coal to also run on compressed wood pellets  it was a unique test  one that required starting from scratch there wasnt a bank of existing knowledge that nicholson and his fellow engineers could call upon we did a lot of testing to learn more about the fuel he explains we had to understand how to get it to the boiler how to process it before we put it in how to convert the mills and then how exactly the combustion would work some of that learning involved experimenting with unorthodox solutions to complex problems the dog tunnel one of the big problems with biomass is you cant expose it to as high a temperature as you can coal nicholson explains this presented a challenge when it came to pulverising it before fuel at the power station can be combusted a set of mills pulverises it into a fine powder using a ring of rotating heavyduty balls  this fuel powder is then dried inside the mill with a mix of hot air drawn from the boiler house and cool air but a fundamental difference between coal and biomass meant this process had to change with coal the air can enter the mills at about 300 degrees with biomass if you get much above about 180 degrees the biomass will set on fire says nicholson as part of the rd phase he needed to work out a way to cool the mills down on a temporary basis we all took a big gulp and thought how are we going to do this part of the problem was the existing ducts werent big enough to deliver enough cool air to the mills to lower their temperature to a safe range nicholson improvised a solution it was known as the dog tunnel he says if he could get a temporary larger air supply to the mills it could provide more cool air and lower the overall temperature allowing the testing to be conducted so he found a company that could supply industrial flexible ducting which he connected to a larger cold air duct and then fed through to a mill to deliver more cool air as its informal name suggests the result didnt look like much but it worked it didnt look like a finished solution but the theory behind it was sound for occasions like this we had to think lets just do it prove it and then we can work on a permanent solution thats ultimately what i became an engineer for to follow that problemsolving thirst through the next challenge now the power station is successfully producing more than half of its electricity from biomass nicholsons daytoday responsibilities lie in ensuring safe operations and driving process efficiencies to do this he keeps tabs on the combustion process  for example by using thermal imaging cameras to monitor the inside of the furnace  and tweaks it to get as much energy as possible from the biomass fuel but at a site as large and complex as drax there will always be new engineering challenges that require inventive thinking often you dont know how youre going to do something until you do a bit more work and try and understand the problem nicholson says were nowhere near the end of our learning curve tags careers  drax power station  technology taming the electric beast power generation its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance says gareth newton as a mechanical engineer in one of the power stations maintenance teams hes a man with a closer eye on that animal than most and when something does need fixing or improving its his job to make sure it happens its a task that keeps him busy on top of the teams ive got a team servicing the filter fans ive got a team doing a filter change on a biomass unit then ive got another company doing a pipework replacement on a discharge line for me somebody else is doing a service on the belt cleaners newton says listing half a typical days responsibilities on any given day he oversees a number of different teams that carry out a variety of maintenance tasks and more often than not that list is a long one hes a part of the materials handling team who deal with all the material arriving and leaving the power station this includes the biomass and coal fuel coming in and the ash gypsum and other byproducts from the generation process going out it means he has a hand in the maintenance of almost all parts of the plant from the compressed wood pellet storage domes to the boiler with such a broad perspective of such a complex plant he knows its not always the things you expect to fail that need fixing monitoring the machine its a machine  its being used its not a showpiece or something in a museum its real and every now and then it will throw a gear out and stop he says those failures dont always happen to a schedule  so when something does go wrong it can be unexpected you might have a 50000 gearbox sat in the stores ready and waiting to replace a faulty one but it will be the 10 probe on a conveyer belt you never thought would break that fails and holds the whole system up he says when something like that happens he adds its not always about having the exact tool that can fix it right there and then its about thinking out of the box the biggest part of this job and i think its one of the biggest parts of heavy industry engineering is not fixing or modifying things with what youve got he says its about using what you havent got to try and engineer your way out he continues if you havent got a tool or part that you need can you make something new can you find a way to make it work or do you even need it its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance keeping your hands dirty newton grew up around engineering his father ran a salvage yard and precious metals business and would bring back broken bits of machinery for the kids to fix as toys ive always had dirty hands he says its something thats stuck with him today even though he now spends a large proportion of his time monitoring jobs at a computer or moving between teams its the practical side of the job that keeps him interested the best part of the job is working with your hands and even though the demands of the living animal that is drax can sometimes keep him on site longer than his working hours its a beast hes happy to look after its a job you either love or hate if you didnt enjoy the engineering side you probably wouldnt like it because theres a lot of ingenuity and thinking on your feet needed he says but there are a lot of jobs out there that i wouldnt want tags careers  drax power station  technology the toolmaster power generation before drax power station was a part of andrew storrs career it was a part of his local environment when i was at school in selby they were building the second half of the station he says we could see them building the cooling towers out of the classroom windows but it wasnt until a careers advisor brought an old cine film of the power station into class that he considered working there part of the film was them stripping the turbine and i watched it and thought i want to do that he says today storr does more than strip the turbines hes part of the engineering team that oversees them  a job that needs to be taken seriously if the turbines off forget the rest of it were not generating electricity  he says weve got to make sure the turbine and the generator are absolutely as bulletproof as possible because weve only got one per unit considering the conditions each one comes under this is no easy task the turbine shaft weighs 300 tonnes and spins at 3000 rpm the high pressure turbine is 165 bar and temperaturewise the steam running through it making it spin is 565 degrees centigrade bulletproof is an understatement when it comes to carrying out maintenance on a turbine its more than likely youll have to visit storrs workshop fixing the governor the workshop hasnt always been there it all started fifteen years ago when a piece of equipment broke it was a turbine governor relay a precision hydraulic actuator that keeps the turbine spinning at the right speed drax needed a new one theyve got to be 100 reliable storr explains if they lose control of the turbine it can either come to a grinding halt or speed up too much and selfdestruct the team went in search of a replacement contacting a manufacturer who came back with a skyhigh quote but storrs boss at the time had another idea he asked whether storr could reverse engineer a full set of governor relays i made the fatal mistake of saying yeah so i set off with a few photographs and a handful of sketches storr explains what followed were sleepless nights and a lot of grey hair but in the end he managed to reproduce a full set that cost nearly half of the original quote better than that they worked perfectly today theyre on unit 5 doing the business building the workshop manufacturing the governor relays was a turning point storr and the team saw there could be further savings and benefits if they did more manufacturing or refurbishment inhouse they had the staff capable of doing it they just needed the facilities although there was some initial scepticism from some in the company drax armed storr with a small budget and he set out on building the workshop that was 15 years ago back then the workshop was designed to only refurbish equipment but it has since grown now they can manufacture too today when drax buys in equipment which is either very expensive or lacking in quality storrs team can modify it make it fit better last longer or improve its efficiency without sending it away from the plant and incurring extra costs were reaping the rewards were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility storr says we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people the workshop has given drax an edge when it comes to its engineering ability but storr remains modest about the achievement the thing is he says ive got a good boss and he will support you but i do see it as a bit of a feather in my cap tags technology  drax power station  careers the life of an electrical engineer power generation a station like drax doesnt run itself its six turbines generate nearly 4000mw of power when operating at full load unsurprisingly for a site that produces 7 of britains electricity needs the role of an electrical engineer is an important one  both when managing how power is connected to the highvoltage electricity transmission grid  and how the giant electrical machines generating the energy work it doesnt get much bigger than drax you need to be at the top of your game every day says lead engineer gary preece a man at the top of his game is a fair way to describe preece he has been an electrical engineer almost his entire life beginning as an apprentice working at the liverpool dockyards at age 16 preece has worked a range of increasingly demanding projects and roles including engineering consultancy and work for the royal navy on their type 26 global combat ship  where he was in charge of designing the onboard power infrastructure he became a member of the drax team five years ago life on the job on a station the size of drax you dont have a typical day there are just too many systems that can change status that can fail or that require immediate attention to remain operational its neverending preece says working as an electrical engineer in a plant the size of drax doesnt just mean getting called down to help out when a fuse blows his responsibilities as lead engineer encompass a broad range of functions theres lots to do theres a lot of handson work but theres also a lot of study work tasks can include scoping out planning and budgeting new projects working with contractors and suppliers fault analysis and power level studies this last role is what preece has come to like most about the job  working with sophisticated computer simulations to model output and crisis scenarios all so drax can operate at its optimal level with national grid i really enjoy a lot of the theoretical work he says we can do so much with this software of course there are times when he does have to fix things and in a power plant mistakes can have major consequences the energy levels in a power plant are so high that when something fails it usually fails spectacularly this means preece needs to be on call all day and all night if theres a technology failure he needs to be on the site finding out what went wrong and directing recovery efforts theres no hiding place if something goes wrong you have to fix it transforming draxs electric infrastructure sometimes individual projects can occupy all aspects of preece engineer thinker and planner one of the most challenging was when drax wanted to import a largely unused industrial generator transformer unit from kent to the station in yorkshire the transformer was split into three 200tonne components before transit preece and his team conducted extensive checks on the components and oil transformers contain oil to insulate the coil to evaluate the state of the machinery and these steps had to be repeated after every stage of the journey to ensure no damage had been sustained after checks were completed the units needed to be transported via the m25 motorway to ports in the south of england from which they would travel by ship on the north sea ready to be unloaded and transported to drax for installation however the team hit complications this time with the highways agency the structures were so heavy that we had to take a ferry from a different port because authorities were worried the bridges we were planning on using to get there wouldnt take the weight of the units we had to do a turnaround in the middle of the motorway getting the extra transformers installed gave the plant some important breathing room in the unlikely event of a failure some power stations dont have spares if there was a failure they could be out of commission for months says preece for a power station as large as drax that would be disastrous but even with the extra transformers on site the number of ways the electrical infrastructure at a power plant can go wrong is huge thats why experienced engineers like preece are as indispensable as the machinery itself drax is one of the best opportunities youre going to get for artistic licence it doesnt get much bigger tags careers  drax power station  technology what does an instrument craftsperson do 10 november 2016 power generation how do you go about fixing a turbine that on a normal day spins 3000 times every minute the first port of call is to call in someone like alice gill an instrument craftsperson at drax power station what does an instrument craftperson do what i do is maintain and repair the equipment that links the outside power plant and the control room  equipment that tracks temperature levels or positioning that then informs our operators in the control room whats happening on the plant things like an oxygen analyser its a probe that sits in the boiler and monitors the oxygen level so the operator can ensure the correct ratio of fuel to air is going into the boiler to reach optimum combustion i might be called on to do calibration checks on that sensor to ensure that its working properly or i might be asked to completely remove it and then to repair it how did you come to be doing this job im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person my dad was always working and fixing things in the garage at home and i liked being in there with him when i was at school i decided i didnt want to go to university so started applying for apprenticeships and looking into engineering opportunities drax was one of those schemes and was the one i most wanted to be selected for  luckily enough i was offered a place the apprenticeship was four years and there are loads of training courses and so much to learn including hands on experience and working in the plant i remember first arriving to the power station and not really believing the scale of the place you think how am i ever going to find my way around but you soon get used to it and it becomes the norm in september i became a full instrument craftsperson so now i can really get stuck in im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person what sort of challenges do you face over the summer ive been doing a lot of work on the turbines its a big job as theyre one of the most important elements driving the plant and generating the power during outages the whole thing gets overhauled and given a full health check the turbine team needs to get into machinery which is densely constructed and put together so its my job to go in and carefully remove instrumentation so they can access it when theyre done i have to go back in refit everything and check its all working again how do you do that when youre removing the instruments its a bit more of a just get it off approach  you just make sure you get it off safely without damaging it then when were refitting it were out there with our multimeters making sure were setting different probes at the right voltages and that everything is calibrated correctly theres a screen in our workshop we use to watch the activity of the turbine so we can see the speed of the turbine creeping up as they switch it back on its always a big moment you know things are going to be alright because youve done everything but there are still some nervous people in the room the turbines are spinning at 3000rpm so you really need it all to be working properly is there anything that could wrong on an average day one of the biggest things that could go wrong in my area is the potential to trip an entire generating unit it might be that you overpressurise something or you accidentally trigger a switch that then sets off a daisy chain of events that ends up in a unit tripping tripping is where the unit turns off which basically leads to a total shutdown in electricity generation from one sixth of drax power station theres something called the 660 club  at full load the units are operating at 660 mw so if you trip one you enter into this infamous club there are a few guys in the 660 club but thankfully i havent joined when operating at full load of 660 mw our units supply the national grid with around 645 mw enough to power an entire city what do you do outside of work ive got a horse called red  ive had him for seven years but ive been riding since i was eight its quite different to working with things that do exactly what you tell them when you get on the horse he just does what he wants  hes got a mind of his own its a big change tags careers  apprenticeships  power station  technology  engineering how do you build a dome bigger than the albert hall 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the most iconic sight at drax power station has been its large grey cooling towers but thats changing today the most striking image on the selby skyline is four white domes each larger in volume than the royal albert hall these are draxs biomass storage domes standing 50 metres high and holding 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets between them  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool for more than 12 days theyre an integral part of draxs ongoing transition from coal to renewable biomass electricity generation but while biomass is a far cleaner source of energy than coal  reducing carbon emissions by more than 80  it comes with its own challenges a key one is storage thats where the domes come in the need for a new storage space storing coal is a relatively simple task with some management by heavy vehicles to reduce the occurrence of air pockets coal can quite happily sit outside in the rain and still work efficiently as fuel compressed wood pellets are different if a wood pellet gets wet it can degrade and become unusable the main reason to compress wood into high density pellets in the first place is to take its moisture content down saving weight for transportation and increasing its efficiency as a fuel for power station boilers more than that because the biomass pellets are made from wood  a living and breathing organic material  they have to be stored in sensitively calibrated environments to keep them in a safe and usable state each storage dome had to be carefully designed engineered and constructed to ensure it was fit to maintain this environment construction began back in 2013 and required a drax engineering team working closely with idahobased dome technology and yorks shepherd construction at more than 50 metres tall theyre the largest of their kind in the world  a new approach to construction had to be considered there were three key steps involved in the build blowing up a giant balloon the first stage is to prepare the foundation which takes the form of a massive concrete circular ring beam a giant pvc airform dome is laid out over the ring beam and inflated using fans that are about the size of a doctor who telephone box to form the outside of the dome insulating the inside with the dome still airinflated a thin 15mm layer of polyurethane foam is sprayed to the inside serving to both insulate the structure and provide purchase for the first layers of steel reinforcements completing the shell once the first steel reinforcing grid is attached to the polyurethane the concrete spraying process begins the dome wall is built up to a thickness of up to 350mm by adding further layers of steel reinforcement grid and reinforced concrete under pressure the challenge the team now face following construction is maintaining a safe atmosphere inside the domes the pellets are stored inside the domes in vast quantities and weight which collectively create high amounts of pressure as the pressure builds up the pellets release oxygen which can cause a buildup of heat and potentially an explosion but by addressing the cause of the increase in heat  the oxygen  the team found they could limit the danger potential the solution was a speciallydesigned system that releases nitrogen into the dome the gas forms nonflammable compounds with the oxygen which keeps the inside of the dome stable the drax cooling towers are still visible in and around selby and while theyre still an essential part of the power station emitting steam not smoke used in the generating process theyre no longer its most iconic image the four storage domes sitting beside them more closely represent the future of drax a renewable one built on biomass technology now that the domes have been built find out how their atmosphere is controlled  tags power station  technology  careers  visit us summer in the station power generation bees buzz and heat haze fizzes on the tarmac its summer and since the days are warm and long demand for electricity sinks as lights are left off and life is lived outdoors electricity demand is lower so the assumption would be that activity at the uks power stations is minimal the reality however is far different instead the fall in demand is an opportunity to perform crucial maintenance work  to upgrade and extend the life of power stations across the world in many ways summer in the station is the busiest time of the year slowing the beating heart of the country to get up close and personal with the equipment and carry out major repairs large sections of the power station need to come offline  this is a procedure called an outage at drax power station there are six units which together supply around 78 of the uks supply taking one offline is a big project but a necessary one many years ago we use to do a mixture of major and minor outages but we have reconfigured the outage cycle so all we do now are major outages now we run a schedule where each unit has an outage every four years says andrew squires outage manager at drax this year each of our six units have come offline  five outages have already been completed and one is set to be back in service at the beginning of november with two of these being major outages and the other four taken off the system for essential high pressure hp turbine module repair works to ensure this all operates smoothly planning starts early the process starts a minimum of a year in advance during which time scoping planning parts and materials are ordered for the outage its a necessary advance given the challenging timescales projects and numbers of people that are needed to carry out the work required calling in the helping hands drax drafts in engineering contractors in large numbers to carry out the huge scale of work required to shut down and maintain units at the power station 2016 was a particularly busy year  at peak points 3500 people were on site carrying out the work its a number weve never seen previously squires says main projects delivered during the outage timescale in 2016 include changing the generator stator core generator transformer oil burner system and hp turbine module the main steam pipework replacement being the largest of all this pipework runs from the boiler to the turbine and is the first time this had been done in the lifetime of the plant now complete this is set to last the life of the station industry pioneers drax uses compressed wood pellets in three of its six units and this pioneering step brings implications for how theyre maintained in the industry its a whole new challenge for which drax engineers are still writing the rulebook were understanding the engineering implications of using biomass in our boilers and developing strategies for maintenance says squires as europes largest decarbonisation project maintaining and consistently learning comes with the territory its just another challenge for the team to tackle during summer in the station and beyond tags technology  power station  engineering  careers  visit us  1 2 3  name email comment sign up for updates from drax
