more people in these careers 11 november 2021 sustainable business many components are needed to tackle climate change and reach environmental milestones such as meeting the goals of the paris agreement one of those components is the right workforce large enough and with the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the green energy jobs of a lowcarbon future in 2020 the renewable energy sector employed 115 million people around the world but as the industry continues to expand that workforce will only grow last year a national grid report found that in the uk alone 120000 jobs will need to be filled in the lowcarbon energy sector by 2030  to meet the countrys climate objectives that figure is expected to rise to 400000 by 2050 the uk energy sector as a whole currently supports 738000 jobs and much of this workforce already has the skills needed for a low carbon society  others can be reskilled and retrained helping to bolster the future workforce by supporting employees through the green transition at a global level energy sector jobs are expected to increase from 18 million to 26 million by 2050  jobs that will span the full energy spectrum from researching and advising on lowcarbon solutions to installing and implementing them here are some of the roles that will be key to the lowcarbon energy transformation a wind farm under construction off the english coast wind turbine technicians according to the international energy agency iea wind power is this year set for a 17 increase in global energy generation compared to 2020 the biggest increase of any renewable power source the iea also forecasts that wind power will need to grow tenfold by 2050 if the world is to meet the goals of the paris agreement its not surprising therefore that wind turbine technicians  the professionals who install inspect maintain and repair wind turbines  are in high demand in the us wind turbine technician is the fastestgrowing job in the country  with 68 growth projected over the 20202030 period  to give just one example in the uk many wind turbine technicians have a background in engineering or experience from the wider energy sector although there are wind turbine technician and maintenance courses available they are not a prerequisite and many employers offer apprenticeships and onthejob training  smoothing the path for energy professionals to transition into the role solar panel installers today solar photovoltaic solar pv is the biggest global employer in renewable energy accounting for 38 million jobs  the iea also reported a 23 uptick in solar pv installations around the world in 2020 in the uk there are currently 132 gigawatts gw of installed solar power capacity  trade association solar energy uk predicts this will need to rise to at least 40 gw by 2030 if the uk is to succeed in becoming a net zero economy by 2050 the trade association believes this could see the creation of 13000 new solar energy jobs solar panel installers  who carry out the important job of installing and maintaining solar pv  are essential to a lowcarbon future many solar panel installers in the uk come from a background in electrical installation or have transitioned from engineering while there are training courses specifically designed for solar panel installers they are not a necessity particularly if you already have onthejob experience in a relevant sector this makes a move to becoming a solar panel installer relatively easy for someone already working in energy or with a mind for engineering energy consultants businesses of all kinds must play a role in the transition to net zero organisations must be able to manage their energy use and begin switching to renewable sources as professionals who advise companies on this process renewable energy consultants are a key part of the green energy workforce aspects of the job include identifying how organisations use their electric assets and helping businesses optimise those assets to build responsiveness and flexibility into energyintensive operations the core responsibilities of a renewable energy consultant are to reduce a companys environmental impact while helping the business reduce energy costs and identifying opportunities carbon accountants a growing number of businesses are setting targets for reducing their greenhouse gas ghg emissions but thats only possible if you can first determine what your ghg emissions are and where they come from which is where the relatively young field of carbon accounting comes in through what is known as physical carbon accounting companies can assess the emissions their activities generate and where in the supply chain the emissions are occurring this allows businesses to implement more accurate actions and be realistic in their timelines for reducing emissions on a wider scale accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in certifying emissions reductions or abatement as well as in the distribution of carbon credits or penalties as whole economies push towards net zero battery technology researchers energy storage is essential to a lowcarbon energy future  the ability to store and release energy from intermittent sources such as wind and solar will be crucial in meeting demand and balancing a renewablesdriven grid while many forms of energy storage already exist  developing electric batteries that can be deployed at scale is still a comparatively new and expanding area global patenting activities in the field of batteries and other electricity storage increased at an annual rate of 14  four times faster than the average for technology  between 2005 and 2018 however its estimated that to meet climate objectives the world will need nearly 10000 gw hours of battery and other electricity storage by 2040 this is 50 times the current level and research and innovation will be crucial to delivering bigger and more efficient batteries farmers and foresters how we use and manage land will be important in lowering carbon emissions and creating a sustainable future for people and the planet crops like corn sugarcane and soybean can serve as feedstock for biofuel and bioenergy and farming byproducts such as cow manure can be used in the development of biofuel techniques adopted in the agricultural sector will also be important in optimising soil sequestration capabilities while ensuring it is nutrientrich enough to grow food these techniques include the use of biochar  a solid form of charcoal produced by heating biomass without oxygen research indicates that biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for centuries or longer it also helps soil retain water and could contribute to reducing the use of fertilisers by making the soil more nutrientdense forests meanwhile provide material for industries like construction the byproducts from which can serve as feedstock for woody biomass primarily in the shape of lowgrade wood that would otherwise remain unused sustainably managed forests such as those from which drax sources its biomass have twofold importance they both enable woody biomass for bioenergy and ensure co 2 is removed from the atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle biofuel engineers and scientists farmers and foresters provide feedstock for biofuels but its biofuel scientists and engineers who research develop and enhance them opening the door to alternative fuels for vehicles heating and even jet engines according to the iea production of biofuel that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector grew 6 in 2019 however the organisation forecasts that production will need to increase 10 annually until 2030 to be in line with paris agreement climate targets scientific innovations that can help boost the production of biofuel around the world therefore continues to be vital as is the work of biofuel engineers who assess and improve existing biofuel systems and develop new ones that can replace fossil fuels like petrol and diesel the wealth of knowledge around fuels in the oil and gas industries means there is ample opportunity for scientists and engineers who work with fossil fuels to bring their skills to crucial lowcarbon roles geologists the overriding goal of the paris agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2 and preferably to 15 degrees celsius compared to preindustrial levels this is an objective the iea has said will be  virtually impossible to fulfil without carbon capture and storage ccs technologies ccs entails capturing co 2 and transporting it for safe and permanent underground storage in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas fields coal seams and saline aquifers according to the global ccs institute the world will need a 100fold increase on the 27 ccs project currently in operation by 2050 knowledge and research into rock types formations and reactivity will be important in helping identify sites deep underground that can be used for safe permanent carbon storage and sequestration skills and expertise gained in the oil and gas industries will allow professionals in these sectors to make the switch from careers in fossil fuel to roles that help power a net zero economy employees working at drax power station chemists the role of chemists is also vital to decarbonisation knowledge and research around co 2 is a potent force in the effort to reduce and remove it from the atmosphere technologies like ccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage becss  and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs  are based around such research carbon capture processes are chemical reactions between emissions streams and solvents often based on amines and ghgs understanding and controlling these processes makes chemistry a key component of delivering carbon capture at the scale needed to help meet climate targets chemists role in decarbonisation is far from limited to carbon capture methods from battery technology to reforestation chemists understanding of the elements can help drive action against climate change bringing together disciplines tackling climate change on the scale needed to achieve the aims of the paris agreement depends on collaboration between industries countries and disciplines decarbonisation projects such as the uks east coast cluster which encompasses both zero carbon humber and net zero teesside fuse engineering and construction jobs with scientific and academic work zero carbon humber which brings together 12 organisations including drax is expected to create as many as 47800 jobs in the region by 2027  among these are construction sector jobs for welders pipefitters machine installers and technicians in addition indirect jobs are predicted to be created across supply chains from material manufacturing to the logistics of supporting a workforce meeting climate challenges and delivering projects on the scale of zero carbon humber depends on creating an energy workforce that combines the knowledge of the past with the green energy skills of the future draxs apprenticeships have readied workers for the energy sector for decades and will continue to do so as we build a lowcarbon future options include fouryear technical apprenticeships in mechanical electrical and control and instrumentation engineering getting onthejob training and practical experience apprentices receive a nationally recognised qualification such as a btec or an nvq level 3 at the end of the programme apprentices at drax power station 2021 the workforce needed to make low carbon societies a reality will be a diverse one  stretching from apprentices to experienced professionals with a background in traditional or renewable energy it will also span every aspect of the renewable energy field from the chemists and biofuel scientists who develop key technologies to the solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians who fit and maintain the necessary equipment the skills needed to take on these roles are already plentiful in the uk and around the world overcoming challenges on the road to net zero requires refocussing these existing talents skills and careers towards a new goal
