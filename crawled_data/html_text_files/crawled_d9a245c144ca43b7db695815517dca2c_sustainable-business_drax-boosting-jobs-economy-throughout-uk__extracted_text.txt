power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station how drax is boosting jobs and the economy throughout the uk the impact of a british energy company extends beyond either end of a power cable 17 october 2017 sustainable business whether powering homes across britain or helping stabilise the national grid  drax power stations impact to our electricity network is far reaching but it doesnt stop at generating and supplying power a new report by oxford economics  commissioned by drax has found that in addition to its important role powering britain drax group also provides an economic boost to areas across the country here are three ways drax group contributed to the uk economy in 2016 167 billion added to uk gdp drax group contributed an estimated 167 billion to uk gross domestic product gdp in 2016 an increase from 124 billion in 2015  of that figure 301 million was added directly  as a result of the groups own activities such as the generating and selling of power and while this is an impressive 61 increase on 2015 the numbers are even more significant when looking at the benefit beyond the groups core activities in 2016 drax groups spending with external suppliers such as rail freight wagon manufacturer wh davis and imserv  which supplies automated meter reading technology to opus energy reached 872 million a further 36m was spent by these suppliers across their own supply chain to help them provide their services to drax there is an even greater impact when considering how this money filters through employees and suppliers into local retail leisure and service economies something which is especially important when the number of jobs drax supports is taken into account 18500 jobs supported across the country drax group directly employed more than 2000 people in 2016 but across the country it supports far more  18500 a significant increase from the 14150 of 2015 these jobs are primarily in highskilled manufacturing engineering construction it professional business services and transport while 3650 of these were in drax power stations native yorkshire and humber area this year saw the groups overall impact extend much further an i mpact beyond the northern powerhouse roughly a quarter 419 million of draxs total contribution to uk gdp was generated in the yorkshire and the humber region when the north west and north east were included the company impacted the northern economy to the tune of 577m and supported over 6000 jobs yorkshire and the humber was closely followed by the east of england  the home of haven power  which saw the second highest impact  registering more than 200 million contributed in gva  and london and the east midlands  this is thanks in part to the growing activities of drax group companies both haven power and opus energy which became a part of drax group in february 2017 are helping the uk move towards a low carbon future by supplying an increasing amount of british companies with renewable power  with offices in ipswich oxford northampton and cardiff haven power and opus energy highlight how drax group businesses are direct drivers for local gdp and employment opus energy supported 1600 jobs and 130 million in gva in wales  while haven power contributed 232 million to the east of england these numbers are noteworthy but what makes them all the more significant is how this translates into tax revenue operations at drax group generated an estimated 327 million for the uks public purse  equivalent to the salaries of almost 14000 nurses or 11900 teachers as the group continues to grow  adding new power generation assets to the national electricity transmission system and helping more businesses use renewable power  drax can increase its positive impact on the uks economy and help to make the countrys lowcarbon future a reality more quickly to find out more about how drax has benefited the uks economy visit draximpactcouk  the full 2016 report can be downloaded
