Negative emissions
Will Gardiner’s Drax carbon negative ambition remarks at COP25
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
10 December 2019
Opinion

Thank you very much Nick, it’s a pleasure to be here in Madrid. My name is Will Gardiner and I am the CEO of the Drax Group. We have been proud members of the
Powering Past Coal Alliance
for a year now, but our journey beyond coal began more than a decade ago, when we realised that we had a responsibility to our communities, our shareholders and our colleagues to be part of the solution to the escalating climate crisis.
And so at Drax we did something that many believed wasn’t possible and began to
replace coal generation with sustainable, renewable biomass
.
With the right support and commitment from successive UK ministers, and through the ingenuity of our people, within a decade we transformed into Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and its biggest source of renewable power –
generating 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity last year
while reducing our carbon emissions by more than 80% since 2012.
We have reduced our emissions, we believe, more than any other energy company in the world and we have enabled a just transition for thousands of UK workers who began their career in coal but will end it by producing renewable, flexible and low carbon power for 13 million British homes.
But as the climate crisis intensifies and the clock counts down, we can’t stand still. So today I am pleased to share our new ambition: to move beyond carbon neutrality, to achieve something that nobody has before, and
become the world’s first carbon negative company by 2030
.
By applying carbon capture and storage technology to our bioenergy generation we can become the first company in the world to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we produce, while continuing to produce about 5% of the UK’s overall electricity needs.
As the IPCC and UK government’s Committee on Climate Change make clear –
negative emissions are vital if we are to limit the earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees
.
At Drax we can be the first company to produce negative emissions at scale, helping to arrest climate change and redefining what is possible in the transition beyond coal.
If we are to defeat the climate crisis we must do it in a way that unlocks jobs and economic growth, unleashes entrepreneurial spirit and leaves nobody behind. The UK is unrivalled in decarbonising in this way. We are second to none in deploying renewables like
offshore wind
and
bioenergy
, which have transformed lives and our post-industrial communities.
We need to apply a similar framework to Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage as made offshore wind so successful. Fundamentally, an effective strategic partnership of government and the private sector was critical. The government provided support and an effective carbon tax regime. With confidence in that regulatory framework, many businesses provided investment and innovation. As a result, offshore wind has grown from less than 600 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity in 2008 to more than 8,000 MW in 2018 — an increase of more than 13 times in 10 years to produce 7.5% of the UK’s electricity.
At the same time, the
cost of that electricity has declined
from £114/MWh in 2015 to £39/MWh in 2019, the latter being a cost that will make offshore wind viable without subsidy. With government support and an effective regulatory regime to give the private sector the confidence to invest and innovate, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will trace that same path. At the same time, investing in this technology will both save lots of existing jobs and create many next generation green technology jobs.
That is why we have founded, along with Equinor and National Grid,
Zero Carbon Humber
, to work with the government to bring carbon capture and storage infrastructure to the northeast of the UK. We can save 55,000 existing heavy industry jobs, while capturing as much as 30 million tons of CO
2
per year. At the same time we will create a new industry and also the infrastructure for a new hydrogen economy to take our decarbonisation further.
By creating the right conditions for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to flourish, Britain can continue to benefit – socially, economically and environmentally from being at the vanguard of the fight against climate change.
And at the same time, it is our ambition at Drax to play a major role in that fight by becoming the first carbon negative company.
Thank you

The policy needed to save the future
6 December 2019
Carbon capture

Over the past decade the United Kingdom has decarbonised significantly as coal power has been replaced by sources like biomass, wind and solar. Every year power generation
emits fewer and fewer tonnes of carbon thanks to renewables
and with the ban on the sale of new diesel and petrol cars coming in no later than 2040, roads and urban areas are about to get cleaner too.
However, there are still tough challenges ahead if the UK is to meet its target of carbon neutrality by 2050. Aviation, heavy industry, agriculture, shipping, power generation – some of the key activities of daily economic life – all remain reliant on fuels that emit carbon.
This is where Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) technologies have a big role to play. These can capture carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and either store them or use them, helping the drive towards carbon neutrality.
While the idea of being able to capture carbon has been around for some time, the technology is fast catching up with the ambition. There now exist a number of credible solutions that allow for capturing emissions. The challenge, however, is putting in place the framework and policies needed to enable technologies to be implemented at scale.
Time is short. A
recent report by Vivid Economics
for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) emphasised the need for government action
now
if we are to achieve the volume of carbon removal needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
The tech to take emissions out of the atmosphere
The planet naturally absorbs CO
2
, forests absorb it as they grow, mangroves trap it in flooded soils, and oceans absorb it from the air. So, harnessing this power through planting, growing and actively managing forests is one natural method of GGR that can be easily implemented by policy.

The idea of using
technology
to capture CO
2
and prevent its release into the atmosphere has been around since the 1970s. It was first
deployed successfully in enhanced oil recovery
, when captured emissions are injected into underground oil reserves to help remove the oil from the ground.
Over time it’s been developed and is now in place in a number of fossil fuel power stations around the world, allowing them to
cut emissions
. However, by combining the same technology with renewable fuels like compressed biomass wood pellets, we can generate electricity that is
carbon negative
.
Each of these solutions operate in different ways, but all are important. Vivid Economics’ report emphasises that a range of different solutions will be required to reach a point where 130 million tonnes of CO
2
(MtCO
2
) are being removed from the atmosphere in the UK annually by 2050.
However, investment and clear government planning and guidance will be crucial in enabling the growth of GRR. The report estimates large-scale GGR could cost around £13 billion per year by 2050 in the UK alone, a figure similar in size to current government support for renewables.
“If you went back 20-odd years, people were sceptical of the role of wind, solar and biomass and whether the technologies would ever get to a cost point where they could be viably deployed at scale,” explains Drax Policy Analyst Richard Gow.
“In the last few years we’ve seen enormous cost reductions in renewables and people are far more confident in investing in them – that has been driven by very good government policy.”
GGR needs the same clear long-term strategy to
enable companies to make secure investments and innovate
. But what shape should those policies take for them to be effective?
Options for policies
Perhaps the most straightforward route to enabling GGR is to build on existing policies. For example, there are existing tree planting schemes such as the Woodland Carbon Fund, Woodland Carbon Code and the Country Stewardship Scheme, all of which could receive greater regulatory support, or additional rules obliging emitters to invest in
actively managed forests
.
More technically complex solutions, like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), could be incentivised by alternative mechanisms in order to provide clarity on, and to stabilise, revenue streams.
These are already used to support companies building low-carbon power generation
such as through the Contracts for Difference scheme and have been effective in encouraging investment in projects with high upfront costs and long-payback periods.
Alternative options to support the roll-out of negative emissions technologies should also be considered. For example, the government could make it obligatory for companies that contribute to emissions, to pay for GGR to avoid increased burden on electricity consumers.
In such a scenario, fossil fuel suppliers would be required to offset the emissions of their products by buying negative emissions certificates from GGR providers. As a result, the price of fossil fuels for users would likely rise to cover this expense and the costs would then be shared across the supply chain rather than just a single party.
Another approach that passes the costs of GGR deployment on to emitters is using emissions taxes to fund tax credits for GGR providers.
Making these tax credits tradable would also mean any large tax-paying company, such as a supermarket or bank, could buy tax credits from GGR providers. This approach would come at no cost to government as sales of the tax credits would be funded by an emissions tax and would offer revenue to GGR providers.
The challenge with tax credits, however, is they are vulnerable to changes in government. An alternative is to offer direct grants and long-term contracts with GGR providers which would ensure funding for projects that transcends changes in Parliament. They could, however, prove costly for government.
Whatever policy pathway the government may choose to follow, there are underlying foundations needed to support effective GGR deployment.
Making policies work

There are still many unknown factors in GGR deployment, such as the precise volume that will be needed to counter hard-to-abate emissions. This means all policy must be flexible to allow for future changes, and the individual requirements of different regions (forest-based solutions might suit some regions, DACCS might be better in others).
Underlying the strength of any of these policies, is the need for accurate carbon accounting. Understanding how much emissions are removed from the atmosphere by each technology will be key to reaching a true net zero status and giving credibility to certificates and tax credits.

Proper accounting of different technologies’ impact will also be crucial in delivering innovation grants. These can come through the UK’s existing innovation structure and will be fundamental to jumpstarting the pilot programmes needed to test the viability of GGR approaches before commercialisation.
Different approaches to GGR have different levels of effectiveness as well as different costs. BECCS, for example,
serves two purposes in both generating low-carbon power and capturing emissions
– resulting in overall negative emissions across the supply chain.

“It’s important to account for the full value chain of BECCS,” explains Gow. “Therefore, it should be rewarded through two mechanisms: a CfD for the clean electricity produced and an incentive for the negative emissions. A double policy here is important because you are providing two products which benefit different sectors of the economy, one benefits power consumers and the other provides a service to society and the environment as a whole, and cost should be apportioned as such.
BECCS and DACCS also have to consider
wider supply chains, such as carbon transport and storage infrastructure
. Although this requires a high initial investment, by connecting to industrial emitters, it can enable providers to recover the costs through charges to multiple network users.
Ultimately, the key to making any GGR policies work effectively and efficiently is speed. In order to put in place accounting principles, test different methods, and begin courting investors, government needs to act now.
The Vivid Economics report “is further confirmation of the vital role that BECCS will play in reaching a net zero-carbon economy and the need to deploy the UK’s first commercial project in the 2020s,” Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner says.
“Our successful BECCS pilot is already capturing a tonne of carbon a day. With the right policies in place, Drax could become the world’s first negative emissions power station and the anchor for a zero carbon economy in the Humber region.”
It will be significantly more cost efficient to begin deploying GGR in the next decade and slowly increase it up to the level of 130 MtCO
2
per year, than attempting to rapidly build infrastructure in the 2040s in a last-ditch effort to meet carbon neutrality by 2050.

Laying down the pathway to carbon capture in a net zero UK
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
17 July 2019
Opinion

The starting gun has fired and the challenge is underway. The government has officially set 2050 as the target year in which
the UK will achieve carbon neutrality
.
There’s no denying this economy-wide transformation will need a great deal of investment. Reaching net zero carbon emissions will require an evolutionary overhaul of not just Great Britain’s electricity system but the UK economy as a whole. And indeed, the way we live our lives and go about our business.
But that doesn’t mean it’s out of reach. Instead it will fall to technologies such as carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS), as well as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to make it economical and possible.
The secret to making decarbonisation affordable
The UK’s Committee on Climate Change (CCC) estimates the price of decarbonisation will cost as little as 1% of forecast GDP per annum in 2050.
However, the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Select Committee inquiry found that failure to deploy CCUS and BECCS technology could
double the cost to 2%.
There are a number of reasons for this, such as the cost to jobs, productivity and living standards of shutting down industrial emitters. CCUS’s ability to
contribute to a hydrogen economy
can help avoid this.
Moreover, the CCC claims even with industries striving to decarbonise rapidly, as much as 100 megatonnes of hard-to-abate carbon dioxide (CO
2
) is expected to remain in the UK economy by 2050.
This makes
carbon negative techniques and technologies
, such as BECCS – which uses woody biomass that has absorbed carbon in its lifetime as forests – alongside direct air capture (DAC), the boosting of ocean plant productivity, much greater tree planting and better sequestration of carbon in soil, essential if the UK is to attain true carbon neutrality.
The importance of BECCS and CCUS in the zero carbon future is clear. Now is the time for rapid development. Not in 2030, not in 2040, but today in 2019 and into the 2020s.
But doing this requires the government to move beyond its historic policies that have failed to support the technology in the past. Progress needs long-term frameworks that provide private sector investors with the certainty they need to kick-start the commercial-scale deployment of CCUS technologies.
Laying down the tracks to negative emissions

For carbon capture to become an integrated part of the energy system it must deliver value well beyond the energy sector. Establishing markets for
products developed from captured carbon
will play a role here, but to set the wheels in motion, financial frameworks are needed that can allow BECCS and CCUS to thrive.
One device that can allow the market to develop CCUS is the creation of
contracts for difference
(CfDs) for carbon capture. These currently exist in the low-carbon generation space, between generators and the government-owned Low Carbon Contracts Company (
LCCC
). Through these contracts, power generators are paid the difference between their cost of generating low carbon electricity (known as a strike price) and the price of electricity in Great Britain’s wholesale power market. If the power price in the market is higher than the strike price generators pay the difference back to the LCCC, meaning consumers are protected from price spikes too.
It means that the generator is protected from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power, offering the security to invest in new technology. More than this, CfDs last many years meaning they transcend political cycles and the cost per megawatt can be reduced with a longer contract. Creating a market for carbon capture or negative emissions generation could offer the same security to generators to invest in the technology.
A CfD for BECCS should not only incentivise the building of infrastructure to capture carbon, but we must also recognise the valuable role that negative emissions can play. By compensating BECCS producers for their negative emissions, it should provide a lower cost alternative to reducing all other CO2 emissions to zero, while still ensuring that the UK can get to net zero.
Beyond installing carbon capture at existing generation sites, one of the major financial barriers to the wider deployment of CCUS and BECCS is the cost and liability associated with transporting and storing captured carbon.
A Regulated Asset Base (RAB) funding model, would encourage investment by gradually recovering the costs of transport and storage via a regulated return. This approach is currently
under consideration as a means of financing other major infrastructure projects
.
A RAB allows businesses, including investment and pension funds, to invest in projects under the oversight of a government regulator. In exchange for their commitment, investors can collect a fee through regular consumer and non-domestic bills.
Led by industry; guided by government
Ultimately, the current carbon trading system is based around charging polluters. But as we approach a post-coal UK and in order to achieve net zero, it’s necessary for this to evolve – from economically disincentivising emissions to incentivising carbon-negative power generation.
However, with the cost of carbon capture and negative emissions differing between types of industries and technologies, there’s a requirement to consider differentiated carbon prices to guide industry through long-term strategy. But the need for carbon capture development is too pressing for us as an industry to wait.
At Drax Power Station our BECCS pilot is just the beginning of our wider ambitions to become the first negative emissions power station. Our use of biomass already makes Drax Power Station the largest generator of renewable electricity in Great Britain. The responsibly-managed working forests our suppliers source from absorbed carbon from the atmosphere as they grew so adding carbon capture at scale to this supply chain can turn our operation from low carbon, to carbon-neutral and eventually carbon negative.
And we have bigger plans still to
create a net zero carbon industrial cluster in the Humber region
, in partnership with Equinor and National Grid. The cluster would deliver carbon capture at the scale needed to not just decarbonise the most carbon-intensive industrial region in the UK, but to put the country at the forefront of the decarbonisation of industry and manufacturing.
Government action is needed to make CCUS and BECCS economically sustainable at scale as an integrated part of our energy system. However, the onus is on us, the energy industry to lead development and act as trusted partners that can deliver the decarbonisation needed to reach net zero carbon by 2050.

Could turning carbon dioxide into fish food feed the future?
17 June 2019
Carbon capture

Reducing carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions is one today’s greatest global challenges. But it‘s far from the only issue the world faces. The global population is expected to grow by a third to hit 10 billion by 2050 – an incredible growth that will place huge stress on securing a sustainable source of nutritious, healthy food for future generations.
One UK start-up,
Deep Branch Biotechnology
, is aiming to tackle both problems with a single solution that utilises captured CO
2
emissions to create animal feed protein. In the past, Drax has explored using CO
2
captured from its biomass units to help prevent a
looming summer beer shortage
. Now it’s
partnering with Deep Branch
to test if captured CO
2
can solve some of agriculture’s most-pressing problems.
Broken food chain
The amount of land and resources dedicated to producing animal feed is increasingly unsustainable. A third of all the earth’s cropland is currently used to
grow feed crops for livestock
, which adds up to more
than 90% of all global soy, and 60% of all cereals
.
Soy seedlings
“The process of creating the protein we eat on our plates is extremely resource inefficient,” says Peter Rowe, Deep Branch CEO. “It takes about 6 kilograms (kg) of feed to produce one kg of pork. Soy is one of the world’s most widely produced crops but more than 90% of it goes into animal feed.”
It’s not just on land where feed crops are creating problems. Of fish caught around the world, an incredible
25% is processed into fishmeal for the aquaculture
, or fish farming, industry. The demand for fishmeal is such that at present it outpaces demand for fish.
Even with an increasing number of people
shifting to meat-free diets
and
more alternatives making headlines
, meat production is still expected to double by 2050.
These industries need serious overhauls if they are to sustain into the coming decades. Deep Branch, helped via funding from
Innovate UK
, is looking to aquaculture as a test bed for sustainable protein production whilst also encouraging CO
2
capture.
Turning carbon to carp
The secret behind Deep Branch’s approach to turning emissions into fish food is a strain of bacteria that feeds on CO
2
.
The partnership will see Deep Branch connect directly to a source of CO
2
, with the start-up taking up residence in Drax’s carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) incubator space. Here, flue gas from one of Drax’s biomass power generation units will be fed into Deep Branch’s system, along with hydrogen, enabling a process known as gas fermentation to take place.

“Normally when people think of fermentation, they think about something like wine, where sugar is converted into alcohol with a yeast acting as the biological catalyst,” says Rowe. “Our process, however, uses CO
2
and hydrogen instead of sugar. Rather than yeast, our proprietary bacterium acts as the biological catalyst and converts these gases into protein.”
The resulting product is single cell protein, which comes out as a milk-like liquid when harvested. It’s then dried into powder and 70% of what remains are proteins that can be used as a fishmeal replacement.
One of the advantages of Deep Branch’s system is that rather than requiring energy to separate CO
2
, flue gas can be delivered directly to microbes, which can convert up to 70% of the captured CO
2
into proteins. But for such a system to have a real impact it needs to be deployed at scale.
Scaling up
The process has been trialled in labs and proved highly efficient, with ten kg of CO
2
producing seven kg of protein. What this new partnership with Drax offers is the opportunity to test Deep Branch’s process and technology at grid-scale. And while Deep Branch is focusing on aquaculture for now, the concept could potentially reach much further through the food chain.
Fish feed
“Because Drax’s
biomass units are carbon neutral
at the point of generation, the process creates an extremely low-carbon protein,” explains Rowe. “If you divorce the negative environmental impacts of industries like agriculture from its growth then you can provide more whilst impacting less.”
Deployed at global scale the idea of carbon-neutral protein would free up some of the arable land currently being used for soy and other feed crops. It means that as well as cutting the carbon intensity of traditional protein sources, more land would be available for other uses, while helping to halt climate change.

Negative emissions


Capturing carbon emissions from the atmosphere could transform these industries
24 April 2019
Carbon capture

Countries, companies and industries around the world are racing to find ways to reduce their emissions. But looking slightly further down the line there is in fact a grander aim:
negative
emissions.
Negative emissions technologies
(NETs) can actually absorb more carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from the atmosphere than they emit, and they’re vitally important for avoiding catastrophic, man-made climate change. Without NETs it could be impossible to achieve the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s ambition of keeping temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
One example already being implemented is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It is what its name suggests. Using technologies to capture and store the CO
2
generated during the process of energy generation from biomass or organic materials rather than releasing it into the atmosphere.
BECCS holds vast potential in the electricity generation industry. Drax Power Station is currently
piloting one form of this technology
on one of its biomass units to capture as much as a tonne of CO
2
a day. But if it were deployed across all its biomass units, BECCS technology could make it the world’s first negative emissions power station.
Beyond the power industry, however, there’s scope for growth across other industries once the biomass is sourced sustainably. There are already five sites around the world where BECCS is being trialled and implemented at scale, laying the road to negative emissions.
Storing CO
2
from ethanol production in the Illinois Basin
The ethanol production industry is already seeing significant deployment of BECCS, including the largest installation of the technology operating in the world. The Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage project is part of a corn-to-ethanol plant in the US that has the capacity to capture
1 million tonnes of CO
2
every year
.
Here, corn is used to create ethanol by fermenting it in an oxygen-deprived environment. This process creates CO
2
as a by-product, which is captured and stored permanently in pores within the sandstone of the Illinois Basin under the facility.
Researchers believe with further development the site could capture as much as 250 million tonnes each year.
Norway’s cement challenge

Concrete is one of the world’s most versatile building materials. As a result it is the
second most-consumed material in the world behind water
– more than 10 billion tonnes of it is produced every year. However, its key ingredient – cement, which acts as concrete’s binding agent – is made using a hugely carbon-intensive manufacturing process and now accounts for as much as 6% of all global carbon emissions.
The Norcem Cement plant in Brevik, South-East Norway, has been experimenting with using biomass to power the kilns used to create its cement (which must heat ingredients to 1,500 degrees Celsius). Now it’s taking this a step further by becoming part of the country’s ambitious Full Chain CCS project.
The project will see 400,000 tonnes of CO
2
captured annually, which will then be transported by ship to a storage site on Norway’s western coast. From here a pipeline will transport the CO
2
50 kilometres away and deposit it deep below the North Sea’s bed.
The plan has the potential to work at an even bigger scale. The pipeline will be
capable of receiving as much as 4 million tonnes of CO
2
per year
, meaning it could even import and store carbon from other countries.
Burning waste and growing algae
In a world that seems increasingly unsure how to safely deal with its waste, the idea of incinerating it and making use of the heat this produces seems widely beneficial. But combusting any solid means releasing carbon emissions.
In Japan, however, a biomass-fired waste incineration plant is changing this by being the first in the world to capture its carbon emissions.
To get this project up and running, Toshiba, the firm behind the project, had to overcome unique challenges. For example,
waste incineration produces a greater mix of chemicals
than in ethanol or power production, including some that are corrosive to the metal pipes normally used in carbon capture.
Now running at commercial scale, the Saga City waste incineration plant isn’t just capturing CO
2
, it’s also utilising it to
cultivate crops at a nearby algae farm
. The carbon is being absorbed and used to grow algae for use in commercial scale cosmetic products, such as body and skin lotions.
Carbon isn’t the only thing finding new use at the facility. Reconstituted scrap metal from the plant is being used to make the medals for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The carbon capture system has been operational since 2016 and is capable of capturing 3,000 tonnes of CO
2
a year, but it isn’t the region’s first deployments of BECCS.

Fully integrating BECCS into biomass power
Nearby, the Mikawa power plant on the Fukuoka Prefecture, is leading the race in Asia to fully integrate carbon capture technology into a biomass power station.
The 50 MW power station successfully piloted carbon capture in 2009 through a partnership with Toshiba. At the time it was powered by coal, however, in 2017, the plant
upgraded to a 100% biomass boiler
fuelled by palm kernel shells – a waste product from palm oil extraction mills. Now it’s in the process of ramping up its carbon capture capabilities, with a target of being operational in 2020.
The system – which after Drax will be the second plant in the world to capture carbon using 100% biomass feedstock – will have the
capacity to capture more than 50% of the biomass plant’s CO
2
emissions, or as much as 180,000 tonnes per year
. Japan’s government is now supporting efforts to develop CO
2
transportation and potential offshore storage solutions for next year.
Pulping wood and growing food
BECCS technology has yet to be deployed in the paper industry to the same extent as in other organic-matter-based industries. But with many pulp and paper mills already using
by-products, such as hog fuel
, in generating power for their sites, it’s a prime area for BECCS growth.
In Saint-Felicien, Quebec, commercial-scale
carbon capture technology
is being deployed at a pulp mill run by Resolute Forest Products, and, as of March 2019, had a capacity of capturing 11,000 tonnes of CO
2
a year. Rather than storage, however, it supplies the carbon
to a cucumber-growing greenhouse next door to the mill
, as well as supplying enough warm water to meet 25% of the greenhouses’ heating needs.
Both long established biomass-based industries like ethanol and paper, and new sectors like electricity, are now adopting BECCS technology and driving innovation.
The biomass feedstocks involved in BECCS must, however, be sourced sustainably – or else a positive climate impact could be at the expense of environmental degradation elsewhere. ‘It should be possible to expand biomass supply in a sustainable way,’ found a recent
‘Global biomass markets’ report
from Ricardo AEA for the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).
While it’s still a complex technology to deploy, BECCS is increasingly operating at larger scales and growing to the level needed to seriously reduce industrial CO
2
emissions and help to combat climate change.

Negative emissions


Negative emissions techniques and technologies you need to know about
28 November 2018
Carbon capture

Cutting carbon emissions is the headline environmental policy for the 195 countries signed up to the Paris Climate Agreement – and so it should be. Decarbonisation is crucial to keeping global warming below 2
o
C and avoiding or at least mitigating
potentially dire consequences
for our planet, its people and biodiversity.
However, centuries of pumping out carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from factories, vehicles and power plants means it’s not enough just to reduce output. Countries must also work on CO
2
removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. Implemented at scale, what’s also known as Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) could mean a country or facility removing more CO
2
than it emits – effectively giving it negative emissions.
Achieving this is not only advantageous to combating climate change, it’s essential. A new
report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
explores 116 scenarios in which global warming is kept to 1.5
o
C of pre-industrial levels (more ambitious than the Paris Agreements 2
o
C). Of these scenarios, 101 use negative emissions technologies (NETs) at
a scale of between 100 to 1,000 gigatonnes
*
over the 21st century.
Given the scale of the ambition, the task of capturing enough carbon to be truly negative will need to rely on many sources. Here are some of the techniques, technologies, and innovations aiming to push the world towards negative emissions.
Forests
Weyerhaeuser Nursery, Camden, Alabama
CDR doesn’t have to utilise complex tech and chemistry. The planet’s natural carbon cycle already removes and stores huge amounts of carbon from the atmosphere – primarily through trees. The world’s forests have absorbed
as much as 30% of annual global human-generated CO
2
emissions
over the last few decades.
Regenerating depleted forests (reforestation), planting new forests (afforestation), and protecting and helping existing forests thrive through
active management
can all contribute to offsetting emissions.
The IPCC report estimates
that reforestations and afforestation could potentially capture 0.5 and 3.6 billion tonnes of CO
2
a year at a cost of USD$5 to $50 (£3.90 to £39) per metric tonne.
There are potential drawbacks of extensive afforestation. It could compete with food crops, as well as reducing the reflection of heat and light back into space that arid lands currently offer to prevent global warming.
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
Europe’s first BECCS pilot project at Drax Power Station
Biomass on its own is an important fuel source in lowering emissions from industries such as power generation. On one hand, it’s created by organic material, which during its lifetime absorbs carbon from the atmosphere (often enough to offset emissions from transportation and combustion). On another, it creates a sustainable market for forestry products, encouraging landowners to responsibly manage forests, which in turn
can lead to growing forests
and increased CO
2
absorption.
But when combined with
carbon capture and storage (CCS or CCUS) technology
it becomes a negative carbon emissions process, known as BECCS. Drax is partnering with carbon capture company C-Capture in a £400,000 pilot to develop CCS technology, which will remove a tonne of carbon from its operations a day. Combined with the carbon removed by the forests supplying the biomass, it could turn Drax into the
world’s first negative emissions power station
.
Beyond just storing the captured carbon underground, however, it can be
used to create a range of products
, locking in and making use of the carbon for much longer.
The IPCC report estimates between 0.5 and 5 billion metric tonnes of carbon could be captured globally this way at a cost of $100 to $200 (£80-160) per metric tonne.
Increased ‘blue carbon’
Mangrove roots
It’s not only forests of fast-growing pines or eucalyptus that remove CO
2
from the atmosphere. In fact, coastal vegetation such as mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses suck in and store carbon in soil at a
greater rate than plants on land
. The carbon stored in these waterside ecosystems is known as ‘blue carbon’.
Human encroachment and development on coastlines has depleted these environments. However, efforts are underway to regenerate and expand these hyper-absorbent ecosystems –turning them into carbon sinks that can remove more emissions from the atmosphere than conventional forests.
Apple is currently throwing its financial weight behind a mangrove expansion project in Colombia
to try and offset its global operations.
Boosting ocean plants’ productivity
Beyond costal mangroves, the ocean is full of plants that use CO
2
to photosynthesise – in fact, the oceans are thought to be one of the world’s largest carbon sinks. But there are some people who think we could enhance marine plants’ absorption abilities.
Eelgrass Bed
One such approach
involves injecting iron nutrients into the ocean
to prompt a bloom in microscopic plants called
phytoplankton, which float in the upper part of the ocean
absorbing the CO
2
absorbed from the atmosphere. When the plants eventually die they then sink trapping the absorbed carbon on the seabed.
An additional positive effect would be an increase in dimethyl sulphide, which marine plants emit. This could alter the reflectivity of clouds that absorb water from the ocean and further act to cool the earth.
Enhanced rock weathering
Plants absorbing CO
2
through photosynthesis is the most-commonly known part of the carbon cycle, however, rocks also absorb CO
2
as they weather and erode.
The CO
2
usually reaches the rock in the form of rain, which absorbs CO
2
from the atmosphere as it falls. It then reacts with the rocks, very slowly breaking them down, and forming a bicarbonate that is eventually washed into the ocean, locking the carbon on the seabed.
The problem is it takes a long time. One idea that seeks to use this natural process more effectively is to
speed it up by pulverising rocks
and spreading the resulting powder over a larger area to absorb more CO
2
from rain and air.
Natural rock weathering currently absorbs around
0.3% of global fossil fuel emissions annually,
but the IPCC estimates at scale it could capture 2 and 4 billion metric tons at a cost of between $50 and $200 (£39-160) per metric ton. This approach also requires extensive land use and has not been trialled at scale.
Sequestering carbon in soil
Soil
is another major carbon sink. Plants and grasses that die and rot store carbon in the soil for long periods. However, modern farming techniques, such as intensive ploughing and fertilisation, causes carbon to be released and oxidised to form CO
2
.
Adjustments in farming methods could change this and, at scale,
make agriculture carbon neutral
. Straightforward techniques such as minimising soil disturbance, crop rotation and grassland regeneration could sequester as much as 5 billion tonnes of carbon into the soil annually, according to the IPCC, at potential zero cost.
A challenge to this method is that once soil is saturated it can’t hold any more carbon. That material would also be easily released if methods are not maintained in the future.
Increasing soil carbon with biochar
A way to super-charge how much carbon soil can store is to add a substance called biochar to the earth. A type of charcoal made
by burning biomass
, such as wood or farm waste, in the absence of oxygen, biochar can increase the amount of carbon locked into the soil for hundreds or thousands of years. It also helps soil retain water, and reduce methane and nitrogen emissions.
Biochar has only been trialled at a small scale but the IPCC estimates that between 0.5 and 2 billion metric tonnes could be captured annually through this means. However, it predicts a cost of between $30 and $120 (£23-94) per metric tonne. Additionally, producing biochar at scale would require large amounts of biomass that must be sustainably sourced.
Direct air capture
CO
2
is in the air all around us and so removing it from the atmosphere can effectively take place anywhere. Direct air capture (DAC or DACCS) proposes that the carbon capture and storage technology many power stations are now trialling can be carried out almost anywhere.
Direct Air Capture of CO2 by a Climaworks startup, KEZO, involving garbage Incineration in Switzerland
Swiss start-up
Climeworks is one company attempting to make DAC viable
. Its technology works by passing air through a surface that reacts with CO
2
to form a compound, but releases the remaining air. The newly formed compound is then heated so the reactive chemical agent can be separated and reused. The CO
2
is then stored underground with gas and water where it reacts with basalt and turns to stone in less than two years.
The main challenge for this technique is the cost – between $200 and $600 (£156-468) per metric tonne – and that it requires large amounts of energy, creating further demand for electricity.
One hundred million tonnes

The primary challenge for negative emission technology as a whole is that so few have actually been implemented at a global scale. However,
trials are in motion
around in the world, including at Drax, to remove emissions and help limit the effects of climate change.
Even if the UK decarbonises heavily across all sectors of the economy by 2050, there’s still projected to be 130 MtCO
2
(million tonnes of carbon dioxide) net emissions. But a Royal Academy/Royal Society report released earlier this year was optimistic. It concluded that the country can become net zero and do its part in mitigating man made climate change – with
BECCS identified as the negative emissions technology best suited to take the leading role and at least cost
.

Negative emissions


The roadmap to zero carbon
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
1 October 2018
Opinion

The UK has come a long way in its efforts to decarbonise. Greenhouse gas emissions last year were
43% below 1990 levels
, while increasing renewable electricity generation and a
strengthening carbon price
means the country could soon go
coal-free for an entire summer
.
There is still, however, much work needed to reach the UK target of reducing emissions to 20% of 1990 levels by 2050 and meeting the Paris Agreement’s aim of keeping temperature increases below two degrees Celsius. As ambitious as these goals may be, recent research by the
Energy Transitions Commission
(ETC) believes they
can
be met by 2050, with the right government policies and action from businesses.
To help to mitigate man made climate change, all industries, across all sectors must cut carbon emissions. It’s a big challenge but a clear first step must be the decarbonisation of electricity generation. This step will enable other industries to reduce their emissions in turn through electrification.
Since 2000 we have been building our experience in decarbonising electrical generation, transforming what was once Western Europe’s largest coal-fired power station into the UK’s biggest decarbonisation project. This puts us in a unique position to offer the leadership and innovation needed – across the electricity industry and other sectors – to reach a zero-carbon world.
Electricity generation will lead decarbonisation
The electrification of carbon-intensive sectors, such as transport and heating, will only contribute to reducing overall emissions if the electricity comes from mostly low or zero-carbon sources.
The ETC’s research suggests wind and solar will be capable of providing 85% of the world’s electricity generation by 2050. When these intermittent sources are unable to generate electricity the remaining 15% will come from a combination of nuclear, hydro, biomass and storage (including batteries, pumped storage and new technologies).
In fact, biomass alone could provide as much as half of that 15% but it is critical that this flexible, renewable, low carbon fuel must be sustainably sourced. For the wood biomass we use at Drax Power Station, its sourcing should contribute to growing and healthy forests, which will be another key part of the climate change solution.
Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group
At Drax, we have a long history of finding ways to cut emissions and improve the efficiency of
our own biomass pellet supply chain
, from bigger ships to more efficient rail freight loading and unloading.
The skills and experiences gained from these efforts serve not only to decarbonise our business but will benefit other supply chain-based industries along the path to lower-carbon emissions. More than this, it is far from the only way we are working towards doing this.
From here to zero-carbon
One of the biggest hopes for removing carbon from industry lies in carbon capture and storage. We’re leading the charge on bringing this technology to the fore by running a six-month pilot of a Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) system, which will capture a tonne of carbon every day from one of our four, 600+ megawatt (MW) biomass units.
Capturing emissions not only further reduces the carbon intensiveness of electricity generators of all kinds, but also opens
new revenue streams for businesses through utilising captured carbon
. For Drax, BECCS takes us another step towards becoming a
carbon negative operation
, where we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit. It is also an opportunity to further expand the knowledge and experience of our team and become leading experts in a field which
will be essential in meeting climate change goals
.
Alongside this, our plans to repower the last of our coal-fired units to highly-efficient combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) and build four, rapid-response open cycle gas turbines (OCGT) will give the electricity system the
flexibility needed to support more intermittent renewable sources
. The abilities of gas plant in
balancing and system services
can help to complete the journey away from coal before 2025. In subsequent decades, gas can play a pivotal role assisting the transition to a zero-carbon power system.
Our retail businesses,
Haven Power
and
Opus Energy
, also allow us to help companies and the public sector outside of electricity generation to reduce their carbon footprint. Beyond just supplying renewable electricity, we’re also looking at ways through closer customer partnerships to help businesses leverage new technologies to use electricity more efficiently and in turn lower their costs.
Reaching a zero-carbon future is a monumental task for electricity producers that depends on innovative thinking and new technologies. We have the experience in developing transformative ideas and making them a reality – all of which will be essential in guiding us into a brighter, more stable, decarbonised future.

What can be made from captured carbon?
11 September 2018
Carbon capture

The combination of a
heatwave
and an entertaining world cup campaign put big demands on Great Britain’s beer supplies this summer. But European-wide carbon dioxide (CO
2
) shortages put a hold on that celebratory atmosphere as word spread that a lack of bubbles could result in the country running out of beer.
The drinks business managed to hold out, but the threat of long term CO
2
shortages still lingers over the continent. One possible – and surprising – solution could lie in electricity generation, thanks to the capturing and storing of its carbon emissions.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS)
is one of the key technologies in need of development to allow nations to meet their Paris Agreement goals. It has the potential to stop massive amounts of emissions entering the atmosphere, but it also raises the question: what happens to all that carbon once it’s captured?
Drax recently
met with the British Beer & Pub Association
to discuss using some of the carbon it plans to capture in its upcoming trial of
Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)
to keep the fizz in drinks.
It’s a novel solution to a potential problem, but it’s just one of the many emerging possibilities being developed around the world.
Smarter sneakers
Carbon capture is all about reducing carbon footprints – a phrase energy company NRG interpreted quite literally by creating
‘The Shoe Without A Footprint’
. The white trainer was created to showcase the abilities of carbon capture, use and storage (CCuS) and is
made of 75% material produced from captured emissions
that have been turned into polymers, a molecular structure similar to plastics.
Only five pairs of the sneakers were created as part of NRG’s Carbon XPrize competition to find uses for captured carbon. However, they remain symbolic of the versatility offered by captured and stored carbon and its potential to contribute to the manufacture of everyday objects.
Better furniture
Finding an alternative to plastics is one of the key ways of facilitating a move away from global dependencies on crude oil. Sustainable materials company Newlight uses captured CO
2
or methane emissions to
create a bioplastic called AirCarbon
–  a thermopolymer, which means it can be melted down and reshaped.
The company has
teamed up with IKEA
, which will buy 50% of the 23,000 tonnes of bioplastic Newlight’s plant produces per year. It’s part of the Swedish furniture giant’s efforts to increase the amount of recycled materials it uses and means upcycled carbon could soon be appearing in millions of homes around the world.
Cleaner concrete
If the shoes people walk around on can be made from captured carbon, so too can the cities they walk within. Making concrete is a notoriously dirty process. Cement, the main binding agent in concrete, is thought to contribute to as much as
5% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions
, but this could change thanks to clever use and implementation of carbon capture technology.
At one level, CCS can be introduced to capture emissions from the manufacturing process. On another, the CO
2
captured can be used as a raw material from which to create the concrete, effectively ‘locking in’ carbon and storing it for the long term.
Teams of engineers, material scientists and economists at UCLA
who have worked on the problem for 30 years have succeeded in creating construction materials from CO
2
emissions in lab conditions using 3D printing technology. Now it’s just a matter of scaling it up to industrial usage.
A metal alternative
Carbon nanotubes are stronger than steel but lighter than aluminium, which makes them a hugely useful material. They’re currently used in jets, sports cars and even in industrial structures, but producing them can be expensive and, until recently, could not utilise CO
2
for manufacture. A team from George Washington University is changing that.
Its
C2CNT technology splits captured CO
2
into oxygen and carbon in a molten carbonate bath using electrolysis. From here the carbon is repurposed into carbon nanotubes at a high rate and lower cost than previous methods.
Future fuels
Transportation is one of the major emitters of carbon around the world, so any way it can be reduced or re-used in this field will be a huge positive. Carbon recycling company
LanzaTech has developed a way to do this via a process that uses anaerobic bacteria to ferment emissions
into cleaner chemicals and fuels.
Its first facility, opening this year in China, will create fuel-grade bioethanol that can be blended with gasoline to create vehicle fuel, or even
converted into jet fuel with 65% lower greenhouse gas emissions
.
Aviation, too, can benefit from carbon recycling through the creation of synthetic crude oil and gas using CO
2
. Technology company
Sunfire
is developing processes that combine hydrogen (set to become a major part of industry and transport) and biogenic CO
2
, (emissions from natural sources), to create synthetic hydrocarbons that could fuel planes.
From Silicon Valley to Valles Marineris
Earth isn’t the only place humans are innovating around carbon capture – at least, right now. With the race to send men and women to Mars stepping up, the challenges of dealing with its inhospitable atmosphere (which is 95% CO
2
) and ensuring a minimal human impact to the planet are becoming more acute. Carbon capture and use presents an opportunity to tackle both.
Californian company Opus 12 has developed
a device that recycles CO
2
from ambient air and industrial emissions and turns it into fuels and chemicals using only electricity and water. The device has the CO
2
conversion power of 37,000 trees (or 64 football fields of dense forest) packed into the volume of a suitcase, and can convert CO
2
into 16 different products.
In the long-term, the technology might provide critical services for human colonies on the Red Planet by capturing and using CO
2
from the atmosphere or any future Mars-based factories. The Opus 12 device can also use ice (buried on the planet
in places that could be accessible to astronauts
) to convert Mars CO
2
into plastic to make bricks and tools, methane that can form rocket fuel, and feedstocks for microbes to create medicine or food.
Turning pollution into possibilities
Many of these technologies are in their infancy, but the possibilities they present are very real. In fact, Drax’s upcoming trial of BECCS will see it capture and store as much as a tonne of carbon every day.
The proliferation of this technology in industry and electricity production – and the resultant increase in captured carbon – will help encourage more companies to see CO
2
emissions as an opportunity for revenue while helping countries meet their Paris Agreement emissions goals.
