power station ceo andy koss andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 8 april 2016 opinion a new survey from the green alliance and regen sw shows that selby in north yorkshire produces the most renewable energy of any area in england and wales as you can see drax s home tops the chart by a large margin thats because between three and four per cent of the uks electricity is generated from sustainable biomass here at drax power station weve already converted half the station to use compressed wood pellets that half of drax has reduced its carbon emissions by more than 80 per cent as a result but theres so much more drax could do to help the uk get more coal off the grid and if the green alliances next data visualization pitted renewables against fossil fuels a renewableonly drax as our countrys biggest power station would give low carbon technologies an even bigger share than would be the case today drax can not only generate more renewable power ourselves but also help solar and wind power to cope with demand as some of the older coal gas and nuclear plant retire over the coming years moving towards a balanced mix of renewables including further biomass upgrades at drax could save bill payers billions of pounds found research carried out by nera and imperial college london this was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main forms of renewable energy  wind solar and biomass the uk is already far below the european average when it comes to using wood for energy if the government made the right decision and levelled the playing field for biomass in the uk drax could help our country climb the table meet our national climate change targets more quickly and contribute to saving bill payers billions of pounds upgrading from coal to wood pellets is also ensuring drax group  which employs more than 1400 people  has a real future at the heart of the northern powerhouse however its not just for government to change the status quo  businesses have a role to play too many uk businesses have made firm commitments to limit and reduce their impact on the environment for all their use of energy is a critical area to consider and address some of the biggest electricity users such as thames water and manchester airport group are increasingly demanding renewable electricity drax groups haven power is proud to offer the only 100 guaranteed renewable electricity product in the market to businesses big and small perhaps thats what the green alliances next index could investigate  which businesses have taken practical steps towards a renewable
