is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are vital carbon sinks absorbing around 76 million tonnes of co 2

forestry and forest management and arboriculture  sustainability carbon markets will be essential in reaching net zero  we must ensure they support high standards 9 november 2022 carbon capture angela hepworth commercial director drax in brief the voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage dacs at scale the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is developing a set of core carbon principles ccps drax support proposed principals if theyre applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals standards around additionality and the permeance of carbon removals may apply very differently to naturebased and engineered removals something that needs to be addressed explicitly theres growing recognition in governments and environmental organisations of the urgent need to develop highintegrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective parisaligned climate goals bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  and direct air carbon capture and storage  dacs  are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely the technology is proven developers are bringing forward projects and the most forwardthinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from beccs and dacs developers yet theres a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals drax is a worldleader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of highintegrity permanent co 2 removals by 2030 from its beccs projects in the uk and the us we support the development of rigorous standards for co 2 removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the co 2 removals theyre buying such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to however the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits rather than removals to create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale rethinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency core carbon principles the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is in the process of developing a set of core carbon principles ccps and assessment framework af intended to set new threshold standards for highquality carbon credits at drax we welcome and support the principals proposed by the integrity council however its crucial theyre applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals and support rather than prevent their development many ccps are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies among the most important principals include those stating removals must be robustly quantified with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity while safeguarding commercially sensitive information removal credits should be subject to robust independent thirdparty validation and verification credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits registries must be subject to appropriate governance to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability taking account of impacts on nature the climate and society there should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates or between countries bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel and that the article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldnt trigger corresponding adjustments to countries carbon inventories however as pioneers in the field we believe that two of the core carbon principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals supporting additionality and development incentives the ccps state the greenhouse gas ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional ie they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues engineered carbon removal credits such as beccs and dacs are by their nature additional they are developed for the specific purpose of removing co 2 from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere they also rely on revenue from carbon markets  largely the voluntary market at present but potentially compliance markets such as the uk and eu ets in the future however most early projects are likely to have some form of government support eg 45q in the us or contracts for difference in the uk from outside carbon credit revenues but that support isnt intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment  project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets engineered carbon removals have high upfront capital costs and its clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable additionality assessments should be riskbased if its clear that a technologytype is additional a technologylevel assessment should be sufficient this should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects compensating against nonpermanent storage on the topic of permeance that ccps state the ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent or if they have a risk of reversal any reversals shall be fully compensated a key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small  the risk of reversal for naturebased credits by contrast is much greater schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for naturebased credits are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool potentially as much as 10 are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a wellmanged geological store they also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators similarly where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with co 2 storage risk which place liabilities on storage owners operators or governments the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers at drax we believe the ccps provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals if applied pragmatically they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product theyre buying and provide a clear framework for project developers they can ensure that standards support rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as beccs and dacs which are essential to achieving our global climate goals tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  technology why and how is carbon dioxide transported 11 april 2022 carbon capture what is carbon transportation carbon transportation is the movement of carbon from one place to another in nature carbon moves through the carbon cycle  in industries like energy however carbon transportation refers to the physical transfer of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from the point of capture to the point of usage or storage why does carbon need to be transported anthropogenic manmade co 2 released in processes like power generation leads to the direct increase of co 2 in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming  however these emissions can be captured as part of carbon capture and storage ccs  the co 2 is then transported for safe and permanent storage in geological formations deep underground capturing and storing co 2 prevents it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming processes that can deliver negative emissions  such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage dacs  aim to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere through ccs in ccs carbon must be transported from the site where its captured to a site where it can be permanently stored this means it needs to travel from a power station or factory to a geological formation like a saline aquifer or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as of september 2021 there were 27 operational ccs facilities around the world with the combined capacity to capture around 40 million tonnes per annum mtpa of co 2  its estimated that the uk alone has 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space in sandstone rock formations under the north sea how is carbon transported co 2 can be transported via trucks or ships but the most common and efficient method is by pipeline moving gases of any kind through pipelines is based on pressure gases travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure compressing gas to a high pressure allows it to flow to other locations gas pipelines are common all around the world including those transporting co 2  in the us there are for instance more than 50 co 2 pipelines  covering around 6500 km and transporting approximately 68 million tonnes of co 2 a year  gas takes up less volume when its compressed and even less when it is liquefied solidified or hydrated therefore before being transported captured co 2 is often compressed and liquefied until it becomes a supercritical fluid  in a supercritical state co 2 has the density of a liquid but the viscosity thickness of a gas and is therefore easier to transport through pipelines its also 5080 less dense than water with a viscosity that is 100 times lower than liquid this means it can be loaded onto ships in greater quantities and that there is less friction when its moving through pipes and subsequently into geological storage sites how safe is it to transport carbon its no riskier to transport co 2 via pipeline or ship than it is to transport oil and natural gas  and existing oil and natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to transport co 2  to enable the safe use of co 2 pipelines ccs projects must ensure captured co 2 complies with strict purity and temperature specifications as well as making sure co 2 is dry and free from impurities that could impact pipelines operations whilst there are a growing number of ccs transport systems around the world ccs is still is a relatively new field but research is underway to identify best practises materials and technologies to optimise the process this includes research around potential risks and techniques for leak mitigation and remediation in the uk the health and safety executive regulates health safety and integrity issues for all natural gas pipelines which are covered by legislation the legislation ensures the safety of pipelines pressure systems and offshore installations and can serve as a strong foundation for co 2 transport regulation fast facts globally ccs projects have been operational since the 1980s with more than 260 million tonnes of co 2 being captured and stored over 40 years the global capacity of ccs projects in development in september 2021 was 111 million tonnes per year  this was a 48 increase compared to the end of 2020 the uks existing gas transmission network is made up of some 7660 km of highpressure gas pipelines the price of reusing offshore oil and gas pipelines to transport co 2 could be just 1 to 10 of the cost of building a new pipeline go deeper catch up on how a range of carbon capture transport and storage projects around the world are progressing here are the details of five proposed carbon capture projects in the uk read the full story of how carbon is captured transported and stored how governments can implement the policies needed to enable ccs at scale  tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  engineering  negative emissions  technology how is carbon stored 13 january 2022 carbon capture carbon storage is the process of capturing and trapping that co 2  this can occur naturally in the form of carbon sinks like forests oceans and soils that store carbon however it can also be manually carried out through technology one of the most wellestablished ways of storing carbon through the use of technology is by injecting co 2 into naturally occurring geological formations that can lock in or sequester the molecule on a permanent basis carbon storage is the final phase of the carbon capture usage and storage ccus process why do we need to store carbon global bodies like the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as well as the uks own climate change committee emphasise carbon capture and storage as crucial to achieving net zero emissions and meeting the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to within 15 o c this includes supporting forest growth through afforestation and reforestation  and other naturebased solutions to store carbon alongside ccus technology  the european commission also highlights ccuss role in balancing increased energy demand and continued fossil fuel use in the future with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent them entering the atmosphere how is carbon captured and transported to storage in naturally occurring examples forests and ocean fauna absorb carbon through photosynthesis when the vegetation eventually decomposes the carbon is sequestered into soil and seabeds carbon can also be captured from emissions sources such as factories or power plants the carbon is captured either precombustion where it is removed from the fuel source or postcombustion where it is removed from exhaust fumes in the form of co 2  the co 2 is then converted into a supercritical state where it has the viscosity of a gas but the density of a liquid meaning it can travel more easily through pipelines it can also be transported via trucks and ships but pipelines are the most efficient where can carbon be stored natural carbon sinks differ all over the world from peatlands in scotland to pacific coral reefs to the massive forests that cover countries like russia canada and brazil wooden buildings also act as carbon storage as they maintain the carbon within the wood for long time periods the co 2 captured by manmade technologies can also be stored in different types of geological formation unused natural gas reserves saline aquifers and unminable coal mines the north sea with its expansive layers of porous sandstone also offers the uk alone an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  if negative emissions technologies which actively remove emissions from the atmosphere were to capture and store the equivalent amount of co 2 as the 258 million tonnes expected to remain in the uk economy in 2050 it would take up just 036 of the available storage space years of research by the oil and gas industries mean many such geological structures have been mapped and are well understood all around the world carbon storage fast facts the international energy agency iea estimates that an accumulative 100 billion tonnes or 100 gigatonnes of co 2 must be stored by 2060 to limit global warming to a 2 o c increase globally peatland soils contain more than 600 gigatonnes of carbon  exceeding the carbon stored in all other vegetation types including the worlds forests the united states geological survey estimates the country has a mean storage potential of 3000 gigatonnes of co 2 more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years over 25 million tonnes of captured carbon was permanently stored in sites across brazil norway and the united states in 2019 how is the carbon kept in place in naturebased carbon sinks the carbon does not always remain in one location in a forest for example trees and plants will hold carbon until the end of their lifetime after which they decompose releasing some co 2 into the atmosphere while some is sequestered into soil when co 2 captured through ccus is stored several things can happen to it in a geological storage site it can be caught in the minute intervening spaces within the rock through capillary action or trapped by a layer of impermeable caprock which prevents it from moving upwards co 2 may also dissolve in the water and then sinks as it is heavier than normal water the carbonated water reacts with basaltic rocks which cover most of the ocean floor the reaction releases elements like calcium magnesium and iron into the water stream over time these elements combine with the dissolved co 2 to form stable carbonate minerals that permanently fill pores within the rock how does co 2 enter the storage sites the co 2 is injected into the porous rocks of depleted or unused natural gas or oil reserves as well as saline aquifers  geologic strata filled with brine or saline water porous rock is filled with holes and gaps between the grains that make up the rock when co 2 is injected into these structures the co 2 floods the pores displacing the brine or remnants of oil and gas it then spreads out and is trapped in the domelike structures of the rock strata called anticlines how long can co 2 be stored appropriately selected and maintained geological reservoirs are very likely to retain 99 of sequestered carbon for more than 100 years and are likely to retain 99 of sequestered carbon for more than 1000 years according to the 2005 special report on ccs by the ipcc another study by nature found that more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years in natural carbon sinks the length of time that carbon is stored varies and depends on environments being preserved peatland for example builds up over thousands of years storing carbon however as peatlands degrade from attempts to drain them to create arable land as well as peat extraction for fuel they begin to emit co 2  the lifecycle of a tree by contrast is relatively short before it decomposes and releases some co 2 back into the atmosphere the ability for geological storage to contain co 2 for millennia means it can truly remove and permanently store emissions go deeper the history of carbon and how its removal
