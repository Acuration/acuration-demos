reduce emissions and create new job opportunities for the region dr neville hargreaves vp waste to fuels velocys said subject to planning consent and financing our altalto immingham project could be producing sustainable aviation fuel as soon as 2024 velocys has a robust technological solution for this challenging sector which addresses one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise and can help the

of a special dark blue thread to represent those who tragically lost their lives building what was the worlds first reversible pumped storage hydro system located in the western highlands of scotland ian kinnaird head of hydro at drax said building this unique power station was an astonishing feat of engineering completed in challenging conditions the work was physically demanding and at times incredibly dangerous sadly during the course of the construction 15 men lost their lives when we were commissioning this new tartan we decided it was a fitting tribute to incorporate 15 dark blue threads in memory of those who tragically died  many of whom were very young between 1959 and 1965 a 4000strong workforce built the power station on the shore of loch awe in argyll and bute  1300 of them were known as tunnel tigers  the men at the forefront of the work they drilled blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of the mountain barbara mccabe aged 81 click to viewdownload one of those who died was 23yearold edward gallagher from donegal  the fiancé of barbara mccabe now 81 who lives in invernessshire mrs mccabe explained how she got engaged to edward on december 21 1961 and they were planning to get married the following september however tragedy struck just before easter 1962 when loose rock in the ceiling of a tunnel fell down  the force of which was so strong it pulled edward out of his protective footwear he was such a lovely lovely man mrs mccabe recalled eddies father sent me a telegram and what it said was is eddie alright i didnt know what it meant i was busy getting ready for eddie coming down so we could spend easter together he shouldnt have been at work but hed swapped shifts with someone else who wanted to go home early for easter  that was what eddie was like he was a great young man always doing things like that to help people edward gallagher with barbara at queens park in glasgow 1961 click to viewdownload mrs mccabe explained that mr gallaghers father travelled across from ireland and they went together to the cottage hospital at oban where edward was being treated when i saw eddie there wasnt a mark on his face  but we were told his injuries were so severe there was no hope of survival he passed away in the early hours of easter monday  the 23 rd of april 1962 mrs mccabe has always stayed in touch with mr gallaghers family in donegal and has visited his grave at a chapel in the village of termon near letterkenny of the tartan drax has commissioned she said i think its a lovely way to make sure eddie and the others who died are always remembered ive told his family about it and im going to be sending them one of the new tartan scarves this christmas edward gallagher l february 1962 click to viewdownload hollowing out the ben cruachan mountain was done by handdrilling two to threemetredeep holes into the granite rockface gelignite was packed into the drilled holes and detonated  blasted rocks were then removed by bulldozers trucks and shovels before drilling began on a fresh section of exposed granite eventually some 220000 cubic metres of rubble was removed ian maclean from oban was a 20yearold joiner when he started working at cruachan in 1962 he said i worked as a joiner on the roof of what is the machine hall now the noise from the blasting was incredible  you didnt just hear it you felt it too there was a lot of dust but what bothered us the most was the smell  it was horrible there were fumes from the explosives as well as the dump trucks diesel engines that were running all the time  and we didnt have masks to wear some days the air was so thick you could only see a few yards in front of where you were standing ian maclean looking at the machine hall inside cruachan click to viewdownload
