decarbonised at a faster rate than other countries in the last decade  with emissions falling twice as quickly as in any other major economy a new report has found 30 november 2020 uks electricity system has more than halved its carbon intensity in the last decade decarbonising twice as fast as any other major economy demonstrating the uks climate leadership ahead of cop26 the rise of renewables means british households have reduced their co 2 emissions by three quarters of a tonne per year  equivalent to the co 2 emitted when a family of four flies off on holiday to spain new ambitious targets to grow offshore wind to 40 gigawatts by 2030 in the uk will require the expansion of energy storage technologies able to capture excess power independent analysis conducted via imperial consultants by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights shows the uks move away from coal to renewable power sources such as biomass and wind has dramatically driven down carbon emissions the change in electricity carbon intensity in the worlds thirty largest markets over the last decade click to viewdownload renewable power has grown sixfold in the last decade helping the uk to cut its carbon intensity by 58 this is double the reduction seen in other major economies over the same period generation from coal fell from 30 per cent to just two per cent of power produced over the period with renewables rising at the same time from eight per cent to supplying 42 per cent of the countrys electricity the changes to where our electricity comes from means british households have each reduced their co 2 emissions by three quarters of a tonne per year compared to the start of the decade which is roughly equivalent to the co 2 generated by a family of four taking a return flight from the uk to spain dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights reports said the uk has decarbonised its power grid at an astonishing rate over the last decade the country has transformed itself from relying on coal to keep the lights on to having its first coalfree month since the industrial revolution while this progress in the power sector has been rapid we now need to decarbonise wider society by using electricity to heat our homes and power our cars to achieve net zero by 2050 as the world marks five years since the paris agreement the uk offers an example of how fast energy transitions can be made the uks power system is set to grow even greener after the prime minister set a new target of installing 40 gigawatts gw of offshore wind by 2030 however the drax electric insights report also outlines the need for the uk grid to become more flexible to deliver this ambition with careful management required to keep the system stable once this ambition is realised upwards of 37 twh of excess electricity will be generated annually amid diverging weather and demand by 2030  with wind and solar power being unable to provide all the services needed to stabilise the system and maintain secure supplies one solution to this challenge is to expand storage capacity by increasing the role pumped storage hydro plays in storing excess power when supply outstrips demand and then to rapidly plug gaps when the wind is not blowing to provide fast flexible power and greater system stability will gardiner drax group ceo said the uk has made incredible progress decarbonising the electricity system over the last decade  for its part drax has drastically reduced its carbon emissions by 85 as a result of transforming the power station in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal making it the largest decarbonisation project in europe we share the governments ambition to go even further by embracing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and flexible technologies liked pumped storage hydro we will enable the uks power system to evolve and provide the secure and sustainable electricity supplies a zero carbon economy needs supporting the governments ten point plan for climate change whilst levelling up the economy drax recognises the potential of pumped storage hydro and is considering how its iconic cruachan site could be expanded  the group aims to become carbon negative by 2030 through pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire which could deliver millions of tonnes of negative emissions and simultaneously provide the grid with vital stability services while creating thousands of new

click to viewdownload editors notes the uks carbon intensity has fallen from from 450 grams of co 2 per kwh to 195gkwh since 2010 the co 2 emissions per passenger emitted by a return flight from london heathrow to madrid is 195kg  which adds up to 780kg for a family of four renewables provided their largest ever instantaneous share of power providing britain with 725 of its power at one point in the quarter drax announced its ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  by using beccs at scale at its north yorkshire power station last year a feasibility study was conducted into expanding cruachan in 2016 and drax is considering ways to unlock its full potential to support renewables  for more information visit electricinsightscouk or download the full report  about electric insights

worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 2900strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers through its two b2b energy supply brands haven power and opus energy drax supplies energy to 250000 businesses across england scotland and wales pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax
