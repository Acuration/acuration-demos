Completion of Acquisition of Louisiana Pellets
26 April 2017
Investors

RNS Number : 3839D
Drax Group PLC
(Symbol: DRX)
Following a court hearing to approve the result of an auction on 30 March 2017, Drax has now completed the acquisition of
substantially all of the assets of
Louisiana Pellets
(1)
. The acquisition price was $35.4m.
Louisiana Pellets will provide additional biomass pellet capacity in the region of 450k tonnes pa, playing an important part in Drax’s strategy to build a flexible supply chain capable of self-supplying 30% of its generation requirement.
The plant is expected to return to service by early 2018 following incremental investment to upgrade and optimise the facility.
Dorothy Thompson, Chief Executive Officer of Drax Group, said:
“Louisiana Pellets marks another positive step in delivering the Drax Group strategy.
“The deal forms part of our plan to significantly increase our capability to manufacture high quality compressed wood pellets and increase self-supply to Drax Power Station.
“Upgrading half the Power Station to use sustainable wood pellets has resulted in Drax producing 16% of the UK’s renewable electricity and with the right conditions we aim to do more.”

How space tech helps forests
20 April 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Can you count the number of trees in the world? Accurately, no – there are just too many, spread out over too vast an area. But if we could, what would we gain? For one, we would get a clearer picture of what’s happening in our planet’s forests.
They’re a hugely important part of our lives – not only for the resource they provide, but for their role in
absorbing carbon
dioxide (CO
2
). So properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them – whether increasing or decreasing – and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important.
The trouble is, they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally haven’t been able to accurately monitor them en masse. Thanks to space technologies, that’s changing.
The view from up there
As far back as World War II, aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment. In addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground, infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets.
As satellite and
remote sensing technology
developed through the 20
th
century, so too did our understanding of our planet. Satellites were used to map the weather, monitor the sea, and to create topological maps of the earth, but they weren’t used to track the Earth’s forests in any real detail.
But in 2021 the European Space Agency (ESA) will launch
Biomass
, a satellite that will map the world’s forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever P-band radar to be placed in Earth orbit. This synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches. It won’t just be able to track how much land a forest covers, but how much wood exists in it. In short, the Biomass will be able to ‘weigh’ the world’s forests.
Over the course of its five-year mission, it will produce 3D maps every six months, giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles.
The satellite is part of ESA’s
Earth Explorers
programme, which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions. And it’s not the only entity carrying out research of this sort.
California-based firm
Planet
has 149 micro-satellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the Earth, each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day. To put it another way, each satellite photographs about 2.5 million square kilometres of the Earth’s surface on a daily basis.
The aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question: what is changing on Earth? When it comes to forests, this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires, but the overall aim is to create a searchable, expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights.
Keeping the world green
All this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing, it is vital for the development of responsible, sustainable forestry practices.
From 2005 to 2015, the UN rolled out the
REDD programme
(Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), which, among other functions, allows countries to earn the right to offset CO
2
emissions – for example through forestry management practices. Sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries, it can also help them monitor, highlight and encourage responsible forestry.
Satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet. But more than just a clearer view on what is happening, it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening. And it’s with this information that real differences in our future can be made.

4 amazing uses of bioenergy
5 April 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Bioenergy is the world’s largest renewable energy source,
providing 10% of the world’s primary supply
. But more than just being a plentiful energy source, it can and should be a sustainable one. And because of this, it’s also a focus for innovation.
Biomass currently powers 4.8% of Great Britain’s electricity through its use at Drax Power Station and smaller power plants, but this isn’t the only way bioenergy is being used. Around the world people are looking into how it can be used in new and exciting ways.
Powering self-sufficient robots

What type of bioenergy?
Algae and microscopic animals
How’s it being used?
To power
two aquatic robots
with mouths, stomachs and an animal-type metabolism. Designed at the University of Bristol, the 30cm Row-Bot is modelled on the water boatman insect. The other, which is smaller, closer resembles a tadpole, and moves with the help of its tail.
Both are powered by
microbial fuel cells
– fuel cells that use the activity of bacteria to generate electricity – developed at the University of the West of England in Bristol. As they swim, the robots swallow water containing algae and microscopic animals, which is then used by their fuel cell ‘stomachs’ to generate electricity and recharge the robots’ batteries. Once recharged, they row or swim to a new location to look for another mouthful.
Is there a future?
It’s hoped that within five years the Row-Bot will be used to help
clean up oil spills and pollutants such as harmful algal bloom
. There are plans to reduce the tadpole bot to 0.1mm so that huge shoals of them can be dispatched to work together to tackle outbreaks of pollutants.
Purifying water
What’s used?
Human waste
How’s it being used?
The
Omni Processor
, a low cost waste treatment plant funded by the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
, does something incredible: it turns sewage into fresh water and electricity.
It does this by heating human waste to produce water vapour, which is then condensed to form water. This water is passed through a purification system, making it safe for human consumption. Best of all, it does this while powering itself.
The solid sludge left over by the evaporated sewage is siphoned off and burnt in a steam engine to produce enough electricity to process the next batch of waste.
Is there a future?
The first Omni Processor was manufactured by
Janicki Bioenergy
in 2013 and has been operating in Dakar, Senegal, since May 2015. A second processor, which doubles the capacity of the first, is currently operating in Sedro-Woolley, Washington, US and is expected to be shipped to West Africa during 2017.
Closer to home and Drax Power Station, a similar project is already underway.
Northumbrian Water
was the first in the UK to use its sludge to produce renewable power, but unlike the Omni Processor, it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power. Any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid, resulting in a total saving in the utility company’s carbon footprint of around 20% and also multi-millions of pounds of savings in operating costs.
Flying across the Atlantic
What’s used?
Tobacco
How’s it being used?
Most tobacco is grown with a few factors in mind – taste and nicotine content being the most important. But two of the 80 acres of tobacco grown at Briar View Farms in Callands, Virginia, US, are used to grow tobacco of a very different sort. This tobacco can
power aeroplanes
.
US biofuel company
Tyton BioEnergy Systems
is experimenting with varieties of tobacco dropped decades ago by traditional growers because of poor flavour or low nicotine content. The low-nicotine varieties need little maintenance, are inexpensive to grow and flourish where other crops would fail.
The company is turning this tobacco into sustainable biofuel and last year filed a patent for converting oil extracted from plant biomass into jet fuel.
Is there a future?
In the hope of creating a promising source of renewable fuel, scientists are pioneering selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to increase tobacco’s sugar and seed oil content.
In 2013, the
US Department of Energy gave a $4.8m grant to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
, in partnership with UC Berkeley and the University of Kentucky, to research the potential of tobacco as a biofuel.
Powering repopulation of a disaster zone
What’s used?
Wood exposed to radiation by the Fukushima nuclear meltdowns
How’s it being used?
Last year it was announced that German energy company Entrade Energiesysteme AG, will
set up biomass power generators in the Fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity
using the lightly irradiated wood of the area.
It’s hoped they will help Japan’s attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident. Entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 99.5%, which could help Japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy.
Is there a future?
The prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy
and solar power

The biomass carbon story
Matthew Rivers, Director of Corporate Affairs, Drax, Group Special Advisor
23 February 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

There is an important difference between carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emitted from coal (and other fossil fuels) and CO
2
emitted from renewable sources. Both do emit CO
2
when burnt, but in climate change terms the impact of that CO
2
is very different.
To understand this difference, it helps to think small and scale up. It helps to think of your own back garden.
One tree, every year for 30 years
Imagine you are lucky enough to have a garden with space for 30 trees. Three decades ago you decided to plant one tree per year, every year. In this example, each tree grows to maturity over thirty years so today you find yourself with a thriving copse with 30 trees at different stages of growth, ranging from one year to 30 years old.
At 30 years of age, the oldest has now reached maturity and you cut it down – in the spring, of course, before the sap rises – and leave the logs to dry over the summer. You plant a new seedling in its place. Through the summer and autumn the 29 established trees and the new seedling you planted continue to grow, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere to do so.
Winter comes and when it turns cold and dark you burn the seasoned wood to keep warm. Burning it will indeed emit carbon to the atmosphere. However, by end of the winter, the other 29 trees, plus the sapling you planted, will be at exactly the same stage of growth as the previous spring; contain the same amount of wood and hence the same amount of carbon.
As long as you fell and replant one tree every year on a 30-year cycle the atmosphere will see no extra CO
2
and you’ll have used the energy captured by their growth to warm your home. Harvesting only what is grown is the essence of sustainable forest management.
If you didn’t have your seasoned, self-supplied wood to burn you might have been forced to burn coal or use more gas to heat your home. Over the course of the same winter these fuels would have emitted carbon to the atmosphere which endlessly accumulates – causing climate change.
Not only does your tree husbandry provide you with an endlessly renewable supply of fuel but you also might enjoy other benefits such as the shelter your trees provide and the diversity of wildlife they attract.
No added carbon
This is a simplified example, but the principles hold true whether your forest contains 30 trees or 300 million – the important point is that with these renewable carbon emissions, provided you take out less wood than is growing and you at least replace the trees you take out, you do not add new carbon to the atmosphere. That is not true with fossil fuels.
It is true that you could have chosen not to have trees. You could instead build a wind turbine or install solar panels on your land. That would be a perfectly reasonable choice but you’ll still need to use the coal at night when the sun doesn’t shine or when the wind isn’t blowing. Worst of all you don’t get all the other benefits of a thriving forest – its seasonal beauty and the habitat that’s maintained for wildlife.
Of course, the wood Drax needs doesn’t grow in our ‘garden’. We bring it many miles from areas where there are
large sustainably managed forests
and
we carefully account for the carbon emissions in the harvesting, processing and transporting the fuel to Drax
. That’s why we ‘only’ achieve more than 80% carbon savings compared to coal.
