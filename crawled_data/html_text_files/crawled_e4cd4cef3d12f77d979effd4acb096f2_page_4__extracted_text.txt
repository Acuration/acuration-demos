to a low carbon future with the right conditions we can do even more converting further units to run on compressed wood pellets this is the fastest and most reliable way to support the uks decarbonisation targets whilst minimising the cost to households and businesses in a challenging commodity environment drax has delivered a good operational performance with 65 renewable power

financial reports  investors we can make a difference in 2016 and beyond dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 23 february 2016 investors today we released our financial results for 2015  ill be the first to admit that they are not good what makes it all the more painful is that one of the strongest operational performances the business has achieved in the last decade was more than wiped out by factors well outside of our control lets be frank for any business operating in the uk energy market 2015 was a tough year the deterioration in the commodity markets were some of the most severe i have seen in my career this was then accompanied by a series of unexpected regulatory announcements which caused many to question the uk governments commitment to decarbonisation like any ceo on results day i have spent this morning speaking to investors journalists and financial analysts instead of focusing too much on what hasnt gone our way in 2015 ive focused on where i think we can make a difference in 2016 and beyond and ive been pleased with their positive reaction the affordable way to end coal in november amber rudd announced the governments proposal to consult on setting a clear end date for coal of march 2025 given it still provides around 25 of the countrys electricity this is an ambitious target part of the solution is new nuclear and gas but as a recent report by the institute of mechanical engineers noted the country will find it very hard to build enough new facilities to replace coal capacity in time  instead of having to take all the existing coal power stations off the grid and build new facilities the country could use the world leading biomass technology that drax has pioneered to upgrade some of them to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal the economic consultancy nera found that more biomass conversions are one of the most sensible ways for the uk to get off coal at the fairest price to the taxpayer  with the right support we stand ready to convert our remaining coal units to become a fully renewable generator helping society and creating shareholder value i fundamentally believe that drax is making a valuable contribution in helping society deal with one of the most pressing issues of our time  cutting carbon emissions to limit climate change we have an approach which is both affordable and reliable so long as we remain operationally strong which i am very confident about then shareholder value will accrue throughout 2016 and beyond we will build on our expertise and continue to evaluate a range of longer term strategic options i lead a strong business that will use the opportunities available to us to create value for our shareholders and help bring about a reliable renewable future that we can all afford tags financial reports  investors three ways to judge a cfo will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 17 december 2015 opinion its a good question because you cant build a great company without a great chief financial officer cfo but as a shareholder how can you judge how well your cfo is doing without setting myself up for a fall the answer i gave our investor broke down into these three questions are they keeping control at its heart the first part of any cfos role is to make sure that their business is under control and that all risks are being properly managed they need to maintain a strong balance sheet and keep reporting and communications clear and transparent above all they need to make sure there are no surprises are they improving efficiency the second part is making sure the organisation is always working as efficiently as possible keeping a strong hand on costs and ensuring that current revenue streams are always optimised above all they need to be making sure that less money is going out and more money is coming into the organisation are they allocating capital wisely the final task of any cfo is investing shareholders money in the best projects  first internally and second externally above all they need to have a clear consideration of cash returns for shareholders so now the next time you wonder how well your cfo is doing you know how to judge them this article was originally published by will on linkedin  tags financial reports  investors  will gardiner  1 2 3 4 name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to
