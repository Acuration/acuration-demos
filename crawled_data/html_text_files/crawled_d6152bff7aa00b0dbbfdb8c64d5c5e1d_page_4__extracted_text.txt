decarbonisation of the wider humber region we believe we would be creating and supporting around 50000 new jobs and delivering a green economic recovery in the north we greatly value the contribution that our colleagues in gas generation have made to the group over the last two years as we focus on a renewable and flexible portfolio it is right that we divest these gas generation assets and in doing so create value for our shareholders between 2012 and 2019 through investment in sustainable biomass and hydro drax has reduced its carbon emissions by over 85 and become the largest source of renewable electricity in the uk 1  in december 2019 drax announced an ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 the negative emissions provided by beccs will offset carbon emissions within the groups supply chain and help to offset emissions in harder to abate sectors of the economy such as aviation and agriculture in february 2020 drax announced an end to commercial coal generation in 2021 and now by divesting its existing gas generation assets drax will further reduce its carbon emissions drax will continue to provide system support services alongside its decarbonisation strategy through its renewable generation portfolio other development opportunities and demandside response within its customers business these activities provide renewable electricity and a fully flexible

sustainable biomass drax aims to do this by expanding its supply chain to five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity by 2027 15 million today plus 05 million tonnes in development and reducing the cost of biomass to 50mwh 5  these savings will be delivered through the optimisation of existing biomass operations greater utilisation of lowcost wood residues and an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other lowcost renewable biomass across the groups expanded supply chain drax believes that the additional capital and operating cost investment required to deliver this supply chain expansion is in the region of 600 million which the group expects to invest ahead of 2027 drax remains alert to sector opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth the group has identified three models through which it believes it can deliver a longterm future for sustainable biomass all of which are underpinned by the delivery of its supply chain expansion and cost reduction plans these options which are not mutually exclusive are summarised below the delivery of one or more of these models by 2027 would enable drax to continue its biomass activities when the current uk renewable schemes for biomass generation end in march 2027 1 merchant biomass generation at drax power station drax believe that biomass has an important role to play in the uk as a flexible and reliable source of renewable energy supporting increased utilisation of intermittent and inflexible generation across the uk power grid in march 2027 when the current cfd6 and roc 7 renewable schemes end drax believes that through a combination of peak power generation system support services capacity market income and a lowcost operating model for drax power station including lowcost biomass this

expects global demand for wood pellets to increase in the current decade as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes which recognise the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation whilst there is an abundance of unprocessed sustainable biomass material globally there remains limited capacity to convert these materials into energy dense pellets which have a lowcarbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation as a result drax expects the global market for biomass to remain under supplied drax is therefore exploring options to service biomass demand in europe north america and asia alongside the uk establishing a presence in these markets could offer the potential for longterm offtake agreements providing diversified revenues from other biomass markets trading

to meet the treatys target of keeping global warming below 152 degrees celsius explore carbon capture by drax countries have set their own decarbonisation targets and many companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative  as we at drax intend to achieve by 2030  while these leading ambitions are important for the uk and the world to meet the goals of the paris agreement real action polices and investment are needed at scale we have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago we know from the recent 6 th carbon budget that renewable energy as well as carbon capture usage and storage ccus are essential for the uk to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in that detailed 1000page report  the climate change committee ccc was clear that progress must be made immediately  the country as a whole must be 78 of the way there by 2035 by investing where its needed the uk can lead the world in a whole new industry one that may come to define the next century  leading the world in decarbonisation it was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the uk to launch the industrial revolution some 250 years ago today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world as a country  one that i moved to over 20 years ago now  we have decarbonised at a greater pace than any other over the past decade investing in renewable generation such as wind solar and biomass has allowed the uk to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for net zero emissions  to remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future power grids will require vastly increased support from energy storage systems such as pumped hydro  as well as flexible reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation however the urgency of climate change means the uk must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing negative emissions technologies which remove more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit the ccc as well as national grids future energy scenarios report have emphasised the necessity of negative emissions for the uk to reach net zero  by removing co 2 not just from energy but other industries too the uk can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cuttingedge green technology that can take the country to net zero establishing it as a world leader for others to follow creating an industry exporting it to the world when the paris agreement was signed i was just joining drax i had been impressed by the power

new jobs in a new sector the humber region has a proud history in heavy industries  what began as a thriving ship building hub has evolved to include chemicals refining and steel manufacturing however these emissionsintensive industries have grown increasingly expensive to operate and many have left for countries where they can be run cheaper leading to a decline in the humber region if they are not decarbonised these industries will face an even greater cost by 2040 emitters could face billions of pounds per year in carbon taxes making them less competitive and less attractive for international investment deploying carbon capture and hydrogen are essential steps towards modernising these businesses and protecting up to 55000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the region capturing carbon at drax delivering jobs clean growth and levelling up the humber click to view executive summary and case studies from vivid economics report for drax a report by vivid economics commissioned by drax found that carbon capture and hydrogen in the humber could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades as well as protecting peoples livelihoods decarbonisation is also a matter of public health in the humber alone higher air quality could save 148 million in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 i believe the uk is well position to rise to the challenge and lead the world in decarbonisation technology there is a clear opportunity to export knowledge and skills to other countries embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys beccs alone could create many more jobs related to exporting the technology and operational knowhow and deliver additional value for the economy as interest in negative emissions grows around the world the uk needs to move quickly to secure a competitive advantage a fairer economy this is in many ways the start of a new sector in our economy  one that can offer new employment earnings and economic growth it comes at just the right time without intervention to spur a green recovery the covid19 crisis risks subjecting longterm economic damage being at the beginning of the industrial decarbonisation journey means we also have the power to shape this new industry in a way that spreads the benefits across the whole of the uk weve previously seen sector deals struck between the government and industry include equality measures for example the nuclear industry aims to count women as 40 of its employees by 2030 while offshore wind is committed to sourcing 60 of its supply chain from the uk  wind turbines at bridlington east yorkshire at present the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk contributing to a pronounced skills gap among the workforce in addition almost 60 of construction workers across the wider yorkshire and humber region were furloughed as of august 2020 a project such as zero carbon humber could address this regional imbalance and offer skilled long term jobs to local communities thats why i welcome the prime ministers announcement of 1bn investment to support the establishment of ccus in the humber and other superplaces around the uk as the governments ten point plan says ccus can help decarbonise our most challenging sectors provide low carbon power and a pathway to negative emissions healthier forests the cobenefits of beccs extend beyond our communities in the uk we aim to become carbon negative by 2030 by removing our co 2 emissions from the atmosphere and abating emissions that might still exist on the uks path to net zero this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use continues to be sourced from sustainable forests that positively benefit the environment and the communities in which we and our suppliers operate engineer working in turbine hall drax power station

gove mp chancellor of the duchy of lancaster dear chancellor secretaries of state building back better by supporting negative emissions technologies today our organisations have launched a new coalition with a shared vision to build back better as part of a sustainable and resilient recovery from covid19 by developing pioneering projects that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  and other pollutants from the atmosphere together we represent hundreds of thousands of workers across some of the uks most critical industries including aviation energy and farming each of which contribute billions of pounds each year to the economy a growing number of independent experts including the committee on climate change royal society and royal academy of engineering and the electricity system operator have recognised the crucial role of negative emissions or greenhouse gas removal technologies in fighting the climate crisis whilst we should seek to decarbonise sectors such as aviation heavy industry and agriculture as far as practically possible due to technical or commercial barriers it is unlikely we will eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions completely negative emissions technologies are critical therefore to balancing out these residual emissions and ensuring we achieve net zero in a credible cost effective and sustainable way as well as benefiting the environment negative emissions technologies and projects can build back a cleaner greener economy in the wake of covid19 the foundations for this are already being laid by our coalitions members today for example the national farmers union has set out a net zero vision for the agricultural sector whereby uk farmers harness the ability to capture carbon to create new income streams the aviation industry through the sustainable aviation initiative has identified negative emissions projects alongside other measures as sustainable jet fuel as being crucial to greening the industry in north yorkshire drax is developing plans to combine sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology beccs to create the worlds first carbon negative power station  supporting thousands of jobs in the process in north east lincolnshire velocys with the support of british airways is developing the altalto wastetojet fuel project that could produce negativeemission jet fuel once the humber industrial clusters carbon capture and storage infrastructure is established finally carbon engineering has announced a partnership with pale blue dot energy to deploy commercialscale direct air capture projects in the uk that would remove significant volumes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with cop26 fast approaching there is a real and compelling opportunity for the uk government to demonstrate to the world it is taking a leadership position on negative emissions conversely if the uk does not act quickly it could jeopardise the delivery of projects in the 2020s that can support innovation learning by doing and the scaleup of negative emissions in the 2030s it also risks britain falling behind in the race to scale and commercialise these technologies with a view to exporting them to other countries around the world to support their own decarbonisation efforts we therefore call on this government supported by your departments to pursue the following low regrets interventions to support this critical emerging industry adopt a clear unambiguous commitment to supporting negative emissions in the 2020s and beyond the last significant reference to negative emissions by government was in the 2017 clean growth strategy between now and the end of the year there is a window of opportunity for the government to go further reflecting the changed reality of a net zero world and the growing consensus on the need for negative emissions a clear signal of intent would also give greater confidence to investors and developers in negative emissions projects in the absence of a longterm strategy develop targeted policies to support viable negative emissions projects in the 2020s  in order to scale up in the 2030s at a pace compatible with the uks climate commitments it is essential that government works with industry to bring forward early projects in the 2020s that are viable and represent value for money however there is no marketplace or regulatory regime in the uk today that incentivises or rewards negative emissions making financing projects extremely challenging dedicated policy frameworks and business models for solutions such as afforestation beccs and direct air capture are therefore urgently needed seize the opportunity to make negative emissions a point of emphasis at cop26  the uk has already led the way at a global level by adopting net zero as a legally binding target at cop26 the uk can showcase its further commitment to continuous innovation around the decarbonisation agenda by signposting the early actions it has taken to deploy negative emissions  which other countries will also need to meet their own zero carbon ambitions this statement would be particularly powerful as it can be credibly supported by several pioneering projects already being undertaken by british businesses and research organisations in this space we would welcome the opportunity to meet with each of you to discuss these points in further detail yours the coalition for
