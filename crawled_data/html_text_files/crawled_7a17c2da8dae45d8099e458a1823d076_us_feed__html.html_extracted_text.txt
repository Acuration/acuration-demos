<p>Mississippi and Arkansas were devastated by a recent rash of tornadoes that ripped across the Southeastern U.S. in March.</p>
<p>As part of the Communities in Crisis Fund, Drax donated $25,000 to the <a href="https://www.unitedwaysela.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Way of Southeast Louisiana</a> and $25,000 to the <a href="https://heartaruw.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heart of Arkansas United Way</a> to support tornado damage relief efforts. Funds will be used for immediate relief efforts and long-term rebuilding and recovery in affected communities near Rolling Fork, Mississippi and Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The establishment of our Communities in Crisis Fund is an example of how we are strengthening our approach to supporting our communities, which includes an enhanced approach to philanthropic giving,” said <strong>Shona King, Group Head of Community for Drax</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Crisis Fund provides donations to reputable relief organizations working on the ground or organizations that have been established to run emergency appeals in the immediate aftermath of disasters such as hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes and wildfires.</p>
<blockquote><p>“United Way of Southeast Louisiana and our partners at WDSU-TV are grateful to Drax for supporting efforts to help our neighbors in Mississippi,” said <strong>Michael Williamson, President and CEO of United Way of Southeast Louisiana</strong>. “We know all too well the devastating effects of tornadoes on communities, and thanks to Drax’s generous donation, we can grant critical funds to our fellow United Ways to help their families rebuild and recover.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Drax is committed to being a good neighbor, helping those in immediate need and playing a positive role in their communities.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Drax’s generous gift will allow Heart of Arkansas United Way to provide victims of the March 31 tornadoes the support they need through recovery and rebuilding work that will be ahead for many months to come,” said <strong>Lynn Holzman Pharr, President of the Heart of Arkansas United Way President</strong>. “Disaster recovery is a long-term process – a marathon, not a sprint. Our community is thankful for the immediate response efforts of many who are helping to evaluate the scope and scale of the impact, so that we may begin planning for the support individuals and families will need in the long term.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Drax’s philanthropic efforts focus on the well-being of the states especially as the company grows and wants to give back to local communities.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our employees live in Arkansas and Mississippi and know, or are related to, people impacted by the tornado damage,” said King. “They are part of our extended Drax family.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Achieving Drax’s ambitious decarbonisation goals means continuing to find innovative ways to reduce emissions across our operations</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us/sustainable-bioenergy/working-towards-carbon-negative-reducing-supply-chain-emissions/">Working towards carbon negative: Reducing supply chain emissions</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us">Drax US</a>.</p>
<h3>Key takeaways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drax’s ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 means we’re always working to reduce our supply chain emissions further.</li>
<li>We’re partnering with different organisations to explore innovative solutions to lowering shipping emissions.</li>
<li>Through our experience of carbon capture and storage, we can deploy the technology to decarbonise operations at our pellet mills.</li>
<li>Using rail wagons specifically designed to transport biomass wood pellets helps us reduce transport on land emissions.</li>
<li>By developing a new BECCS power station in the U.S., we can help decarbonise electricity systems while removing emissions from the atmosphere and tackling climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Drax, we have ambitious plans to not only help countries around the world replace fossil fuels with renewable biomass, but to become a <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainability/carbon-emissions/towards-carbon-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon negative</a> company by 2030.</p>
<p>For the world to achieve its net zero targets and meet the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global temperature rises below 1.5°C, it’s essential to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than is produced.</p>
<p>Drax is leading in this effort through pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology. BECCS is the process of generating renewable power using sustainably sourced biomass <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">while capturing and permanently storing CO2.</a></p>
<p>Developing BECCS at scale and achieving our own carbon negative objective means working to decarbonise the technology’s entire supply chain. It’s a responsibility we’ve been committed to for decades, even before the <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainable-bioenergy/switch-power-station-off-coal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drax Power Station was converted to run on sustainable biomass</a>, and we continue to look for new innovations.</p>
<div class="vimeo responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe title="Drax ambition: carbon negative by 2030 [Dec 2019; 16:9]" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/378375694?h=4a4c2beb3a&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Here are three of the ways we’re working to optimise our supply chains to make them as energy efficient and low-carbon as possible:</p>
<h2>1. Shipping emissions: Harnessing the wind</h2>
<p>Around <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/mol-dryblulk-and-drax-launch-green-shipping-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90% of the world’s goods are transported by sea</a>, including the wood pellets produced at our pellet mills and used to generate renewable power at Drax Power Station in the U.K. And while shipping has a lower carbon footprint than road or air transport, the sector still accounts for <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/smart-green-shipping-alliance-partners-drax-ultrabulk-cut-shipping-supply-chain-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 3%, or 1 billion tonnes</a> of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Initiatives to reduce the emissions associated with shipping are an important part of our efforts to decarbonise our supply chain and become carbon negative.</p>

<p>In 2022, we signed a <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/mol-dryblulk-and-drax-launch-green-shipping-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memorandum of understanding with Japanese shipping company MOL Drybulk</a>. Together, we’re exploring installing MOL’s proven Wind Challenger hard sail technology on vessels transporting wood pellets on routes such as British Columbia to biomass customers in Japan. Wind Challenger, which reduces fuel consumption and emissions by harnessing wind power through modern sails, could be ready to be fitted onto newly built vessels for Drax from 2025.</p>
<p>The Environmentally Friendly Bulk Carrier “EFBC” project’s use of new and more efficient wind-power could contribute to reducing emissions associated with shipping biomass by around 20%. At a later stage, the project could also incorporate the use of other low-carbon technologies, as well as lower-emission fuels such as liquefied natural gas, ammonia, and synthetic fuels.</p>
<p>We previously partnered with the Smart Green Shipping Alliance, dry bulk cargo transporter Ultrabulk, and Humphreys Yacht Design for <a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/smart-green-shipping-alliance-partners-drax-ultrabulk-cut-shipping-supply-chain-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a feasibility study that looked at reducing shipping emissions</a>. The study examined the potential to retrofit an innovative sail solution known as FastRig onto Ultrabulk ships importing biomass into the UK. FastRigs, made from 100% recycled and recyclable material, are designed to considerably reduce GHG emissions and the use of fuel. The feasibility study found that the FastRig solution could help lower fuel use and GHG emissions on one of our export routes – from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Liverpool in the UK – <a href="https://www.maritimeuk.org/priorities/environment/netzeromaritime-showcase/Smart-Green-Shipping-Fastrigs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by at least 20%</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Reducing emissions through carbon capture and storage</h2>
<p>Biomass pellet plants are a key part of Drax’s supply chain. By producing renewable, sustainable biomass feedstock we can help countries around the world to replace fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Our pellet mills in Canada and the U.S. South use a mix of fibre sources – all of which are unsuitable for lumber or other solid wood products. Globally, in the first half of 2022, almost 70% of the fibre for our biomass came from sawmill residues, like sawdust and wood chips.</p>
<p>Fibre for biomass also comes from low-grade wood that’s rejected by the lumber industry, slash left over from lumber industry harvests, and trees removed in forest management processes, like thinning and wildfire mitigation.</p>
<p>The pelletisation process uses power from local grids – wedding us to regional power sources. In areas like the U.S. where <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20about%204%2C116%20billion,facilities%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;text=About%2061%25%20of%20this%20electricity,%2C%20petroleum%2C%20and%20other%20gases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61% of electricity</a> is still generated from fossil fuels, this adds to <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainability/carbon-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Scope 2 emissions</a>.</p>
<p>However, our pioneering development of carbon capture technology offers the potential to decarbonise emissions connected to pelletisation. It’s one of the ways that the experience and technology we put into action at a new U.S. BECCS plant can decarbonise other facilities, whole industrial clusters, and our own supply chains.</p>
<h2>3. Rail: The low-carbon road option</h2>
<p>For in-country transportation, Drax utilises rail freight as much as possible, as rail offers the capacity we need as well as having a lower carbon footprint than road transport. In the UK, we <a href="https://www.drax.com/us/press_release/new-drax-trains-powering-northern-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own 225 rail wagons</a>, specifically designed to transport biomass wood pellets and will be taking delivery of 30 more in 2023. The bespoke wagons carry a greater volume of compressed wood pellets than traditional wagons are capable of, delivering around 20,000 tonnes of renewable biomass to Drax Power Station every day.</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-12500" class="wp-caption-text">Train carrying sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets arriving at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire [click to view/download]</p>
</div>
<p>Optimising the volume of biomass on each train allow us to run fewer trains to the power station, keeping emissions minimal. Using rail rather than road transport is estimated to save around 270,000 truck journeys and more than <a href="https://www.drax.com/us/press_release/new-drax-trains-powering-northern-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32,000 tonnes of CO2</a> a year.</p>
<p>In 2020 a new rail link was opened to connect our LaSalle BioEnergy biomass pellet plant in Louisiana to the regional rail network, enabling the delivery of around <a href="https://www.drax.com/us/press_release/15m-rail-link-helps-drax-reduce-supply-chain-emissions-and-biomass-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7,000 tonnes of biomass</a> per week to the Port of Greater Baton Rouge. The rail link replaced the 27 tonnes that was previously transported by each individual truck.</p>
<p>Helping countries around the world achieve net zero and working towards becoming a carbon negative company is only possible if we continue our practice of examining our supply chain and developing new innovative ways to reduce emissions even further.</p>

<p>How different management strategies are expanding the world’s working forests</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us/sustainable-bioenergy/the-key-to-sustainable-forests-thinking-globally-and-managing-locally/">The key to sustainable forests? Thinking globally and managing locally</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us">Drax US</a>.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working forests, where wood products are harvested, are explicitly managed to balance environmental and economic benefits, </strong><strong>while encouraging healthy, growing forests that store carbon, provide habitats for wildlife, and space for recreation. </strong></li>
<li><strong>But there is no single </strong><strong>management technique. The most effective methods vary depending on local conditions. </strong></li>
<li><strong>By employing locally appropriate methods, working forests have grown while supporting essential forestry industries and local economies. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Forests in the U.S. South, British Columbia, and Estonia all demonstrate how local management can deliver both environmental and economic wins.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Forests are biological, environmental, and economic powerhouses. Collectively they are home to most of the planet’s terrestrial biodiversity. They are responsible for absorbing <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/3-reasons-companies-are-investing-in-forest-conservation-and-restoration-and-how-they-do-it#:~:text=environmental%20degradation%20worldwide.-,The%20sustainable%20management%20of%20forests%20could%20create%20%24230%20billion%20in,%2C%20and%20values%2Dbased%20leadership." target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.6 billion tonnes</a> of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) equivalent per year, or roughly 1.5 times the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by the United States on an annual basis. And working forests, which are actively managed to generate revenue from wood products industries, are important drivers for the global economy, employing over <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/forests/brief/forests-generate-jobs-and-incomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 million people</a> worldwide and generating <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/forests/brief/forests-generate-jobs-and-incomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600 billion annually</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But as important as forests are globally, the key to maximizing working forests’ potential lies in smart, active forest management. While 420 million hectares of forest have been <a href="https://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/">lost since 1990</a> through conversion to other land uses such as for agriculture, many working forests are actually growing both larger and healthier due to science-based management practices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The best practices in working forests balance economic, social, and environmental benefits. But just as importantly, they are tailored to local conditions and framed by appropriate regional regulations, guidance, and best-practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The following describes how three different regions, from which Drax sources its biomass, manage their forests for a sustainable future.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>British Columbia: Managing locally for global climate change</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">British Columbia is blanketed by almost 60 million hectares of forest – an area larger than France and Germany combined. Over 90% of the forest land is owned by Canada’s government, meaning the province’s forests are managed for the benefit of the Canadian people and in collaboration with First Nations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">From the province’s expanse of forested land, less than half a percent (0.36%) is harvested each year, <a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/state-canadas-forests-report/timber-being-harvested-sustainably/16494">according to government figures</a>. This ensures stable, sustainable forests. However, there’s a need to manage against natural factors.</p>

</div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, 2018, and 2020 catastrophic fires ripped through some of British Columbia’s most iconic forest areas, underscoring the threat climate change poses to the area’s natural resources. One response was to increase the removal of stands of trees in the forest, harvesting the large number of dead or dying trees created by pests that have grown more common in a warming climate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By removing dead trees, diseased trees, and even some healthy trees, forest managers can reduce the amount of potential fuel in the forest, making devastating wildfires less likely. There are also commercial advantages to this strategy. Most of the trees removed are low quality and not suitable for processing into lumber. These trees can, however, still be used commercially to produce biomass wood pellets that offer a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. This means local communities don’t just get safer forests, they get safer forests that support the local economy.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The United States</strong><strong>: Thinning for healthier forests </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. South’s forests have expanded rapidly in recent decades, largely due to growth in working forests on private land. Annual forest growth in the region more than doubled from <a href="https://forestscope.info/">193 million cubic metres of wood in 1953 to 408 million cubic meters by 2015</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This expansion has occurred thanks to active forest product markets which incentivise forest management investment. In the southern U.S. thinning is critical to managing healthy and productive pine forests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thinning is an intermediate harvest aimed at reducing tree density to allocate more resources, like nutrients, sunlight, and water, to trees which will eventually become valuable sawtimber. Thinning not only increases future sawtimber yields, but also improves the forest’s resilience to pest, disease, and wildfire, as well as enhancing understory diversity and wildlife habitat.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">While trees removed during thinning are generally undersized or unsuitable for lumber, they’re ideal for producing biomass wood pellets. In this way, the biomass market creates an incentive for managers to engage in practices that increase the health and vigour of forests on their land.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The results speak for themselves: across U.S. forestland the volume of annual <a href="https://www.forestlandowners.com/forest-facts/">net timber growth 36% higher</a> than the volume of annual timber removals.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Estonia: Seeding the future</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Though Estonia is not a large country, approximately half of it is covered in trees, meaning forestry is integral to the country’s way of life. Historically, harvesting trees has been an important part of the national economy, and the government has established strict laws to ensure sustainable management practices.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These regulations have helped Estonia increase its overall forest cover from about 34% 80 years ago to <a href="https://envir.ee/en/water-forest-resources/forestry">over 50% today</a>. And, as in the U.S. South, the volume of wood harvested from Estonia’s forests each year is less than the volume added by tree growth.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Estonia has managed to increase its growing forest stock by letting the average age of its forests increase. This is partially due to Estonia having young, fast-growing forests in areas where tree growth is relatively new. But it is also due to regulations that require harvesters to leave seed trees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Seed trees are healthy, mature trees, the seeds from which become the forest’s next generation. By enforcing laws that ensure seed trees are not harvested, Estonia is encouraging natural regeneration of forests. As in the U.S. South protecting these seed trees from competition for water and nutrients means removing smaller trees in the area. While these smaller trees may not all be suitable for lumber, they are a suitable feedstock for biomass. It means managing for natural regeneration can still have economic, as well as environmental, advantages.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Different methods, similar results</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Laws, landownership, and forestry practices differ greatly between the U.S. South, British Columbia, and Estonia, but all three are excellent examples of how local forest management contributes to healthy rural economies and sustained forest coverage.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many different strategies for creating a balance between economic and environmental interests, all successful strategies have something in common: They encourage healthy, growing forests.</p>

<p><em><strong>Angela Hepworth, Commercial Director, Drax </strong></em></p>
<h3><strong>In brief:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACS) at scale. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market is developing a set of Core Carbon Principles (CCPs). </strong></li>
<li><strong>Drax support proposed principals if they’re applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Standards around additionality and the permanence of carbon removals may apply very differently to nature-based and engineered removals, something that needs to be addressed explicitly. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There’s growing recognition, in governments and environmental organisations, of the urgent need to develop high-integrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective Paris-aligned climate goals.</p>
<p>Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (<a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BECCS</a>), and direct air carbon capture and storage (<a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-direct-air-carbon-capture-and-storage-dacs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DACS</a>) are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely. The technology is proven, developers are bringing forward projects, and the most forward-thinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from BECCS and DACS developers.</p>
<p>Yet there’s a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals.</p>
<p>Drax is a world-leader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions. Our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of high-integrity, permanent CO<sub>2</sub> removals by 2030 from its BECCS projects in the U.K. and the U.S. We support the development of rigorous standards for CO<sub>2</sub> removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the CO<sub>2</sub> removals they’re buying. Such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to.</p>
<p>However, the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits, rather than removals. To create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale, re-thinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency.</p>
<div class="vimeo responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Carbon Removals by Drax [60s/16x9]" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/752019011?h=c9568c8e57&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Core Carbon Principles</strong></h2>
<p>The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market is in the process of developing a set of <a href="https://icvcm.org/the-core-carbon-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) and Assessment Framework (AF)</a> intended to set new threshold standards for high-quality carbon credits.</p>
<p>At Drax, we welcome and support the principals proposed by the Integrity Council. However, it’s crucial they’re applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals, and support rather than prevent their development.</p>
<p>Many CCPs are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies. Among the most important principals include those stating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removals must be robustly quantified, with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made.</li>
<li>Key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity, while safeguarding commercially sensitive information.</li>
<li>Removal credits should be subject to robust, independent third-party validation and verification.</li>
<li>Credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits.</li>
<li>Registries must be subject to appropriate governance, to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome.</li>
<li>Removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability, taking account of impacts on nature, the climate and society.</li>
<li>There should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates, or between countries. Bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel, and that the Article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldn’t trigger corresponding adjustments to countries’ carbon inventories.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>However, as pioneers in the field, we believe that two of the Core Carbon Principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Supporting additionality and development incentives </strong></h2>
<p>The CCPs state: “The greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional, i.e., they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues.”</p>
<p>Engineered carbon removal credits such as BECCS and DACS are by their nature additional. They are developed for the specific purpose of removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere. They also rely on revenue from carbon markets – largely the voluntary market at present, but potentially compliance markets such as the U.K. and E.U. ETS in the future.</p>
<p>However, most early projects are likely to have some form of Government support (e.g., 45Q in the U.S., or Contracts for Difference in the U.K.) from outside carbon credit revenues. But that support isn’t intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment – project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets.</p>
<p>Engineered carbon removals have high up-front capital costs, and it’s clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable.</p>
<p>Additionality assessments should be risk-based. If it’s clear that a technology-type is additional, a technology-level assessment should be sufficient. This should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects.</p>

<h2><strong>Compensating against non-permanent storage </strong></h2>
<p>On the topic of permanence that CCPs state: “The GHG emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent, or if they have a risk of reversal, any reversals shall be fully compensated.”  A key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal. <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/how-do-you-store-co2-and-what-happens-to-it-when-you-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small</a>.</p>
<p>The risk of reversal for nature-based credits, by contrast, is much greater. Schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for nature-based credits, are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals.</p>
<p>Requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool, potentially as much as 10%, are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a well-manged geological store. They also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place.</p>
<p>Any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators. Similarly, where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with CO<sub>2</sub> storage risk, which place liabilities on storage owners, operators, or governments, the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them, and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers.</p>
<p>At Drax, we believe the CCPs provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals. If applied pragmatically, they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product they’re buying and provide a clear framework for project developers. They can ensure that standards support, rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as BECCS and DACS, which are essential to achieving our global climate goals.</p>

<div class="vimeo responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe loading="lazy" title="DRAX NBBECCS subtitled" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/766929207?h=8950525d44&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After a summer of soaring temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere, the global nature of climate change is more obvious than ever. Forest fires around the world in 2021 resulted in <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires">double the loss of tree cover</a> than in 2001, while today more than <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1118142">2.3 billion people</a> face water stress from drought. It’s clear that the action we take to help tackle the global climate emergency must be international too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) removals will be crucial in addressing this global challenge. Experts and governments agree that in addition to economy-wide decarbonization, removing carbon from the atmosphere is critical to meeting the goal of net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by mid-century. The IPCC says 10 billion tons per year of removals will be needed in 2050 for the world to get to net zero. That’s a huge step up from the <a href="https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage">40 million tons captured globally</a> in 2021, but also a significant investment opportunity.</p>
<div class="vimeo responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Carbon Removals by Drax [60s/16x9]" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/752019011?h=c9568c8e57&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our ambition is to remove 4 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> through <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/">bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)</a> outside the UK per year, while generating renewable, baseload electricity and supporting healthy, sustainable forests.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The likely contender for our first location? The United States. We already operate in communities across the U.S. South, employing more than 1,200 people in our <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainability/sustainable-bioenergy/">sustainable biomass pellet production</a>. Now we are preparing to build a new BECCS power station in the region.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s clear to us that the U.S. is an ideal market for BECCS with its long-running sustainable forest industry and range of suitable sites for permanent CO<sub>2</sub> storage. We see the country’s efforts to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/u-s-won-t-have-coal-by-2030-john-kerry-predicts-in-glasgow">retire coal by 2030</a> and commitment to innovation as an opportunity to build one of the largest carbon removal projects in the U.S. Our first plant could be capable of permanently removing 2 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year, while also generating 2-terawatt hours of 24/7 renewable power.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S.’s newly legislated commitment to tackling climate change through the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as the Department of Energy’s <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81644.pdf">National Renewable Energy Lab recent scenario planning for ‘100% clean electricity system’</a> are establishing it as the leading market to deploy new environmental technologies. And a new frontier for permanent, high-quality emissions removals.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The need for high quality, permanent emissions removals</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A net zero future is only possible through the wide-spread implementation of high-integrity, carbon removals. BECCS offers this by combining low carbon, renewable biomass power generation with carbon capture technology and secure, permanent carbon sequestration.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">BECCS works by generating renewable electricity using biomass sourced from sustainably managed forests that absorb CO<sub>2</sub> as they grow. CO<sub>2 </sub>released in the generation process is captured and stored, permanently and safely, in geological rock formations. The overall process removes more CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere than it emits, resulting in negative emissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This allows us to offer decarbonizing industries high-quality carbon removals credits. Given the scale of CO<sub>2</sub>that must be removed from the atmosphere and the importance for countries and companies around the world to reach net zero, I believe this market for verified CO<sub>2</sub> removal credits is a trillion-dollar opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Voluntary carbon markets have historically suffered from a lack of sustained and reliable investment due to fluctuating market prices and varying quality of the carbon credits they contain. However, increased oversight from investors, NGOs and independent bodies is encouraging credibility and integrity, prompting sustained adoption by businesses.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve demonstrated the growing appetite for carbon removals by signing the worlds largest carbon removals deal to date at New York Climate week. The agreement with<a href="https://www.drax.com/press_release/worlds-biggest-carbon-removals-deal-announced-at-new-york-climate-week/"> Respira, an impact-driven carbon finance business</a>, will allow it to purchase 400,000 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> removals (CDRs) a year from our North American operations. This would enable other corporations and financial institutions to achieve their own CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction targets, by purchasing CDRs from Respira.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Deals like these make voluntary carbon markets a more effective means of reducing net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by securing commitments and driving investment in projects that deliver independently verified, high-quality emissions reductions. As the global economy works towards its net zero targets, CO<sub>2</sub> removals will be crucial in reducing the still dangerously high levels of carbon in our atmosphere today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">BECCS stands to be a powerful tool in a net zero future as the only technology capable of delivering both high quality, permanent carbon removals, while also delivering baseload renewable power. The ability to generate power with negative emissions will be crucial for increasingly electrified economies, as they move away from fossil fuels.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The potential for the U.S. </strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Driven by a dynamic mix of markets, investors and engaged consumers, some of the most prominent U.S. companies are pledging to reach net zero, investing in 24/7 renewable power and other means to do so.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Technology companies like Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft have laid out ambitious plans to decarbonize operations, supply chains, and even remove historic emissions. Other organizations, like the First Movers Coalition, include U.S. companies from a range of sectors committing corporate purchasing power to solving <a href="https://www.weforum.org/first-movers-coalition">difficult decarbonization challenges</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This industry readiness is increasingly backed up by legislative policy action. The recent Inflation Reduction Act substantially increases the availability of the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and storage projects, increasing their value from $50 a ton of carbon removals to $85 per ton, helping to further support the business case needed to deploy technologies like BECCS.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We believe the U.S. is on the right track to create a market in which BECCS can thrive. The Department of Energy’s <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81644.pdf">National Renewable Energy Lab recent ‘100% clean electricity system’</a> report includes BECCS in three of the four possible scenarios explored. It forecasts the US will need between 7-14GW of installed BECCS capacity by 2035 to achieve an electricity system with net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. That equates to removals of approximately 55-120 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> per year by 2035.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S.’s established forestry commercial industry, with its credible commitment to sustainable management offers ample low-grade wood and wood industry residues to power BECCS. The country’s long-running exploration of CO<sub>2</sub> capture and transport, and history of industrial innovations means there are the skills, supply chains, and regulatory environment to undertake ambitious new infrastructure projects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">BECCS is a proven technology and one that can scale up sooner than any other technology. But action is needed now to make these markets that can deliver large scale carbon removals projects a reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Action is needed now </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For responsible businesses with the desire to go further, faster, or for sectors still developing viable decarbonization routes, carbon removals from BECCS deliver real, verifiable, and permanent progress towards net zero and beyond, to net negative.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s encouraging to see the U.S. pass legislation that can facilitate investment into carbon removal technologies and develop the carbon credit market.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, carbon markets must have standards that are credible both in the business community, and in the environmental and civil society. Collaboration between governments, corporations, and NGOs will be critical to ensure we create systems that can tackle the climate emergency.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t afford to contemplate theoretical net zero futures. Buying and selling high-quality permanent removals is the action we need today. Now is the time to capture the opportunity and be part of the solution together.</p>

<p>How carbon accounting can help companies and countries reach net zero</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us/sustainable-business/an-introduction-to-carbon-accounting/">An introduction to carbon accounting</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us">Drax US</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tracking, reporting, and calculating carbon emissions are a key part of progressing countries, industries, and companies towards net zero goals. </strong></li>
<li><strong>As a newly established discipline, carbon accounting still lacks standardisation and frameworks in how emissions are tracked, reduced, and mitigated. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, which lays out three ‘Scopes’ businesses should report and act upon.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Carbon accounting evolves from reporting in the use of goals and timeframes in which targets are met.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Timeframes are crucial in the deployment of technologies like carbon capture, removals, and achieving net zero.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How can countries and companies find a route to net zero emissions? Many organisations, countries and industries have pledged to balance their emissions before mid-century. They intend to do this through a combination of cutting emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Tracking and quantifying emissions, understanding output, reducing them, and setting tangible targets that can be worked towards are all central to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions – especially when it comes to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Emissions and energy consumption <em>reporting </em>is already common practice and compulsory for businesses over a certain size in the UK. However, carbon accounting takes this a step further.</p>
<p>“Carbon reporting is a statement of physical greenhouse gas emissions that occur over a given period,” explains Michael Goldsworthy, Head of Climate Change and Carbon Strategy at Drax. “Carbon accounting relates to how those emissions are then processed and counted towards specific targets. The methodologies for calculating emissions and determining contributions against targets may then have differing rules depending on which framework or standard is being reported against.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Carbon accounting tools can help companies and counties understand their carbon footprint – how much carbon is being emitted as part of their operations, who is responsible for them, and how they can be effectively mitigated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like how financial accounting may seek to balance a company’s books and calculate potential profit, carbon accounting seeks to do the same with emissions, tracking what an entity emits, and what it reduces, removes, or mitigates. Carbon accounting is, therefore, crucial in understanding how countries and companies can contribute to reaching net zero.</p>

<h2><strong>A new space</strong></h2>
<p>How different organisations, countries and industries approach carbon accounting is still an evolving process.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s as complex as financial accounting, but with financial accounting, there’s a long standing industry that relies on well-established practices and principles. Carbon accounting by contrast is such a new space,” explains Goldsworthy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regardless of its infancy, businesses and countries are already implementing standardised approaches to carbon accounting. Regulations such as emissions trading schemes and reporting systems, such as Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) and the Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), are beginning to deliver some degree of consistency in businesses’ carbon reporting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15939" src="https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/iStock-1181546520-1536x1024-1.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1024" srcset="https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/iStock-1181546520-1536x1024-1.jpg 1536w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/iStock-1181546520-1536x1024-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/iStock-1181546520-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/iStock-1181546520-1536x1024-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/iStock-1181546520-1536x1024-1-480x320.jpg 480w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/iStock-1181546520-1536x1024-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/iStock-1181546520-1536x1024-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></p>
<p>Other standards such as the GHG Protocol have sought to provide a standardised basis for corporate reporting and accounting. Elsewhere, voluntary carbon markets (e.g. carbon offsets) have also evolved to allow transferral of carbon reductions or removals between businesses, providing flexibility to companies in delivering their climate commitments.</p>
<p>The challenge is in aligning these frameworks so that they work together. For example, emissions within a corporate inventory or offset programme must be accounted for in a way that is consistent with a national inventory.</p>
<p>To date, these accounting systems have evolved independently with different rules and methodologies. Beginning to implement detailed carbon accounting, upon which emissions reductions and removals can be based, requires standardised understanding of what they are and where they come from.</p>
<h2><strong>Reporting and tackling Scope One, Two, and Three emissions</strong></h2>
<p>The main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol</a>. This voluntary carbon reporting standard can be used by countries and cities, as well as individual companies globally.</p>
<p>The GHG protocol categorises emissions in three different ‘scopes’, called Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. Understanding, measuring, and reporting these is a key factor in carbon accounting and can drive meaningful emissions reduction and mitigation.</p>
<h3><strong>Scope One – Direct emissions </strong></h3>
<p>Scope One emissions are those that come as a direct result of a company or country’s activities. These can include fuel combustion at a factory’s facilities, for example, or emissions from a fleet of vehicles.</p>
<p>Scope One emissions are the most straightforward for an organisation to measure and report, and easier for organisations to directly act on.</p>

<h3><strong>Scope Two – Indirect energy emissions </strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-15941" src="https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/AdobeStock_137722846-scaled-e1652364570357-405x600-1.jpeg" alt="" width="405" height="600" srcset="https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/AdobeStock_137722846-scaled-e1652364570357-405x600-1.jpeg 405w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/AdobeStock_137722846-scaled-e1652364570357-405x600-1-203x300.jpeg 203w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/AdobeStock_137722846-scaled-e1652364570357-405x600-1-324x480.jpeg 324w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/10/AdobeStock_137722846-scaled-e1652364570357-405x600-1-101x150.jpeg 101w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" />Scope Two emissions are those which come from the generation of energy an organisation uses. These can include emissions form electricity, steam, heating, and cooling.</p>
<p>A business may buy electricity, for example, from an electricity supplier, which acquires power from a generator. If that generator is a fossil-fuelled power station the energy consumer’s Scope Two emissions will be greater than if it buys power from a renewable electricity supplier or generates its own renewable power.</p>
<p>The ability to change energy suppliers makes Scope Two relatively straightforward for organisations to act on, assuming renewable energy sources are available in the area.</p>
<h3><strong>Scope Three – All other indirect emissions</strong></h3>
<p>Scope Three is much broader. It covers upstream and downstream lifecycle emissions of products used or produced by a company, as well as other indirect emissions such as employee commuting and business travel emissions.</p>
<p>Identifying and reducing these emissions across supply and value chains can be difficult for businesses with complex supply lines and global distribution networks. They are also hard for companies to directly influence.</p>
<p>Add in factors like emissions mitigations or offsetting, and the carbon accounting can quickly become much more complex than simply reporting and reducing emissions that occur directly from a company’s activities. Nevertheless, these full-system overviews and whole-product lifecycle accounting are crucial to understanding the true impact of operations and organisations, and to reach climate goals.</p>
<h2><strong>Working to timelines </strong></h2>
<p>Setting goals with defined timelines and the development of rules that ensure consistent accounting is also crucial to implementing effective climate change mitigation frameworks throughout the global economy. Consider the UK’s aim to be net zero by 2050, or Drax’s ambition to be net negative by 2030, as goals with set timelines.</p>
<p>For many technologies, the time scales over which targets are set have added relevance. There are often upfront emissions to account for and operational emissions that may change over time. Take for example an electric vehicle: the climate benefit will be determined by emissions from construction and the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power it.</p>

<p>Looking at a brief snapshot at the beginning of its life, say the first couple of years, might not show any climate benefit compared to a vehicle using an internal combustion engine. Over the lifetime of the vehicle, however, meaningful emissions savings may become clear – especially if the electricity powering the vehicle continues to decarbonise over time.</p>
<p>This provides a challenge when setting carbon emissions targets. Targets set too far in the future potentially risk inaction in the short term, while targets set over short periods risk disincentivising technologies that have substantial long-term mitigation potential.<em> </em></p>
<h2><strong>Delivering net zero</strong></h2>
<p>Some greenhouse gas emissions will be impossible to fully abate, such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture, while other sectors, like aviation, will be incredibly difficult to fully decarbonise. This makes carbon removal technologies all the more critical to ensuring net zero is achieved.</p>
<p>Technologies such as <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/">bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)</a> – which combines low-carbon, biomass-fuelled renewable power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) to permanently remove emissions from the atmosphere – are already under development.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-15613" src="https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/02/Pete-Madden-1024x773-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1171px) 100vw, 1171px" srcset="https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/02/Pete-Madden-1024x773-1.jpg 2560w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-1024x679.jpg 1024w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-1536x1019.jpg 1536w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-2048x1359.jpg 2048w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-1920x1274.jpg 1920w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-480x318.jpg 480w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-1809x1200.jpg 1809w, https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drax_Photos190422_71-904x600.jpg 904w" alt="" width="1171" height="777" /></p>
<p>However, it is imperative that such technologies are accounted for using robust approaches to carbon accounting, ensuring all emission and removals flows across the value chain are accurately calculated in accordance with best scientific practice. In the case of BECCS, it’s vital that not only are emissions from processing and transporting biomass considered, but also its potential impact on the land sector.</p>
<p>Forests from which biomass is sourced will be managed for a variety of reasons, such as mitigating natural disturbance, delivering commercial returns, and preserving ecosystems. Accurate accounting of these impacts is therefore key to ensuring such technologies deliver meaningful reductions in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>within timeframes guided by science.</p>
<h2><strong>Accounting for net zero </strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>While carbon accounting is crucial to reaching a true level of net zero in the UK and globally, where residual emissions are balanced against removals, the practice should not be used exclusively to deliver numerical carbon goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>“To deliver net zero, it’s vital we have robust carbon accounting systems and targets in place, ensuring we reduce fossil emissions as far as possible while also incentivising carbon removal solutions,” says Goldsworthy.</p>
<p>“However, many removal solutions rely on the natural world and so it is critical that ecosystems are not only valued on a carbon basis but consider other environmental factors such as biodiversity as well.”</p>

<p>Everything you need to know about the carbon cycle</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us/carbon-capture/what-is-the-carbon-cycle/">What is the carbon cycle?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us">Drax US</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the carbon cycle? </strong></h2>
<p>All living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another. Most carbon is stored in rock and sediment, but it’s also found in soil, oceans, and the atmosphere, and is produced by all living organisms – including plants, animals, and humans.</p>
<p>Carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations, also known as reservoirs, on Earth. They do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis, the decomposition and respiration of living organisms, and the eruption of volcanoes.</p>
<p>As our planet is a closed system, the overall amount of carbon doesn’t change. However, the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir, including the atmosphere, can and does change, as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle?</strong></h2>
<p>Carbon exists in many different forms, including the <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-carbon-dioxide/">colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a><sub>. </sub>During photosynthesis, plants absorb light energy from the sun, water through their roots, and CO<sub>2</sub> from the air – converting them into oxygen and glucose.</p>
<p>The oxygen is then released back into the air, while the carbon is stored in glucose<sub>,</sub> and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem, branches, leaves, and roots. Plants also release CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere through respiration.</p>
<p>Animals – including humans – who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes. The cells in the human body then break down the glucose, with CO<sub>2 </sub>emitted as a waste product as we exhale.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is also produced when plants and animals die and <a href="https://www.drax.com/uk/carbon-capture/can-carbon-capture-take-the-uk-beyond-net-zero/#chapter-2">are broken down</a> by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the fast carbon cycle?</strong></h2>
<p>The natural process of plants and animals releasing CO<sub>2 </sub>into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle. Biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism. This cycle also incorporates CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed and released by the world’s oceans.</p>
<p>The biogenic carbon cycle is also called the “fast” carbon cycle, as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly. There are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter06_FINAL.pdf">Reservoir turnover times</a> – a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location – range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the slow carbon cycle?</strong></h2>
<p>In some circumstances, plant and animal remains can become fossilised. This process, which takes millions of years, eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels. Coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock. And we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was, over time, buried by sediment.</p>
<p>The rocks and sedimentary layers where coal, crude oil, and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle. From this cycle, carbon is returned to the atmosphere through, for example, volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks. In the slow carbon cycle, reservoir turnover times exceed 10,000 years and can stretch to millions of years.</p>
<h2><strong>How do humans impact the carbon cycle? </strong></h2>
<p>Left to its own devices, Earth can keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels balanced, with similar amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> released into and absorbed from the air. Carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time. However, human activity has upset this natural equilibrium.</p>
<p>Burning fossil fuel releases carbon that’s been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years, transferring it from the slow to the fast (biogenic) carbon cycle. This influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2, </sub>that the biogenic carbon cycle can’t cope with.</p>
<p>As a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the Earth and its atmosphere, CO<sub>2</sub> is essential to human existence. Without CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, the planet could become too cold to sustain life.</p>
<p>However, the drastic increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between Earth and the atmosphere. This has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature, a development that is part<a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainable-business/what-is-climate-change/"> of climate change</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle? </strong></h2>
<p>One way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, including <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainable-bioenergy/what-is-biomass/">sustainably sourced biomass</a>. Feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material, wood, and forest residue – organic matter that absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> as part of the biogenic carbon cycle. When the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation, the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>This is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil, gas, and coal. The addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy – creating <a href="https://www.drax.com/carbon-capture/what-is-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture-and-storage-beccs/">BECCS</a> – means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered, permanently removing it from the atmosphere. By capturing CO<sub>2</sub> and transporting it to geological formations – such as porous rocks – for permanent storage, BECCS moves CO<sub>2 </sub>from the fast to the slow carbon cycle.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of burning fossil fuels, which takes carbon out of geological formations (the slow carbon cycle) and emits it into the atmosphere (the fast carbon cycle). Because BECCS removes more carbon than it emits, it delivers negative emissions.</p>

<p>A stable forest area with increasing inventory of softwood pulp and saw-timber, increasing softwood growth rates and a substantial surplus of fibre. The Drax Forestry team assesses the evidence.</p>

<p>The area of timberland in the Alabama cluster catchment area has remained stable over the last 20 years, increasing slightly from 4.08 million ha to 4.16 million ha, an increase of 79 thousand hectares.  This area represents 79.6% of the total land area in 2020, up from 78.1% in 2020.  The total area of forestland and woodland was 86% of the catchment area in 2020, with farmland making up 13% and urban areas 1%.  This land base can be considered to be heavily forested and dominated by timberland.</p>

<p>The timberland area is classified by growth rate potential, capable of achieving a minimum of 0.57 m<sup>3</sup>/ha/year.  More than 95% of the timberland area is in private ownership.  This proportion has remained stable since 2000 as shown in Figure 2.</p>

<p>The total standing volume, the amount of carbon stored in the forest area, has increased by 115 million m<sup>3</sup> since 2000 an increase of 30%. Most of this increase has occurred since 2010, with 90 million m<sup>3</sup> added to the inventory since this time, reflecting the maturing age class of the forest resource as it passes through the peak growth phase.  Almost all of this increase has been in the softwood pine forest area, with a combined increase of 86 million m<sup>3</sup> since 2010.  Pine saw-timber and chip-n-saw both increased by 46% since 2010 and pine pulpwood by 25% over the same period. Suggesting that the average tree size is getting larger as the forest matures.</p>

<p>One measure of the sustainability of harvesting levels is to compare average annual growth against removals.  This comparison gives a growth drain ratio (GDR).  Where removals are equal to or lower than growth (a GDR of 1 or more) this is a measure of sustainability, where the ratio falls below 1, this can indicate that harvesting levels are not sustainable in the long-term.  Figure 4 shows that all pine product classes have a positive GDR since 2010.  In particular the pine pulpwood GDR ratio is in excess of 2 suggesting that there is a substantial surplus of this product category.  By contrast, the hardwood GDR for both saw-timber and pulpwood are both lower than 1 suggesting that harvesting levels for hardwood species should be reduced until growth can recover.</p>
<div id="attachment_15480" style="width: 874px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15480" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15480" src="https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/02/Picture-4.png" alt="" width="864" height="504" srcset="https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/02/Picture-4.png 864w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/02/Picture-4-300x175.png 300w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/02/Picture-4-768x448.png 768w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/02/Picture-4-480x280.png 480w, https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/02/Picture-4-150x88.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /><p id="caption-attachment-15480" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4: Growth Drain Ratio by Product Class &#8211; Alabama cluster</p></div>
<p>Figure 5 shows the maturing age class of the forest area, charting the change in annual surplus and deficit in each product class.  The trend shows that harvesting of pine saw-timber from 2000 to 2008 represented a deficit of growth compared to harvesting removals.  This indicates an immature forest resource with a low quantity of forest categorised as saw-timber, therefore harvesting volume in mature stands outweighed the growth in mid-rotation stands.  As the forest aged, and more standing timber grew into the saw-timber category, the surplus of annual growth compared to removals increased.  Saw-timber growth in 2020 was 3 million m<sup>3</sup> higher than in 2000.  The surplus of pine pulpwood has remained positive and has increased substantially from 3 million m<sup>3</sup> in 2000 to 6.5 million m<sup>3</sup> in 2020 despite harvesting levels increasing slightly over this period.</p>

<p>Biomass demand began in 2008 at a very small scale, representing just 0.5% of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area.  From around 2013 it began to increase and reached peak in 2015 with a total demand of 724,000 tons of pulpwood in that year, representing 8.1% of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area.  After that time, demand for pulpwood declined as pellet mills switched to mill residuals.  The latest data on pulpwood demand shows that the biomass sectors made up just 2.8% of total pulpwood demand in 2020 with just over 216,000 tonnes of total demand.  This demonstrates that the biomass and wood pellet sector is a very small component of the market in this region and unlikely to influence forest management decision making, as shown in Figure 6.</p>

<p>Pine pulpwood stumpage prices have declined significantly since a peak in 2013, falling from an annual high of $9.46 when demand was strongest to just $4.12 in 2020 as demand for pine pulpwood declined in 2020.  Pine saw-timber prices have seen a similar decline from a high point in the early 2000’s to a plateau from 2011 onwards.  Saw-timber stumpage more than halved in value over this period from $49 per ton to $22 per ton.  This can have a significant impact on forest management objectives and decision making.</p>

<h3>Detailed below are the summary findings from Hood Consulting on the impact of biomass demand on key issues in the Alabama cluster catchment area.</h3>
<h4><em>Is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following:</em></h4>
<p><strong>Deforestation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> US Forest Service (USFS) data shows that total timberland area has held steady and averaged roughly 4,172,000 hectares in the Alabama Cluster catchment area since Alabama Pellets-Aliceville started up in late-2012. More importantly, planted pine timberland (the predominant source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production) has increased more than 75,000 hectares (+4.9%) in the catchment area since Alabama Pellets’ startup in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>A change in management practices (rotation lengths, thinnings, conversion from hardwood to pine)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inconclusive.</strong> Changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last two decades. However, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether increased demand attributed to bioenergy has caused or is responsible for those changes.</p>
<p>Clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region, both of which are long-standing, widely used methods of harvesting timber. TimberMart-South (TMS) data shows that the prevalence of thinnings temporarily increased in the Alabama Cluster market (from 2007-2013) due to the weakening of pine sawtimber markets. Specifically, challenging market conditions saw pine sawtimber stumpages prices decline from an average of $47 per ton from 2000-2006 to just over $23 per ton in 2011, or a roughly 50% decrease from 2000-2006 average levels. This led many landowners to refrain from clearcutting (a type of harvest which typically removes large quantities of pine sawtimber), as they waited for pine sawtimber prices to improve. However, pine sawtimber stumpage prices never recovered and have held between $22 and $25 per ton since 2011. Ultimately, landowners returned to more ‘normal’ management practices by 2014, with thinnings falling back in line with pre-2007 trends.</p>
<p>The catchment area has also experienced some conversion. Specifically, from 2000-2020, planted pine timberland increased more than 460,000 hectares while natural hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood timberland decreased a combined 390,000 hectares. Note that the increase in planted pine timberland and decrease in natural hardwood/mixed pine-hardwood timberland over this period were both gradual and occurred simultaneously. This suggests a management trend in which natural timber stands are converted to plantation pine following final harvest. It’s also important to note that there is little evidence that links these changes to increased demand from bioenergy, as this conversion trend begun years prior to the startup of Alabama Pellets and continued nearly unchanged following the pellet mill’s startup.</p>
<p><strong>Diversion from other markets?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> Demand for softwood (pine) sawlogs increased an estimated 12% in the catchment area from 2012-2020. Also, there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused a diversion from other softwood pulpwood markets (i.e. pulp/paper). Also, even though softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy is down 14% since Alabama Pellets-Aliceville’s startup in 2012, there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused this decrease. Rather, the decrease in demand from non-bioenergy sources is due to a combination of reduced product demand (and therefore reduced production) and increased utilization of sawmill residuals.</p>
<p><strong>An unexpected or abnormal increase in wood prices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> The startup of Alabama Pellets-Aliceville added roughly 450,000 metric tons of softwood pulpwood demand to the catchment area from 2012-2016, and this increase in demand coincided with essentially no change in delivered pine pulpwood (PPW) price over this same period. Ultimately, the additional demand placed on the catchment area following the startup of Alabama Pellets-Aliceville was offset by a decrease in demand from other sources from 2012-2016, and, as a result, delivered PPW prices remained nearly unchanged.</p>
<p>However, the Aliceville facility was shut down for a majority of 2017 due to the catastrophic failure of a key piece of environmental equipment, and this was followed by Alabama Pellets’ strategic decision to transition to residual-consumption only beginning in 2018, which eliminated more than 360,000 metric tons of annual softwood pulpwood demand from 2016-2018. Over this same period, softwood pulpwood demand from other sources also decreased nearly 360,000 metric tons. So, with the elimination of roughly 720,000 metric tons of annual softwood pulpwood demand from all sources from 2016-2018, delivered PPW prices in the catchment area proceeded to decrease more than 6% over this period. Since 2018, total softwood pulpwood demand has increased roughly 4% in the catchment area (due to increases in demand from non-bioenergy sources), and this increase that has coincided with a simultaneous 4% increase in delivered PPW price.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered PPW price. However, the relationship between delivered PPW price and non-biomass-related softwood pulpwood demand was found to be stronger, which is not unexpected given that pine pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 94% of total pine pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2012. Ultimately, the findings provide evidence that PPW price is influenced by demand from all sources – not just from bioenergy or from pulp/paper, but from both.</p>
<p>Furthermore, note that Alabama Pellets’ shift to residual-consumption only beginning in 2018 resulted in no increase in pine sawmill chip prices, as the price of pine sawmill chips in the Alabama Cluster catchment area rather decreased from 2018-2020, despite a more than 100,000-metric ton increase in pine sawmill chip consumption by the Aliceville mill over this period.</p>
<p><strong>A reduction in growing stock timber?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> From 2012 (the year Alabama Pellets started up) to 2020, total growing stock inventory increased an average of 2.6% per year (+22% total) in the Alabama Cluster catchment area. Specifically, inventories of pine sawtimber and pine chip-n-saw increased 41% and 40%, respectively, while pine pulpwood (PPW) inventory increased 25% over this same period.</p>
<p><strong>A reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> US Forest Service (USFS) data shows the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber in the Alabama Cluster catchment area increased from 6.0% in 2012 to 6.2% in 2020, suggesting that the sequestration rate of carbon also increased slightly over this period.</p>
<p>Note that the increase in overall growth rate (and therefore increase in the sequestration rate of carbon) can be linked to gains in pine timberland and associated changes with the catchment area forest. Specifically, growth rates decline as timber ages, so the influx of new pine timberland (due to the conversion of both hardwood forests and cropland) has resulted in just the opposite, with the average age of softwood (pine) growing stock inventory decreasing from an estimated 35.4 years of age in 2000 to 33.2 years of age in 2010 and to 32.2 years of age in 2020 (total growing stock inventory decreased from 41.9 to 41.0 and to 40.4 years of age over these periods).</p>
<p><strong>An increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong> Growth-to-removals (G:R) ratios, which compare annual timber growth to annual timber removals, provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability. In 2020, the latest available, the G:R ratio for pine pulpwood (PPW), the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector, equaled 3.26 (recall that a value greater than 1.0 indicates sustainable harvest levels).</p>
<p>Moreover, note that the PPW G:R ratio has increased in the catchment area since the Aliceville mill’s startup in 2012, despite the associated increases in pine pulpwood demand. In this catchment area, pine pulpwood demand from non-bioenergy sources decreased more than 860,000 metric tons from 2012 to 2020, and this decrease more than offset any increase in demand from bioenergy.</p>
<h4><em><strong>Impact of bioenergy demand on:</strong></em></h4>
<p><strong>Timber growing stock inventory</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neutral.</strong> According to USFS data, inventories of pine pulpwood (PPW) increased 25% in the catchment area from 2012-2020, and this increase in PPW inventory can be linked to both increases in pine timberland and harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area. Specifically, pine timberland (both planted and natural combined) increased more than 185,000 hectares in the catchment area from 2012-2020. Over this same period, annual harvests of PPW were 65% below maximum sustainable levels.</p>
<p><strong>Timber growth rates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neutral.</strong> The average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber increased from 6.0% in 2012 to 6.2% in 2020 in the Alabama Cluster catchment area, despite pine pulpwood (PPW) growth rate decreasing from 15.1% to 12.5% over this period. However, this decrease in PPW growth rate was not due to increased demand attributed to bioenergy but rather to the aging of PPW within its product group and its natural movement along the pine growth rate curve. Specifically, USFS data indicates the average age of PPW inventory in the catchment area increased from an estimated 13.4 years of age in 2012 to 13.6 years of age in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Forest area</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neutral.</strong> In the Alabama Cluster catchment area, total forest (timberland) area remained nearly unchanged (decreasing only marginally) from 2012-2020. However, pine timberland – the predominant source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production – increased more than 185,000 hectares over this period, and this increase can be linked to several factors, including conversion from both hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood forests as well as conversion from cropland.</p>
<p>Specifically, the more than 185,000-hectare increase in pine timberland from 2012-2020 coincided with a roughly 197,000-hectare decrease in hardwood/mixed pine-hardwood timberland and a more than 8,000-hectare decrease in cropland over this period. Furthermore, statistical analysis confirmed these inverse relationships, identifying strong negative correlations between pine timberland area and both hardwood/mixed pine-hardwood timberland area and cropland in the catchment area from 2012-2020.</p>
<p><strong>Wood prices</strong></p>
<p><strong>Negative/Neutral.</strong> Softwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy increased from roughly 80,000 metric tons in 2012 (the year Alabama Pellets-Aliceville started up) to more than 655,000 metric tons in 2015 (the year biomass demand reached peak levels). However, this roughly 575,000-metric ton increase in softwood biomass demand coincided with essentially no change in delivered pine pulpwood (PPW) price – which averaged $26.40 per ton in 2012 and $26.39 per ton in 2015. Ultimately, the additional demand placed on this catchment area following the startup of Alabama Pellets-Aliceville was offset by a more than 680,000-metric ton decrease in demand from other sources over this same period, and, as a result, delivered PPW prices remained nearly unchanged. Also note that Alabama Pellets’ strategic shift to consume residuals only (a transition that begun in 2018 and had been completed by 2019) resulted in a nearly 480,000-metric ton decrease in softwood biomass demand in the catchment area from 2015 to 2020. Over this same period, softwood pulpwood demand from other sources decreased more than 180,000 metric tons. In total, softwood pulpwood demand from all sources decreased more than 660,000 metric tons from 2015 to 2020, and this decrease in demand resulted in delivered PPW prices decreasing 5% over this period.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered PPW price. However, the relationship between delivered PPW price and non-biomass-related softwood pulpwood demand was found to be stronger, which is not unexpected given that pine pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 94% of total pine pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2012. Ultimately, the findings provide evidence that PPW price is influenced by demand from all sources – not just from bioenergy or from pulp/paper, but from both.</p>
<p><strong>Markets for solid wood products</strong></p>
<p><strong>Positive.</strong> In the Alabama Cluster catchment area, demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products has increased an estimated 12% since 2012, and this increase in softwood lumber production has consequentially resulted in the increased production of sawmill residuals (i.e. chips, sawdust, and shavings) – by-products of the sawmilling process and materials utilized by Alabama Pellets to produce wood pellets.</p>
<p>Moreover, the increased availability of sawmill residuals and lower relative cost compared to roundwood (after chipping and other processing costs are considered) led Alabama Pellets to make a strategic shift to utilize residuals only for wood pellet production beginning in 2019. So, not only has Alabama Pellets benefited from the greater availability of this lower-cost sawmill by-product, but lumber producers have also benefited, as Alabama Pellets has provided an additional outlet for these producers and their by-products.</p>

<p>How actively managing forests keeps them healthy and productive.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us/sustainable-bioenergy/what-is-sustainable-forest-management/">What is sustainable forest management?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/us">Drax US</a>.</p>
<p>Sustainable forest management is frequently defined in terms of providing a balance of social, environmental, and economic benefits, not just for today but for the future too. It might be seen as the practice of maintaining forests to ensure they remain healthy, absorb more carbon than they release, and can continue to be enjoyed and used by future generations.</p>
<p>To achieve this, foresters apply science, knowledge, and standards that help ensure forests continue to play an important role in the wellbeing of people and the planet.</p>
<p>Managed forests, also called working forests, fulfil a variety of environmental, social, and economic functions. These range from forests managed to attract certain desired wildlife species, to forests grown to provide saw timber and reoccurring revenue for landowners.</p>
<h2><strong>How are forests sustainably managed? </strong></h2>
<p>How forests are managed depends on landowner goals – managing for recreation and wildlife, focusing on maximising production of wood products, or both. Each forest requires management tailored to its owner’s or manager’s objectives.</p>
<p>There are many ways to manage forests to keep them healthy – there is no ‘one size fits all’ – but keeping track of how they are doing can be tricky. One alternative for monitoring forests is <a href="https://www.drax.com/us/sustainable-bioenergy/evaluating-regrowth-post-harvest-with-accurate-data-and-satellite-imagery/#chapter-3">to use satellite imagery</a>.</p>

<p>One common sustainable forestry practice is <a href="https://www.drax.com/us/sustainable-bioenergy/what-is-a-working-forest/">thinning</a>, which involves periodically removing smaller, unhealthy, or diseased trees to enable stronger ones to thrive. Thinning reduces competition between trees for resources like sunlight and water, and it can also help promote biodiversity by creating more space for other forest flora.</p>
<p>The wood removed from forests through thinning is sometimes not high-quality enough to be used in industries such as construction or furniture. However, the biomass industry can use it to make <a href="https://www.drax.com/us/technology/this-is-how-you-make-a-biomass-wood-pellet/">compressed wood pellets</a>; a feedstock for renewable source electricity.</p>
<blockquote><p>By providing a market for low-quality wood, pellet production encourages landowners to carry out thinnings. This practice improves the health of the forest, and helps support better growth, greater carbon storage, and creates more valuable woodland.</p></blockquote>

<li>Forests cover about <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS">30%</a> of the world’s land surface, absorbing around <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/forests-absorb-twice-much-carbon-they-emit-each-year">16 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> a year</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/raw-materials/related-industries/forest-based-industries/sustainable-forest-management_en">42% of EU forests</a> are covered by 3<sup>rd</sup> party forest certification schemes.</li>
<li>Through sustainable forest management, annual forest growth in the US South increased from <a href="https://forestscope.info/">193 million m<sup>3</sup> in 1953 to 408 million in 2015</a>.</li>

<h2><strong>What are the environmental benefits of sustainably managed forests?</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>Through their ability to act as carbon sinks, forests are an important part of meeting global climate goals like the Paris Agreement and the UK’s own target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.</p></blockquote>
<p>When managed effectively through thinning or active harvesting, and replanting and regeneration, forests can often sequester – or absorb and store – <a href="https://www.drax.com/us/sustainability/trusting-trees-four-countries-transformed-forests/">more carbon</a> than forests that are left untouched, increasing productivity and improving planting material.</p>
<p>Harvesting trees before they reach an age when growth slows or plateaus can help prevent fire damage, pests, and disease, so timing of final cutting is important. Though the vast majority of timber from such cutting will go to other markets (construction, furniture etc) and secure higher prices from those markets, being able to sell lower quality wood for biomass provides the landowner with some extra revenue.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sustainably managed forests also help achieve other environmental goals, such as sustaining biodiversity, protecting sensitive sites and providing clean air and water. Managed forests also have substantial water absorption capacity preventing flooding by slowing the flow of sudden downpours and helping to prevent nearby rivers and streams from overfilling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wood from working forests also help tackle climate change in that high-value wood from harvested trees can be used to make timber for the construction or furniture sectors. These wood products lock up carbon for extended periods of time, and the wood can be used at end-of life to displace fossil fuels. Using wood also means materials such as concrete, bricks or steel are not used, and these materials have a large carbon footprint compared to wood.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the socioeconomic benefits of sustainably managed forests?</strong></h2>
<p>There are also social and economic benefits to managing forests. Sustainably managed working forests make vital contributions both to people and to the planet.</p>
<p>The commercial use of wood in industries like furniture and construction drives revenue for landowners. This encourages landowners to continue to replant forests and manage them in a sustainable way that continues to deliver returns.</p>
<p>Healthy forests can also improve living standards for local communities for jobs and helping to address unemployment in rural regions. Managed forests can also improve access for recreation. On a larger scale, sustainable forestry can offer a valuable export for regions and nations and foster trade between countries.</p>
