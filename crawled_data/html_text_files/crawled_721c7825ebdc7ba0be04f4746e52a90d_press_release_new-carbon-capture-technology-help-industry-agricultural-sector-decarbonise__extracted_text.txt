power station new carbon capture technology could help industry and agricultural sector decarbonise drax is working with biotech startup deep branch biotechnology to explore the feasibility of using the power stations carbon dioxide emissions to make proteins for sustainable animal feed products 17 june 2019 innovative biotech startup deep branch biotechnology is partnering with drax group on a new bioenergy carbon capture usage and storage beccus pilot which could help reduce emissions from the agricultural sector carbon dioxide will be used to create protein which could replace soy and fishmeal the main components in fish and livestock feeds the project aims to help meet the anticipated increase in global demand for meat products global markets for single cell proteins could be worth 9bn by 2023 drax is working with biotech startup deep branch biotechnology to explore the feasibility of using the power stations carbon dioxide emissions to make proteins for sustainable animal feed products deep branch biotechnology a leading tech startup based at nottingham university will place a pilot plant within draxs carbon capture usage and storage ccus incubation area at its power station in north yorkshire it will extract flue gases from the power stations renewable electricity generation to feed to microbes which can make single cell proteins for use in fish food and other sustainable animal feeds drax group ceo will gardiner said by giving partners like deep branch biotechnology access to our ccus incubation area we can test emerging technologies and explore their potential in delivering for both the climate and the economy we want to create a cleaner environment for future generations whilst generating new jobs and export opportunities for british businesses technologies like this could enable some of our more difficult to decarbonise sectors like agriculture to make positive changes to address the climate crisis drax power station is the biggest renewable electricity generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted two thirds of the plant to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it is exploring the feasibility of using beccus technologies to help further reduce its emissions and contribute towards the uk meeting its climate targets this is draxs first incubation project exploring a market for carbon dioxide the power station has also held discussions with the british beer and pub association about the possibility of captured co 2 being used to carbonate drinks drax group ceo will gardiner second right accompanied energy and clean growth minister claire perry in a visit to the drax power station beccs pilot project in november 2018 download graphic in highres a dedicated incubation area has been created at the power station to give other technology companies the opportunity to test their processes on its carbon dioxide chris skidmore minister for energy and clean growth said carbon capture usage and storage technologies are not only putting fizz in our drinks but feeding fish too as we move towards net zero emissions and end our contribution to global warming innovative projects like this will help reduce agricultural emissions and meet increasing demand for animal feed demonstrating the enormous global potential ccus has to tackle climate change peter rowe deep branch biotechnology ceo explained that the method they have developed for producing proteins from co 2  relies on an edible microbe that consumes carbon dioxide when fed carbon dioxide the microbes grow and reproduce enabling them to be continually harvested for protein whilst maintaining a growing culture under optimal conditions up to 70 per cent of the material produced is protein download graphic high res no logo high res with logo the benefits of this process over other carbon capture technologies is that the co 2 does not need to be separated from the power stations flue gases before being fed to the microbes peter said meat production is set to double by 2050 as global populations increase but using existing methods of producing animal feeds to meet this growing demand is completely unsustainable the technology weve developed is an exciting solution we can convert up to 6070 of co 2 into protein helping to both minimise the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere during power generation and other industrial processes whilst producing protein for animal feeds which will help reduce the impact of agricultural sectors on the environment as well the usa is the worlds biggest soy producer producing one third of global supply and uses 97 to produce animal feed over 60 of cereals grown globally are being used in animal feeds along with 20 million tonnes of oceancaught fish concerns about overfishing have seen the aquaculture farmed fish industry boom yet this industry uses more than 15 of oceancaught fish for feed in the form of fishmeal the new proteins created using the deep branch biotechnology could help reduce the quantities of fish removed from the oceans this not only minimises the impact on ecosystems but decreases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere mitigating the harmful effects of climate change the deep branch pilot will get underway in the autumn when a demonstration plant will be installed within the drax ccus incubation area it aims to capture enough co 2 to produce 100kg of protein to be used to create feedstocks for fish and livestock the protein generated from the project will be used in a trial project with a major feed producer if successful deep branch biotechnology plans to build a larger production facility by 2020 so it can produce several tonnes of protein per year ends media contacts

drax announced in february that is had started to capture carbon dioxide from its first bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project using technology developed by leeds university spinout company ccapture this is the firsttime carbon dioxide has been captured from the combustion of a 100 biomass feedstock anywhere in the world if the pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions drax power station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced since starting its innovative beccs pilot project drax has been talking to several industries about using its co 2 in their processes this could be to produce concrete within the food and drinks industry or creating synthetic fuels to use in hardtodecarbonise sectors like aviation drax announced in may it had signed a memorandum of understanding with equinor and national grid ventures the three energy companies will work together to explore how a largescale carbon capture usage and storage ccus network and a hydrogen production facility could be constructed in the humber in the mid2020s the committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 mt co 2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero today drax is capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from its ccapture beccs pilot  once scaled up it could be capturing up to 16 million tonnes of carbon a day from its four biomass generating units the agricultural sector was one highlighted by the committee on climate change in its net zero report as being too slow to make progress in reducing emissions the uns food and agriculture organisation has found that around a third of all global cropland is used to grow animal feed in the form of soy around 15 per cent of all fish caught globally are turned into feed for commercial fisheries according to analysis by the uks sea fish industry authority  using bacteria to make protein for animal feed was first considered in the 1970s it is now more economically viable as producing fishmeal powder from milling and drying fish parts has become more expensive and has not kept up with growing human demand for fish about deep branch biotechnology deep branch biotechnology s mission is to transform the polluters of today into the producers of tomorrow their technology removes carbon dioxide directly from emissions generating single cell protein a clean and
