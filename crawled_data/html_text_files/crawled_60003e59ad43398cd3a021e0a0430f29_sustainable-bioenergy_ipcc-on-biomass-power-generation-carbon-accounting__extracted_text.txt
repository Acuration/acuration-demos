 sustainability  sustainable bioenergy  ipcc on biomass power generation carbon accounting ipcc on biomass power generation carbon accounting ipcc on biomass power generation carbon accounting extract from 2019 refinement to the 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories volume 2 energy about this resource in 2019 the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change updated its guidance on how to treat biomass greenhouse gas ghg emissions it clearly reiterates the principle held since 1995 that because biomass spans lots of accounting frameworks ie forestry and other land use energy agriculture etc there is a risk of double counting it therefore says that biomass should be accounted for in the forestry and other land use afolu category and not in energy the information below is extracted from the website of the ipccs task force on national greenhouse gas inventories  we have placed the key points in bold and drax commentary in italic blue  treatment of biomass extract with commentary biomass is a special case the overall ipcc approach to greenhouse gas emissions from combustion of biomass or biomassbased products eg ethanol at the national level allows for complete coverage of emissions and sinks and involves all ipcc sectors including in particular energy agriculture forestry and other landuse afolu and waste carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from the combustion of biomass or biomassbased products are captured within the co 2 emissions in the afolu sector through the estimated changes in carbon stocks from biomass harvest even in cases where the emissions physically take place in other sectors eg energy this approach to estimate and report all co 2 emissions from biomass or biomassbased products in the afolu sector was introduced in the first ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas emissions ipcc 1995 reflecting close linkages with data on biomass harvesting and for the pragmatic reason to avoid double counting because biomass is accounted for in the land use sector it should be treated as zero ie carbon neutral in the energy sector otherwise emissions would be accounted for twice in the energy sector co 2  methane ch 4  and nitrous oxide n 2 o emissions from combustion of biomass or biomassbased products for energy are estimated but the co 2 emissions are recorded as an information item that is not included in the sectoral total emissions for the energy sector as they are already included in afolu the ch 4 and n 2 o emissions from the combustion of biomass for energy are included in the sectoral total emissions in the energy sector as emission rates depend on combustion and transformation conditions and cannot be estimated using afolu carbon stock change methodologies this provides a complete picture of a countrys energy system and avoids double counting of emissions with those reported in the afolu sector this is why we report stack emissions but do not have to surrender eu ets allowances and also why we are still subject to eu and uk air quality legislation that covers ghgs other than co 2  for biomass only that part of the biomass that is combusted for energy purposes should be estimated for inclusion as an information item in the energy sector for fuel wood activity data are available from the international energy agency iea or the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao  these data originate from national sources and inventory compilers can obtain a better understanding of national circumstances by contacting national statistical agencies to find the organisations involved for agricultural crop residues part of other primary solid biomass and also for fuel wood estimation methods for activity data are available in chapter 5 of the afolu volume in some instances biofuels will be combusted jointly with fossil fuels in this case the split between the fossil and nonfossil fraction of the fuel should be established and the emission factors applied to the appropriate fractions further clarification on the approach for biomass energy emissions can be found in section 11 concepts in volume 1 chapter 1 further clarification on the reporting of emissions from burning woody biomass for energy is provided in section 125 chapter 12 of the afolu volume of the 2019 refinement  related stories press releases drax responds the ipccs ar6 synthesis
