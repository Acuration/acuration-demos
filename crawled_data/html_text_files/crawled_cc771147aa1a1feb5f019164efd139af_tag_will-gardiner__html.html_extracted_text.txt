UK Biomass Strategy – Highly Supportive of Biomass and a Priority Role for BECCS
10 August 2023
Investors

The Strategy outlines the potential
extraordinary
role which biomass can play across the economy in power, heating and transport, including a priority role for Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide large-scale carbon removals.
Will Gardiner, Drax CEO, said:
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO
“We welcome the UK Government’s clear support for sustainably sourced biomass and the critical role that BECCS can play in achieving the country’s climate goals.
“The inclusion of BECCS at the top of a priority use framework is a clear signal that the UK wants to be a leader in carbon removals and Drax is ready to deliver on this ambition. We are engaged in formal discussions with the UK Government about the project and, providing these are successful, we plan to invest billions in delivering BECCS at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire, simultaneously providing reliable, renewable power and carbon removals.
“We look forward to working alongside the Government to ensure biomass is best used to contribute to net zero across the economy, through further progression of plans for BECCS and ensuring an evidence-driven, best practice approach to sustainability.”
A priority role for BECCS
The Strategy reiterates the Government’s ambition to deliver 5Mt pa of carbon removals by 2030, with the potential for this to increase to 23Mt by 2035 and up to 81Mt by 2050, with BECCS expected to provide the majority of the total in 2050.
In the period to 2035 Government intends to facilitate the use of biomass for power and heating, whilst supporting projects transitioning to BECCS. BECCS projects, which includes Drax Power Station, are seen as a priority use of biomass given existing generation assets with established supply chains and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology ready to be deployed. Beyond 2035 there will remain a role for biomass without BECCS in harder to decarbonise sectors and in supporting energy security.
The Strategy notes the active work in government to support BECCS, including the development of business models.
Biomass availability and sustainability
The Strategy considers the global availability of sustainable biomass, finding that by using domestic and imported biomass sources there is sufficient material to meet estimated future demand in the 6
th
Carbon Budget.
Alongside the increased use of sustainable biomass, Government will continue to develop sustainability criteria and Drax supports the development of robust standards across sectors.
A link to the Strategy can be found
here
.
Scientific assessment of carbon removals from BECCS
Alongside publication of the Strategy, the Government has published an evidence-based assessment of BECCS as a route to negative emissions. The report sets out how “well regulated” BECCS can deliver negative emissions and ensure positive outcomes for people, the environment, and the climate.
BECCS at Drax Power Station
In March 2023, the Government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of large-scale Power-BECCS projects by 2030 and that the Drax Power Station BECCS project had passed the deliverability assessment for the Power-BECCS project submission process.
Formal bilateral discussions with the Government are ongoing to move the project forward and help realise the Government’s ambition to deliver 5Mt pa of carbon removals by 2030. These discussions include a bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of BECCS at Drax Power Station.
Drax believes that BECCS at Drax Power Station is the only project in the UK that can enable the Government to achieve this ambition, in addition to the large-scale renewable power and system support services it provides to the UK power system.
In July 2023, the Government designated the Viking CCS cluster as a Track 2 cluster. Progressing a CO
2
transport and storage network in the Humber represents a significant step toward helping the region meet its net zero ambitions and ensuring that it remains a source of high-skilled jobs and energy security for decades to come. Along with the East Coast Cluster, Viking creates an additional potential pathway to support BECCS at Drax Power Station.
The Government has also confirmed that during 2023 it will set out a process for the expansion of its wider CCS programme for individual projects, including BECCS (Track 1 expansion and Track 2).

Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO
Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:
“In the first half of 2023, we delivered a strong system support and generation performance, providing dispatchable, renewable power for millions of UK homes and businesses. Drax Power Station remained the UK’s single largest provider of renewable energy by output during the period.
“We continue to focus on our role as the UK’s leading generator of flexible renewable power and our ambition to be a world leader in carbon removals. To that end, in the US, we have made good progress screening options for BECCS projects which can deliver long-term, large-scale carbon removal and attractive opportunities for growth.
“We are excited about the opportunity for BECCS in the UK and are in formal discussions with the UK Government to facilitate the transition to BECCS at Drax Power Station by 2030. Our plans could create thousands of new jobs in the Humber region, help the UK meet its carbon removals targets and support long-term energy security.”

Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner said:
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO
“The world’s leading climate scientists at the UN’s IPCC are clear – the planet cannot solve the climate crisis without the combination of reliable, renewable electricity and carbon removal technologies.
“Drax is a growing and sustainable, international business providing flexible, renewable energy and carbon removals solutions, via BECCS, which put us at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security.
“Our plans to invest billions in critical renewable energy and carbon removal technologies will help to tackle the climate crisis and could create thousands of jobs whilst generating secure, renewable power. This investment is underpinned by our strong operational performance.”
Capital Markets Day
Drax is today hosting a Capital Markets Day for investors and analysts.
Will Gardiner and members of his leadership team will update on the Group’s strategy, market opportunities and development projects, including the progress Drax is making in the development of BECCS in North America and the opportunities this represents for the Group.
Purpose and ambition
The Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030. The Group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars, which are closely aligned with global energy policies that increasingly recognise the role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change.
The Group’s three strategic pillars remain (1) to be a global leader in carbon removals, (2) to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets, and (3) to be a UK leader in dispatchable, renewable generation.
Global need for carbon removals
Research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
(3)
, the world’s leading authority on climate science, states that CDR methods, including BECCS, are needed to mitigate residual emissions and keep the world on a pathway to limit global warming to 1.5
o
C.
All of the illustrative mitigation pathways assessed in the IPCC’s latest report use significant volumes of carbon removals, including BECCS, as a key tool for mitigating climate change. The IPCC believes that globally up to 9.5 billion tonnes of CDRs via BECCS will be required per year by 2050.
In the USA, the supportive investment environment created by the Inflation Reduction Act is stimulating action and robust pricing for CDRs.
BECCS – North America
Over the past two years, Drax has been progressing a number of work streams to develop its options for BECCS, with a primary focus on North America.
Drax has continued to develop plans for a new-build BECCS power unit capable of producing c.2TWh of renewable electricity from sustainable biomass and capturing c.3Mt of carbon per year. Two initial sites in the US South have been selected and are progressing to option, although the precise details remain commercially sensitive. The two sites combined could enable the capture of c.6Mt of carbon per year by 2030.
Total investment would be in the region of $2 billion per plant with a target FID in 2026 and commercial operation by 2030. The capital cost reflects the construction of new-build power generation as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems.
The design of new-build BECCS enables a wider choice of biomass materials, including non-pelletised material, such as woodchips. Drax aims to locate new plants in regions which are closer to sources of sustainable biomass and T&S systems to permanently store CO
2
. This is expected to significantly reduce the operating cost of new-build BECCS compared to retrofit, as well as carbon emissions in the supply chain.
The Group is continuing to evaluate nine further sites in North America, creating a pipeline of development opportunities into the 2030s.
Commercial arrangements
The commercial model for US BECCS includes Power Purchase Agreements, long-term CDR offtake agreements and a direct pay tax incentive under the Inflation Reduction Act of $85/tonne.
Drax believes that the role of high-quality, permanent removals, such as BECCS and Direct Air Capture, will grow significantly as governments and companies take action to address their own carbon footprints. In September 2022, Drax announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for one of the world’s biggest carbon removals deal with Respira, a carbon broker. Under the terms of the MoU, Respira will be able to purchase up to 2Mt of CDRs over a five-year period from Drax’s North American BECCS projects.
Drax has also agreed MoUs with C-Zero, a carbon broker, for the sale of CDRs at c.$300/tonne.
Resourcing
To support the development of its BECCS projects in North America, Drax has hired 80 employees across the US and Canada and is in the process of establishing a Global BECCS headquarters in Houston, Texas, which will provide access to the highly skilled workforce needed to support the growth of this part of the Group.
Other developments
In addition to new-build BECCS, Drax is currently developing an option for a project to add a carbon capture process to an existing pellet plant in Louisiana. The project would have the capacity to capture over 100k tonnes of CO
2
per year from the pelleting process, providing an early demonstration of the technology and creating CDRs which can help to stimulate this nascent market. The project, which has a capital cost in the region of $150 million, is targeting FID in 2024/25 and commissioning in 2026.
The Group is also assessing options for BECCS on existing non-Drax assets and is continuing to screen other regions, including Europe and Australasia.
Capital allocation
The Group has previously outlined a fully funded plan to invest c.£3 billion in two BECCS units at Drax Power Station, pellet production and pumped storage hydro.
Today, the Group expands on this plan to include two new-build BECCS plants and CCS on a pellet plant, increasing the total potential investment to c.£7 billion between 2024 and 2030.
Any final investment decisions will be subject to the achievement of project milestones, including further progress on commercial arrangements as well as clarity on regulatory and funding mechanisms.
Reflecting strong expected cash generation from existing assets and new investments, Drax can fully fund the £7bn of opportunities and return to net debt to Adjusted EBITDA below 2x by the end of 2031. Drax will also continue to assess a wider range of funding options, including project finance.
The Group remains committed to its capital allocation policy, which was established in 2017, and has delivered average annual dividend per share growth of around 11%.
The Group has commenced a £150 million share buyback programme, which is expected to complete by the end of 2023. The programme is not expected to have any impact on the Group’s medium and long-term growth plans and, beyond the current buyback programme, will continue to assess its capital requirements in line with the current policy, including the return of excess capital to shareholders.
Outlook
The Group’s outlook for 2023, as set out in its recent Trading Update, remains unchanged and provides a strong platform for long-term investment and returns to shareholders.
Drax continues to expect full year Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
for 2023 to be in line with analysts’ consensus estimates
(2)
, subject to continued good operational performance.

Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner said:
“In the first quarter of 2023, we have delivered a strong system support and generation performance, providing renewable, secure, dispatchable power for millions of homes and businesses across the UK.
“We remain excited about the opportunity to do BECCS in the UK. Whilst the project is not currently in the Track 1 process, we have commenced formal discussions with the Government to facilitate the transition to BECCS at Drax Power Station by 2030.
“At the end of March, we formally closed the remaining two coal units at Drax Power Station. This is a significant moment for the business and I’d like to thank the many hundreds of people involved in making this happen and transforming Drax into a global leader in biomass power generation.
“In the US, we continue to make good progress screening options for over 10 BECCS projects which will deliver long-term, large-scale carbon removal.”
Generation
Drax has continued to optimise generation across all four biomass units (ROC and CfD), based on system need and sustainable biomass supply. The Group’s biomass, pumped storage and hydro assets have continued to support UK security of supply, providing a wide range of system support services and renewable electricity generation, which included forward power sales from pumped storage in the first three months of 2023.
Generation contracted power sales
As at 21 April 2023, Drax had 26.2TWh of power hedged between 2023 and 2025 on its ROC, pumped storage and hydro generation assets at an average price of £152.2/MWh

Coal
Following the completion of a “winter contingency” service agreement (October 2022 – March 2023) with National Grid, Drax has commenced the decommissioning of its two coal units. There was no coal generation during the agreement period.
Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) – UK
In March 2023, the UK Government provided an update on its plans for the deployment of carbon capture and storage infrastructure and projects. This confirmed that Power BECCS and certain other shortlisted projects were not included in the initial Track 1 process, which relates to projects targeting commissioning in the mid-2020s. The Government confirmed that during 2023 it will set out a process for the expansion of Track 1 and has also launched a Track 2 process. Power BECCS is eligible for both tracks.
Alongside this update the Government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of large-scale Power BECCS projects by 2030. Drax has now commenced formal bilateral discussions with the Government to move the project at Drax Power Station forward and ensure that the Government is able to fulfil its restated commitment of achieving 5Mt pa of engineered Greenhouse Gas Removals by 2030. Drax believes that BECCS at Drax Power Station is the only project in the UK that can enable the Government to achieve this goal
(6)
. This process will also include discussion of a bridging mechanism for biomass power generation between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of BECCS.
In addition, the Government has now published its response to the Power BECCS business model consultation, which took place in 2022, confirming its preference for the use of a CfD mechanism to remunerate renewable power and carbon removals in BECCS. The Government has also committed to publish its biomass strategy by the end of June 2023 which will set out how the technology could be deployed.
Drax’s plan of record for investment in UK BECCS was based on a first BECCS unit commissioning in 2027 and a second by 2030. Since Power BECCS is not currently in the Track 1 process and Government’s aim is to support BECCS by 2030, Drax has paused further investment in its UK BECCS project in 2023 and will revise its UK BECCS investment schedule subject to further clarity on support for BECCS at Drax Power Station.
Pellet Production
The Group’s sustainable biomass pellet business has continued to support efforts to optimise biomass power generation and security of supply in the UK. In the US, the focus has remained on ensuring the Demopolis plant reaches full capacity and reliable, safe operation.
As outlined in the 2022 Full Year Results (February 2023), inflationary pressures, primarily in transportation and utilities have contributed to an increase in pellet production costs. Taken together with costs incurred in providing supply-side flexibility, Drax continues to expect production costs to be higher in 2023.
While continuing to optimise its supply chain to maximise value for the Group, Drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce the cost of biomass.
Full Year Expectations
Reflecting these factors, Drax continues to expect full year Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
for 2023 to be in line with analysts’ consensus estimates
(2)
, subject to continued good operational performance.
Reflecting the reprofiling of investment in UK BECCS, Drax now expects capital investment in 2023 to be in the range of £520-580 million (was £570-630 million).
Capital Returns and Share Buyback Programme
In line with its capital allocation policy and reflecting (a) a strong net debt to Adjusted EBITDA position, (b) the revised timing of UK BECCS investment and (c) the mitigation of equity dilution associated with the vesting of share schemes
(7)
, the Group plans to return up to £150 million to shareholders via a share buyback programme. The programme is expected to commence in Q2 2023 and be completed by the end of 2023.
The programme is not expected to have any impact on the Group’s medium and long-term growth plans which continues to include UK BECCS, US BECCS, pellet plant and pumped storage hydro expansion.
The Group remains committed to its current capital allocation policy, which remains unchanged and, beyond the current buyback programme, will continue to assess its capital requirements in line with the current policy.
Other
Drax will host a Capital Markets Day on 23 May 2023, updating on its plans for growth with a focus on BECCS.
Drax will report its half year results on 27 July 2023.

As of 21 April 2023, analyst consensus for 2023 Adjusted EBITDA was £1,156 million, with a range of £1,100 – 1,200 million. The details of this company collected consensus are displayed on the Group’s website.
https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Company_Collected_Consensus_April_2023.pdf
Includes structured power sales in 2023 and 2024 (forward gas sales as a proxy for forward power), transacted for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward sales from ROC units and highly correlated to forward power prices. 2024: 1.1TWh, 2025: 0.8TWh, presented net of cost of closing out gas positions at maturity and replacing with forward power sales.
Typical estimated annual biomass generation from ROC and CfD units c.13-14TWh based on estimated biomass availability, incrementally lower in 2023 due to major planned outages on two ROC units, resulting in lower ROC cap versus 2022.
2023 includes limited forward selling of pumped storage generation resulting in higher captured prices but lower system support availability.
Biomass is the only large-scale source of dispatchable, renewable electricity and Drax power station in Yorkshire is the largest provider of secure supply in the UK’s electricity system. Its renewable biomass generation provides 2.6GW of electricity, representing c.4% of the UK’s dispatchable capacity and supplies millions of homes and businesses with dispatchable, reliable power. BECCS at Drax Power Station is expected to be one of the world’s biggest engineered carbon removal projects, permanently removing 8Mt of CO
2
from the atmosphere every year by 2030. The project would see the addition of post combustion carbon capture to two of the existing biomass units, using sustainable biomass and technology from Drax’s technology partner, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Captured CO
2
would be transported and permanently stored by the Group’s partners in the East Coast Cluster.
Vivid Economics
concluded that it could deliver £370 million of economic benefit for the UK during construction, creating and supporting more than 10,000 jobs during peak construction. Recent
Baringa research
also demonstrates that Drax is the UK’s largest source of energy security and will continue to play a vital role in the UK security of supply in to the late 2020s. Drax aims to source 80% of materials and services for the project from British businesses and is also working with British Steel to explore opportunities for its UK production facilities to supply a proportion of the steel needed for BECCS.
Of the total share options outstanding as at 31 March 2023 (18.6 million), an aggregate number of approximately 9.4 million are expected to vest in 2023 under the Company’s various share plans. This includes approximately 6.8 million under the all-UK employee Sharesave Plan which matures in June 2023 when the three-year savings contract period concludes for approximately 900 participating employees. More information on outstanding awards and associated share-based payments can be found in note 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022.

Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO
“Drax delivered a strong performance in 2022, and played a significant role in ensuring security of supply during a challenging year for the UK’s energy system.
“Our renewable generation – biomass, hydro and pumped storage – are a major source of power in the UK and during periods of peak demand when there was low wind and solar power, these assets collectively supplied up to 70% of the UK’s renewable power in certain periods.
“We believe that BECCS can become a world-leading solution for large-scale high-quality carbon removals and we are seeing increasing global policy support for its delivery.
“Drax stands ready to invest billions of pounds in the development of this technology and, following the introduction of the US Inflation Reduction Act, we are increasingly excited about the opportunities to deploy BECCS in the US. In response, the UK Government should accelerate its policy support for BECCS to make the UK a world leader in carbon removals, while attracting investment and delivering its net zero targets.
“Drax is a growing international business with strong cash returns which we are reinvesting to produce more renewable energy and deliver carbon removals while reducing our own carbon emissions. We aim to be at the heart of the energy transition, creating the jobs, renewable power and large-scale carbon removals that the world needs.”

Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner said:
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO
“Drax plays a critical role in supporting the UK energy system, generating more renewable power by output than any other company. During the difficult winter ahead, we will continue to optimise our biomass operations to ensure that more renewable power is available, when the country needs it most.
“As governments around the world increasingly look to introduce supportive policies for carbon removals, Drax is considering more exciting global opportunities for deployment of BECCS, advancing our ambition to be a leader in this critical technology.
“Drax is a growing, international business at the heart of the green energy transition and we are accelerating our plans to invest billions of pounds in critical renewable energy and carbon removal technologies which could create thousands of jobs and generate the secure, renewable power that this planet urgently needs.”
Pellets Production
The Group’s sustainable biomass pellet business has continued to support efforts to optimise biomass power generation and security of supply in the UK at times of higher demand this winter.
As outlined at the Group’s half year results, in July 2022, there has been an incremental increase in costs in North America, primarily in transportation and utility costs. These cost increases have continued in the second half of 2022 and taken together with costs incurred in providing supply-side flexibility, production costs for the business are expected to be higher in 2022 and 2023. These increased costs have been considered in an adjusted transfer price, which was implemented in the second half of the 2022.
Drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce the cost of biomass but will balance this against the need to optimise its supply chain to deliver value for the Group.
In the second half of 2022, Drax commissioned a second 40kt satellite plant at Russellville (Arkansas) and in August 2022, Drax acquired a 90kt pellet plant in Princeton (British Columbia) from Princeton Standard Pellet Corporation. In addition, following commissioning in the first half of 2022 both the Demopolis (Alabama) and Leola (Arkansas) pellet plants have continued to work towards full production and these four plants combined will add over 500kt of full production capacity.
Investment in new production capacity
Drax has taken a Final Investment Decision (FID) to invest in two new pellet production projects – a 450kt new-build pellet plant at Longview (Washington State), including the development of a new port facility at this location, and a 130kt expansion of its Aliceville site (Alabama). The combined investment in these three projects is expected to be in the region of $300 million, inclusive of the effect of inflation on construction costs.
The development of the new plant at Longview will provide the Group with access to a new fibre basket and Drax will also develop port infrastructure at the Port of Longview, adding a fifth port to the Group’s North American supply chain, with the opportunity to consolidate additional capacity in the future. The US Pacific North-West will be the Group’s fourth major fibre basket alongside; the US South; British Columbia; and Alberta. The new facility is expected to support further diversification of the Group’s fibre sourcing production and export capacity, supporting sales into Asian and European markets, as well as own-use.
The Longview plant will be located next to the Port of Longview, removing the need for rail or road transport of pellets, significantly reducing transport time, cost and carbon emissions.
The plant and port are expected to begin commissioning in 2025.
The Aliceville expansion includes upgrades to existing systems as well as new truck dumps and pelletiser units which will allow for an increase in the amount of sawmill residuals processed. The additional capacity is expected to begin commissioning in 2024.
Generation
The Group’s biomass, pumped storage and hydro assets have continued to support UK security of supply, providing power system stability at a time of higher gas prices and volatility on the power system.
Drax has continued to optimise biomass generation across all four biomass units (ROC and CfD), maximising generation in the winter, based on system need and sustainable biomass supply.
In October 2022, due to a fall in gas prices and a consequential fall in short-term power prices, Drax bought back certain existing forward sold power sales for 2022 on its ROC units. As a result, Drax has taken steps to reprofile and optimise biomass supplies between own-use and third-party supply.
The Group’s pumped storage and hydro assets have performed strongly in the second half of 2022, providing a wide range of services to the system operator in support of system stability and renewable electricity.
Generation contracted power sales
As at 8 December 2022, Drax had 28.3TWh of contracted power sales between 2022 and 2024 on its ROC and hydro generation assets at an average price of £135.8/MWh, with a further 1.4TWh equivalent of gas sales (transacted for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward sales from ROC units and highly correlated to forward power prices) plus additional sales under the CfD mechanism.

Generation biomass costs
Over the past 12 months the cost of biomass in the European spot market has increased significantly, with cargoes trading at over three times their historic average.
Reflecting higher production costs in its own supply chain, those of third parties and higher spot market prices, Drax has incurred additional costs in the second half of 2022, securing biomass to support its reliable and dispatchable generation. Accordingly, the Group currently expects its all-in contracted cost of biomass for the UK generation business to be over £100/MWh in 2023. This is above the historic average, in part reflecting increased transportation and fuel costs associated with higher energy costs, inflation and the lower value of Sterling captured in the Group’s foreign exchange hedges.
These factors, alongside the Electricity Generators Levy (EGL) (see note below), could make generation at certain times less economic and is expected to restrict the Group’s purchase of additional biomass cargoes at spot prices.
Coal
In July 2022, at the request of the UK Government, Drax entered into an agreement with National Grid, to provide a “winter contingency” service to support the UK power system via its legacy coal units.
The units will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and will only operate if, and when, instructed to do so by National Grid. To date National Grid has not instructed the units to run, other than for testing. The contract, which covers the period October 2022 to March 2023, provides Drax with a fixed fee for the provision of the units with National Grid remunerating Drax for costs, including the coal and carbon associated with any generation.
Drax’s decision, in 2020, to end coal generation supports the Group’s purpose of enabling a zero-carbon, lower-cost energy future and the transition to a flexible, renewable generation model. This has led to a c.99% reduction in the Group’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions since 2012 and enabled Drax to become the UK’s largest source of renewable electricity by output.
Full year expectations
Reflecting these factors, and the strong pumped storage and hydro performance in the second half of 2022, Drax now expects that full year Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
for 2022 will be slightly above the top of the range of analyst expectations
(2)
, subject to continued good operational performance and logistics for the remainder of the year.
The power sales reflected in the Generation business’s contracted power sales book includes some exchange traded contracts, with higher power prices resulting in an increase in collateral payments on these contracts in 2022. Inclusive of these temporary cash outflows the Group continues to expect net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
to be significantly below 2x at the end of 2022.
Electricity Generators Levy
In November 2022, the UK Government announced a windfall tax on renewable and low-carbon generators, the EGL.
The EGL, which is expected to be implemented from 1 January 2023, represents a levy on power sales above a threshold and would apply to Drax’s three biomass units operating under the Renewable Obligation scheme and its run of river hydro operations, but does not include the sale of ROCs. Drax’s CfD biomass unit is exempt, along with Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station and coal generation.
Through November and December Drax has engaged with the UK Government regarding the precise details of the EGL, including UK investment allowances and the treatment of costs for dispatchable generators. Drax notes the UK Government’s reference to the potential for cost adjustments in its EGL technical note published in November 2022. Drax anticipates an update from Government on these issues shortly.
Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) – UK
Drax has continued to commit development expenditure into its Drax Power Station BECCS project, including continuing a Front-End Engineering Design study.
The project would see the addition of post combustion Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to two of the existing biomass units, using sustainable biomass and adapting a proven technical solution from Drax technology partner, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. By 2030 the project aims to permanently remove 8Mt of CO
2
per annum from the atmosphere. In doing so Drax Power Station aims to become one of the largest sources of Carbon Dioxide Removals (negative CO
2
) in the world.
The UK Government recognises the important role which BECCS has to play in delivering net zero, requiring at least 5Mt of CO
2
removals per annum from BECCS and other engineered Greenhouse Gas Removal technologies by 2030.
In August 2022, the UK Government published a Power-BECCS business model consultation which set a viable investment framework based on a CfD mechanism for both power generation and negative emission production. In addition, the UK Government also set out the timeframe for the selection of “Track 1” Power-BECCS projects, stating that shortlisted projects could be confirmed from December 2022 with draft heads of terms for the contracts in the first half of 2023. “Track 1” projects are expected to commission in the mid-2020s and along with expected clarity on the financial model, this supports Drax’s aim to take a FID in 2024 and commission a first unit in 2027, with a second by 2030.
The six-month extension of coal unit availability to March 2023 is not expected to impact the timing of a FID or intended commissioning date for the project. Site preparation works for BECCS are ongoing and will continue following formal closure of the coal units in March 2023 on conclusion of the contract with National Grid (see above).
BECCS – North America
Drax aims to realise its ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 primarily through the development of BECCS, including the development of BECCS globally.
To realise these opportunities, the Group is progressing a number of work streams including regulation and policy, technology, fibre sourcing, logistics and commercial.
Over the course of the year, the Group has made good progress towards its ambition to deliver 4Mt per annum of CDRs from new-build BECCS outside of the UK by 2030, with a primary focus on North America.
Opportunities under consideration include two new-build 300MW BECCS power units each capable of producing 2TWh of renewable electricity from sustainable biomass and each capturing over 2Mt of CO
2
per annum. Drax is also developing options for a pellet plant with BECCS and the addition of BECCS to existing generation assets, including coal-to-biomass-to-BECCS.
Key considerations for these opportunities include proximity to sustainable biomass fibre, CCS infrastructure, regulatory support, commercial potential and technology.
Drax is evaluating a range of potential financial models for these projects, which could include long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), long-term CDR offtake agreements and government investment frameworks. As part of the development of these models, in September 2022, Drax announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the world’s biggest carbon removals deal with Respira, a carbon broker. Under the terms of the MoU, Respira will be able to purchase up to 2Mt of CDRs over a five-year period from Drax’s North American BECCS projects.
Regulation and policy development
The regulatory environment for BECCS in the US has continued to develop in 2022, with the inclusion of BECCS as an eligible technology under the Department of Energy climate goals funding scheme and the increase in 45Q support to $85 per tonne of CO
2
captured, under the Inflation Reduction Act. A recent National Renewable Energy Lab report highlights that by 2035, the US could need c.100Mt of negative emissions from BECCS to offset remaining carbon emissions in the power sector.
In addition, recent State level developments in Louisiana and California have both been supportive of the development of BECCS. The Louisiana Congress approved a bill that classifies biomass as carbon neutral and BECCS as carbon negative. Similarly, California’s net zero strategy identifies BECCS as a critical tool in the delivery of their climate targets. The California Air Resources Board, which is responsible for climate policy, has stated its intention to deploy 75Mt of carbon removals, including BECCS, by 2045.
Potential for significant growth in CDRs
Research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s leading authority on climate science, states that CDR methods, including BECCS, are needed to mitigate residual emissions and keep the world on a pathway to limit warming to 1.5
o
c.
All the illustrative mitigation pathways assessed in the IPCC’s latest report use significant volumes of CDRs, and specifically BECCS as a key tool for mitigating climate change. The IPCC believes that globally between 0.5 and 9.5 billion tonnes of CDRs via BECCS will be required and the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment estimate that the CDR market could be worth over a trillion dollars by 2050.
Drax sees significant growth opportunities linked to BECCS in North America and in order to progress these opportunities in 2023, expects to invest in development expenditure in the region of £30 million with a view to progressing these opportunities to a FID. Drax expects to update on progress with these opportunities in the first half of 2023.

Biomass Sustainability
Delivering positive outcomes for people, climate and nature are at the core of Drax’s business model and ensuring that Drax only uses biomass which is sourced sustainably is central to this ambition.
Biomass – when sustainably sourced – supports good forestry, is a renewable source of energy, and an important part of both UK and international renewable energy policy.
Drax sources its biomass from well-established forestry markets in the US and Canada as well as Europe. The main output from these markets is sawlogs, which are processed for use in construction and manufacturing, such as house building. When used in this way, these materials represent a source of long-term carbon storage and when the forest regenerates or is replanted these growing trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere.
Drax supports these forest economies by providing incremental secondary revenues to forest landowners through the purchase of material which is not merchantable to a sawmill, such as bark, branches, low-grade wood and woody material from forest management activities (thinning), in addition to purchasing sawmill residues from sawmills. These materials often have limited alternative uses. In some instances, where there would otherwise be no demand for these materials, they are burned to reduce the risk of wildfire, the spread of disease and to allow the forest to be replanted – this is especially prevalent in Canada.
In the US South, the periodic thinning of a forest helps improve the size and quality of sawlogs when the trees reach maturity, the economic value of the timber produced and the carbon absorbed and stored, as well as forest health and biodiversity. If forests were not thinned, the revenue from sawlogs would be reduced and landowners may consider other uses for their land, such as agricultural crops and livestock farming. The management of forestland to produce sawlogs ensures forests are growing vigorously, absorbing carbon, and forests remain a carbon sink.
Forests in the areas where Drax sources material are subject to national and regional regulation and typically supported by, and independently monitored for compliance by, forest certification schemes such as: the Forestry Stewardship Council
®
(FSC)
(3)
, Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).
Drax supplements this regulation through its own biomass sourcing policy and checks of its supply chain, with third party verification under the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP).
Other
In December 2022 Drax agreed a new £200 million credit facility with banks within its lending group. The facility provides an additional source of liquidity to the Group’s undrawn £300 million revolving credit facility, over the next 12 months.
Drax will report its full year results on 23 February 2023.

Drax CEO, Will Gardiner [click to view/download]
Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:
“As the UK’s largest generator of renewable power by output, Drax plays a critical role in supporting the country’s security of supply. We are accelerating our investment in renewable generation, having recently submitted planning applications for the development of BECCS at Drax Power Station and for the expansion of Cruachan Pumped Storage Power Station.
“As a leading producer of sustainable wood pellets we continue to invest in expanding our pellet production in order to supply the rising global demand for renewable power generated from biomass. We have commissioned new biomass pellet production plants in the US South and expect to take a final investment decision on up to 500,000 tonnes of additional capacity before the end of the year.
“As carbon removals become an increasingly urgent part of the global route to Net Zero, we are also making very encouraging progress towards delivering BECCS in North America and progressing with site selection, government engagement and technology development.
“In the UK and US we have plans to invest £3 billion in renewables that would create thousands of green jobs in communities that need them, underlining our position as a growing, international business at the heart of the green energy transition.”

Drax CEO, Will Gardiner [click to view/download]
Drax CEO Will Gardiner said:
“In the first quarter of 2022 we delivered a strong system support performance as our reliable, renewable electricity continued to support UK energy security and helped to keep the lights on for millions of British homes and businesses.
“We advanced our strategy to increase biomass pellet production, with another 400Kt of capacity commissioned from two new pellet plants in the US. We also progressed the engineering design work for our UK BECCS project, which will deliver negative emissions for the UK and pioneer BECCS technology at scale. BECCS is a vital carbon removals technology that the UN’s IPCC says is needed globally to achieve net zero.
“With the right government support, Drax is ready to invest £3bn this decade in delivering vital renewable energy technologies including BECCS, a carbon removal technology that is cost-effective but also the only one that generates reliable, renewable electricity while removing millions of tonnes of CO
2
from the atmosphere.”
Pellet Production
In April 2022, the Group completed the commissioning of its 360Kt plant at Demopolis, Alabama and its 40Kt satellite plant in Leola, Arkansas. The Group is also currently constructing a second 40Kt satellite plant at Russellville, Arkansas, allowing greater utilisation of lower cost sawmill residues whilst leveraging on existing infrastructure in the US southeast.
Leola satellite plant under construction [February 2022]
Once at full capacity these developments, alongside incremental capacity expansions at existing sites, will increase nameplate production capacity to around 5Mt p.a. Over 2Mt p.a. of production is contracted to high-quality third-parties under long-term contracts, with the balance available to Drax to fulfil its own-use requirements.
Strong demand for forest products in construction and manufacturing markets continues to support good fibre residue availability with no material change in fibre cost. Drax notes an incremental increase in transportation costs in North America principally related to truck driver shortages and haulage costs.
The Group continues to target a Final Investment Decision (FID) on up to 1Mt of new capacity in 2022 as part of its plans to increase total pellet production capacity to 8Mt by 2030.
Generation
In the UK, the Group’s biomass, hydro and pumped storage assets have continued to play an important role in security of supply, providing stability to the UK power system at a time when higher gas prices and interconnector availability have placed the system under increased pressure.
To maximise renewable output at times of high demand, the Group is continuing to optimise biomass generation across all four biomass units at Drax Power Station, contributing to an increase in average achieved power prices.
The current power price environment increases the importance of appropriate investment to ensure good operational performance and availability, and, in March and April 2022, two biomass units underwent planned maintenance outages. The unit’s contracted positions in this period were bought back and the generation reprofiled, with no net change in output over the ROC compliance period.
Drax’s two legacy coal units were called into the Balancing Mechanism by the system operator in January for limited operations to support security of supply. These short-term measures helped to stabilise the power system during periods of system stress and did not result in any material increase in the Group’s total carbon emissions.
Drax continues to expect to formally close these two legacy coal units following the fulfilment of their Capacity Market obligations in September 2022 but remains committed to supporting security of supply in the UK. Drax has recently been asked by the UK Government to consider options for a limited extension of its coal operations and this remains under review.
Generation contracted power sales
The Group has continued to add to its forward power sales book. As at 22 April 2022, Drax had 22.2TWh of power hedged between 2022 and 2024 on its ROC and hydro generation assets at an average price of £78.1/MWh.
A further 1.8TWh equivalent of gas hedges have been contracted in 2023 and 2024 for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward power sales from the ROC units. These contracts are highly correlated to forward power prices.
Due to the optimisation of biomass generation in 2022, to support increased generation at times of high demand, CfD output will be lower than historic average, with ROC unit output higher.

War in Ukraine

Drax previously sourced a small volume of Russian and Belarussian biomass, which it has now removed from its supply chain. The biomass that Drax uses comes from stable, sustainable markets in North America and Europe and is sourced under long-term fixed formula contracts.
The removal of Russian biomass cargoes from European supply chains has led to higher prices and lower availability in the small European spot market, adding incremental costs and limiting the potential to source additional cargoes to support incrementally higher levels of generation in 2022.
Full year expectations
Reflecting these factors, the Group now expects that full year Adjusted EBITDA for 2022 will be around the top of the range of analyst expectations, subject to continued good operational performance.
Reflecting the improved outlook for Adjusted EBITDA the Group expects net debt to Adjusted EBITDA to be significantly below 2x by the end of 2022.
Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)
During 2022 Drax is investing incremental capital expenditure and development expenditure into BECCS, including continuing a Front-End Engineering Design study at Drax Power Station.
Drax continues to expect to take a FID in 2024 and expects the UK Government to set out the process for selection and support for individual BECCS projects, such as BECCS at Drax Power Station, during 2022.
The development of BECCS in the UK is supported by the Group’s plans to invest in the expansion of its biomass pellet production to deliver security of supply for the biomass volumes required for BECCS, which are expected to be underpinned by long-term contracts reflecting the market price of biomass.
The Group is also continuing to develop options to deliver 4Mt of negative CO
2
emissions each year from new-build BECCS outside of the UK by 2030 and is currently developing models for North American and European markets.

In March 2022, Drax signed a development agreement with EPC contractor Mytilineos for the development of three Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) developments.
At the full year results in February 2022 Drax noted it would invest up to £100 million in 2022 to fulfil obligations under the Capacity Market agreements, but was continuing to evaluate options for its OCGT developments, including their sale. Drax expects that any capital invested in 2022 will be recovered in the event of a sale.

A letter from Drax CEO, Will Gardiner, on the current situation in Ukraine
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
3 March 2022
Opinion

The situation in Ukraine is increasingly worrying and I want to share my view of what we are doing as a company.
I absolutely condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I am heartened by the resolute stance of NATO, the EU and many companies and stand behind and recognise the bravery of the Ukrainian people.
Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people and our first concern is for their safety.
In regards to our biomass, we source the vast amount from North America. We have ceased the supply of the small percentage – less than 1% – of Russian biomass we use and are working with our suppliers and customers, to identify any further links to Russia.
We have systems in place and are working closely with the UK Government and other critical national infrastructure organisations to manage security threats arising from this conflict and to maintain our security of supply to all our customers.
Thank you
Will Gardiner
CEO, Drax
