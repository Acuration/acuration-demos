14 november 2018 sustainable bioenergy from arcticcircle snowladen pines to damp equatorial rainforests to dry australian scrublands the planet is home to an incredibly diverse range of forested environments and while each region is very different almost all have been impacted by humans the effects of this have not always been positive and despite decades spent raising awareness of the importance of forests for the health of the world some regions forests remain in decline africa and asia in particular have seen a decline in forest cover although each year sees less lost over the past few decades but there are areas where the impact of humans is in fact having a positive effect this is largely thanks to the introduction of modern sustainable forestry practices  which have incentivised growth and helped bringing a variety of environmental and economic benefits to different regions around the world a recent report by p√∂yry management consulting for drax has looked in depth at these benefits and in particular four regions where different approaches to sustainable forestry have brought a positive impact to people industry and the environment alike more than a testament to the beneficial effects sustainable forest management can have it shows that while the tactics methods and environments may differ their positive effects are universal us south turning around old practices weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama the forests of the us south from virginia and kentucky to texas and florida have a long history of misuse both indigenous people and later european settlers used disruptive techniques such as large scale burning and removed valuable mature hardwood on a mass scale often leaving areas to naturally regenerate that largely changed in the mid20 th century however when forestry became moreintensive and the need for sustaining a supply of quality timber grew more apparent the introduction of processes such as thinning and managed regeneration helped usher in a more responsible approach that has led to growth in both the forestry industry and forest coverage between 2010 and 2015 there was 50 more growth in the volume of forests than was removed from harvesting more than just growing forest area this means an increase in the amount of carbon being absorbed and stored from the atmosphere charts us south historical increment to removal and us south above ground carbon 19571997  in the us south around 86 of forest land is privately owned by either corporations or individuals but the economics of sustainable forestry practices has encouraged the overall growth in forests even with limited regulations on land use in the area in addition to the native birds and mammals that depend on sustainably managed forests in the region more than 200000 people were employed by the industry in 2016 making it a vital part of local rural economies finland a centurylong history of sustainable practices asikkala finland by taneli lahtinen on unsplash wood and wood products play an important role in finnish culture from its famous saunas to the worlds largest wooden church  multinational phone brand nokia even started life in in 1865 as a wood pulp mill a high demand for wood as a commercial product meant that a few centuries ago finlands forests where in a state of heavy degradation but starting as far back as 100 years ago sustainable practices such as planned harvesting and regeneration legislation were introduced the results are significant there is now more wood in finnish forests today than at the turn of the century the majority 61 of finlands forests are privately owned with the state owning 25 companies only owning 8 and 5 held by other owners many large companies however offer services such as forestry work wood sales drainage and tax services to private owners this collaboration between sectors allows for best practices to be easily shared and quickly become widespread as a result forest stocks have increased from 1500 million m 3 in 1970 to 2500 million m 3 in 2015 even while overall forest area has remained largely the same it highlights the effectiveness of legislation guidelines and certification in regenerating forests chart forest growing stock in finland  uk incentivising growth and diversity the uk was once thought to be 30 covered by forestland but by the turn of the last century forests made up less than 5 today however this has grown to as much as 13 owing largely to regulation and incentives chart forest area in uk by country and type over previous 10 years   as far back as the 1700s the uk had become dependent on wood imports from new england in the us and the baltics in europe following the first world war the forestry commission was established primarily to try prevent timber shortages during times of war but it went on to drive a boom in new plantations across the country and introduce grant schemes for private plantations chart top 10 net importers of wood products  in 2017 the uk was the worlds second largest net importer of wood products a problem with this afforestation however was that it mostly consisted of monocultures of exotic species that were well suited to the climate rather than regenerating native species the modern uk forestry standard is countering this practice by putting in place requirements for afforestation and replanting that protect biodiversity landscape and climate change as well as soil and water forest in argyll and bute some 73 of the uks forests are privately owned which includes historic estates and charitable trusts as well as investment funds despite the increasing forest area in the uk over the past century imports of both wood and wood products still make up almost 80 of the uks wood needs the upside for the region is increased recreational and preserved historic forests uruguay sustainably managing rapid expansion uruguays forestry industry is much younger than the likes of the us south or finland but offers an example of a how to rapidly expand the sector while preserving its old growth or primary forests eucalyptus trees in uruguayan working forest in 1975 the country introduced incentives such as tax waivers on forest operations and later subsidies for new plantations as well as tax duties for timber exports the result was a surge in eucalyptus plantations which grew from 25000 hectares in 1987 to more than 1 million hectares in 2015 largely driven by interest from international companies and investors these plantations are currently managed sustainably with growth still exceeding removals eucalyptus is not a native species to uruguay but by allowing international investors to plant on land deemed of no agricultural or environmental value the country has seen enormous afforestation while 800000 hectares of native forests remain the economic impact is similarly impressive today forestry directly employees 15000 people in uruguay  55 in forestry and logging and 45 in wood processing the skills required to work in newly constructed mills has led to several courses in forestry and wood science at uruguayan universities chart total forest area development in uruguay these four countries take different approaches to forestry but what they have in common is forest growth exceeding that removed through harvesting it points to sustainable forest management as a means of growing forests and in turn carbon extracted and stored read the full report by dr hannes lechner and dr jack lonsdale assessment of the benefits of sustainable forest
