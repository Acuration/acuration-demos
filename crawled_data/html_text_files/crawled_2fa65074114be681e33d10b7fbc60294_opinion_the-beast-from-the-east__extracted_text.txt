beast from the east in march the freezing weather affected britains transport networks industry and schools but how did it impact the countrys energy system iain staffell imperial college london 18 april 2018 opinion thursday 1 march was the coldest spring day on record averaging 38c the six days from 26 february to 3 march highlighted in blue were the coldest britain has been since christmas 2010 this pushed electricity demand up 10 as people used more electric heating to keep warm the evening peak demand on 1 march was the highest in three years and so was not stretching the system to its limits electricity prices rose to five times the average for the quarter they peaked at 990 per megawatt hour mwh for half an hour and also fell to 150 per mwh as the market became volatile coal generation surged for the weeks surrounding the cold spell not because more output from conventional plants was needed but rising gas prices made it more economical to burn than gas total generation from fossil fuels remained around 2025 gw biomass and hydro ran solidly throughout the cold spell wind output was particularly high when it was most needed ranging from 118 to 138 gw during 1 march whilst wind certainly helped the lights would not have gone off without it as up to 19 gw of spare gas capacity was available if needed britains links to other countries were not so helpful we exported to france through much of the cold spell french electricity demand is more impacted by temperature than british as more french homes use electric heating looking in more detail at the uks links to other countries britain had been largely importing from france all year but then exported solidly through 2728 february when power prices were higher in france prices remained lower in the netherlands so britain continued importing from them britain and ireland traded power back and forth to help balance their systems on 3 march the eastwest link between north wales and dublin was taken
