daldowie how scotlands sewage becomes renewable energy 17 december 2019 sustainable bioenergy from traffic pollution to household recycling and access to green spaces cities and governments around the world are facing increasing pressure to find solutions to a growing number of urban problems one of these which doesnt come up often is sewage but every day 11 billion litres of wastewater from drains homes businesses and farms is collected across the uk and treated to be made safe to reenter the water system although for the most part sewage treatment occurs beyond the view of the general population it is something that needs constant work if not dealt with properly it can have a significant effect on the surrounding environment of the many ways that sewage is dealt with perhaps one of the most innovative is to use it for energy daldowie fuel plant near glasgow is one such place which processes sewage sludge taken from the surrounding area into a renewable low carbon form of biomass fuel the solution in the sludge in operation since 2002 daldowie was acquired by drax at the end of 2018 and today processes 35 of all of scotlands wastewater sludge into dry lowodour fuel pellets we receive as much as 25 million tonnes of sludge from scottish water a year says plant manager dylan hughes who leads a team of 71 employees and produce up to 50000 tonnes of pellets making it one of the largest plants of this kind in the world we have to provide a 247 365day service that is built into the infrastructure of glasgow he explains this sludge processed at daldowie is not raw wastewater which is treated in scottish waters sewage facilities instead the sludge is a semisolid byproduct of the treatment process made of the organic material and bacteria that ends up in wastewater from homes and industry from drains sinks and yes toilets until the late 1990s one of great britains main methods of disposing of sludge was by dumping it in the ocean  after this practice was banned cities where left to figure out ways of dealing with the sludge using sludge as a form of fertiliser or burying it in landfills was an already established practice however scottishpower instead decided to investigate the potential of turning sludge into a dry fuel pellet that could offer a renewable low carbon substitute to coal at its power plants cement manufacturing fuel kilns daldowie was originally designed to supply fuel to methil power station near fife which ran on coal slurry however it was decommissioned in 2000 before daldowie could begin delivering fuel to it this led the plant to instead provide fuel to longannet power station where it was used to reduce its dependency on coal before it too was decommissioned in 2016 today daldowies pellets are used in england and scotland to fuel kilns in cement manufacturing  an industry attempting to navigate the same decarbonisation challenges as power generation which daldowie was established to tackle though the end use of the fuel has changed the process through which the facility transforms the waste remains the same the process of turning waste to energy the process starts after wastewater from glasgow and the surrounding area is treated by scottish water daldowie receives 90 of the sludge it processes directly via a pressurised sludge pipeline the rest is delivered via sealed tanker lorries when it arrives at daldowie the sludge is 98 water and 2 solid organic waste it is first screened for debris before entering the plants 12 centrifuges which act as massive spinning driers these separate water from what is known as sludge cake the semisolid part of the sludge feedstock this separated water is then cleaned so it can either be used elsewhere in the process or released into the nearby river clyde membrane tank at daldowie fuel plant the remaining sludge cake is dried using air heated to 450 degrees celsius using natural gas this also reduces germs through pasteurisation while the rotating drums give the fuel granules their pellet shape once dried the pellets are cooled and inspected for quality any material not up to necessary standards is fed back into the system for reprocessing fuel that does meet the right standards is cooled further and then stored in silos where possible throughout the process hot air and water are reused helping keep costs down and ensuring the process is efficient nearly two decades into its life very little has had to change in the way the plant operates thanks to these efficiencies but while the process of turning the waste sludge into energy remains largely unchanged there is as always room for new innovation  improving for the future of the site daldowie is contracted to recycle wastewater for scottish water until 2026 to ensure the plant is still as efficient and effective as possible the daldowie team is undertaking a technical investigation of what if anything would be needed to extend the life of the plant for at least an additional five years the plant operates under the highest environmental and health and safety standards but further improvements are being planned in 2020 hughes explains we are upgrading the odour control equipment to ensure we have a best in class level of performance the control room and plant operators at daldowie draxs scotland office in glasgow is working with other industrial facilities in the area as well as the scottish environmental protection agency sepa to work with the local community we are putting in place a series of engagement events including plant tours from early 2020 offering local residents an opportunity to meet the local team and discuss the planned improvements there are also other potential uses for the fuel including use at drax power station as the pellets are categorised as waste and biomass it would require a new license for the power station however at a time when there is a greater need to reduce the impact of human waste and diversify the countrys energy it would add another source of renewable fuel to great britains electricity mix that could help to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future tags biomass energy  technology  power station

the revised contractual arrangements are designed to mitigate the risk to 2019 capacity payments arising from the recent suspension of the capacity market commenting on todays announcement will gardiner chief executive officer of drax group said the strategic merits of this acquisition remain unchanged and the board believes there is a compelling logic in our move to add further flexible sources of power to our offering which will accelerate our ability to deliver our strategic vision of a lowercarbon lowercost energy future for the uk the capacity market is a central pillar of the uks energy policy and ensures security of supply while minimising costs to consumers the government has stated it is working closely with the european commission to aid their investigation and to reinstate the full capacity market regime including existing agreements as soon as possible to mitigate the risk that capacity payments take time to be restored we have agreed revised terms which provide protection in 2019 beyond 2019 while reinstatement of the capacity market is the most likely outcome we considered other outcomes the more plausible of which would still deliver returns in excess of draxs weighted average cost of capital the acquisition makes financial and strategic sense delivering material value to our shareholders through longterm earnings and attractive returns capacity market on 15 november 2018 the general court of the european union issued a ruling annulling the european commissions 2014 decision not to undertake a more detailed investigation of the uk governments scheme establishing the capacity market the ruling the ruling imposed a standstill period while the european commission completes a further state aid investigation into the capacity market payments to generators scheduled under existing capacity agreements and the holding of future capacity auctions have been suspended cruachan power station on loch awe argylle and bute contracted capacity payments make up a significant proportion of the earnings of the portfolio for the period from 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2022 the cruachan pumped storage hydro asset has contracted capacity payments of 29 million the galloway runofriver hydro assets have contracted capacity payments of 5m million and the combined cycle gas turbine assets have contracted capacity payments of 122 million in aggregate drax notes the uk governments statement in response to the ruling that it is working closely with the european commission to aid their investigation and to seek a timely state aid reapproval decision for the capacity market the uk government also confirmed that the ruling does not change its belief that capacity market auctions are the most appropriate way to deliver secure electricity supplies at the lowest cost and that the ruling was decided on procedural grounds and did not constitute a direct challenge to the design of the capacity market itself lanark hydro scheme lanarkshire based on the information available and legal advice it has received drax believes that the most likely outcome is that the european commission will reapprove the existing capacity market in its current or a broadly similar form despite the above drax recognises there is some uncertainty whether the contracted capacity payments for the 201819 capacity market year which are currently suspended will be paid by the uk government to mitigate the risk that these payments are not received for the 201819 capacity market year drax has agreed with iberdrola certain amendments to the agreement signed on 16 october 2018 arrangements with iberdrola in respect of 201819 capacity payments drax and iberdrola have agreed a risk sharing mechanism in respect of capacity payments for the period 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2019 worth 36 million if less than 100 of these payments are received and the gross profit of the portfolio for the full year 2019 the 2019 gross profit is lower than expected drax will receive a payment from iberdrola of up to 26 million the mechanism also gives iberdrola the opportunity to earn an upside of up to 26 million if less than 100 of these payments are received but the portfolio performs better than expected in 2019 1  under these arrangements if less than 100 of these capacity payments are received iberdrola will make a payment to drax if the 2019 gross profit is less than 155 million the payment will be an amount equal to 72 of any shortfall in the 2019 gross profit below 155 million the amount of the payment is capped at the lower of the amount in respect of capacity payments due to the portfolio but not received and 26 million and drax will make a payment to iberdrola if the 2019 gross profit is more than 165 million the payment will be an amount equal to 72 of any amount by which the 2019 gross profit exceeds 165 million the amount of the payment is capped at the lower of the amount in respect of capacity payments due to the portfolio but not received by drax and 26 million a pylon carries electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe in the mountains of the west highlands of scotland if subsequently drax receives any capacity payments in respect of the period 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2019 drax will pay 72 of those amounts to iberdrola capped at the amount paid by iberdrola to drax under the mechanism above drax and iberdrola have agreed that capacity payments due to the portfolio in respect of the period before completion will be passed through to iberdrola any payments pursuant to the arrangements with iberdrola will be cash adjustments to the consideration and not included in ebitda 2  benefits of the acquisition shoreham power station west sussex based on draxs expectations of the position that is most likely to be achieved in relation to the capacity market following the ruling drax believes the acquisition represents an attractive opportunity to create significant value for shareholders and is expected to deliver returns significantly in excess of draxs weighted average cost of capital drax has considered other possible outcomes for the capacity market which are less likely but may ensue and if they did the financial effects of the acquisition may be adversely affected drax believes that if the more plausible of these outcomes were to ensue the returns from the acquisition would still be in excess of the draxs weighted average cost of capital drax has not attempted to quantify the effect if the less plausible of these other outcomes were to ensue  if there were no capacity market or similar mechanism or if significant structural changes were made to the capacity market drax sees these as a remote possibility and notes that in those circumstances it believes the loss or reduction of capacity payments could be mitigated by increases in wholesale power prices the acquisition strengthens draxs ability to pay a growing and sustainable dividend drax remains committed to its capital allocation policy and to its current 50 million share buyback programme with 42 million of shares purchased to date 2019 profit forecast daldowie fuel plant glasgow based on recent power and commodity prices and assuming that all contracted capacity payments are received the portfolio is expected to generate ebitda in 2019 in a range of 90 million to 110 million from gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments rocs 3 and the daldowie energyfromwaste plant if in light of the ruling the contracted capacity payments payable in 2019 in respect of the portfolio are not received or accrued in 2019 the expected ebitda for the portfolio in 2019 would be reduced by up to 47 million from a range of 90 million to 110 million down to a range of 43 million to 63 million before considering mitigating factors drax believes that the arrangements agreed with iberdrola mitigate in economic terms the majority of the risk that those suspended capacity payments will not be paid assuming performance in line with current expectations and if all capacity payments due in 2019 are received before the end of 2019 net debt to ebitda is expected to fall to draxs longterm target of around 2x by the end of 2019 if capacity payments are not received in 2019 net debt to ebitda is expected to fall to around 2x during 2020 drax current trading and 2018 outlook following the ruling 7 million of contracted capacity payments relating to 2018 principally in relation to draxs remaining two coalfired units will not be paid as and when expected taking this into account and following draxs recent good trading performance and assuming continued good operational availability for the remainder of the year draxs full year ebitda outlook remains in line with previous expectations with net debt to ebitda

of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which

drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to
