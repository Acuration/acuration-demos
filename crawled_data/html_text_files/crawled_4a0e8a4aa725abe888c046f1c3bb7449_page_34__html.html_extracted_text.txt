Press Release
Drax employees raise £6,500 for Macmillan Cancer Support
3 October 2019
Press releases

People working at Drax’s offices and power stations across the country baked cakes, or bought them to raise money for the charity, whilst others took part in an annual fun run at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire.
Drax Group Chairman Phil Cox, started the 5km and 10km fun run which 70 employees took part in at the Skylark Nature Reserve next to the power station, near Selby. Each employee donated £1 per kilometre to take part in the event.
Those who opted to run the 10km course faced a climb up local landmark, Barlow Mound, which has views back over the power station, near Selby in North Yorkshire.
Hayley Adamson, Senior Biomass Portfolio Trader, completed the 5km race and was the first woman over the finishing line. She said:
“It’s great to see so many colleagues taking part in the fun run, the atmosphere’s been great – I just wish I’d completed it a bit quicker.”
Drax Group made a £2,000 charitable contribution to support the employees’ national fundraising day taking the total to £6,500 for Macmillan, which provides support and advice to cancer patients and their families.
Contractors working for Drax Power Station’s suppliers Hargreaves and Doosan Babcock also donated £1,200 towards the total raised for Macmillan Cancer Support.
Vicky Bullivant, Drax’s Head of Business Sustainability said:
“This was an outstanding Drax team effort with people right across the Group contributing to the total raised – including our contractors.
“People baked delicious cakes which were sold at a number of our offices and power stations – whilst many more of us enjoyed buying and eating them. If an army marches on its stomach then it’s probably no surprise that quite so many of our colleagues were able to complete the fun run during a morning filled with so much cake!
“We’re proud to have raised £6,500 for Macmillan, supporting the incredible work they do for so many people and we’re looking forward to organising more events over the course of the year to help raise money for charity.”

Editor’s Notes
In January Drax Group completed
the acquisition
of a portfolio of renewable, low-carbon and flexible power stations, in strategic locations across the country – from Scotland to the South East coast. This includes the pumped hydro storage facility in Cruachan and the run-of-river hydro plants in Lanark and Galloway.
Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire is the UK’s largest power station and the country’s biggest renewable electricity generator.
Since converting two thirds of the power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal, it is producing enough renewable electricity for four million households and delivering carbon savings of more than 80%.
If Drax is able to scale up its
successful bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot
project to become the world’s first negative emissions power station, it would be reducing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the same time as producing flexible, renewable power and supporting grid stability.
About Drax
Drax Group’s ambition is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Its 2,600-strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.

New rapid response gas power station approved in Abergelli
19 September 2019
Press releases

The 299MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) power station, on land located at Abergelli Farm, south of Felindre in southern Wales, will be able to go from cold to full load in less than 20 minutes, enabling it to respond quickly to support the grid.
Once operational, it will run for up to an average of 1,500 hours a year, providing flexible, reliable power, when it’s needed most and system support services – contributing to a balanced and cost-effective electricity system, maintaining supplies for up to 150,000 homes.
Andy Koss, CEO Generation at Drax said:
“Securing this approval from the Secretary of State is a crucial step in ensuring development of the new gas generation the UK needs to provide flexible power and system support services to the electricity grid as part of the country’s transition to a low carbon economy.
“Rapid response gas power stations are agile enough to ramp up quickly and support the grid at times of peak demand, making them highly complementary to intermittent renewable sources of power, like wind and solar. Flexible, reliable power stations like this are essential to provide the power Britain’s homes, businesses, transport and infrastructure need.”
Abergelli Power Station will cost up to £90m to build, with around 150 jobs created during the two-year construction phase. It could be generating power as soon as 2022, subject to it securing a capacity market agreement from the government.
Drax applied for a Development Consent Order for Abergelli Power in 2018 with extensive community consultation as part of the planning and consenting process. Drax Group will continue to engage with communities local to the project as the project progresses.

Editor’s Notes
Drax plans to enter Abergelli Power into the next Capacity Market Auction for the period 2022-2023, known as T-3, and 2023-2024, known as T-4.
The Capacity Market Auction is the government’s mechanism for securing enough power generation for the UK at the lowest cost.
The timing of the next auction is expected to take place in early 2020 following the suspension of the UK government’s Capacity Market pending the outcome of a
European Commission investigation
.
The Development Consent Order (DCO) is published on the
National Infrastructure Planning website

EV battery emissions offset by lower carbon electricity system
29 August 2019
Press releases

Research by Imperial College London for
Drax Electric Insights
shows that on average Britain’s EVs emit just one quarter of the CO
2
of conventional petrol and diesel cars – and if the carbon emitted in making their battery is included, the CO
2
emissions are half those of a conventional vehicle:
After just two to three years the carbon emitted in producing the batteries for the most efficient EV models would have been saved.
Smaller EVs with modest battery sizes are better for the environment, whereas the largest luxury EV models could need three times longer to pay back their carbon cost, as manufacturing their large batteries emits as much carbon as three round the world flights.
More CO
2
is emitted in building the battery for premium EV model than from recharging it over a 15-year lifetime.
1: Minimum daily carbon intensity each month 2: Britain’s generation mix during June 30th that delivered electricity for less than 100g of carbon per kWh
The research found that the increasing decarbonisation of our electricity supply linked to the 2050 net-zero carbon target is enabling EVs to become even more environmentally friendly. Britain’s EVs bought today could be emitting just a tenth of the CO
2
from a petrol car in five years’ time.
Electricity generation is decarbonising faster in Britain than anywhere else in the world. Wind, solar, biomass, and hydro supplied 55% of electricity demand on June 30, breaking last year’s record of 48% according to the report.
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London said:
“EVs have real potential to reduce our carbon footprint and help meet our net-zero carbon ambitions – despite some speculation about how clean they really are.
“An electric vehicle in the UK simply cannot be more polluting than its petrol or diesel equivalent – even when taking into account the upfront ‘carbon cost’ of manufacturing their batteries.  The carbon content of Britain’s electricity has halved in recent years and keeps on falling, whereas conventional engine vehicles have very limited scope to reduce emissions over their lifetime
“Any EV bought today could be emitting just a tenth of what a petrol car would in as little as five years’ time, as the electricity it uses to charge comes from an increasingly low-carbon mix.”
Carbon emissions from driving hatchback electric vehicles in Britain
This new analysis coincides with a longer-term consumer shift in how many electric vehicles there are on our roads, as they fast become more mainstream.
There are now well over 200,000 on Britain’s roads, and this number is growing by 30% per year. 1 in 40 cars sold in Britain is now electric, around a third of which are pure battery models, and two thirds are plug-in hybrid.
Britain’s electric vehicle fleet is expected to expand ten-fold over the next five to ten years according to National Grid’s latest Future Energy Scenarios report.
Paul Sheffield, managing director of Drax’s Customer supply businesses Haven Power and Opus Energy, said:
“The electrification of transport is going to be vital if we are to address the climate crisis. We’ve seen first-hand how complex it can be for businesses to switch their fleet vehicles to EVs and have developed a new service to help make the switch easier for them.
“Supplying renewable electricity to businesses is one step towards helping them to be more sustainable – enabling them to decarbonise other aspects of their operations like transportation, will mean they can play a fuller role in the transition to a zero carbon future.”

Notes to Editors
Drax
launched an EV service
for business customers earlier in the year, with SES Water its first customer.
The research
by Imperial College London for Drax Electric Insights shows:
Electric vans are quickly taking off, with over 8,000 sold in Britain to date. Their performance is comparable to small hatchbacks, and they also currently emit around a quarter of the CO
2
of the most popular conventional van, with around 40 g/km. With their 30–40 kWh battery pack included, this rises to just below half the CO
2
of a small Ford Transit.
Small hatchbacks are the cleanest variety of EV to drive as they are small and light.Electric models currently emit around 33 grams of CO
2
per km driven, which is one quarter that of the most popular conventional vehicle, a 2019 Ford Fiesta.  These electric models typically come with a 30-45 kWh battery, which pushes their lifetime emissions up around 60 g/km.  This is still less than half the emissions of a petrol or diesel car.  With the projected changes to the grid mix, this will fall to less than one third of a standard car in just five years’ time.
Luxury saloons and SUV models are much larger and need more energy to move, meaning they have higher emissions than hatchbacks, at 44-54 g/km. This is still just a quarter of the emissions from a comparable conventional car (a top of the range Mercedes S-Class).  The lifetime emissions of these luxury EVs are notably higher though, pushed up by the enormous 90-100 kWh batteries they use to provide a driving range of over 250 miles.  These batteries are responsible for more CO
2
emissions than driving the car over its entire lifetime.

Drax more than doubles its apprentice intake
28 August 2019
Press releases

Twelve are technical apprentices who could go on to become the power generator’s engineers of the future with one further apprentice joining Drax’s system security team, working to ensure the safety of all staff on site. Six will be in mechanical positions, four in electrical and two working in the control and instrumentation teams.
In the first half of 2019, Drax halved its carbon emissions compared to the year before with more than 90% of the power produced being renewable – enough for more than four million households.
This was made possible as a result of the world class innovation and skill of its inhouse engineers who pioneered the conversion of two thirds of the power station near Selby in North Yorkshire, from coal to use sustainable biomass, delivering carbon savings of more than 80%.
Andy Koss, CEO Generation said:
“One of the highlights of my job is welcoming our newest apprentices to Drax each year – these are the people who could be the shining stars of the future, the ones who will help us to develop the new, cutting edge technologies needed to enable our business to continue to grow.
“Supporting ambitious young people to develop their skills is critical to the future success of our business. By helping them to grow and learn, we can ensure that we have the talented workforce our business and the wider Northern Powerhouse region needs to thrive.”
Drax’s technical apprenticeship scheme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside some of the best engineers in the world, who have helped transform the business to become the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
And Drax could go further – by scaling up its successful bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) pilot, it could become the world’s first negative emissions power station. This means it would be reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the same time as producing renewable power – critical to reaching the UK’s net zero carbon ambitions.
This year’s apprentices are aged between 15 and 22 with five from Goole and the rest coming from across Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire.
One of them, Dan Callon, was part of the successful team from Selby College, supported by Drax, which won the Green Power EV race for schools in Hull earlier in the year.
Dan, from Brayton in Selby, said of his new apprenticeship:
“I knew I wanted to work in a hands-on, practical engineering role but didn’t want to go down the academic route. Having opportunities like this at Drax was a really good move for me.”
The 17-year-old added:
“I really enjoyed building and racing the electric car in the Green Power Race which Drax organised – I got to work with some of my friends from Selby College, as well as getting advice from engineers at Drax – in the end we actually won the overall race.
“I’m looking forward to progressing my career with Drax, learning new skills and getting some good experience here.”
Simran Ley, aged 20, has also joined Drax as a technical apprentice. She said:
“I knew I wanted to go down the apprenticeship route as it provides the sort of practical experience you can’t get at university. Drax is well known for its engineering, it made it an obvious choice for me to apply to.”
The Drax Technical Apprenticeship Training Scheme is a four-year programme, and specialises in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation. Drax’s System Security Apprenticeship is a three-year, Level 3 Fire Emergency and Security Systems Apprenticeship, in conjunction with Lincoln College.
Drax offers apprenticeships in engineering disciplines as well as business support areas, such as Finance and Business Administration. All opportunities are advertised on our website.

Notes to Editors
Drax has a longstanding commitment to STEM learning, with around 12,000 educational visits to the power station each year. These range from primary school pupils to degree level students, and all visits are tailored to the level of the visiting school, college or university.
It is also investing to help boost educational skills by working closely with local schools and colleges to encourage STEM learning.
In 2017 Drax welcomed six technical apprentices compared to nine in 2018, and 12 in 2019 with a further system security apprentice, demonstrating its commitment to retaining and developing a skilled workforce.
It has also launched a new apprenticeship scheme at its Scottish power generation sites which it is recruiting to now.

About Drax
Drax Group’s ambition is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Its 2,600-strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricitygeneration assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, basedat Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead ofcoal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largestdecarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan. It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
B2B supply:
Drax owns two B2B energy supply businesses:
Haven Power, based in Ipswich, supplies electricity and energy services to large Industrial and Commercial sector businesses.
Opus Energy, based in Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, provides electricity, energy services and gas to small and medium sized (SME) businesses.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire togenerate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.

Mongolian Ambassador visits Cruachan Power Station
22 August 2019
Press releases

His Excellency Mr Tulga Narkhuu and the Mongolian delegation were interested to learn more about Cruachan as Mongolia begins its transition to a low carbon energy system.
The Mongolian authorities recognise the value of pumped hydro, and wanted to see it in action at Cruachan. At present the country relies heavily on coal-fired power stations for its electricity but is actively decarbonising  and transitioning towards using more renewables like wind and solar.
Mongolia has a wealth of natural resources including mountainous terrain – ideal for the development of both run-of-river hydro power stations and pumped storage hydro facilities.
Cruachan is one of only four pumped storage hydro stations in the UK and has a capacity of 440 MW – enough to power more than 90,000 homes at times of peak demand.
Built on the shores of Loch Awe in Argyll and Bute, it was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on this scale to be built in the world.
The turbine hall is located 1km within the hollowed-out mountain of Ben Cruachan and houses four generators, supplying a range of vital balancing and ancillary services to the grid, helping to maintain secure power supplies.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Head of UK Hydro said:
“As the first plant of its type in the UK, Cruachan has been providing stability and storage to the power network since 1965. That Mongolia is going through a similar energy transition to the one the UK has been on, gave us a prime opportunity, as a member of the government’s Power Past Coal Alliance to share the learnings and expertise we’ve built up over the decades with the Ambassador and his colleagues.
“Services such as those which Cruachan provides are of growing importance as we transition to a system with more renewables.”
The visit was supported by the UK government’s Department for International Trade.
L-R: Keiron Hanson, Director Hydroplan; Tulga Narkhuu, Mongolia Ambassador to the UK; Elbegsaikhan Ayush, Head of Department for International Trade, Ulaanbaatar Mongolia; Bavuudorj Ovgor, Director of Renewable Energy division, Ministry of Energy, Mongolia; Ganzorigt Luvsanjamba, Solar Tech Independent Power Producer, Naranteeg Mongolia
