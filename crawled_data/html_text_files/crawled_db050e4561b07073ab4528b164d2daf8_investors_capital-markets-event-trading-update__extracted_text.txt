and capital allocation following discussion with shareholders drax today announces a new dividend policy drax expects to pay a growing dividend consistent with maintaining its credit rating and investing in its business drax expects to recommend a dividend of 50m with regards to the 2017 financial year the board is confident that this dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow from this level as the implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flow in determining the rate of growth in dividends the board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the groups commoditybased businesses if there is a buildup of capital in excess of the groups investment needs the board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders dorothy thompson said britains energy market is changing drax has embraced these changes with a strategy which will help change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future through our operations in retail generation and biomass supply we expect to deliver a significant increase in high quality visible contracted

opportunities in all areas of the business we are confident in the strategy and our ability to deliver high quality earnings growth and value for shareholders supported by a strong financial model and
