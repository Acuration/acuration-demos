move to tackle the coronavirus most business that had not already closed moved online with millions of people now working from home this had a huge impact on electricity demand consumption on weekdays fell by 13 to its lowest levels since 1982  a time when there were 10 million fewer people in the country and gdp was a third lower than today other regions have seen a similar collapse in electricity demand spain italy and france have all seen electricity demand fall by 1015 according to analysis by ember  across the atlantic new york city has seen similar reductions demand has fallen for a simple reason with schools and workplaces now closed or running with a greatly reduced staff  machinery computers lights and heaters are not drawing power electric rail tram and tube systems are also running a reduced service on the contrary with more people at home household electricity consumption has increased octopus energy estimate that during social distancing before the stricter lockdown came into effect homes were consuming up to a third more electricity adding 20 per month to the typical bill the impact of lockdown on britains electricity demand is much like living through a month of sundays  the average profile for a march weekend day in previous years looks very similar to the daily profile for weekdays since lockdown begun  both in the amount of electricity consumed and the structure postlockdown weekends have even lower demand tracking 11 below weekday demand people no longer have to get up at the crack of dawn for work on a typical weekday morning demand would rise by 10 gw over two hours from 530 to 730 am now it takes more than twice as long  until midday  for this rise to occur at the other end of the day there would normally be a small peak in demand around 8 pm from people gathering in pubs and restaurants up and down the country both on weekdays and weekends demand begins falling earlier in the evening as the sofa has become the only available social venue with lower demand comes lower power prices wholesale electricity prices are typically 7 lower on sundays than on weekdays for this reason march saw the lowest monthlyaverage power price in 12 years down onethird on this month last year prices were already heading downwards because of the falling price of gas but the lockdown has amplified this and negative prices have become commonplace during the middle of the day there was not a visible impact on carbon emissions during the first quarter of the year as only the last week of march was affected however as lockdown continued into april and may emissions from power production in britain have fallen by 35 on the same period last year the effect is slightly stronger across europe with carbon emissions falling almost 40 as dirtier coal and lignite power stations are being turned down will some of these effects persist after lockdown restrictions are eased it is too early to tell as it depends on what longlasting economic and behavioural changes occur electricity demand is linked with the countrys gdp which is set to face the largest downturn in three centuries  whether the economy bounces back or is afflicted with a lasting depression will be key to future electricity demand it will also depend on behavioural shifts people are of course craving their lost freedoms many may appreciate not going back to a lengthy daily commute  and the rise of video conferencing and collaboration apps has shown that remote working may finally have come of age with even a small share of the population continuing to work from home on some days there could be a lasting impact on electricity demand for years to come read full report pdf  read full report  read press release tags covid19  decarbonisation  electric insights  electricity system balancing and ancillary services in a crisis people come first will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 14 may 2020 opinion this crisis will be remembered for many things many are not positive but some are inspiring around the world weve seen tremendous acts of kindness and witnessed remarkable resilience from people continuing to live work and to support one another the actions we are all taking as individuals businesses and communities will not only help us get through this crisis they will shape how we emerge from it at drax we are proud of the ongoing role were playing in supporting the uk and its essential services continuing to generate and supply the electricity needed to keep people healthy and the economy running it is what we have always done and it is what we will continue to do this is possible because our people have continued to carry out their important work in these uncertain times safely and responsibly my leadership team in the uk and us must continue to support them and we must also support the communities they are a part of employees drax power station show their support and appreciation for the heroic efforts of those within the nhs by turning one of its cooling towers blue at 8pm each thursday our communities are at the core of what we do and who we are they support our business globally and enable us to supply energy to the country we have a responsibility to do what we can to help them through this crisis to do this we have put together a covid19 support package totalling more than three quarters of a million pounds that goes beyond just financing to make a positive impact id like to highlight a few of these supporting communities in great britain and the us the robinson family collect their laptop at selby community primary school the closures of schools and the need to turn homes into classrooms has been one of the biggest changes for many families with children now depending on technology and the internet for schooling theres a very real chance those without access may fall behind with a long term negative impact on their education we want to ensure no child is left out so we have donated 250000 to buy 853 new laptops each with three months of prepaid internet access and delivered them to schools and colleges local to our sites across the uk  this has been implemented by drax working closely with headteachers as one of our local heads ian clennan told us schools dont just provide education  theyre a whole support system having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and classmates more easily too  which is also incredibly important at the moment in the us were donating 30000 to support hardship funds for the communities where we operate  our colleagues in louisiana are playing an active role in the community and in amite county mississippi they have helped provide ppe to first responders as well as supporting charities for the families worse affected helping businesses starting with the most vulnerable as an energy supplier to small and medium sized businesses smes we must act with compassion and be ready to help those who are most economically exposed to the crisis to do this we are launching a number of initiatives to support businesses starting with some of the most vulnerable its clear that care homes require extra support at this time we are offering energy bill relief for more than 170 small care homes situated near our uk operations for the next two months allowing them to divert funds to their other priorities such as ppe food or carer accommodation but it is also important we understand how difficult a period this is for small businesses of all kinds many of our customers are facing financial pressure that was impossible to forecast to help relieve this we have agreed deferred payment plans with some of our customers who are unable to pay in full we have also extended current energy prices for three months for 4000 customers of opus energy who have not been able to secure a new contract during this period the impact of this crisis will be long term so we made a significant twoyear charitable donation to business debtline  a dedicated phoneline and webpage will be provided to our small businesses customers offering free debt advice and helping them to recover for the future an

pandemic has changed how the country uses electricity overnight in the coming weeks we will be publishing a more indepth view from electric insights showing exactly what effect this has had and what it might reveal for the future of energy no matter what that future holds however we will remain committed to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future this will mean not only supporting our

changes to our outlook for 2020 trading operational performance and outlook the trading and operational performance of the group has been robust in the first three months of 2020 while the impact of covid19 is still unfolding the groups expectations for 2020 adjusted ebitda are currently in line with consensus inclusive of an estimated potential impact from covid19 of 60 million principally in relation to its customers business full year expectations for the group remain underpinned by good operational availability for the remainder of 2020 in the customers business the consequences of covid19 are only now starting to become visible it is expected to result in reduced demand and a potential increase in bad debt which represents a major sensitivity particularly in the sme 4 market as a result drax has significantly increased its expectation of potential customer business failures and higher bad debt assuming the continued impact of covid19 throughout 2020 drax now expects a full year adjusted ebitda loss for the customers business the group will closely monitor the impact on the customers business and update the market accordingly in generation the groups expectations for the full year reflect a reduction in roc recycle prices resulting from reduced power demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio the performance of the generation business is dependent on the continuation of biomass deliveries to drax power station biomass generation is currently the most material area of activity for the group and a protracted suspension of the supply chain could lead to lower levels of biomass generation resulting in a reduction in the groups expectations for the full year at present there has been no impact from covid19 and the group has a good supply of biomass throughout the supply chain which continues to be robust and functioning well engineer climbs cooling tower at drax power station click to viewdownload generation during the first three months of 2020 draxs generation portfolio performed well with good asset availability and optimisation of generation underpinning a strong financial performance the business benefits from a strong forward power sales position through 2022 which combined with indexlinked renewable schemes and capacity payments provides a high level of earnings visibility helping to protect the business from the current weakness in uk power prices in response to covid19 drax has implemented robust business continuity procedures across its sites to protect employees and contractors and ensure continued operation in addition to operating strategically important infrastructure the components of the groups uk supply chain are considered key sectors allowing continued operation the groups biomass supply chain has a high level of operational redundancy designed to mitigate any potential disruption drax sources biomass from suppliers across north america and europe including the groups own facilities in louisiana and mississippi in the uk drax utilises dedicated port facilities at hull immingham tyne and liverpool with a capacity

unloaded from the zheng zhi bulk carrier at abp immingham click to viewdownload drax power station has 300000 tonnes of biomass storage capacity taken together with volumes throughout its supply chain the group currently has visibility of over one million tonnes of biomass in transit  enough to operate the cfd 5 unit on its own for over four months subject to managing deliveries to drax power station biomass generation has performed well in the first three months of 2020 whilst covid19 has not had any measurable impact on biomass generation to date a sustained reduction in electricity demand could result in a reduction in roc recycle prices in the current compliance period the group has adjusted its expectations for the full year but the precise impact will be dependent on the depth and duration of any reduction in demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio engineer at cruachan power station click to viewdownload the groups hydro assets have performed well particularly the pumped storage business primarily driven by activity in the system support services market as previously disclosed cruachan pumped storage power station was successful in a tender process run by the system operator to procure inertia and reactive power services the contract is worth up to c5 million per year over six years and is expected to commence during the second quarter of 2020 this was the first tender of its kind and reflects the growing importance of system support services as the generation market becomes increasingly supplied by intermittent renewable power sources the system operator is expected to conduct further tenders over the coming year thermal generation is performing in line with draxs expectations pellet production lasalle bioenergy wood pellet manufacturing plant in louisiana click to viewdownload pellet production has performed well in the first three months of 2020 at present there has been no disruption to production caused by covid19 although the state of louisiana is experiencing a high number of cases the semiautomated nature of the pellet production process limits the need for individuals to be in contact with each other and this has been enhanced by robust business continuity procedures to further reduce the risk to employees and contractors drax continues to monitor developments closely and notes that energy rail port and forestry are designated key sectors in the usa allowing continued operation customers the groups customers business which sells power gas and energy services to the ic 6 and sme markets has seen a significant reduction in demand as a result of covid19 the group has been working to assess the potential impact of this demand reduction the increased risk of business failure and bad debt the impact is expected to be most pronounced in the sme market which represents c30 percent of monthly billing the impact is expected to be partially mitigated by credit insurance in respect of certain customers balance sheet at 31 december 2019 drax had 404 million of cash which increased to 454 million at 31 march 2020 the groups plan for 2020 included capital investment of 230250 million with half of this assigned to strategic investment in biomass expansion and cost reduction whilst the group continues to see its biomass strategy as both a primary long and shortterm source of value drax is reviewing the timing of its investment programme in 2020 and in the shortterm investment is expected to be lower at 31 march 2020 net debt had reduced to 818m million and drax continues to target around 2 x net debt to ebitda for the full year the group has available cash and committed facilities of 663 million including a cash line available within a 315 million revolving credit facility rcf which is currently undrawn and matures in april 2021 the group has an esg facility with final maturity in 2022 and a 350m sterling bond which matures in 2022 the group has a further 500 million fixed rate usd bond maturing in 2025 and infrastructure private placement loans maturing through 20242029 the groups facilities include a maintenance covenant which if triggered requires a minimum ebitda level requirement around 40 of 2020 current consensus adjusted ebitda customary covenants apply to all other facilities the groups rolling fiveyear foreign exchange hedge book continues to provide protection from the recent weakness in sterling to 2025 the group actively manages risk limits with counterparties providing forward foreign exchange contracts and the current weakness in sterling has led to the rebasing of a number of contracts resulting in the acceleration of cash flows from these contracts to the benefit of drax contracted power sales as at 16 april 2020 the power sales contracted for 2020 2021 and 2022 were as follows 2020 2021 2022 power sales twh comprising 167 96 43  fixed
