reserve drax power station visit power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station drax starts planning process for battery storage and gas options on site these options would if developed increase draxs ability to provide the flexible generation and grid support services britains electricity system will need as coal and other large power stations are turned off 13 september 2017 drax today gave notice to the planning inspectorate of its intention to consult on longterm options to repower up to two coal units to gas and build battery storage at drax power station plans for gas on site were announced in june and are part of an ongoing research and development project the options could create up to 36gw of new gas generation capacity and 200mw of battery storage they are subject to a positive investment decision and would need to be underpinned by a 15year capacity market contract the upgrade would enhance drax power stations flexible and responsive capability and make yorkshire the home of large scale battery technology at this early stage in the planning process these figures represent the maximum parameters of the project these options would if developed increase draxs ability to provide the flexible generation and grid support services britains electricity system will need as coal and other large power stations are turned off todays notice to the planning inspectorate is a step in developing these options as part of draxs strategy to play a vital role in changing the way energy is generated as the uk moves to a low carbon future the options complement draxs ongoing work to explore converting a fourth unit to sustainable biomass three units have already been successfully upgraded ontime and onbudget they account for 70 of the electricity drax produces  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool and 16 of the uks total renewable power drax expects to begin consulting on these options with local communities and national stakeholders over the coming weeks andy koss ceo of drax power said we are at the start of the planning process but if developed these options for gas and battery storage show how drax could upgrade our existing infrastructure to provide capacity stability and essential grid services as we do with biomass this would continue to keep costs low for consumers and help to deliver governments commitment to remove coal from the uk grid drax power station is a national asset and a significant driver of economic growth in the north of england these options could repurpose up to two of our coal assets and extend their operation into the 2030s we have always supported and worked with our local communities and want to ensure they have a role in shaping our thinking we will undertake a comprehensive programme of local consultation and engagement over the coming months to share our options with the public and listen to their views  ends  media contacts ali lewis head of news drax group 01757 612165 email protected jessica gorton press officer drax group 07712 677177 email protected notes to editors about the drax repower project the project encompasses the following elements the repowering of either one or both of drax units 5 and 6 which are currently coal fired to gas using two new gas turbines a heat recovery steam generator hrsg and cooling systems the capacity of each gas unit would be up to 1800 mw with a combined maximum possible capacity of 3600 mw a battery storage facility of up to 200 mw capacity a new gas connection entering the eastern side of the existing station an electrical connection into the 400 kv substation from the repowered units would allow for electricity to be distributed into the national grid further information about the project consultation and planning application will be published in the coming months on this page about the planning regime the proposed development is a nationally significant infrastructure project nsip under the construction or extension of a generating station category in part 3 sections 141a and 152 of the planning act 2008 as amended as such drax is required to seek planning permission known as a development consent order dco from the planning inspectorate an executive agency of the government that manages nationally significant infrastructure projects about drax group drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used as the uk moves to a low carbon future drax operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies 7 percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax biomass  based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests
