accounts  investors  about us  customers heating the future 9 april 2019 sustainable bioenergy we all want our homes and our workplaces to be warm and cosy but not at the cost of catastrophic climate change thats why decarbonising our heating is a challenge that simply cannot be ignored making decisions about how this is done requires careful consideration and a detailed deliverable national strategy here we discuss the key issues in decarbonising heat the numbers the climate change act commits the uk to reducing its carbon emissions by at least 80 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2050 as heating our homes and workplaces is responsible for almost one fifth of our countrys total carbon emissions we are clearly going to need to make huge changes to the way we keep our homes and workplaces warm in order to meet those commitments over 80 of energy used in homes is for heating  suggesting large potential for continued decarbonisation  energising britain progress impacts and outlook for transforming britains energy system  by i staffell m jansen a chase c lewis and e cotton 2018 improved insulation greater energy efficiency and electrification will all reduce the need for fossil fuelbased heating however domestic energy efficiency in the uk is lagging well behind targets although the situation varies from region to region  and such targets do not even exist yet for the nondomestic sector  roof insulation material even in a low or zerocarbon future were still going to need to keep our homes and workplaces warm  and affordably future policy against this backdrop in march 2018 the uk government issued a call for evidence for a future framework for heat in buildings chancellor phillip hammond introduced a new future homes standard in his 2019 spring budget statement  mandating the end of fossil fuel heating systems gas boilers will be banned from all new homes from 2025 a major change is coming but what else will we need to change in order to transform our heating systems 1 more electrification the most noticeable change in the way we heat our homes and workspaces in the future may well come from the need to switch from systems that fuelled by natural gas to ones that are driven by electricity some technologies that can offer a solution to the challenge of decarbonising heating depend on a significant amount of electricity to keep the warmth flowing for instance the hybrid heat pump scenario which is currently supported by the committee on climate change would see up to 85 of a consumers need for heat being met by lowcarbon electricity to give some context to that figure according to the committee  85 per cent of the uks homes now rely on fossilfuel derived natural gas for heating and hot water and on average these currently emit around 2tco 2 per household per year which represents around one tenth of the average uk households carbon footprint changing from a situation where our heating depends on 85 fossil fuel gas to one that depends on 85 low or zero carbon electricity is little short of a complete transformation given that the new future homes standard is due to be introduced in less than six years this transformation will need to happen quickly of course a great deal of the extra electricity needed will come from intermittent renewables such as wind turbines and solar panels  especially as the cost of renewable electricity is falling  much of that power looks likely to be supplied by distributed sources rather than those integrated into the national grid indeed since 2011 power generation capacity connected directly to the distribution network grew from 12 gigawatts gw to more than 40 gw by the end of 2017 according to estimates from energy experts cornwall insight in a report for our b2b energy supply business haven power with so much of our electricity reliant on the weather there will still be a need for dispatchable and flexible thermal sources and energy storage such as drax and cruachan power stations  their centralised power generation can be turned up and fed directly into the national transmission system at short notice to keep our heating running and our homes warm dam and reservoir cruachan power station scotland such a transformation will obviously require careful strategic planning as well as an enormous amount of investment there may well be no single solution to the challenge of heat decarbonisation rather a number of different solutions that depend on where people live and work their individual circumstances the energy efficiency of their homes and the resources they have close at hand but while it has previously been reported that the overall or system costs of electrifying heating could be as much as three times the cost of using gas another study suggests that the costs could be much closer 2 more heat pumps heat pumps that absorb environmental warmth and use it to provide low carbon heating have always been considered a possible option for the four million homes and countless workplaces that are not currently connected to the uks mains gas network recently expert opinion has been changing with hybrid heat pumps seen as a workable solution even for homes and workplaces that are connected to gas supplies indeed in 2018 the committee on climate change stated that hybrid heat pumps can be the lowest cost option where homes are sufficiently insulated or can be insulated affordably this means that they may be one of the simplest and most affordable options to provide the heating of the future hybrid heat pumps draw heat from the air or ground around them and use a boiler to provide extra heat when the weather is exceptionally cold in a low carbon future that boiler could be fuelled by biogas in a zero carbon situation it could be powered by hydrogen heat pumps can be airsource ashp  absorbing warmth from the atmosphere like the heat exchanger in your fridge in reverse  or ground source gshp gshps absorb heat through on a network of pipes a ground loop buried or a vertical borehole drilled in the earth outside your home or workplace both ashps and gshps can be used to support underfloor heating or a radiator system though neither will provide water heated to the high temperature a natural gas boiler will reach to keep radiators hot and even though the warmth they absorb is free heat pumps depend on a supply of electricity to condense it and to bring it back to the heating system inside the house this electricity could be generated by distributed power from local solar pv wind turbines drawn from batteries or even from the low carbon grid of the future it is worth noting that the size of heat pumps and the amount of land they require  especially gshp  makes them a less attractive solution for people who live or work in built up areas such as cities while for those who live in blocks of flats it is difficult to see how individual heat pumps could be a practical solution 3 more hydrogen the idea of switching the mains gas grid to store and transport hydrogen has long appealed as a potential solution to the challenge of decarbonising heating renewable hydrogen could then be burnt in domestic boilers similar to those we currently use for natural gas the benefits are many hydrogen produces no carbon emissions when burnt and can be stored and transported in much the same way as natural gas provided old metal pipes have been replaced with modern alternatives and given the sunk costs involved in the existing gas grid and in the network of pipes and radiators already installed in tens of millions of homes hydrogen has always been expected to be the lowest cost option too however according to the committee on climate changes latest findings  hydrogen should not be seen as a silver bullet solution capable of transforming our entire heating landscape in a single change the main reasons they give for this judgment are the relatively high cost of the electricity required to produce sufficient hydrogen to power tens of millions of boilers the undesirability of relying on substantial imports of hydrogen and the lack of a carbonfree method to supply the gas costeffectively at scale hydrogen could however be produced by gas reformation of the emissions retained by bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs such as that being pioneered at drax power station carbon capture use and storage ccus of which beccs is the renewable variant is supported by the uk government through its clean growth strategy as it has potential to accelerate decarbonisation in power and industrial sectors extremely rapid progress to provide hydrogen in sufficient quantities from beccs is unlikely  but the first schemes could begin operating in the late 2020s hydrogen production also has the potential to radically transform the economics of ccus making it a much more attractive investment  it was originally assumed that the power required to drive the energyintensive process of hydrogen created via electrolysis would come from surplus electricity generated by intermittent renewables at times of low demand however that surplus is not now generally regarded as likely to be sufficiently large to be relied upon it is these limitations together with a comprehensive model of the likely costs involved in different approaches to decarbonisation that led the committee on climate change to suggest that hybrid heat pumps could provide the bulk of domestic heating in the future at present it seems likely that converting to hydrogenfuelled boilers will mainly be an attractive option for those who live and work near areas where the renewable fuel can be most easily created and stored the north of england is a prime example  close to the energy and carbon intensive areas of the humber and tees valleys where ccus and hydrogen clusters could be located with good access to north sea carbon stores such as aquifers and former gas fields 4 more solar many homes in the uk  especially in the south  could be heated electrically without carbon emissions at the point of use solar thermal for water heating or solar pvs for electric and water heating common sights on domestic property rooftops the intermittency of solar power need not be an issue as the electricity generated could then be stored in batteries behind the meter until it is needed however the lack of sufficient daylight for much of the year in many parts of the uk could together with the still relatively high cost of battery storage  still mean that this would not necessarily be a solution that can be applied at scale to millions of homes and workplaces all year round as the cost of battery storage continues to fall  it may well be that solar becomes a more practical and costeffective solution 5 more biomass more geothermal sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets and biomass boilers have long been proposed as a potential solution to decarbonising heating for the many people who live and work off the mains gas grid bioenergy as a whole  including biogas as well as wood pellets  now provides around four percent of uk heat up from 14 in 2008 the main barriers to this are the current relatively high cost of biomass boilers this is currently offset by the renewable heating incentive rhi which the uk government has committed to continuing until 2021 as this solution is adopted by more consumers it is anticipated that the real costs of such new technology will fall as economies of scale start to take effect in much the same way that solar pv and battery technology has recently become more affordable 6 more geothermal ruins of a tin mine wheal coates mine st agnes cornwall england geothermal energy uses the heat stored beneath the surface of our planet itself to provide the energy we need while in some countries such as iceland  geothermal energy is used to drive turbines to generate electricity that is then used to provide power for heating it is envisaged that in the uk it could be converted into warmth through massive heat pumps that provide heating to entire communities  especially those in former mining areas there is already one geothermal district heating scheme in operation in the uk in southampton  it is envisaged that such geothermal schemes would work most effectively at a district level providing zero carbon heat to many homes and workplaces according to a recent report  geothermal energy has the potential to produce up to 20 per cent of uk electricity and heat for millions at present drilling is being carried out to see if geothermal heating could be viable in cornwall  however there is no reason why it could not be used in disused coalmines too where ground source heat pumps gshps would absorb and condense the required heat this means that geothermal could have strong potential as a solution to the challenge of decarbonisation for former mining communities 7 more chp cory riverside energys resource recovery facility in belvedere london could be operated as a chp plant in the future by using the heat created in thermal renewable electricity generation  such as biomass  in combined heat and power schemes businesses and individuals can reduce their energy costs and their carbon emissions such schemes can work well for new developments on a district basis and are already popular in mainland europe especially sweden denmark and switzerland warm homes factories and offices there are already a number of viable solutions to decarbonising heating in the uk they rely on smart policy smarter technology and customers taking control of their energy rather than any one of these technologies providing a single solution that can help every consumer and business in the country to meet the challenge in the same way it is more likely that it will be met by a number of different solutions depending on geography cost and individual circumstances these will sometimes also work in concert rather than alone the uk has made solid progress on reducing carbon emissions  especially in power generation  when it comes to heating buildings rapid decarbonisation is now needed and that decarbonisation must avoid fuel poverty and help to rebalance the economy  find out more about energy in buildings in energising britain  progress impacts and outlook for transforming britains energy system tags hydrogen  decarbonisation  customers  wood pellets  biomass energy how getting renewable energy from your supplier actually works 2 april 2019 sustainable bioenergy where does our electricity come from one answer might be the power stations wind turbines and solar panels that generate it you might even go as far as to say the wind sun water biomass and gas powering those stations or even the network companies transporting that power around the country but theres also a very important middleman in this process electricity suppliers most of great britain gets its power from one of the big six energy suppliers which buy electricity from the wholesale market and then sells it to consumers however with more businesses and consumers looking for less carbonintense electricity sources there are now a whole host of smaller companies taking on the incumbents and offering allrenewable electricity from ovo to bulb to draxs own haven power and opus energy  consumers and businesses have more and greener options than ever about where to buy their electricity with many even offering 100 renewable electricity but how do these companies ensure the megawatts powering homes offices and street lights come from renewable sources cleaning up the river the electricity we use doesnt just flow through a single cable from a power station to our houses it travels through whats called the transmissions system which is run by national grid eso and local distribution network operators  apart from offgrid installations like solar panels on buildings some of which are unable to export their unused power all the electricity generated by different sources around the country goes into this same system it means megawatts generated by a wind turbine get mixed up with those generated by a nuclear reactor or a coal power station think of it as a river although it is its own entity it is fed by multiple streams of water coming from different sources in the case of electricity megawatts from various generators are fed into a central system which then enter homes offices and devices around the country so what makes green power generated from renewable sources green power used in homes suppliers cant control exactly what megawatts you use but they can influence the makeup of the overall river your electricity is pulled from by what electricity they agree to buy and offer to their customers renewable suppliers match the amount of electricity their customers use with the amount they buy from renewable sources so if a home uses 4 megawatthours mwh a year  a supplier will need to ensure it buys an equal amount of power from national grid which national grid sources from generators if that supplier offers 100 renewable power it will need to ensure it has the right kinds of deals in place with renewable generators to deliver that amount of power it means that while the river of electricity is still a mix from different streams more of the water will come from renewable streams therefore if more homes and businesses switch to renewable suppliers more of the overall river will be renewable which will in turn help to decarbonise the electricity system enabling a lowercarbon economy but how does this fit into the existing electricity business and infrastructure but how do suppliers actually buy renewable power from generators the business of electricity to understand how suppliers ensure they are buying renewable power you first need to understand how the business works or at least how it used to the most obvious place to start is with the generators be they gas power stations or an offshore wind farm the generator is where electricity is produced and are often owned by a supplier suppliers can buy electricity from their own generators often months or years ahead of delivery but if there is a shortfall the supplier can also buy electricity on the wholesale market where other generators can sell their electricity because suppliers are on a competitive market their aim is to buy the electricity for the lowest possible price and sell it for more  but at a better rate than rivals measures like carbon prices or green incentives help lower the cost of renewable and lowcarbon generation and position it as a more economically viable purchase than more expensive fossil fuels like coal  renewableonly suppliers also want to buy electricity as cheap as possible and sell it as affordably as possible but unlike standard suppliers they only buy electricity from renewable sources this can be done by purchasing electricity from independent renewable generators on the wholesale market or arranged through what are known as power purchase agreements  ppas   longerterm contracts between generators and suppliers agreeing on a specific amount of power the advantage of these for the renewable generator is it secures revenue for the future while for the supplier it means a dependable source of electricity for large installations these deals are often signed before construction even begins to ensure investors there will be a return transitioning to a lowcarbon electricity system however is not just about suppliers buying more electricity from renewable sources the future of electricity suppliers as more businesses individuals and communities are becoming prosumers and generating their own electricity the wider role of the supplier in the system is changing the governments feedintariffs financially reward customers for generating their own electricity even if they dont export it to the grid but even small generators can sign deals with suppliers to sell electricity through schemes such as good energys smartgen policy which is open to generators with between 10 and 100 kilowatts kw of installed capacity similarly opus energy helps over 2100 businesses sell more than 1100 gigawatthours gwh of excess wind solar anaerobic digestion and hydro power for larger prosumer businesses the relationship with suppliers and the grid is different rather than the traditional buying and selling of electricity it requires a cooperative approach to understand how the prosumer can best utilise their assets  beyond increasing the amount of lowcarbon electricity decarbonising the electricity system also means making more efficient use of energy and managing the data that can help improve efficiency haven powers partnership with thames water sees it analyse an average of 68 million halfhour smart meter readings every year using the data to help the company improve its billing and forecasting as the wider system becomes more intelligent suppliers will be able to better forecast how much electricity its customers use and help them reduce their consumption the role required of suppliers in a changing system will create opportunities for more renewable and efficient use of electricity and empower more consumers to get their electricity from lowcarbon sources that can help to
