great britain goes on grid chapters chapter 1 great britain goes on grid chapter 2 the big break chapter 3 evolve or die chapter 4 from the gridiron into the future share could great britain go off grid nearly a century after it was first built is the national grid on the verge of breaking up 23 august 2019 chapter 1 great britain goes on grid bonnyfield near falkirk in scotland isnt an exciting place its home to a nature reserve the remnants of a roman wall and a small neighbourhood bowls club its sparse and suburban but it was here in a windbeaten field dotted with trees on the outskirts of town that the largest infrastructure project in british history began on 14 july 1928 the first pylon of what would become the national grid was erected it would be a decade before the grid as we know it today came into existence but on that saturday morning a small group of men gathered to hoist a steel tower upright and signal the arrival of the modern age  nearly a century later the electricity network that grew from that first pylon remains but its a vastly different thing its bigger and more complex  its physical footprint covers almost 90000 pylons 4500 miles of overhead cables and 342 substations operated by the national grid electricity transmission company  as well as many more local distribution networks consisting of wires and transformers its a network of old and new technology spanning almost the whole country that helped propel a population into an age of rapid scientific and economic expansion but today theres one question being asked of it is it fit for purpose in a world of smallscale intermittentrenewable decentralised distributed and batterypowered microgrids is an almost antique network what the country needs to answer that question we have to start with a broader one why do we even have a grid at all 90000 pylons 4500 miles of overhead cables 342 substations great britains national grid the history of the grid electricity came to great britains shores as a novelty when it arrived in the 1880s its practical uses were limited  lighting was just about the only demonstrable function as a result electricitys early adopters were either the rich  who used it to bring uniqueness to their homes  or hotels and seaside attractions such as those in blackpool which used electricity as a way to bring in curious punters the early electrification of great britain wasnt a government effort to light up the country it was a way to show off by the dawn of the 20 th century electricity had begun to grow as a means for powering industrial machines but its use was niche and viewed with scepticism great britains deep reserves of coal had made steam the driving force behind its industrial revolution and in domestic life people were familiar with coal stoves and gas lamps electricity was a complicated unnecessary alternative with few supporters but by the 1910s it became apparent great britain was lagging far behind the economic and industrial development of the us scandinavia and germany  three regions where electricity had grown to be more abundant and less expensive it was clear to anyone comparing those countries that electricity use on a larger integrated scale could unlock greater development and growth britain took notice but the question was where to start and more importantly who had the nerve to take it on the man who would be the grid king charles merz charles merz had ambition born into him the eldest son of a germanbritish chemist and industrialist father he took up his first job aged 15 as an apprentice at the newcastleupontyne electric supply company which was founded by his father in 1889 by age 24 merz was the secretary and chief engineer of the cork electric tramways and lighting company in ireland where he met fellow electrical engineer william mclellan together they set up the consulting firm merz  mclellan with a vision to transform the nascent technology of electrification the pair returned to tyneside in 1901 to open the neptune bank power station the first power station in great britain built exclusively to supply electricity to industry rather than just to power domestic lighting by 1914 merz  mclellan had taken ownership of multiple power stations in the surrounding area but rather than sitting back and reaping the economic rewards of this network merz saw something else in the concentrated geography of british industry he recognised the opportunity for a public supply of electricity spread across sites one that would be cheaper and more reliable than the private generators supplying individual factories  that would connect multiple power stations through highvoltage transmission lines and would pool generation so it could be shared across multiple factories and facilities he set about building it adding connections that linked his power stations to share their generation across the newcastleupontyne region and in the process formed the countrys first ever local grid he used the project as a working demonstration to influence parliament to take the task of interconnection much further he was met with little enthusiasm but then world war one struck and everything changed industrial production would be essential to the war effort the 1915 shell crisis  a severe shortage of artillery shells on the western front  highlighted that british industry was not up to the pace needed furthermore mass conscription caused labour shortages in the coal industry threatening the main source of great britains electricity and industrial power it was through direct government intervention such as rationing of domestic coal and drafting women into factories and mines that great britains industry could get up to speed merz seized the narrative of british survival to advocate for regional grids he argued that reorganising the electricity system to use the latest energy technology would make the most efficient use of coal reserves and generate the electricity needed to ramp up industrial production and overcome the struggle view timeline great britains national grid a timeline the early electrification of great britain wasnt a government effort to light up the country it was a way to show off getting the grid in shape the feeling that the uk had only just scraped through world war one thanks to the us intervention with its industrial might powered by regional grids was deeply troubling it was now apparent to many electrical engineers that radical change was needed but despite the clear need progress was slow the longanticipated peace following the war was fraught with tension coal miners went on strike against wage cuts in 1919 disrupting the countrys most vital source of electricity and heat and exposing the vulnerabilities of the fractured electricity system that same year a group of electrical engineers gathered to write a report in response to the war calling for greater interconnection the williamson report set out to make the countrys electricity systems more efficient and secure but did so through voluntary involvement and gradual legislation as a result progress was slow ad hoc and marginal  not the radical shift that was needed this significant overhaul would come in 1926 with the release of another report  once again with merz one of the main players the weir report laid out the first true vision of a connected grid across the nation and became a point of reference for advocates its first step was to establish seven separate regional networks the committee behind the report was chaired by lord weir of eastwood a scottish industrialist who had come to prominence during the war as director of aircraft production and then as secretary of state for air he made it clear to conservative prime minister stanley baldwin that the plan would not just advocate for a gradual progression of electrification but call for major reorganisation and financial investment baldwin rallied significant support for the construction of the grid thanks to the labour partys support of greater public electricity supply which it saw as a step towards eventual nationalisation but the complexity of the existing network meant the feat of integration would be enormous dr paul warde a professor at cambridge university sums up the state of the countrys power network at the time before the grid as we know it became established britain had 572 local electricity suppliers and almost as many power stations as that the plan to integrate all of them would be the biggest infrastructure project ever undertaken by the government looking over the planned transmission lines crisscrossing a map of the country for the first time charles merz stood back and said what he saw  a gridiron impression across great britain the man to champion the idea of a national grid had also just given it its name before the grid as we know it became established britain had 572 local electricity suppliers and almost as many power stations as that dr paul warde cambridge university the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken legislation was passed in 1926 and planning began immediately one of the first tasks in 1927 was to found the central electricity board ceb which would oversee the construction and operation of the system this included everything from finding and procuring the right land to deciding which power stations were high capacity and efficient enough to be brought onto the system to overcoming the technical challenges of standardising voltage and frequency nearly a century later this decision to unify voltage and frequency remains one of the fundamentals of the grid as we know it the final of the 26000 original pylons that would become the national grid was erected on the outskirts of the new forest on 5 september 1933 just seven years after the project began it was completed  on time and within budget its impact on the country was immediate between 1926 and 1933 electricity consumption in great britain doubled from 5 million kilowatt hours kwh to 10 million kwh while industrial production grew significantly factories and workshops now had a cheap reliable public supply of electricity they could use rather than having to depend on their own the homes of ordinary people across the country also now gained access to electricity for the first time it became a political debate in the 1930s when the decision as to whether public housing should have electricity or not was raised primarily conservative local councillors worried about inflicting the cost of electricity on poorer tenants while labour councillors advocated for modernity in anticipation of cost falling in the future in an era when the vast majority of people rented their housing the decision would ultimately fall to landlords rather than tenants in the end electrification won out these were huge steps forward but there was still no nationwide fully integrated network the country had interconnected its power stations but it remained regionally divided into seven individual networks another change was needed but it wasnt going to come easily it needed a maverick plan the rebels that turned seven into one on the evening of 29 october 1937 almost a decade after the construction of the first pylon there was a rebellion brewing a group of electrical engineers at the ceb had launched a plan behind their employers back to run an experiment that would once again transform the countrys electricity system the network was divided into seven separate networks but this group of engineers saw the potential for something else  an integrated system a truly national grid that evening the group of coconspirators decided to run all seven separate networks as one integrated system as an unauthorised experiment there was high potential for disaster  if it didnt work the country could falter and each engineer would likely lose their jobs the group advanced regardless there was no disaster no loss of power and crucially it worked authorities at the ceb were initially deeply unhappy with the maverick plan but the potential for a single system was clear and they would soon need to consider it further in the harsh winter of 1938 the possibility of shortfalls in the south of england prompted the decision to formally attempt to run the system as one grid and to connect the more plentiful generation of the north with the rest of the country it was intended as a shortterm measure but this time it stuck the countrys grid has remained connected and centrally coordinated ever since by 1940 electricity consumption had once again doubled to 20 million kwh a year while through the 1930s great britains industrial production grew to sit behind only germany and the soviet unions  which would prove massively important given what the next decade would entail merz the man who had kicked it all off however would not live to see how robust and vital the grid proved throughout the second world war in 1940 he died during a german air raid at his home in kensington at the age of 66 as the country emerged from the second world war the unified electrified great britain he had imagined decades before was just coming into being more than just transforming industry it was changing society transformation at home and work the grid merz helped shape was responsible for ramping up the industrial power that would help the uk survive the second world war but away from the shipyards and factories it was changing the lives of ordinary people across the country the shift from small locallyplaced power stations to larger plants located further from towns and cities massively reduced the level of pollution in urban areas the benefit was felt in homes too where the reduced need for gas canisters and oil wicks cut indoor pollution  though coal would still play a role in heating and cooking in homes until the 1970s the immediately obvious lifestyle benefits this brought meant greater electrification  and the construction that came with it  was invited rather than obstructed communities of all kinds saw recognisable benefits brought by electrification and were willing to accept transmission lines and cables traversing the landscapes for it in the postwar years the practical applications of electricity in homes and businesses expanded significantly as new appliances came to market  from fridges to electric ovens to hoovers to kettles advertising for these appliances was targeted at women the belief being that having been tasked with labourintensive domestic jobs for centuries new electrical appliances suddenly made these much less time consuming from houses to factories and neighbourhoods to regions reliable safe electricity from the grid allowed modern great britain to emerge in the second half of the 20 th century the transformation was radical positive and rapid but there was a silent problem lurking at the heart of it  the fuel powering it when everything changed coal had been the backbone of british industry for as long as there had been any british industry  the electricity revolution was no different power stations across the country may have been connected to one another but in the immediate postwar years almost all were running on coal and as populations grew and electricity demand increased more and more coal was needed at the same time so did awareness of what that coal was doing to the world around it air pollution in urban areas may have improved as power stations had moved beyond city limits following the 1956 clean air act but their cumulative effect to the world at large could no longer go unnoticed as science and computing advanced in the 1950s and 60s researchers were slowly gathering more evidence that carbon dioxide co 2  was no longer just another invisible byproduct of burning coal but a worlddamaging gas slowly filling the atmosphere the world needed to cut carbon emissions but it still needed power in fact it needed more power than ever so the industry began looking at other sources of electricity part of the solution was found in nuclear which grew in the 1950s and 60s before the arrival of natural gas in the 1990s but elsewhere technologies that ran on sources that would never run out and that wouldnt emit the malicious molecule  co 2  were gaining greater traction and interest by the turn of the millennium solar and wind generation werent new technologies but they came under renewed consideration as an option to provide cleaner renewable power at scale and as more minds began to tackle this challenge the costs of these technologies began to fall while their abilities grew triggering the rise of larger more plentiful pockets of renewable generation that existed in localised hubs centred on servicing single homes facilities or regions it was an historic moment in recognition of a cleaner energy future but for great britain it also signalled the end of coal  the fuel that for centuries had powered the country instead the future would be focused on renewable and lowercarbon power sources the first great leap of the national grid was to unify generation so that no part of the country would ever be without power there was now a second how do we make it cleaner the pockets of renewable generation dotted across the country that had been quietly developed and cultivated were now something else  they were no longer the fringe they were the future but they would need to grow the focus wasnt the big connected network but the smaller sections within it and if this was where we were headed what would that mean for merzs great interconnected grid as we entered the 21 st century in earnest the grid began to break chapter 2 the big break in the northwest highlands of scotland is a peninsula jutting out into the north atlantic the community of scoraig is only accessible by boat or a fivemile hike it is also completely cut off from the national grid the local homes and community school are partlypowered by smallscale wind turbines built by a local physicist and windpower hobbyist called hugh scoraig has become a haven for people who want to escape the traditional ninetofive and seek a selfsustained lifestyle it is exactly what comes to mind when you think of living offgrid but the idea of offgrid is nolonger limited just to these types of remote communities instead aided by technological advances and government incentives it has become a feasible smallscale way to begin to decarbonise great britains electricity system and to bring generation closer to electricitys point of use these offgrid communities bring advantages but there are also repercussions for the broader network great britains grid was built with big power stations that generate a lot of electricity in mind facilities like drax power station  now the biggest in the country  can generate 600plus megawatts from each of its four biomass units and contribute as much as 8 of the countrys total electricity the substations and transmission cables that make up the national grid were built to integrate and transmit vast quantities of power from stations of a similar size to plugs across the country but when electricity generation is happening at the place of consumption such as at a local wind turbine or solar panel on an office building much of that grid infrastructure isnt needed whats more the cost of maintaining it suddenly disappears offering lowercost electricity to end consumers what was built to connect a handful of big power generators is instead having to accommodate many smaller ones that dont need to feed their power into a central integrated pool this shift is called decentralisation  a move away from a network built around a handful of big generators to one made up of multiple smaller ones but as more buildings communities and businesses develop the ability to go offgrid and decentralise the relationship between electricity producers and consumers changes and inevitably so does the business of power the result could be a complete transformation of the centralised grid the countrys electricity system is built on a transformation not of consolidation but of separation a transformation that is already well underway the growth of decentralised generation the sun ship freiburg germany the primary catalyst for decentralisation was decarbonisation but whats arguably moved it into the mainstream is economics and energy independence the falling costs of renewable technologies  in particular solar panels  have made the ability for individuals to generate their own electricity a possibility for anyone able to afford the initial outlay this has given rise to whats known as prosumers  individuals and businesses who both produce and consume their own electricity the benefits of this are obvious families and organisations can save money by generating their own renewable power rather than buying it from suppliers this in turn reduces utility bills and in many cases allows them to sell the excess power they generate back to the grid to even make money and its not just in the private sector that its gaining traction three quarters of local authorities around the country are exploring governing electricity at a local level with decentralised sources including the countrys capital the london mayors office expects 25 of the citys power as well as heat to be generated through decentralised sources by 2025 this would be an impressive achievement for such a large city as well as a signal of intent for where the rest of the country may head but it wouldnt be the first of its kind globally the renewable village the resilient country the village of feldheim lies in a flat windswept stretch of germany just south east of berlin with just a few hundred residents its far from big but it is unique in the midnineties it began experimenting with renewables  erecting four wind turbines in an effort to begin generating its own power feldheims wind turbines eventually grew to 47 in number and in 2008 these were joined by a biogas plant using local farm waste to create methane for heating as well as a solar farm all together these installations were generating so much electricity that 99 of it was being sold by the community back to the local energy market but feldheim was still a part of the local grid utility company eon  who owned and operated the grid  refused to sell or lease the part of the grid the village sat on to the community this meant the electricity being used there remained a mix of all the different sources of power on the countrys centralised integrated grid rather than coming directly from the local renewable sources sitting on their doorstep so the community did something drastic  they built their own grid using donations from residents eu subsidies and a partnership with a french energy company it raised enough money to build a parallel grid that would only service the village in 2010 it was switched on and feldheim achieved total energy independence feldheim was now entirely offgrid decentralised and truly carbon neutral just a year later on the other side of the world a devastating natural disaster would begin a move to decentralisation on a far bigger scale one not just focused on decarbonisation but on security in the wake of the 2011 great east japan earthquake and subsequent fukushima nuclear incident japan found itself at a crossroads it recognised its centralised electricity system was susceptible to major disruption from natural disasters and that its geography made those natural disasters more likely the country was also on an ambitious plan to reduce its carbon emissions in 2030 by 26 from 2013 levels there was a need for resilience shioashiya smart city  a new district in the city of ashiya near osaka began development in 2012 with the aim of building a netzero carbon emission city on a microgrid using solar and storage facilities built in partnership with panasonic each of its 400 homes features a 46 kw solar generator and a 112 kwh storage cell as well as systems allowing users to share excess power with other buildings in the neighbourhood including three condominium complexes the region regularly overgenerates allowing the community to sell excess power back to the main grid but even if connection to this is interrupted in an emergency shioashiya can continue to function from stored power and solar generation nearly 600 miles away to the northeast of the country the city of higashi matsushima has taken a lesstechnological but larger scale approach a city of 40000 people it was awarded funding as part of japans national resilience program to construct a series of microgrids and renewable generation clusters that now produce 25 of the citys total electricity  the approach to decentralisation of the small german village and japanatlarge are very different  not just in geography but in ambition one is driven by a desire to isolate itself as a carbonneutral offgrid haven the other to demonstrate security through separation what they share however is a progression towards empowering users of electricity rather than just those that produce and manage it this doesnt mean a benefit just to individuals but potentially whole societies changing generation changing where the money goes emma bridge is ceo of community energy england cee an organisation which acts as a voice for community energy schemes around the country with several years experience in renewable and community energy projects she recognises the transformational potential of decarbonisation and digitalisation more importantly she sees the opportunity they present for society one example of how are community benefit society cooperatives these are renewable projects built through money raised by share and bond offers to community members once up and running the electricity they generate is offered back to the community in some cases at a discount bridge gives the example of a school installing solar panels on its roof the school would get discounted electricity from the panels while selling power to the community any surplus income is then invested back into the local community which has a say on how the money is spent this can include helping to alleviate fuel poverty in areas where it is needed a scheme in barnsley has seen more than 300 solar panels and battery systems installed in councilowned houses in an area where 75 of residents are elderly and 25 are on prepayment meters the scheme estimates in its first year it saved tenants more than 40000 through reduced electricity bills and lowered carbon emissions by more than 400 tonnes bridge points out how the benefits of decentralised projects can play an even more important role by driving the behavioural change needed to further decarbonise the electricity system the beauty of community energy comes in the trusted intermediary she says its very effective in reaching people and helping them to adopt different patterns because if were going to tackle energy challenges its not just about generation its about changing the way we use energy but while community energy projects like these sit outside the control of national or regional electricity suppliers they still utilise the national grids local distribution systems to move megawatts around and this is where the challenges of decentralisation begin to emerge the grid that merz and his contemporaries designed and built was based around big coal power stations on the outskirts of cities pumping electricity through the transmission system to consumers what it enabled  constant secure and stable power at all times anywhere in the country  created the society we live in the industries we work in and set the standard for how we use power its a system that has endured for almost 100 years and its success is evidenced in how little we notice it in our daily lives the creation of this connected power system worked to ensure there is always power and there is always an integrated highly complex system in place to manage the flow of that power back and forth the countrys operation relies on some degree of centralisation to keep it all running together as one if were going to tackle energy challenges its not just about generation its about changing the way we use energy emma bridge ceo community energy england decentralisation creates benefits at street level but in a world with only decentralised renewable microgrids what powers the traffic lights in devon when the sun is only shining in scotland and how do we manage the power of a country of 66 million connected technologydependent people when everyone is a prosumer but the country still needs to operate in unison these are questions that arent easy to answer at the best of times they are made significantly more difficult given the scale and rate at which decentralisation is occurring a decade ago britain had 80 individual points of generation to manage today there are nearly one million can we keep up with a system that is decentralising faster that we can adapt to it and how do we support separation while maintaining the stability of the country chapter 3 evolve or die its easy to tell when electricity is working  a light bulb comes on a kettle begins to boil its a far harder task to spot when an electricity system is working because when it works its invisible this might give the impression the system is therefore simple  its not it is a complex web of infrastructure that relies on an incredible number of moving parts working in sync at all times at face value the move towards decentralisation simplifies this system a home with a solar panel on its roof has its electricity source directly attached to what its powering but behind the scenes beyond that single house decentralisation is actually making the whole system more complex to truly understand how and why its doing this we need to fully understand what it takes to make the grid work the big bucket of electricity power generation must exactly match power use at all times of day across the whole country if more electricity is generated on the grid than is needed at that precise moment that excess electricity cant always be stored and used at a later date small amounts can be stored in batteries and larger amounts at pumped hydro storage power stations but a largescale nationwide seasonal storage system would be needed to meet the challenge of storing all excess electricity conversely when demand suddenly surges power stations need to just as quickly ramp up generation to match it it leaves the electricity network in a constant balancing act of supply and demand one way of thinking about this is like a bucket of water with a tap near its top water feeds into the top of this bucket from two different sources which keeps the bucket full and allows the tap to flow freely when its open if too much water is let in the bucket quickly overflows not enough and the tap runs dry so far quite simple but now imagine its not just two sources of water filling up the bucket but many and that there are multiple taps and these sources and taps can open and close at any moment without warning and drastically change how much water is both coming in and out of that bucket the risk of suddenly having too much water and the bucket overflowing grows exponentially as does the possibility of the taps running dry now imagine this system working seamlessly twentyfour hours a day every day in the case of great britains electricity system making sure this constant balancing act happens smoothly is the job of the national grid electricity system operator company which manages the integrated power system by forecasting demand instructing generators to switch on or off and ultimately ensuring constant stability decentralisation however is making this task increasingly tricky its hiding a large part of the electricity being generated and used such as selfgenerating office buildings or homes with solar panels and in cases where generation remains connected to the central grid which is still the majority of time decentralisation has the secondary effect of adding even more complexity to the system by increasing the number of potential points of generation that may or may not be supplying power at any given time this system grows even more complex when we consider the way many of these sources operate solar and wind power operate very differently to more traditional sources they are unable to generate at all times  such as when the weather doesnt permit it  and cant ramp up generation nor easily reduce it in the main where they are not accompanied by storage they are either on or off because of this its necessary to partner these sources with flexible and dispatchable generators that can make up the difference when weather conditions limit renewable generation and can run as backup in case of sudden spikes in demand the grid as a result is a complex web of sources and systems all of which operate in different ways and from different fuels but all must work together to deliver electricity at all times across the country it has grown incredibly complicated but it is also needed to bring some sort of order and stability to the increasingly fractured system the growth of this decentralised system has largely been led by a leap in technological ability a leap that allowed solar panels and storage to become a feasible option for powering homes and communities but to grow and remain stable the grid now needs a similar leap in something far less exciting operational ability keeping the balance in a changing system one of the key challenges electrical engineers had to overcome when constructing the grid was standardising voltage and frequency electricity can operate at a different voltage or frequency depending on how its generated but in a system where electricity was to be shared nationally and used to power different devices across many different wires and cables it had to be standardised  in the uk this was set at 50 hertz hz and 230 volts v monitoring and maintaining this has been a vital part of keeping the grid stable ever since national grid does this through a set of tools called ancillary services but decentralisation through intermittent renewables is making the balancing act these services provide more challenging one example of this is just how much power is actually running through britains power lines as the country decentralises its power lines are increasingly becoming lightly loaded meaning there is less current flowing along them this is because there are more decentralised power sources meeting local demand rather than large power plants supplying wider areas through the integrated network when lines are lightly loaded voltage across the entire network rises when there is a high load on the lines the voltage sinks this is a problem because even small fluctuations can cause damage to equipment and lead to blackouts so this voltage needs to be managed to remain consistent at all times this is done using reactive power  a type of power that helps effectively move electricity from power stations through the system to where its used power generators can add more reactive power to the system  increasing the voltage  or absorb it to lower the voltage unlike the megawatt power that lights and devices all run on reactive power does not travel far its a local product but the balance in each area must be managed to produce the correct conditions for megawatts to flow from region to region the national grids electricity systems operations division eso must direct individual generators to maintain this balance even if distributed generators like wind farms and solar panels are capable of providing reactive services the eso does not have the capability to dispatch thousands of individual units when the grid was first conceived it was built to provide power to a range of demands including heavy industry in factories and shipyards those industries have since declined and have been replaced by small electronic devices which make up so much of electricity demand today large industrial inductive power loads such as those required for steel mills coal mines and other heavy industries brings voltage down and creates a demand for more reactive power explains ian foy head of ancillary services at drax now with more smallpower consumer products service industries and less large motordriven demand the need for active power production is falling keeping the voltage down is the greater concern the result is that drax power station and other thermal power plants now spend more time absorbing reactive power than exporting it to keep voltage levels down in the past by contrast foy says the station would export reactive energy during the day and absorb it at night ancillary services at a glance perhaps an even greater threat to the stability of the network posed by decentralisation is the volatility created by the intermittent sources being added this creates greater need for reserve power which can suddenly jump into action and fill any sudden spikes in demand for generation  for example a football match going into extra time clouds passing over a solar farm or gusting wind this reserve is important in making sure theres enough power to meet demand but it is also critical in keeping the system frequency at 50 hz because when it isnt there can be significant repercussions the effects of major frequency change it was a lightning strike and a sudden drop in frequency that caused great britains first widespread blackout in a decade when in august 2019 a gas power station and an offshore wind farm suffered simultaneous outages the initial lightning strike caused multiple small embedded generators such as small wind turbines solar and small gas generators to trip off the system this was immediately followed by the loss of one module from the hornsea one wind farm and little barford gas fired power station such a large portion of generation coming off the grid  almost 18 gigawatts gw  couldnt be replaced with enough fast acting reserve as the eso was only required to hold 1 gw in reserve at the time which in turn caused an imbalance in supply and demand the imbalance meant frequency dropped below the grids safety limits triggering a string of safety trips that resulted in automatedbutcontrolled power outages across large sections of the country the reality of power generation is things do occasionally go wrong and when a large power station trips and stops supplying electricity to the grid the frequency is pulled down rapidly in an electricity system made up of 10000 rather than 10 different sources of power one or even 10 small sources can suddenly stop working without severely disrupting the grids ability to operate but while this might insure against single large scale changes on the grid it increases the potential for many more smaller ones and this means the act of managing the grid requires a similar approach to the services that stabilise it  more of them called upon more often while its incredibly rare for multiple largescale power generators to cut out at the same time the august 2019 blackout does highlight a strength of a diversified electricity system based around multiple different types of generation in recent times the eso has operated the system with lower levels of inertia than historically due to the closure of large power stations these low inertia conditions mean that it is harder to respond to changes in frequency caused by a sudden increase or decrease in demand or generation the promises of expanding grid scale battery and storage technologies means intermittent renewable generated electricity will be able to provide increasing amounts of these services such as reserve power and voltage management in the future but at present great britain has limited storage at the scale needed to do so  mainly its pumped storage hydro fleet in scotland and wales instead it falls on flexible fast acting thermal generators to provide these services and as more of these are called upon to ensure the grid operates flexibly it becomes far more complex to manage it from a central point the response to this challenge has been to split how national grid operates it from nationwide to regional national grid made the decision to divide its electricity systems operations division eso into a separate company from its electricity transmission et business  which maintains the highvoltage infrastructure in order to better manage the changing nature of the electricity system the national grids distributed resource desk was established in april 2019 to enable power system engineers to give instructions much faster to smaller generators battery storage operators and demand side response dsr suppliers and act as a central coordinating force in a diverse ecosystem this follows a rise in importance of locallyoperated grids also driven by the ambition to provide a degree of autonomy to regional power networks the local grids of great britains electricity system are currently run by six distribution network operators dnos which bring electricity from the national highvoltage transmission system  which national grid et owns and national grid eso controls  onto local electricity networks and into homes dnos own and operate the cables  poles and transformers that make up the local electricity systems however as more electricity generation shifts to a local level their role is changing from dnos to distributed service operators dsos  a oneletter change that makes a big difference instead of just maintaining and repairing the actual physical aspect of the local electricity network dsos will increasingly play a role in actually managing demand storage capacity and generation at a local level this is currently the responsibility of the national grid eso it maintains the generation and demand balance and carries the reserve and ancillary services on behalf of the whole supply system how or even if this responsibility can be delegated is still uncertain one of the first challenges these dsos will run into however will be the imminent growth of another of the key players in the worlds decarbonisation efforts  electric vehicles ev in 2040 britain will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars giving rise to a sudden influx of evs in the preceding two decades national grid esos most recent forecast puts the number of evs it expects to be on uk roads by 2050 at over 30 million  which will in turn create an added electricity demand of close to 50 twh on top of the current national need for just shy of 300 twh this growth will not only require a similar increase in generation capacity but in how that electricity is managed this is because evs wont add an even amount of demand to the grid theyll add spikes at certain times of day  for example when drivers get home from work and all plug in their vehicles to recharge or potentially in the time before rush hour begins the use of intelligent charging systems might be one way to help deal with this increased demand by enabling cars to automatically charge when there is a surplus of electricity and costs are low for consumers smart charging will also allow vehicles to act as distributed storage systems that can store excess electricity from the grid and feed it back when theres high demand this type of technology  called vehicletogrid or v2g  is still in its infancy but it could have a major impact in decentralised systems it will allow buildings to tap into connected vehicles or entire fleets of vehicles for power when demand is high but generation from sources like wind and solar is low it has the potential to bring added stability to the grid in its abilities to store and supply power but it also adds yet again more complexity to the system the difference of this complexity however is that it comes with a way to manage it data the great data revolution smart meters are slowly being rolled out across great britain by the end of 2020 the government has the ambitious aim of installing 50 million in homes and businesses across the country this will vastly increase the amount of data available to help inform decisions on how the grid functions such as what types of generation are available with the lowest carbon emissions or how much reserve power is needed at any given moment across the electricity system carl skerritt head of smart innovation at drax highlights the potential power of this data if youre getting real time readings from every single meter in every single property youll be able to forecast and balance the grid better its not just the organisations controlling electricity generation and balancing that will feel the impact of smart systems for everyday consumers the increased access to information about how they use electricity its cost and its impact could be transformative its an industrial revolution of the energy industry says kerry maisey head of smart integration at drax for years people have had no clarity whatsoever about the energy theyre using that drives a certain type of behaviour where people emotionally disconnect themselves we know we cant keep going on the path we are but its a real cultural shift for people this shift represents a change in our relationship with electricity not seen in generations when the grid first brought electricity into homes it made a noticeable and immediate positive impact to everyday lives people were very aware of their electricity but during the decades that followed it has become an invisible part of modern life it is taken for granted only noticed when bills arrive or in the rare occasion of an outage its an industrial revolution of the energy industry kerry maisey head of smart integration drax smart meters that deliver a more indepth understanding of how we use electricity have the potential to reset the relationship so electricity will be something were all more aware of the devices are also a vital stepping stone in the difficult task of shifting how society thinks about electricity and building the datadriven future of the grid the question is who will own all the detailed data on our electricity consumption and who will control access to it this is where centralisation rather than decentralisation could prove important the data communications company dcc is responsible for the construction and maintenance of a secure smart grid infrastructure which will be instrumental in connecting suppliers dsos and other third parties to allow for universal access to electricity data this could bring benefits similar to how granting access to the data on your phone allows apps to offer tailored services like delivering a pizza to your precise location by agreeing to share electricity data it could open the door to new potential technology offerings maisey suggests this may manifest in services that quickly and automatically switch customers between suppliers as rapidly as every half hour to get the best deal or in services that switch them to suppliers with the most renewable generation in action on any given day as with anything driven by data cybersecurity will consequently become an important part in the world of electricity by protecting individuals and organisations information a central authority that can approve or revoke thirdpartys access to data could prove more secure than spreading control of data across multiple businesses by decreasing the number of potential points of penetration that unauthorised parties could breach and steal data from blockchain technologies will also have the potential to be transformational for the industry as well as a further force for decentralisation distributed platforms like blockchain are maintained by all participants without a central authority so they can execute millions of transactions very quickly and for a very low cost in the case of electricity this could allow even the smallest electricity generator to send electricity to the grid or in a fully decentralised system to peers on a local system what is certain is technology and data have the power to rapidly transform the electricity system together they can enable more accurate forecasting of demand and generation begin to structure and organise the growing numbers of decentralised sources and ultimately help bring order to a rapidly changing system the potential is great but so is the question it raises is the grid  at nearly 100 years old  fit to support this chapter 4 from the gridiron into the future nearly 100 years ago a small group of people hoisted up a pylon and set in motion one of the most dramatic transformations this country has ever seen but the journey that began on that saturday morning in scotland and brings us to todays sprawling complex system is not a linear one it is only with the benefit of hindsight we can map out how charles merz stanley baldwin and the rogue engineers of the ceb managed to build a grid that integrated electricity across the country today we find ourselves in a similar position we are once again at the beginning of a transformation but where this will lead and how our electricity system will eventually look is difficult to define because the grid is always changing  its written into its dna the grid was built to propel the country into a new age of economic and technological development but by transforming the country it powered it created a requirement for itself to change it must change with  and for  the world it helps create this is whats driving its transformation today were in the middle of an energy revolution that needs us to transition out of the coalpowered gridiron that merz envisioned and into a much more complex renewablypowered and techenabled future the promise of that first centralised grid was electricity whenever we need it wherever we are but today were looking to fulfil a new promise  electricity whenever we need it wherever we are created in a cleaner way this is the promise of a decentralised grid its impossible to know exactly what shape this grid will take but we know where were headed with data at its heart driven by smart meters the efficiencies and stability a centralised electricity system created will remain essential but so will increasing the level of decentralised and intermittent generation we can be certain more communities businesses and homes will generate their own electricity the grid will need to play a crucial role in supporting and stabilising this its a role quite different from its historic one of just a physical backbone for the power system instead this grid will need to be a centralised entity that ensures electricity remains accessible and reliable for everyone that uses technology and data to bring order to the millions of new points of generation and storage and that brings stability to a network of sources generating at different times in different places and in different ways the grid will be the force that connects and powers us and even though it will run through many similar cables and cross the same country it did 100 years ago it will be a very different thing but it will be a national grid and we will remain on it chapter 1 great
