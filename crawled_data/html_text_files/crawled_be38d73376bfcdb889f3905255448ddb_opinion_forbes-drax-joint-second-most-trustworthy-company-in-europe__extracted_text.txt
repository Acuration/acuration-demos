tax should follow into other areas of corporate governance will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 22 april 2016 opinion im delighted that drax group plc has been named by forbes magazine and msci esg research as one of the 50 most trustworthy companies in europe  in fact drax came joint second across the whole continent among companies judged who consistently demonstrated transparent accounting practices and solid corporate governance its a massive tribute to everyone involved with drax that worldleading business experts have recognised our commitment to trust and integrity in this way of course that commitment goes much further than our accounting practices alone i believe my british colleagues would say that it runs right through drax like the writing in a stick of rock indeed it was one of the reasons i was so honoured to be asked to join drax as cfo  from my very first meeting with ceo dorothy thompson i could see that drax would always strive do the right thing in the right way thats just as true for our sustainability data as it is for our business data it was our commitment to doing the right thing that led drax to take on the decision to convert drax power station from coal to compressed wood pellets  it is our commitment to doing the right thing that means drax is reducing emissions by over 80 per cent while giving people and businesses all over the uk the reliable renewable power that they need and we know we can save billpayers money at the same time the uk is lagging far behind the rest of europe when it comes to generating energy from compressed wood pellets drax is committed to bringing us closer to the european average while helping us move from the fossil fuels of the past to the renewables of the future and yes you can trust us on that
