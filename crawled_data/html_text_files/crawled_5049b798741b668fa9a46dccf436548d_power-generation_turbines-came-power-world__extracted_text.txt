power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station how turbines came to power the world one shipbuilders design still helps power much of the modern world 5 september 2018 power generation charles algernon parsons knew he was onto something in 1884 the young engineer had joined a ship engineering firm and developed a steam turbine engine which he immediately saw had a bigger potential than powering boats he connected it to a dynamo turning it into a generator capable of producing up to 75 kilowatts kw of power and in the process kickstarted an electrical and mechanical revolution that would reshape how electricity was produced and how the world worked today turbinebased generation is the dominant method for electricity production throughout the world and even now  almost a century and a half later  parsons turbine concept remains largely unchanged even if the world around it has steam dreams throughout the 20 th and into the current century electricity generation has depended on steam power be it in a coal nuclear or biomass power plant heating water into highly pressurised steam is at the core of production greek mathematician and inventor hero of alexandria is cited as building the first ever steam engine of sorts with his aeolipile  which used steam to spin a hollow metal sphere but it wasnt until the 18 th century when english ironmonger thomas newcomen designed an  albeit inefficient  engine to pump water out of flooded mines that steam became a credible power in industry scottish engineer james watt from whose name the unit of energy comes from built on these humble beginnings and turned steam into the power behind the industrial revolution around 1764 when he added an condensing chamber to newcomens original design  it was the combination of this engine with thomas edisons electrical generator late in the 19 th century that first made largescale electricity production from steam a reality the turbine takes over steam engines and steam power was not a new concept when parson began his explorations in the space in fact nor were steam turbines others had explored ways to use streams velocity to spin blades rather than using its pressure to pump pistons in turn allowing rotors to spin at much greater speeds while requiring less raw fuel what made parsons design so important was its ability to keep rotational speeds moderate while also extracting as much kinetic energy from steam jets as possible he explained in a 1911 rede lecture that this was done by splitting up the fall in pressure of the steam into small fractional expansions over a large number of turbines in series which ensured there was no one place the velocity of the blades was too great the designs strength was also apparent at scale in 1900 his company which was eventually acquired by siemens  was building turbinegenerator units capable of producing 1000 kw of electricity by 1912 however the company was installing a 25000 kw unit for the city of chicago parsons would live to see units reach 50000 kw and become the primary source of electricity generation around the world turbines in the modern grid the world is a vastly different place to the one in which parson designed his turbine yet the fundamentals of his concept have changed very little the results of what they achieve and the scales at which they work however have increased significantly today the turbines that make up draxs six generating units are each capable of producing more than 600 mw or 6000000 kw of electricity with the shape materials and arrangement of blades carefully designed to maximise efficiency and while that first design was purely with steam in mind turbine technology has advanced beyond dependency on a single power source and has been developed to accommodate for the shift towards lowercarbon power sources one such example is gas turbines which work by sucking in air through a compressor which is then heated by burning natural gas in turn spinning a turbine as it expands these can jump into action much faster than other turbines as they dont require any steam to be created to power them renewable sources such as hydro and wind power also depend on spinning turbines to generate electricity where these differ from gas or steampowered turbines is that rather than being encased in metal and blasted with gases wind and hydro turbines blades are exposed so flowing air or water can spin them powering a generator in turn turbine technology helped bring access to electricity around the world but the ingenuity and flexibility of the design means it is now serving to adapt electricity production for the postcoal age share related stories press releases on pawtrol sparky the robodog enhances safety at uks
