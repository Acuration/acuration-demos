29 august 2023 drax today announced its membership to the first movers coalition fmc playing its part in the development of the nascent carbon dioxide removals cdr market and working toward becoming a global leader in the potentially trilliondollar sector the fmc which was launched at cop26 by us special presidential envoy for climate john kerry is a coalition of companies who use their collective purchasing power to create early markets for innovative clean technologies led by the world economic forum and the us department of state the fmc is currently focused on addressing eight hard to abate industries which are currently responsible for 30 of global emissions such as shipping and aviation drax will join the carbon dioxide removals group comprised of businesses with commitments to purchase durable and scalable carbon removals from solutions such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  a vital new technology in which drax is a pioneer carbon removals are used by organizations to balance their hardtoabate carbon emissions achieve a net zero and in some cases a carbon negative status longer lasting and lower risk carbon credits such as the types generated by carbon removals technologies are increasing in demand as more organizations look to hit their decarbonization targets the commitments to carbon dioxide removals we are seeing in the market now are essential to accelerating the deployment of climate saving technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which we will need to meet our climate goals said will gardiner ceo of drax group we welcome the opportunity to join the world economic forum in their efforts developing early markets for innovative technologies like beccs we are thrilled to welcome drax to the first movers coalition and look forward to working alongside the company to drive the acceleration of the global carbon removals market said nancy gillis program head of the first movers coalition at the world economic forum the first movers coalition believes that reducing emissions to netzero by 2050 is possible if the right technologies are brought to commercial scale within the next decade and we need companies like drax to champion this mission to enact the change we need said gillis with the right government engagement drax plans to invest billions over the coming years in global carbon removals and renewable energy projects with the aim of capturing 14mt a year of carbon removals by 2030 globally and to be a global leader in carbon removal projects through beccs drax aims to be a global

accelerating its progress in the development of global beccs projects nearly all pathways to limit global warming to 15c require carbon removal technologies such as beccs the ipcc believes that globally up to 95 billion tons of cdrs via beccs will be required per year by 2050 carbon dioxide removals can be used by organizations to balance their hardtoabate carbon emissions achieve a net zero and in some cases a carbon negative status longer lasting and lower risk carbon credits such as the types generated by carbon removals technologies are increasing in demand as more organisations look to hit their decarbonization targets about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcomus power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonization project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilization and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target

and supply the group has 19 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tons a year drax is targeting 8 million tons of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tons of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers in europe and asia customers drax supplies renewable electricity to uk businesses offering a range of energyrelated services including energy optimization as well as electric vehicle strategy and management to find out more go to the website wwwenergydraxcom about first movers coalition the first movers coalition is a global initiative harnessing the purchasing power of companies to decarbonize seven hardtoabate industrial sectors that currently account for 30 percent of global emissions aluminium aviation chemicals concrete shipping steel and trucking along with innovative carbon removal technologies the coalitions members commit in advance to purchasing a proportion of the industrial materials and
