you realise its not an obvious one 9 april 2018 electrification theres a common perception of how innovation happens someone locked in a dark room has a lightbulb moment and with a finger click a worldchanging idea is born this is true for the most part without people of immense passion ambition and energy we wouldnt have much of the technology we take for granted today but it doesnt tell the whole story many of the worlds most innovative technologies have come about thanks to great minds combined with institutional support in fact economist and author mariana mazzucato has argued that of the 100 most important innovations from 1971 to 2006 as identified by rd magazine almost 90 depended heavily on government research support  gps although an inherent part of nearly every smart or connected device global positioning system gps technology wasnt developed by a smartphone manufacturer like apple or samsung  its a product of the us department of defense  in 1964 roger easton a scientist at the us naval research laboratory began experimenting with satellite tracking to understand the path of satellites in 1974 he was awarded a patent for a system which became gps it was subsequently used by the us military to gain a more accurate understanding of the global position of its assets but in 1998 us vice president al gore announced a plan that would make gps satellites transmit two additional signals that could be used for civilian means for example ensuring aircraft safety leading the way for its inclusion in any number of devices tesla creator of the first commercially successful electric sports car and some of the most promising battery technology in the energy industry tesla is arguably one of the most exciting companies of the past few decades much of this is owed to the groundbreaking vision of its ceo elon musk however it is equally indebted to early government support telsa received a 465 million loan from the us department of energy in 2009 while two of musks other companies solarcity and spacex have also received substantial support in total musks three companies have received 49 billion in us government support  jet engines today jet engines take millions of people around the world every minute but before the second world war they only existed in labs while training for the royal air force raf in the late 1920s coventryborn engineer frank whittle outlined in a thesis the idea of using a gas turbine to propel a jet  at the time he struggled to drum up any interest with the uks air ministry believing the concept was impractical nevertheless whittle went on found his company power jets and prove his engines design in a lab in 1937 with the political landscape in europe becoming increasingly tense the air ministry soon realised the potential importance of jet engines it signed a contract in 1939 for power jets to develop an engine for aircraft manufacturer gloster the internet one of the most important innovations of the last 50 years the internet has its roots in the us military in the 1960s the department of defense developed a communication system that could directly link computers called the arpanet advanced research projects agency network this led to further development of computerconnecting systems and in the mid 80s british computer scientist tim bernerslee who at the time was working cern developed the worldwide web leading to the increasingly connected world we know today microchips in 1959 texas instruments  one of the usas leading electronics companies announced the launch of the integrated circuit  a small selfcontained circuit that didnt require additional disparate parts to function the potential of this early microchip was huge but it was expensive to produce which limited its growth when the government realised it could use microchips to improve its missile and rocket guidance systems  it fuelled an increased demand that facilitated mass production of the new technology and sparked the beginning of true growth the black box in 1950 australias aeronautical research laboratory asl was trying to figure out why british comet aircraft were crashing  chemist david warren was researching fuels for newlyarrived jet engines when he realised what asl needed was not speculations on crashing comets but more data on what was happening inside the planes development of the black box was gradual as it evolved from a simple tape recording of pilots conversation the concept was even passed over by the royal australian air force it was a visit by sir robert hardingham the secretary of the british air registration board in 1958 that eventually led to warren presenting the idea at the uks royal aeronautical establishment production of what we now know as a black box soon began in the uk touch screens modern touchscreen technology was initially developed by the university of kentucky but it wasnt until 1996 when the nsf and cia began funding research at the university of delaware that the technology truly took off in 2001 the first touchscreen tablet was introduced by a company called fingerworks  which was started by the university of delaware research team in 2005 apple purchased their technology and adapted it to create the iphone screen which led to the technologys ubiquity across many of the smart devices we use today renewable and low carbon energy transforming an entire industry takes time but when the matter is as urgent as decarbonising power generation on a national or global scale government backing of the technologies making this possible is crucial the electric revolution or electricity era will positively impact heating manufacturing transport and other industries to lower their own carbon intensity the uk is aiming to drive adoption of renewable technologies and nuclear power through its contracts for difference cfd scheme it works by generators being paid the difference between the strike price  the cost of electricity with investment in the lowcarbon technology factored in  and the market price to stabilise revenues for lowcarbon suppliers an earlier scheme the renewables obligation ro  now closed to new projects in favour of cfds involves power generators receiving renewable obligation certificates rocs for every megawatthour mwh of electricity they generate if they fail to meet their obligation to produce renewable power they pay a penalty cfds allow for longerterm certainty both for suppliers and consumers of power on a smaller scale feedin tariffs support adoption of renewable technologies by property owners with payments to cover the electricity it generates in excess of its own usage encouraging investment its not easy to get a new technology up and running  or to adapt and improve it to a challenge such as manmade climate change the infrastructure investment the supplier network the manufacturing of multiple facilities all take time and investment it often means companies at the vanguard of cutting edge industries need to spend a few years investing money before they and their shareholders stand to see any returns cfds encourage businesses to secure their shareholders approval to commit capital over periods of a decade or more such investment has enabled wind nuclear and biomass projects to get off the ground more quickly whereas without a cfd the upfront costs may have been prohibitive where flexible low carbon biomass power generation at drax is concerned its providing certainty up to 2027 after which we hope to be able to operate subsidyfree the examples above show how early government support has been so critical in spurring commercial investment  and why it has played a large part in developing the industries and technologies we now see as innovative this process of innovation may be more than a lightbulb moment but it does help keep the lights on share related stories press releases on pawtrol sparky the robodog enhances safety at uks
