Visit Drax Power Station
Drax Power Station provides the most renewable power of any single location in the UK, some 14 terawatt-hours or enough electricity to power the equivalent of four million homes. To do this, Drax runs on a massive scale. We’ve got 4 operational boilers, as high as a 15-storey office block, a main chimney taller than the London Eye, and over 1,800 miles of steel tubing, enough to stretch from John O’Groats to Land’s End and back again. It’s a site etched on the local landscape since 1974 and on a tour at Drax you can see it all first-hand. Even better, our tours are free, and available throughout the year.
The tour of Drax Power Station offers a captivating and educational experience to a wide range of groups such as local businesses, organised members clubs as well as students in key stage 2 – 4. Regardless of background, all interested individuals can immerse themselves in the fascinating world of energy generation. From start to finish, participants will gain valuable insights into the intricate energy generation process employed at Drax, witnessing first-hand how electricity is produced on a massive scale.
Moreover, visitors will learn about Drax’s social impact within local communities, the pivotal role biomass plays in ensuring energy security and renewable power as well as a look into the future of our BECCS project, the future of carbon dioxide removal which will mitigate climate change and foster a cleaner, more sustainable energy landscape. All our tours include an interactive presentation, a bus tour around the site as well as a guided walk inside the very heart of the station.
