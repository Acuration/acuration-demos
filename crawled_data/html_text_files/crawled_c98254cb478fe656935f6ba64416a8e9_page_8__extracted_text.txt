people strategy to 2020  one drax it has been designed to address the key issues that were raised by employees in our 2016 employee survey such as the need for clearer learning and development programmes and more effective internal communications the strategy focuses on valuing our people  driving business performance and developing talent to deliver our strategic and operational objectives we launched the five aspects of the strategy my career my performance our behaviours our reward my recognition in 2018 we will focus on all of these aspects and in particular our reward my recognition and my career behavioural framework we have developed a number of hr programmes in line with our people strategy the foundation of this is a new behavioural framework that identifies positive behaviours reflecting our company values honest energised achieving together the behaviours are integrated into all areas of our people management processes at drax group the hr team consulted with one in five employees across the business including senior leaders and union representatives to develop the framework in 2018 we will further embed the behavioural framework and our company values into our culture by developing an online tool for employees to evaluate how they demonstrate the behaviours developing our people  apprenticeships at drax power we have a proud history of apprenticeships  with the majority remaining to work at drax and progressing through the company mick moore joined drax on 7 september 1976 as a craft apprentice on completion of his apprenticeship mick continued to further his education and completed an hnc in electrical  electronic engineering after a 10year break he resumed his further education graduating from humberside  lincolnshire

certification programmes such as the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council fsc and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc these evidence sustainable forest management practices but do not yet encompass regulatory requirements for reporting greenhouse gas ghg emissions  this is a critical gap for biomass generators who are obligated to report ghg emissions to european regulators there is also limited uptake of forestlevel certification schemes in some key forest source areas sbp is working to address these challenges sbp certification provides assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements for the users of biomass for energy production are met the tool is a unique certification scheme designed for woody biomass mostly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips used in industrial largescale energy production sbp certification is achieved via a rigorous assessment of wood pellet and wood chip producers and biomass traders carried out by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee tags biomass

telecommunications construction manufacturing technology real estate and energy sectors constructed in 2009 the biomass plant in portugal is one of the strategic investments of the group in the renewable energy sector the plant has an annual biomass production of 150000 tonnes supplying both the international industrial and the internal domestic biomass markets drax worked closely with pinewells in 2017 to ensure the feedstock used for production is both harvested lawfully and sustainable by meeting the requirements of the drax supplier data return and thirdparty audit working with the forest and quality engineers at pinewells we have supported the company to develop and implement their monitoring and inspection system within their own supply base key features of this system include deskbased research to determine the characterisation of harvesting areas and field audits to approve the felling areas highlight the good forest practice guide and deliver focused training this work has provided a valuable foundation for pinewells to implement the sustainable biomass program sbp within their supply chain working with drax this year has provided us guidance and

group of major european utilities to promote the continuous improvement of corporate responsibility in the coal supply chain  with a specific focus on the mines themselves through membership of the bettercoal initiative drax aims to ensure that the coal industry respects peoples rights and makes a positive contribution to the social and economic livelihoods of workers producers and communities the bettercoal code sets out 10 social environmental and ethical principles it is not a certification body but outlines a process for assessing coal suppliers performance against the ten principles suppliers complete selfassessment questionnaires and approved assessors conduct bettercoal assessments continuous improvement plans are developed jointly with the supplier and summary results are shared with bettercoal members all bettercoalengaged mines sign a letter of commitment at the outset which outlines their responsibilities if a mine then falls short of these expectations such as by not following up on the continuous improvement plan put in place by their auditors then they would lose their status as a bettercoalengaged mine drax ended its membership of bettercoal in june 2020

highbiodiversity woodland settings for people living with a terminal illness haven power has been supporting the trusts ambitious brickmakers wood project in ipswich since april 2016 brickmakers wood is a threeandahalfacre site that is being transformed into a peaceful space for cancer patients disadvantaged children and people with mental or physical health problems and learning difficulties throughout 2017 up to 12 haven power employees spent time volunteering at the project each month volunteers contributed to the restoration of the site and relished getting their hands dirty clearing rubbish and dense overgrowth building new structures creating an allotment and planting wild flowers without haven powers contribution the charity founders would have had to undertake most of the work at brickmakers wood themselves in their words the continual volunteering has transformed the project so we are now two to three years ahead of where we would have been otherwise the site is being transformed into a town centre oasis and has already been put to good use the charity has run skills workshops for 1216 year olds who have been excluded from school encouraging them to learn about woodcraft and how to run a business tags haven power  sustainability giving up coal tony juniper author adviser and environmental campaigner 7 december 2017 opinion tony juniper is an environmental campaigner author and director at robertsbridge a consultancy helping advise drax on its sustainability programmes back in 2006 while working as director at friends of the earth i approved a new report to be published in support of our then campaign for a new climate change act we wanted to show uk government ministers how it would indeed be possible to make cuts in emissions so that by 2050 the uk could progressively have reduced greenhouse gas pollution by 80 per cent compared with emissions in 1990 it was a radical and demanding agenda that wed adopted and it was important to show the practical steps that could be made in achieving it the analysis we presented was based on an electricity sector model that we had developed different data and assumptions could be inputted and using this we set out six possible lower carbon futures in our best case scenario we foresaw how it would be feasible to slash emissions by about 70 per cent by 2030 this was based on an ambitious energy efficiency programme and a shift away from fossil energy and toward renewables including wind and solar power in that renewables mix was also an important role for biomass to replace coal in the countrys largest power station  drax this was not only crucial for backing up intermittent renewable sources but also a key piece in a future electricity sector that we believed should avoid the construction of new nuclear power stations in november 2008 our campaign succeeded and the uk was the first country in the world to adopt a new national law for the sciencebased reduction of greenhouse gas emissions since then ive been working as an independent sustainability advisor including with the advisory group robertsbridge of which i was a cofounder my work has included assisting various companies in meeting the targets set out in that new law for example i was the chair of the industry campaign action for renewables which sought government and public support for the largescale expansion of wind tidal and wave power different campaigners tried to stop the expansion of these renewable sources of electricity however and succeeded in derailing support for onshore wind power developments although in its infancy concerns were also raised about proposals for different kinds of tidal power in the years after the climate change act i was encouraged to see that drax began to switch over to wood pellets to generate power but concerned to see that this too had come under attack the broadly agreed view that sustainable biomass could have a role in the phase out of coal had gone and in its place were claims that it was actually worse than burning coal it was against this backdrop of changed perspectives that myself and robertsbridge colleagues were pleased to be invited to help drax in devising a new sustainability plan early on in our conversations with drax it became clear that part of the challenge with biomass  deciding the extent to which it is a rational choice to help with the process of decarbonisation is how the answer to that touches so many different issues for example when it comes to the exit from coal cleaner alternatives must be brought forward to replace it including wind and solar power but although these sources of renewable energy are growing rapidly they still come with their own challenges especially because wind cant generate on still days and solar ceases at night this intermittency raises issues about what the best electricity storage or complementary clean power sources might be to back them up when needed there are important questions about the best sources of biomass and the extent to which longdistance transport of that fuel is desirable on top of that are issues linked with the management of the forests from which the raw material is sourced and whether the extraction of wood to generate power can be compatible with carbon neutrality there is the matter of nature conservation and the extent to which wood fuel demand will affect the status of species and habitats of conservation concern for example to what extent might the wood pellet industry be driving the conversion of seminatural woodlands to plantations all of this is bound up with the economic and social conditions prevailing in the landscapes from which the wood is derived and the extent to which those buying wood fuel can pursue positive outcomes for the environment even when carbon and wildlife are at best of marginal concern to the local forest owners growing the wood then there is the extent to which economic incentives might be linked with the carbon stocks held in the forest for example strong demand for wood is held to be the main reason why since the 1950s the volume of carbon stored in standing timber in the forests of the us south has increased by over 100 demand for wood might seem counterintuitive as a positive factor in maintaining tree cover but in the us south it has been a big part of the picture on top of all this is the question of what would happen if there were no demand for wood fuel in landscapes that have seen volatility in demand arising from the decline in newsprint in favour of digital devices and the slowdown in us house building following the 2008 financial crisis this is not easy to answer although seeking answers is a complex task our advice to drax was that it should work with its many stakeholders in finding the best possible fit between its business planning and these and other questions one way of doing that would be to set out the different issues in an accessible manner and hence the production of the film that can be seen here  its called  the biomass sustainability story  and while most of us can agree with the basic idea that we have to stop burning coal it seems the big questions are about what might be the best ways to do it might biomass have a role i believe it does have a look at the film and see what you think especially if you feel as though youve already made up your mind tags biomass energy  climate change  coal  fossil fuels  renewable energy  sustainability  wood pellets 7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass policy 28 november 2017 sustainable bioenergy biomass is playing an important role in moving the uk away from coal at drax power station in the form of compressed wood pellets  biomass is already supplying roughly 17 of great britains renewable power  but more than just being a low carbon replacement for fossil fuel generation it is also crucial in maintaining the stability of the power network among renewable sources of power biomass is unique in being able to provide the same range of ancillary services that can be provided by coal power stations  such as frequency control and inertia  this inherrent flexibility is vital in maintaining stability on britains high voltage transmission system wood pellets can also reliably generate power helping to fill in the gaps left by intermittent renewables when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine and avoiding reliance on diesel coal and gas however for the uk and the wider global environment to reap the maximum benefits from biomass it must be produced sustainably more than this its supply chain must be low in emissions so that clear savings can be made versus power generation with fossil fuels to ensure this the use of biomass is regulated in the uk under eu timber regulations and the renewables obligation ro  but further guidelines are set to be introduced as part of the european parliaments update to the renewable energy directive red which will specify criteria for all biomass there is a clear need for this but for these to be truly successful they need to be based on a set of robust key principles a new report by drax outlines seven of these which can ensure sustainable biomass usage in the future 1 forest biomass for bioenergy should be sourced from sustainable forests the sustainability of the forests from which biomass is sourced is key to ensuring its usage has a positive impact on the environmental social and economic health of that supply region for example a properly managed forest can boost carbon stock as the younger faster growing trees that are replanted after felling absorb more co 2 than older overmature trees thinning operations also increase the growth of the biggest and best trees  ensuring more carbon is stored in longer term solid wood products generators should be able to demonstrate they are avoiding biomass sourced from higherrisk areas where extracting biomass could cause longterm carbon stock decreases in soils or ecosystems as well as other factors such as biodiversity loss soil erosion or depletion of water sources 2 bioenergy from forest biomass should not be produced from highrisk feedstocks feedstocks the raw materials turned into biomass pellets must come from sustainable sources and avoid protected and sensitive sites that could be considered a risk in 2016 around 40 of all feedstock supplied to drax originated as a sawmill residue  processes such as thinning also serve as a source of biomass feedstock while also benefitting the overall health and quality of the forest thinning a semi mature stand of trees allows the forest owner to maximise the production of higher value sawtimber trees storing more carbon and generating more stable revenue streams having a variety of wood products markets from saw logs through to biomass incentivises land owners to maintain healthy forests and reduces the risk of conversion of forest to agriculture or urban development 3 carbon savings and emissions should be properly accounted to understand the effectiveness of biomass sustainability policy carbon savings need to be measured factors such as fossil fuel substitution and the emissions associated with harvesting processing and transporting biomass are relatively straightforward to measure 4 bioenergy should be limited to what can be sustainably supplied unlike coal or oil which will eventually run out more trees can be planted grown and harvested that said there is a natural limit to the amount of biomass available on the planet and so it should not be considered an infinite resource this is why its crucial biomass is sourced from sustainable forests managed following set guidelines in short to ensure biomass truly is sustainable it is essential that working forests are actively managed and maintain or increase productivity  5 support should be given to all technologies that achieve significant carbon savings one of the major advantages of biomass over other renewable sources is its potential to help the uk rapidly adapt to meet the eu target of achieving 27 of final energy consumption from renewables the fastest way for biomass to make an impact to the uks carbon emissions is through converting coal power stations to biomass  as is the case at drax power station this repurposing of existing facilities not only offers rapid adoption of renewable energy but also the ability to provide vital ancillary services other renewable sources cant quickly deploying biomass solutions in this manner will serve to help it become an established part of the energy system as it continues to decarbonise 6 the efficient use of raw materials is supported by encouraging buoyant forest biomass markets globally there are substantial amounts of forest residue and forestry industry byproducts that currently go unused biomass should be sourced from regions where the largest surpluses exist and the forest carbon balance can be maintained to enable this to function effectively on a global scale trade restrictions should be avoided pelletisation offers one of the most efficient ways for this raw material to be used by making it safe costefficient and lowcarbon to transport around the world these principals are tried and tested by drax and known to protect forests and ecosystems  as well as optimise supply chains to ensure carbon emissions are kept to a minimum ultimately draxs experience in sustainably using biomass serve as a guide for other producers and governments to quickly decarbonise energy systems 7 the sustainability of forest biomass should be independently verified one of the best ways to guarantee biomass is sourced sustainably is by introducing thirdparties and official guidelines that generators and suppliers can work with in europe forest level management certification schemes can act as an effective indicator that forests are managed in accordance with the guidelines laid out by forest europe  outside of europe where drax sources most of its biomass  independent third part auditors can ensure the uks stringent criteria are being met on the ground read the full report the 7
