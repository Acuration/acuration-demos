Drax invests £6M in Galloway Hydro Scheme refurbishment
Press releases

The Glenlochar Barrage, a 103-meter-long bridge that spans across the river Dee, controls the flow of water from Loch Ken to Tongland power station through its six sluice gates. Built in 1934, the barrage is a critical component of the scheme’s operations, which can produce enough renewable electricity to power 218,000 homes.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Head of Hydro, said:
“The Galloway Hydro Scheme has been generating flexible, renewable electricity for almost a century, and this major refurbishment will ensure it continues to do so for many years to come.
“Scotland has a long and proud history of hydroelectricity, and with this project Drax is ensuring these power stations play an important part in securing a net zero carbon future for our country.”
Drax acquired the Galloway hydro scheme alongside the Lanark hydro scheme and the Cruachan pumped-hydro storage facility in Argyll in January 2019, helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible, low carbon and renewable power generation.
Over the next three years Drax will fully refurbish the barrage, alongside its project partners KGAL Consulting Engineers and AJT Engineering, to ensure the hydro scheme can continue to generate renewable electricity for many decades to come.
Construction of the Glenlochar Barrage
Andy Neill, AJT Engineering’s divisional manager, said:
“We are delighted to be able to support Drax on this major project with our extensive experience in this type refurbishment works, extending the life span of critical infrastructure for future generations.”
Nicholas Crosby, KGAL’s associate director, said: “A number of our engineers started their careers with the original supplier of the gates, so it’s appropriate that they now apply their skills to extending the life of this structure.”
Commissioned in the mid-1930s, the Galloway Hydro Scheme was the first large-scale integrated hydro-electric complex to be built in Britain and consists of six power stations, eight dams and a network of tunnels, aqueducts and pipelines. At its peak during construction, more than 1,500 people were employed on the project.
ENDS
Editor’s notes
Local people will be kept informed of the project by Drax and its contractors through community information sessions. As piece of key infrastructure, the barrage will remain operational throughout the refurbishment to manage water levels.

Press releases

Energy company Drax is kickstarting careers in engineering by extending its apprenticeship scheme across Scotland.
Drax has appointed the new apprentices as part of its commitment to STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) education, ensuring its workforce in Scotland has the skills needed to support a post-covid economic recovery.
Nathan Harbinson, Lanark apprentice
Mike Maudsley, Drax Group’s UK Portfolio Generation Director, said:
“Meeting our apprentices is one of the highlights of my job – these are the young people with the enthusiasm and raw talent to deliver the cutting-edge technologies of the future.
“Through these apprenticeships we aim to nurture that talent so they develop valuable skills – we want to have a workforce with the expertise that Drax, and Scotland, needs to thrive, especially as we recover from the Covid-crisis.”
Ross Davie – Daldowie apprentice
The budding engineers will join Drax at its Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station, in Argyll and Bute, Galloway hydro power scheme, Lanark hydro power scheme and the Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow.
Ross Davie, aged 18, who has joined Drax’s Daldowie fuel from waste plant as a technical apprentice, said: “It has been a very uncertain time for young people like me looking to start their careers over the last few months, because of Covid. To not only secure an engineering apprenticeship, but one based at Drax’s Daldowie plant, is incredibly exciting.”
This is the second time Drax has invested in apprenticeships at its Scottish sites since it acquired them as part of a wider portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable assets at the start of last year. The continued investment in young people has been welcomed by the Scottish Government.
Jamie Hepburn, Skills Minister, said:
“As we recover from the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic it is vital that we continue to develop Scotland’s young workforce to equip people with the skills they need to succeed while meeting the emerging needs and opportunities of our employers and economy.
“Apprenticeships are not only valuable for our young people, they are a fantastic way for all employers to invest in their workforce and provide the skills the economy needs now and in the future.
“I am delighted that Drax continues to nurture new talent by appointing apprentices as part of its commitment to STEM skills and training. I would also like to take this opportunity to wish all those starting out in a new career the very best.”
Drax’s technical apprenticeship scheme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside highly qualified engineers. It is a four-year programme, and specialises in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation.

COVID lockdown made Britain’s electricity system cleaner and cheaper, but harder to control
31 August 2020
Press releases

Latest Drax Electric insights report shows renewables up 32% year-on-year as biomass, wind and solar set new generation records in Q2 2020.
Cleanest ever quarter as carbon emissions fall by a third compared to the same period last year, and the carbon intensity of electricity fell to an all-time low of 21 g/kWh on the Spring Bank Holiday.
Wholesale power prices down 42% from same quarter last year as demand plummets during lockdown.
Cost to balance the grid rises to over £100 million per month as pumped hydro storage and CCGTs called on to manage low demand and high generation from wind and solar sources.
As businesses shut up shop and millions of people were furloughed or working from home during the second quarter of 2020,
independent analysis
, conducted via Imperial Consultants, by academics from Imperial College London for Drax Electric Insights shows the impact this had on our electricity system.
Lower electricity demand combined with exceptional weather propelled renewables to their greatest ever share of electricity, forcing prices and carbon emissions down to record levels, as well as reducing the need for nuclear and fossil fuel power. At one point renewable electricity sources were providing almost 70% (69.5%) of Britain’s electricity.
The report also highlights how this combination of reduced demand and increased renewable generation meant a record amount of money was spent on keeping the system stable between April and June.
The quarterly-average cost of balancing the power system, expressed as a percentage of the cost of generation [click to view/download]
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and lead author of the quarterly Electric Insights reports, said:
“The past few months have given the country a glimpse into the future for our power system, with higher levels of renewable energy and lower demand make for a difficult balancing act. To help the country decarbonise further it is vital that flexible technologies which provide power and system stability play an increasing role in our grid.”
Alongside keeping power supply and demand perfectly in balance, National Grid ESO must also stabilise the system. It does this by ensuring there is not just the right amount of megawatts available to meet demand – but also the right kind of MWs.
During Q2 wind and solar power provided a lot of the electricity required by the grid, which helped the carbon intensity fall to 153 g/kWh averaged over the quarter – its lowest on record. However, these technologies are unable to provide all the services needed to stabilise the system, such as inertia, which is essential for maintaining the grid’s frequency at 50Hz and preventing power cuts.
Whilst wholesale prices fell 42% as a result of falling demand during the period, balancing prices rose from being just 5% of wholesale prices typically over the last decade to 20%, with the cost of the actions taken to stabilise the system averaging £100 million per month during the first half of this year.
Mike Maudsley, Drax Group’s UK Portfolio Generation Director
Mike Maudsley, Drax Group’s UK Portfolio Generation Director, said:
“It has been a challenging time for everyone in the country and for our power system. The last few months have underlined the importance of flexible, low carbon technologies to enable the UK’s power system to evolve and provide the secure and sustainable electricity supplies a zero carbon economy needs.”

Editor’s notes
Electric Insights Q2 2020 report [click to view/download]
The lockdown shattered power system records:
Electricity output from wind, solar and biomass were each up more than 10% on this quarter last year.
May was Britain’s first coal-free calendar month since the Industrial Revolution as the country went an unprecedented 67 days without the fuel on the grid.
Demand fell to its lowest levels this century, falling below 17 GW on the 28th of June.
The country’s four pumped hydro storage power stations supplied a record 7.9% of power at one stage during the quarter as they helped to balance the system and keep it stable.

Will Gardiner responds to BECCS report for BEIS by Ricardo AEA
25 August 2020
Press releases

“This report provides further confirmation that the UK’s target of being
net zero
by 2050 is only achievable with negative emissions delivered by bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (
BECCS
) – a technology which Drax is pioneering and with the right policy and investment framework from government, could develop at scale in the 2020s.
“Developing BECCS will not only deliver for the climate but also for the economy, powering a post-Covid green recovery – whilst positioning the UK as a world-leader in a ground-breaking new technology.
“It is the most cost-effective negative emissions technology available and uniquely it also produces flexible, renewable electricity – demand for which will grow as the economy decarbonises further.”

‘Hollow Mountain’ Cruachan Power Station set for £1M upgrade
Press releases

The upgrade will see the station’s current programmable logic controller (PLC) computer system replaced with a new design to put the station at the cutting edge of energy technology to improve Cruachan’s efficiency. World-leading control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.
Cruachan plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid-19 pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.
The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases. In July, Cruachan became the first power station in Britain to provide critical system support services to the National Grid as part of
a world-first stability contract
aimed at reducing the threat of blackouts.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax Group’s Head of Hydro, said:
“Cruachan plays a critical role in supporting renewable energy in Scotland and stabilising the electricity grid.
“As the country continues to decarbonise, the station’s flexibility has never been more important. This upgrade will ensure the Hollow Mountain can deliver the fast, flexible power that hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses rely on for many decades to come.”
Control room operator at Cruachan Power Station
ITI has a long history with Cruachan and the other hydro assets which Drax owns and operates in Scotland. ITI is the new name for Servelec Controls, the systems integration experts who installed the current PLC control systems in 1987 and built the control system which allows the Lanark and Galloway Hydro Schemes to be remotely managed when needed from Cruachan’s underground cavern from a single interface.
Bryn Thomas, Sales Director for Power and Infrastructure at ITI said:
“
We’ve been working at Cruachan Power Station for over 30 years now, and in that time have developed a deep understanding of their assets, their systems and their operational requirements. It is these strong relationships with our customers that enable us to work with them on developing transformative solutions that enhance their operations, improve safety and support sustainable green energy production.”
ENDS
Notes to editors
The three-year project will be run by a team of highly qualified and experienced engineers based out of ITI’s Glasgow office. The office is currently operating with strict social distancing and hygiene measures in place to allow the critical engineers to progress the project while their colleagues continue to safely work remotely, from home.

Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. It is also where Drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology BECCS within its CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage) Incubation Area.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
Customers:
Through its two B2B energy supply brands, Haven Power and Opus Energy, Drax supplies energy to 250,000 businesses across England, Scotland and Wales.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.
