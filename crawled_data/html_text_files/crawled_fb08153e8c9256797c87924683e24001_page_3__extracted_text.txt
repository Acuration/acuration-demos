bioenergy an increasing percentage of compressed wood pellets used at drax power station are sourced from its own pellet plants in the southern us  but most biomass still comes from external suppliers  in order to improve its sustainability systems drax has been encouraging suppliers to achieve sustainable biomass program sbp certification  in the baltics  a heavily forested region that has long been a source of renewable fuel  this rigorous auditing and certification process identified a new issue with certain types of raw material the key to solving this problem was not just looking in the right places but asking the right questions a surprising issue in both estonia and latvia around half the land is forested so theyre countries in which wood has always played a huge part not only for society but for the economy and because its so important its well protected by both governments latvia and estonia have very strong forest legislation says laura craggs sustainability compliance manager at drax you cannot harvest any site without the government giving you written permission so when it came to lauras attention that all forest product manufacturers and users in the region could be using wood from protected forestland called woodland key habitats it was a surprise certification step change this issue was raised thanks to draxs efforts to improve sustainability standards drax has always maintained a rigorous vetting process for suppliers to ensure they operate with sustainable practices but the creation of the sustainable biomass program sbp a unique certification scheme for woody biomass used in industrial largescale energy production has further improved this sbp raises the bar slightly it looks at each pellet plant and says these are the standards to meet show us how you meet them says craggs while not a huge departure from the process drax used previously there was one added step in the sbp process that in latvia proved crucial stakeholder engagement the sbp has introduced regional risk assessments  which are conducted by appointed working bodies tasked with amongst many other things reaching out to relevant stakeholders in a country or region to assess whether there are any sustainability issues  in latvia it was this that brought up the possibility of woodland key habitats being affected identifying it as an issue however did not mean it was easy to investigate  in latvia woodland key habitats arent mapped craggs explains you cant avoid these areas if you dont know where they are mapping the unknown latbio the latvian bioenergy association an environmental stakeholder group were the first to respond to the issue raised by ngos and commissioned a mapping programme to define where woodland key habitats might be found this mapping involved highlighting the potentially risky areas where woodland key habitats could be through identifying certain ages and species of forests all roundwood entering a pellet plant is now being checked to ensure its not from a woodland key habitat before being brought onto site says craggs when you get a delivery of wood theres a specific code that comes with it telling you exactly where it came from what drax suppliers are now doing is if the code is from a risky area theyre rejecting it as the mapping of the risky areas is by nature overly prudent it is important to carry out further checks as many of the forest areas highlighted as risky may not actually be woodland key habitats this mapping was followed up by teams of biologists who went to the potential atrisk areas and made more detailed studies looking for indicators of a valuable biotope like the presence of lichens mosses or old growth trees this work has now been developed into a checklist which harvesting companies can carry out prior to harvesting in these risky areas if the checklist shows the area has many of the characteristics of a woodland key habitat the low value roundwood cannot be purchased by the pellet plant the process has already had a huge effect in raising awareness and training in identifying woodland key habitats with these standards in place the sbp can roll out a more rigorous degree of woodland sustainability certification the data is then published on their website for full public scrutiny  meaning anyone can check that biomass material is coming from sustainable sources read the estonia catchment area analysis here  and the lativa analysis here  these form part of a series of catchment area analyses around the forest biomass pellet plants supplying drax power station with renewable fuel others in the series can be found here  tags estonia  latvia  supply chain  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp sustainable biomass program  proving biomass is sustainable dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 14 april 2016 opinion i was honoured to be able to accept the excellence in bioenergy award recently not for myself but on behalf of all my colleagues at drax who have worked so hard to make a reality of our shared plan to generate reliable renewable electricity our achievements are truly a team effort in 2015 drax became a predominantly biomassfuelled power station we now generate more electricity at drax power station from compressed lowgrade wood pellets than from coal  between three and four per cent of the uks entire demand every day its a major triumph for all the brilliant engineers involved in converting the plant and everyone who has helped secure the incredibly complex supply chain that keeps it running but we truly believe that this is only the beginning for sustainable biomass sustainable biomass is the ideal fuel to help the world decarbonise in an affordable and reliable way it can support other renewables like wind and solar when the elements are against them and backup power is needed because it can be created by upgrading existing coalfired power stations it can be added to the electricity grid in a fraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost of building new power stations why should the uk only build brandnew gas and nuclear power stations when existing coal power stations can be upgraded to low carbon renewable tech at drax we have shown how engineers working at what once was the biggest coal power station in western europe can use their expertise to work with compressed wood pellet power generation and it can save bill payers billions of pounds when the true costs of bringing other renewables on stream are taken into account the industrys greatest challenge right now is in proving that all the biomass we use is truly sustainable at drax we have proven the sustainability of the biomass we use time and time again but we can and will do more to ensure that standards right across the industry are always equally high we cannot underestimate the importance of sustainability no corners can be cut we must all join together and meet this challenge because without sustainable biomass there will be no industry at all without sustainable biomass in a balanced energy system with other renewables and low carbon technologies the paris climate change summit commitments may not be reached this is why the sustainable biomass program is so important the sbp has developed a certification framework to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources by working with the sbp all of us in the industry alongside hard working families and businesses stand to benefit which is why all of us at drax welcome its inception and look forward to working with the sbp to help build a growing and healthy industry that helps our society transition to the renewable fuels of the future may 2017 update the sbp has changed its name to the
