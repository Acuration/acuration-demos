drax aims to increase the level of thirdparty sales and further expand its capacity to meet its target of five million tonnes of selfsupply by 2027 drax believes that the acquisition is highly complementary to the groups other longterm strategic options for biomass once optimised the enlarged groups biomass supply chain will support draxs own generation requirements including the potential development of beccs whilst also serving the growing biomass markets in europe and asia via longterm offtake agreements a major producer and supplier of goodquality lowcost sustainable biomass pinnacle which is listed on the toronto stock exchange operates 25 million tonnes of biomass capacity at sites in western canada and the southeastern us with a further 04 million tonnes of capacity in development commissioning in 2021 investment in this new capacity is expected to be substantially complete in the first half of 2021 once the new capacity is commissioned pinnacles nameplate production capacity is expected to increase to 29 million tonnes per annum pinnacle has ownership of c80 of this nameplate capacity with the remaining c20 coowned with its forestry industry joint venture partners ensuring strong commercial relationships and shared interests in security of supply pinnacle has sales and marketing rights to 100 of the output from all sites pinnacle is a key supplier of wood pellets for drax and other third parties in asia and europe with c67 billion of contracted thirdparty sales including sales to drax wood pellets loaded onto vessel at westview terminal british columbia through scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing pinnacle is currently produces biomass at a lower cost than drax with a likeforlike 2019 production cost of us124tonne 3  compared to draxs 2019 production cost of us161tonne 3  the pro forma 2019 production cost for the combined business is us141tonne pinnacles lower cost partially reflects the use of high levels of lowcost sawmill residues british columbia has a large and wellestablished commercial forestry industry which has in recent years seen increased harvest levels in part associated with management of a pine beetle infestation producing good levels of residue material availability for the production of biomass this infestation has now run its course and alongside other influences on the forest landscape including wildfire is resulting in a reduction in the annual harvest and sawmill closures the industry is adjusting to this with some production curtailment as well as developing approaches to fibre recovery and use which is expected to result in some increase in fibre costs since 2017 the sustainable biomass program has conducted annual audits of each of pinnacles operational sites allowing drax to ensure through its diligence that the material that it purchases from pinnacle is in line with its sustainability standards drax is committed to ensuring best practice in health and safety operational efficiency and sustainability across the enlarged group and intends to invest accordingly to deliver this outcome drax is committed to ensuring that its biomass sources are compliant with draxs wellestablished responsible sourcing policy and drax expects to invest in adapt and develop sourcing practices to ensure compliance with draxs policies to deliver both draxs biomass strategy and positive forest outcomes a large and geographically diversified asset base pinnacle has ownership interests in ten operational plants and one in development commissioning 2021 six of which are operated through joint venture arrangements providing access to nameplate production capacity of 29 million tonnes per annum seven of pinnacles sites are in british columbia 16 million tonne nameplate capacity and two are in alberta 06 million tonne nameplate capacity all of these sites have rail lines to ports at either prince rupert or vancouver both accessing the pacific ocean providing routes to asian and european markets pinnacle also operates a us hub at aliceville alabama 03 million tonne nameplate capacity and is developing a second site in demopolis alabama 04 million tonne nameplate capacity which pinnacle expects to commission in 2021 pinnacles total operational and development nameplate capacity in the us is 07 million tonnes pinnacles us sites are close to draxs existing operations in the southeastern us and will utilise river barges to access the port of mobile and bargetoship loading reducing fixed port storage costs working forest in lasalle bioenergy catchment area louisiana all production sites are located in areas with access to fibre and are able to operate with a range of biomass material from existing commercial forestry activities including sawmill residues precommercial thinnings and lowgrade wood combined with a geographic spread of production capacity and access to three separate export facilities pinnacle benefits from operational and sourcing flexibility further enhancing draxs security of supply further information is set out in appendix 1 to this announcement longterm biomass revenues with access to asian and european markets pinnacle has contracted sales of c67 billion with highquality asian and european counterparties including drax this equates to 99 of its current production capacity contracted to third parties through 2026 and a significant volume contracted in 2027 and beyond providing longterm highquality revenues vessel carrying biomass pellets at westview terminal british columbia pinnacle has been supplying biomass to europe since 2004 the location of the majority of pinnacles production capacity in western canada with access to the pacific ocean provides a strong position from which to serve the growing demand for biomass in asian markets in 2018 and 2019 pinnacle entered into 12 new longterm contracts in japan and south korea totalling over 13 million tonnes per annum valued at c46 billion with most contracts commencing between 2021 and 2023 the average contract duration is nine years with certain contracts extending significantly beyond this point contracts typically operate on a takeorpay basis global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the global biomass wood pellet market has a broad range of providers that are expected to expand their production capacity including operators such as enviva graanul invest pinnacle an viet phat fram and sy energy the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by asian demand 5  drax believes that increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and an improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand train pulling biomass wagons storage domes and wood pellet conveyor system drax power station north yorkshire as a vertically integrated producer and consumer of sustainable biomass drax is differentiated from its peers and well positioned to deliver supply chain efficiencies and an expanded range of sustainable biomass materials for ownuse and thirdparty sales through its expanding lower cost supply chain expertise in biomass generation and enhanced global footprint drax believes that there will be opportunities to work with other companies and countries in developing their own biomassenabled decarbonisation strategies strong return on investment the acquisition is expected to be cash generative and represent an attractive opportunity to create significant value for shareholders with expected returns significantly in excess of the groups weighted average cost of capital the addition of longterm contracts with highquality counterparties in growing international biomass markets will reduce the groups relative exposure to commodity prices in line with the groups objective to improve earnings quality and visibility in total the acquisition increases access to lower cost biomass by a further 29 million tonnes after the commissioning of the demopolis plant in 2021 the price paid for this capacity is consistent with the previously outlined strategy to invest in the region of c600 million to deliver draxs plans for five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity and a biomass cost of 50mwh by 2027 for the year ended 27 december 2019 pinnacle generated adjusted ebitda 6 of c47 million from pellet sales of 17 million tonnes pinnacles 2019 performance was impacted by fire at its entwistle plant reduced rail access due to rail industrial action and weather disrupted forestry activity at the same time pinnacle experienced regional canadian sawmill closures resulting in some reduction in sawmill residues and an increase in provincial fibre prices fibre diversification and the development of a second hub in the southeastern us is expected to partially mitigate the risk of fibre price rises taking these factors into account alongside the commissioning of new capacity and the commencement of asian supply contracts pinnacles 2022 consensus ebitda is c99 million increasing to c126 million in 2023 bloomberg the acquisition strengthens the groups ability to pay a sustainable and growing dividend drax does not expect the acquisition to have any impact on its expectations for the final dividend payment for 2020 financing the acquisition the acquisition is expected to be funded from cash and existing agreements on 15 december 2020 the group issued a trading update which noted cash and total committed liquidity of 643 million at 30 november 2020 following the completion on 31 january 2021 of the sale of four gas power stations previously announced on 15 december 2020 the group received cash of 188 million being the agreed purchase price consideration of 164 million and 24 million of customary working capital adjustments net debt to adjusted ebitda 7 in 2021 is expected to be above draxs longterm target of around 2 times immediately after completion of the acquisition but is expected to return to around this level by the end of 2022 management of foreign exchange exposure the acquisition price will be paid in canadian dollars pinnacles existing contracts with drax and third parties are denominated in canadian and us dollars and drax expects to manage any exposure within its foreign exchange processes draxs policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposure on contracted biomass volumes over a rolling fiveyear period this has given rise to an average foreign exchange rate hedge around 140 usgbp sustainable sourcing sustainably sourced biomass is an important part of uk and european renewable energy policy the renewable status of sustainably sourced biomass is based on wellestablished scientific principles set out by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and reflected in the european unions eu second renewable energy directive and the uk renewables obligation drax maintains a rigorous approach to biomass sustainability ensuring the wood fibre it uses is fully compliant with the uks mandatory standards as well as those of the eu dead pine trees in background infected with mountain pine beetle british columbia drax recognises that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to commercially managed forests in the southeastern us working in partnership with engo earthworm drax has a good understanding of the considerations associated with sourcing residues from harvesting of primary

financial returns associated with the acquisition are not dependent on synergy benefits but the group has identified areas for potential operational improvements and efficiencies and opportunities to invest across the supply chain to achieve consistent standards and improve outputs across the enlarged group portfolio optimisation drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio drax believes that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers with existing plans to widen of the groups sustainable biomass fuel mix to include a wider range of lower cost sustainable biomass materials drax expects to create further opportunities to optimise fuel cargos for own use and thirdparty supply logistics optimisation drax believes that the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged group will provide greater opportunities to optimise logistics with delivery of cargos to a counterpartys closest port reducing distance time carbon footprint and cost enhanced security of supply control of draxs biomass supply chain with geographically diverse production and export facilities is expected to enhance security of supply further mitigating the risk of supply interruptions thereby resulting in improved reliability and a reduced risk of supply interruption combined expertise drax believes that there will be opportunities to share best practice and drive improved production performance across the enlarged group by leveraging combined expertise in the production of goodquality lowcost pellets across the enlarged supply chain drax also expects to leverage pinnacles experience in developing and managing thirdparty offtake agreements alongside its existing commercial and trading capabilities to develop new agreements for supply to thirdparties stronger counterparty credit drax has a stronger credit rating which could enable pinnacle to develop its supply capability and contracts in asian and european markets beyond its current position reduced cost of debt draxs average cost of debt is lower than pinnacles giving rise to potential future

a net zero uk will be good for people and the planet will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 24 november 2020 opinion for the uk to reach net zero co 2 emissions by 2050 and do its part in tackling the biggest challenge of our time all sectors of the economy must reduce their emissions and do it quickly i believe the best approach to tackling climate change is through cobenefit solutions solutions that not only have a positive environmental impact but that are economically progressive for society today and in the future through training skills and job creation as an energy company this task is especially important for drax we have a responsibility to future generations to innovate and use our engineering skills to deliver power thats renewable sustainable and that doesnt come at a cost to the environment wwwdraxcomcaptureit our work on zero carbon humber  in partnership with 11 other forwardthinking organisations aims to deploy the negative emissions technology beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as well as ccus carbon capture usage and storage in industry and power and ramp up hydrogen production as a low carbon fuel these are all essential technologies in bringing the uk to net zero but they are also innovative projects at scale that can benefit society and the lives of people in the humber and around the uk new jobs in a new sector the humber region has a proud history in heavy industries  what began as a thriving ship building hub has evolved to include chemicals refining and steel manufacturing however these emissionsintensive industries have grown increasingly expensive to operate and many have left for countries where they can be run cheaper leading to a decline in the humber region if they are not decarbonised these industries will face an even greater cost by 2040 emitters could face billions of pounds per year in carbon taxes making them less competitive and less attractive for international investment deploying carbon capture and hydrogen are essential steps towards modernising these businesses and protecting up to 55000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the region capturing carbon at drax delivering jobs clean growth and levelling up the humber click to view executive summary and case studies from vivid economics report for drax a report by vivid economics commissioned by drax found that carbon capture and hydrogen in the humber could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades as well as protecting peoples livelihoods decarbonisation is also a matter of public health in the humber alone higher air quality could save 148 million in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 i believe the uk is well position to rise to the challenge and lead the world in decarbonisation technology there is a clear opportunity to export knowledge and skills to other countries embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys beccs alone could create many more jobs related to exporting the technology and operational knowhow and deliver additional value for the economy as interest in negative emissions grows around the world the uk needs to move quickly to secure a competitive advantage a fairer economy this is in many ways the start of a new sector in our economy  one that can offer new employment earnings and economic growth it comes at just the right time without intervention to spur a green recovery the covid19 crisis risks subjecting longterm economic damage being at the beginning of the industrial decarbonisation journey means we also have the power to shape this new industry in a way that spreads the benefits across the whole of the uk weve previously seen sector deals struck between the government and industry include equality measures for example the nuclear industry aims to count women as 40 of its employees by 2030 while offshore wind is committed to sourcing 60 of its supply chain from the uk  wind turbines at bridlington east yorkshire at present the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk contributing to a pronounced skills gap among the workforce in addition almost 60 of construction workers across the wider yorkshire and humber region were furloughed as of august 2020 a project such as zero carbon humber could address this regional imbalance and offer skilled long term jobs to local communities thats why i welcome the prime ministers announcement of 1bn investment to support the establishment of ccus in the humber and other superplaces around the uk as the governments ten point plan says ccus can help decarbonise our most challenging sectors provide low carbon power and a pathway to negative emissions healthier forests the cobenefits of beccs extend beyond our communities in the uk we aim to become carbon negative by 2030 by removing our co 2 emissions from the atmosphere and abating emissions that might still exist on the uks path to net zero this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use continues to be sourced from sustainable forests that positively benefit the environment and the communities in which we and our suppliers operate engineer working in turbine hall drax power station north yorkshire i believe we must continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light we can help ensure the uks biomass sourcing is led by the latest science  best practice and transparency  supporting healthy biodiverse forests around the world and even apply it internationally global leadership delivering deep decarbonisation for the uk will require collaboration from industries government and society what we can achieve through largescale projects like zero carbon humber is more than just the vital issue of reduced emissions it is also about creating jobs protecting health and improving livelihoods these are more than just benefits they are the makings of a future filled with opportunity for the humber and for the uks green industrial

covid19 nevertheless it is still early in this pandemic as covid19 continues to develop we remain vigilant in looking to protect all our stakeholders and will report further if there are significant changes to our outlook for 2020 trading operational performance and outlook the trading and operational performance of the group has been robust in the first three months of 2020 while the impact of covid19 is still unfolding the groups expectations for 2020 adjusted ebitda are currently in line with consensus inclusive of an estimated potential impact from covid19 of 60 million principally in relation to its customers business full year expectations for the group remain underpinned by good operational availability for the remainder of 2020 in the customers business the consequences of covid19 are only now starting to become visible it is expected to result in reduced demand and a potential increase in bad debt which represents a major sensitivity particularly in the sme 4 market as a result drax has significantly increased its expectation of potential customer business failures and higher bad debt assuming the continued impact of covid19 throughout 2020 drax now expects a full year adjusted ebitda loss for the customers business the group will closely monitor the impact on the customers business and update the market accordingly in generation the groups expectations for the full year reflect a reduction in roc recycle prices resulting from reduced power demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio the performance of the generation business is dependent on the continuation of biomass deliveries to drax power station biomass generation is currently the most material area of activity for the group and a protracted suspension of the supply chain could lead to lower levels of biomass generation resulting in a reduction in the groups expectations for the full year at present there has been no impact from covid19 and the group has a good supply of biomass throughout the supply chain which continues to be robust and functioning well engineer climbs cooling tower at drax power station click to viewdownload generation during the first three months of 2020 draxs generation portfolio performed well with good asset availability and optimisation of generation underpinning a strong financial performance the business benefits from a strong forward power sales position through 2022 which combined with indexlinked renewable schemes and capacity payments provides a high level of earnings visibility helping to protect the business from the current weakness in uk power prices in response to covid19 drax has implemented robust business continuity procedures across its sites to protect employees and contractors and ensure continued operation in addition to operating strategically important infrastructure the components of the groups uk supply chain are considered key sectors allowing continued operation the groups biomass supply chain has a high level of operational redundancy designed to mitigate any potential disruption drax sources biomass from suppliers across north america and europe including the groups own facilities in louisiana and mississippi in the uk drax utilises dedicated port facilities at hull immingham tyne and liverpool with a capacity of eleven million tonnes providing supply chain capacity in excess of the groups annual biomass usage of over seven million tonnes sustainable biomass wood pellets destined for drax power station unloaded from the zheng zhi bulk carrier at abp immingham click to viewdownload drax power station has 300000 tonnes of biomass storage capacity taken together with volumes throughout its supply chain the group currently has visibility of over one million tonnes of biomass in transit  enough to operate the cfd 5 unit on its own for over four months subject to managing deliveries to drax power station biomass generation has performed well in the first three months of 2020 whilst covid19 has not had any measurable impact on biomass generation to date a sustained reduction in electricity demand could result in a reduction in roc recycle prices in the current compliance period the group has adjusted its expectations for the full year but the precise impact will be dependent on the depth and duration of any reduction in demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio engineer at cruachan power station click to viewdownload the groups hydro assets have performed well particularly the pumped storage business primarily driven by activity in the system support services market as previously
