to stop using coal well ahead of uks deadline almost 50 years of coalfired electricity generation at drax power station is expected to come to an end in march 2021 27 february 2020 drax has announced that almost 50 years of power generation from coal at its power station in north yorkshire is expected to end next year  years in advance of the uks 2025 deadline the decision is a landmark moment in the uks efforts to achieve net zero by 2050 and a major milestone towards delivering draxs worldleading ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 drax is also spearheading a zero carbon skills taskforce to help people in the north gain the skills and expertise required to seize the opportunities as the uk moves towards a net zero carbon economy almost 50 years of coalfired electricity generation at drax power station is expected to come to an end in march 2021  marking a major milestone in the companys worldleading ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 it means the countrys largest power station will stop using coal well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline making an even bigger contribution to the uks efforts to achieve net zero the decision to stop using coal at drax comes after a comprehensive review of its operations drax does not expect to use coal after march 2021 but will ensure its two remaining coal units remain available until september 2022 in line with its existing capacity market agreements drax ceo will gardiner said ending the use of coal at drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a worldleading carbon negative company by 2030 draxs journey away from coal began some years ago and im proud to say were going to finish the job well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline drax power station near selby in north yorkshire first started generating electricity using coal in the 1970s once the second half of the power station was built in the 1980s it became the largest power station in the uk with the capacity to generate electricity for six million households over the last decade four of the power stations six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass delivering carbon savings of more than 80 compared to when they used coal this has transformed drax to become the uks largest renewable power generator and the biggest decarbonisation project in europe mr gardiner said by using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on we have also played a significant role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world having pioneered groundbreaking biomass technology were now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030 making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis stopping using coal at drax will lead to a reduction in the workforce at the north yorkshire power station trades unions and employee representatives will be consulted over the coming months and support is being provided to those affected coal pile and biomass storage domes drax power station 2016 click to viewdownload drax is talking to the government trades unions and industrial businesses across the north about joining with drax in establishing a new zero carbon skills taskforce to help people in the region gain the skills and expertise required to seize new job opportunities as the uk moves towards a net zero economy drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload mr gardiner added stopping using coal is the right decision for our business our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees which will be difficult for them and their families in making the decision for the uk to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy its vital that the impact on people across the north is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that they have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future draxs plans to develop beccs means it could be the anchor for the zero carbon humber initiative which aims to bring industrial businesses together to make the region the first net zero industrial economy in the world the humber is the uks biggest industrial region employing 55000 people in energy manufacturing and engineering and as the most carbon intensive region in the country  decarbonising here would make a more significant impact on addressing the climate crisis than anywhere else in the uk ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr email protected 44 07712 670 888 selina williams drax group media manager email protected 44 07912 230 393

reduction in the workforce at drax power station of between 200 and 230 people from april 2021 draxs decision to stop using coal is an important step in achieving its ambition to become carbon negative  this means that by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology drax will remove more carbon emissions from the atmosphere than are produced across all its operations creating a negative carbon footprint for the company by using beccs drax hopes to become the anchor for the uks first net zero industrial cluster in the humber region allowing other industrial emitters to capture and store carbon dioxide protecting jobs creating clean growth and export opportunities drax is a member of the powering past coal alliance an initiative launched by the uk and canadian governments which seeks to end the use of unabated coal in power stations around the world by 2030 the powering past coal alliance wants to accelerate the transition away from unabated coal and drax is supporting its work to encourage members to scale up their ambitions and to create more collaboration helping prospective new members to move forwards in using cleaner energy drax supports stem science technology engineering and maths education and employability initiatives in the communities local to its operations in 2019 it recruited 18 apprentices across the group including 13 at
