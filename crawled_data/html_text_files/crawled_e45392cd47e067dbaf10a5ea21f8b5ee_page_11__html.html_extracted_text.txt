Press Release
Drax to pilot more pioneering new carbon capture technology
10 May 2022
Press releases

Renewable energy giant Drax is collaborating with the University of Nottingham and Promethean Particles on an innovative new carbon capture technology that could shape the future of carbon capture and storage (CCS).
Trial is part of Drax’s bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) innovation programme and could see the technology deployed in future BECCS plants.
The new process uses a type of solid sorbent called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which Promethean Particles are a global pioneer in the development and deployment of, to capture the CO2 released when sustainable biomass is used to generate electricity. CCS technologies typically use liquid solvents.
Dr Theo Chronopoulos, Drax Innovation Engineer and Lewis Neve, Promethean Particles’ Engineering Manager.
MOFs have a simple structure, which means they can be tailored to separate and soak up specific molecules making them excellent for CCS.
The trial will last for two months and will allow all three organisations to understand if this new carbon capture process performs well in real conditions on large-scale projects.
Jason Shipstone, Drax’s Chief Innovation Officer, said:
Pilot unit in situ in Drax’s BECCS incubation hub located in Drax Power Station.
“Negative emissions technologies like BECCS will play a vital role in the fight against the climate crisis, so it’s crucial we continue to innovate and develop new technologies that will support their future deployment.
“This partnership with the University of Nottingham and Promethean Particles is part of our long-term innovation programme and will allow Drax to understand the future potential of this technology, as we continue to innovate and grow as a business.”
Professor Ed Lester, Project Lead, University of Nottingham, said:
“This is a fantastic opportunity to showcase how these solid adsorbents perform in an industrial setting. We know that this project is gathering a lot of interest across many industrial sectors that currently generate large amounts of CO
2
”.
James Stephenson, CEO of Promethean Particles, said:
“There is exciting potential for MOFs to deliver a more efficient CCS. By collaborating with Drax and the Uni, we can show how they can perform in a real industrial setting and drive a step change in their availability and cost effectiveness.”
Drax Group, which has converted Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal to become the UK’s largest renewable generator, plans to deploy the essential negative emissions technology BECCS in the 2020s. This would be the world’s largest carbon capture power project, delivering a significant proportion of the negative emissions needed for the UK to meet its climate targets.

Editor’s Notes
The trial will last for two months and will be hosted within Drax’s BECCS incubation hub at its North Yorkshire Power Station.
Metal Organic Frameworks are a unique class of solid sorbents offering lower operational costs and reducing potential environmental impacts.
Leading climate scientists at the UN’s IPCC and UK Climate Change Committee have said that negative emissions technologies such as BECCS, which permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, are vital to achieve climate targets
Work to build BECCS at Drax could get underway as soon as 2024, with the creation of thousands of jobs.
Subject to the right regulatory support, the first BECCS unit could be operational in 2027, with the second commissioned in 2030, enabling Drax to achieve its world-leading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030.
Analysis by
Baringa
shows BECCS at Drax will save the UK £13bn in achieving the government’s legally binding fifth Carbon Budget.
About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology.

Family reunion at Cruachan Power Station
14 April 2022
Press releases

Peter Lacey was one of the 4,000 ‘Tunnel Tigers’ who drilled, blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of mighty Ben Cruachan over a period of six years from 1959 to 1965 to make way for the UK’s first pumped storage hydro power station.
A mural dedicated to these men has pride of place on the walls of the machine hall, and it is here where one of Peter’s sons saw a photo of him by chance when watching the comedian Frankie Boyle’s Tour of Scotland on BBC television, which featured the power station. They knew instantly it was their father in the photo, as he was missing an index finger due to an injury caused during a farming accident when he was younger.
After seeing the programme, the brothers Frank, John, Martin and Peter did some research about the men who built Cruachan and got in touch with the visitor centre to arrange a tour. As the four men now live in different locations across Britain, the four of them have only been in the same room together a handful of times over the last 30 years to attend family funerals.
The visit was delayed due to covid restrictions but the brothers have finally now been able to see the place where their father had spent many years working.
Peter Lacey grew up near Dublin and moved to Scotland with his family in 1950, leaving his job working on his family’s farm to take advantage of the generous wages being offered to labourers in Scotland – which reflected the danger and difficulty of the work.
Conditions for the men who worked at Cruachan during those early years were really tough and tragically, 15 of them died. These men are commemorated by the mural on the wall of the machine hall as well as in a specially commissioned tartan
Drax created
, which includes 15 strands of a special dark blue thread.
L-R: Martin, Frank, Peter and John Lacey, in front of the photo of their father Peter Lacey (pictured left) on the wall of the Cruachan Machine Hall.
Martin Lacey, the second youngest of the four brothers, said:
“My father, like many of the other men working at Loch Awe, gave up so much to better his family. We weren’t a rich family, but we never wanted for anything. We were so proud of him and always looked forward to him coming home on the weekends when he could.”
The work was physically exhausting and the environment dark and dangerous. Peter suffered several accidents during his time there, including broken ribs. During retirement he lost his eyesight too, which was put down to the hours he had spent working in the darkness of the tunnel all those years earlier.
The brothers took a tour of Cruachan power station during their visit. They were in awe of the size and scale of the power station which their father helped to build:
“We were able to go inside the machine hall which is the size of three football fields and the height of St Paul’s Cathedral. The generators are huge. When we stood beside the photo of our father and saw the inner workings of the hall I was so impressed.”
They also viewed the mural in the machine hall privately – a very emotional experience for them as they remembered their father, who they described as a thoughtful and caring man.
“To us he was a giant of a man at 6ft 3. He was never ill and never felt the cold, he never wore a jacket or jumper no matter the weather,” Martin recalled.
“He never asked for much. He was a family man and very content with what he had. He was extremely hard-working and could never sit still for long. Even when he wasn’t working, he always had to be doing something, gardening or fixing things.”
Martin added:
“Our father and mother taught us to love and support each other, work hard and be decent people. Even though it’s been years since we’ve been together as a family, the lessons they taught us stay with us to this day.”
The brothers now live in different parts of the country. Frank travelled the furthest for the family reunion at Cruachan – coming from Skelmersdale in Lancashire, which is over 280 miles away.
Martin said:
“The staff at Cruachan made the visit really special for us. I’d like to thank them again, we had a great time and it’s a trip that we will always remember. I hope to visit again in the future with my wife.”
Ishbel McFarlane, Cruachan Visitor Centre Team Leader accompanied the brothers on the tour.
She said:
“When the brothers got in touch, we were more than happy to accommodate them. They were a delight to show round the power station and it was so interesting hearing their stories and memories about their father. I hope they enjoyed their time at Cruachan and will visit again in the future.”
After the visit, the brothers each received a scarf made from the special tartan Drax commissioned to commemorate the men who built Cruachan.

Editor’s Notes
Peter Lacey died aged 79 in Skelmersdale, Lancashire surrounded by his family on 25
th
June 1998.
Frank, John, Martin and Peter also have three younger sisters, Margaret, Anna and Geraldine. Margaret passed away in 2013. Anna and Geraldine were unable to make the trip to Cruachan due to work and childcare commitments.
The power station welcomes around 50,000 visitors every year.
Drax is moving forward with ambitious
plans to build a new underground pumped storage hydro plant at its Cruachan facility
. The new 600MW station would be built within a new, hollowed-out cavern that would be large enough to fit Big Ben on its side.
The new power station will provide a huge boost to communities around Loch Awe and across Argyll during construction, with the creation of jobs in these rural areas.

Northern leaders Unite for Ukraine
5 April 2022
Press releases

Businesses come together to offer a one stop shop for jobs for Ukrainian refugees.
Leaders commit to welcoming and supporting all who are fleeing Ukraine.
New platform provides employment and support opportunities.
A consortium of business leaders from across the North have joined forces to provide employment opportunities and support to Ukrainians impacted by the invasion of their country.
United For Ukraine
is a coalition brought together at the request of leaders from across the North, including the Northern Powerhouse Partnership and North West Business Leadership Team (NWBLT), with support from the NP11 group of Local Enterprise Partnerships. The initiative is focused around a digital platform, created by the Growth Company, which connects employers with evacuees.
For Ukrainian nationals, and other refugees who are eligible, the
United For Ukraine
website provides a searchable list of job vacancies with employers who have committed to providing good job opportunities in a supportive environment.
For employers, the free-to-use site provides an easy and direct way to communicate job opportunities and access the right support, to employ those coming here who wish to, and are able to, work.
Vacancies listed on the site will adhere to criteria such as the offer at least a real living wage, and disclosable salaries, to ensure the opportunities on offer are quality jobs.
The site – which is accessible in both English and Ukrainian – also provides signposting to support services and referral agencies for Ukrainian refugees, such as free English language courses and how to open a bank account, as well as services providing advice on issues including housing, work permits and childcare.
It follows the news that the UK Government’s ‘Homes for Ukraine’ scheme has seen more than 100,000 people sign up to provide Ukrainian refugees fleeing their country with accommodation. Those refugees who enter under the scheme will be granted leave to remain in the UK for three years, during which time they will be able to work and access benefits and public services – including healthcare and state schooling.
Organisations involved in the creation of
United For Ukraine
include KPMG, PWC, Creative Concern, DWF Law, EY, Cirrus Connect, Bruntwood, Siemens, Northern Power Women, Net Zero North West and Agent.
Mike Wilton, Director at Arup, and NWBLT Board Member who has chaired the coalition, said:
“Now is the time for us to work together to do all we can to support these refugees who are fleeing the conflict with Russia. I’m incredibly proud of everyone who has joined forces to make this happen, on an entirely voluntary basis, using their own time and resources to do the right thing.
“Not only is this incredibly important to support Ukrainian nationals, but it’s also hugely beneficial for our region. We know that many skills gaps exist in the North, and we have an unprecedented level of unfilled vacancies, so this will help us to bridge those gaps – there are so many reasons for us to get behind this initiative.”
Professor Juergen Maier CBE, vice-chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said:
“It’s wonderful to see the northern business community coming together to provide employment opportunities for refugees.
“We want to send a message to those fleeing the appalling situation in their home country that they are very welcome here and that we are ready to support them however we can.”
Andy Skelton, Drax’s Chief Financial Officer, said:
“We must do all we can to support the Ukrainian people in their hour of need and Drax is proud to be among the businesses in the North taking part in this initiative to help those coming to the UK. By providing employment opportunities and other support through the United for Ukraine website, we hope to help ease some of the distress these families are suffering as they transition to living and working in a new country.”

Hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts available to build world’s biggest carbon capture project at Drax
Press releases

Business events are being held in Yorkshire & the Humber and the North East to give local companies more information about how they can win contracts to help Drax deliver its multi-billion-pound bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project at Drax Power Station.
Drax is aiming to source 80% of construction materials and services for its BECCS project from British businesses.
The project will also create 10,000 jobs across the region during construction, developing green skills and helping to level up the North.
Renewable energy company Drax is teaming up with Worley, its engineering, procurement and construction partner, the UK’s leading UK energy sector business development organisation NOF, and the West & North Yorkshire and Hull & Humber Chambers of Commerce to deliver a series of events that will provide British businesses with further information about how they could win hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts to deliver its vital carbon removal technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
The events will be held in Yorkshire & The Humber and the North East, in May and follow the success of an initial supplier event, held virtually in September 2021, when around 400 UK businesses attended.
Drax has previously said that it aims to source 80% of construction materials and services from British firms and build a robust UK supply chain for BECCS, ahead of construction getting underway as soon as 2024, with the creation of around 10,000 jobs.
Graham Backhouse, Drax’s Commercial Director for the BECCS project, said:
“We want to put British businesses at the heart of our plans to deliver BECCS, allowing them to benefit from hundreds of millions of pounds worth of new contracts.
“Negative emissions technologies like BECCS will play a vital role in enabling the UK to reach its net zero goals, as well as creating exciting opportunities for Britain to lead the world in a vital technology, creating a new sector of the economy, as well as export opportunities.
“Our programme of events is a great opportunity for businesses to get involved and learn more about the project – we encourage companies of all sizes across the region to come along and find out more about how they might benefit from the contracts available.”
Bradley Andrews, President at Worley, said:
“We’re supporting the investment and scale up of the UK supply chain to maximise local business participation working alongside Drax, NOF and Worley’s e-procurement partner,
Requis
.
“Requis provides a digitally enabled platform where qualified suppliers can register their materials and services in line with what’s required for the project scope, driving opportunity for the UK supply market.”
Joanne Leng MBE, Chief Executive at NOF, said:
“NOF has now delivered a significant number of supplier engagement activities on behalf of major clients in the energy industry.
“We are now working on the BECCS project with Drax and Worley who have both demonstrated a strong commitment to working with the local and wider UK supply chain and through NOF’s support they aim to ensure that as much UK content as possible is included in this project. The domestic supply chain is innovative, capable and competitive, it is world class so let’s utilise this experience and expertise on the project.”
Drax has a proven track record in delivering ambitious and pioneering infrastructure projects – the conversion of its power station in North Yorkshire to use sustainable biomass  has enabled it to become the UK’s largest single site renewable generator, supporting more than 6,600 jobs throughout its supply chains across the North, whilst reducing its emissions by over 95% and paving the way for the deployment of BECCS.
Drax aims to deliver the world’s largest carbon capture in power project this decade, making a signification contribution to the UK’s decarbonisation targets.

80% domestic supply chain figure includes materials and services to be used within the construction for Drax’s BECCS project, however, this does not include the carbon capture technology to be delivered by Drax’s technology partner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Leading climate scientists at the UN’s IPCC and UK Climate Change Committee have said that the world cannot address the climate crisis without negative emissions from technologies like BECCS, which permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Work to build BECCS at Drax could get underway as soon as 2024, with the creation of thousands of jobs.
Subject to the right regulatory support, the first BECCS unit could be operational in 2027, with the second commissioned in 2030, enabling Drax to achieve its world-leading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030.
Analysis by
Baringa
shows BECCS at Drax will save the UK £13bn in achieving the government’s legally binding fifth Carbon Budget.

Allied Glass signs deal with Drax for 100% renewable hydro power
24 March 2022
Press releases

Renewable energy giant Drax, has signed an agreement with Allied Glass to provide 66GWh 100% renewable electricity per year from one of Drax’s run of river hydro-electric schemes located in Scotland.
The corporate power purchase agreement (CPPA) allows Allied Glass to use hydro-backed Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) certificates to support its carbon reduction goals, linked to the generation at the Galloway hydro scheme.  The CPPA means that Allied Glass can state with authority where their energy is sourced from and will help the business to further reduce its carbon emissions – already down by more than 10% since 2015.
The Galloway hydro scheme generates renewable power in response to rising electricity demand, helping to provide grid stability.
Dating back to 1935, the Galloway complex was the first large scale integrated hydro-electric power scheme to be built in Britain. Located in rural south-west Scotland it comprises six power stations, 12 turbines, eight large dams, 16km of tunnels and pipelines, five fish passes, 22 bridges and four pumping stations, generating 126MWs of renewable electricity – enough to supply 70,000 homes.
Valpy Fitzgerald, Director of Renewables and Sustainable Commodities at Drax, said:
“We’re delighted to partner with Allied Glass to provide them with 100% renewable source power, as well as Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) from our Galloway hydro scheme.
“Renewable energy is increasingly important to organisations as they look for ways to decarbonise – and being on supply with our 100% renewable source power is a simple first step. Our Galloway CPPA presents another opportunity for our customers to demonstrate their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials while making significant progress towards achieving net zero.”
Alan Henderson, CEO at Allied Glass, said:
“We chose to source our renewable power from Drax’s Galloway Hydro Scheme, as knowing exactly where our electricity comes from helps us continue towards our 2025 sustainability targets.
“We work closely with our suppliers to ensure that the materials and resources we use are sustainable. Renewable electricity is very much part of that process. We’re very happy that we can say our operations are powered by 100% renewable electricity. It’s important for us as a business to be able to operate with a low impact on the environment. Electricity and renewable certification from Drax helps us to demonstrate that to our customers, which is becoming more important.”

Notes to editor
A corporate power purchase agreement (CPPA) is an energy contract for businesses that want to purchase renewable electricity directly from a specific producer and location.
While power purchase agreements (PPA) are made between a power generator and third party, such as an energy supplier, CPPAs allow organisations to contract directly with a power generator to provide long-term support of a specific source of renewable electricity.
The contract with Allied Glass spans 30 months and will see Drax provide 66GWh per annum of renewable electricity.

Back to school at Drax: UK’s biggest renewable power station reopens for educational tours
17 March 2022
Press releases

The UK’s biggest renewable power generator, Drax Group, is inviting schools and colleges back to its eponymous power station for the first time since the country went into lockdown due to Covid-19.
Prior to the pandemic, Drax Power Station near Selby in North Yorkshire, welcomed more than 12,000 visitors every year, many of whom were students, visiting as part of the renewable energy company’s initiatives to encourage young people to study STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects, boosting skills across the region.
In line with lockdown rules, Drax suspended its public tours in March 2020 to protect its key workers, who worked around the clock throughout the pandemic to ensure the country had the renewable electricity it needed. Drax produces 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity – more than any other generator.
Wyke Sixth Form College in Hull was one of the first schools to visit the power station since it reopened, taking part in a tour which supported the work the students are doing to understand how renewable electricity is generated.
Plant Director Bruce Heppenstall said: “We work closely with schools in our communities to inspire the next generation to study STEM subjects, and we’re pleased to be able to offer tours of the power station again after being closed to the public for so long.
“These tours are so important – they fire up students’ imaginations by showing them some of the cutting-edge green technologies we’re pioneering, such as BECCS which could play a vital role in addressing the climate crisis as well as delivering jobs and clean growth here in the North.”
Wyke Sixth Form College students in front of Drax biomass domes
The group of 20 students aged between 16 and 18, were taken on a full tour of the site, which included seeing Drax’s Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot project. BECCS is a vital negative emissions technology which Drax plans to use to permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, whilst also generating the reliable, renewable electricity the country needs.
BECCS at Drax would support over 10,000 jobs at its peak, and it is vital that the region’s workforce has the skills needed to deliver this green energy technology, enabling the UK to meet its net zero target.
Sophie Thompson, Head of Science at Wyke Sixth Form College, said: “The students had a great day at Drax, learning about how the electricity system works and where our electricity is generated. Visits like this are so valuable because seeing the power station and the scale of the operations is impossible to replicate in a classroom – it really brings the subject to life.”
During the tour, pupils learnt how renewable electricity is generated and discovered how sustainable, wood pellets have enabled Drax to reduce its carbon emissions by 95% in a decade, making it Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
They saw the 427-metre turbine hall that houses the huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity, as well as the wood pellet storage domes – each large enough to fit The Royal Albert Hall inside, and the 115m high cooling towers, which are taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Tours are free to all primary and secondary schools and can be tailored to suit the area of the curriculum teachers are interested in.

Drax employees donate essential supplies to local foodbanks
Press releases

Colleagues at Drax’s Daldowie Fuel Plant have donated over 30 bags of food and toiletries to support local foodbanks, thanks to the generosity and fundraising efforts of the team.
This donation is the latest of many that the team has made, collecting a total of over 80 bags of supplies and supporting nine different foodbanks in the Glasgow and Lanarkshire areas since the initiative began in December 2019.
Daldowie Engineer James Beveridge, who organised the donation, said:
“
In December 2019, we decided to set up a donation box to see if colleagues would be interested in helping local foodbanks in the Glasgow area. The response was fantastic, and we have been able to help several charities throughout the Glasgow and Lanarkshire areas. The kindness of people at our site has been incredible, with donations coming in all the time.”
Day Teams Senior Operator Arek Blyskun cooked a special Polish goulash for the team to raise money for the foodbanks
In addition to the collection of food and toiletries, Day Teams Senior Operator Arek Blyskun cooked a special Polish goulash for the team on two occasions, raising £235 which was then match funded by Drax and split between three different foodbanks.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax Group’s Scottish Assets and Generation Engineering Director, said: “I’m really proud of the generosity of the team and their efforts to do something positive for the local community – continuing Drax’s long tradition of supporting the communities local to its operations.”
Ann Hunter, Volunteer at the Rutherglen and Cambuslang Foodbank, said: “Thank you to the team at Daldowie for their generous donation of items to the foodbank which will help to support those facing hard times this year. Collections from local supermarkets alone are not sufficient to keep up with the volume of goods being distributed to the needy and we tend to receive less donations in January and February, making these gifts especially welcome.
“Our distribution centres are busy and provide a vital lifeline to those in need in our community. It is only through kind people and organisations such as Drax and the team at Daldowie that we are able to carry on with this essential work.”

Drax holds final community events on Cruachan expansion plans
8 March 2022
Press releases

Under the plans, a second underground power station will be built adjacent to the existing one to enable Cruachan to play an even bigger role in supporting the expansion of renewable energy sources, such as wind power, and provide stability services to the national grid.
Around 900 jobs will be created and indirectly supported during the new power station’s construction, providing a huge economic boost to communities around Loch Awe and across Argyll.
The previous round of public exhibitions revealed overwhelming support for the development. Since then, the project team has worked to refine the proposals and is pleased to be able to share details of this at the events:
Dalmally Community Centre – Tuesday 15 March 2022, 1.30pm to 7.30pm
Taynuilt Village Hall – Wednesday 16 March 2022, 1.30pm to 7.30pm
Steve Marshall, Drax’s Development Manager, said:
“More than a hundred people attended the last round of public exhibitions, underlining the level of public interest in Drax’s exciting plans to expand Cruachan. This power station has been at the heart of the community for more than half a century and with this proposed investment from Drax, it will continue to be so for many more decades to come.
“Our development will support around 900 jobs during construction, a huge investment in the local area. By expanding Cruachan we will ensure more renewable power is available to Scotland’s homes and businesses, helping to reduce energy costs and emissions.”
Following the public consultation, Drax will submit a Section 36 application to the Scottish Government for their consideration. A decision from the government is expected to be received in 2023.
The project requires a new financial stability support mechanism from the UK government to secure private investment in long-duration storage sites such as Cruachan. If this is developed and the planning application is approved, then work to build the new capacity at Cruachan could get underway in 2024, with the facility operational in 2030.
ENDS
Editor’s Notes
Copies of the exhibition boards and other materials will be available for viewing and download via the website at
www.cruachanexpansion.com
from 14 March or they can be viewed at Cruachan Visitor Centre from 17 March.
No investment decision has yet been taken by Drax and development remains subject to the right regulatory framework from the UK government.
