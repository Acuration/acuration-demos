archives press release drax apprentice evening inspires the next generation 7 december 2018 press releases more than 160 students and parents attended the event at drax power station near selby in north yorkshire to find out more about working at the site which is the largest decarbonisation project in europe it was the first time the power station had held an event of this kind and it comes as it plans to increase the number of training roles available next year from nine to 12  meaning it will have doubled the number of apprenticeships offered in the space of just two years andy koss drax power ceo said this event is helping us to build on our longstanding commitment to promoting education and skills in the north of england every business in the northern powerhouse region has a role to play in creating opportunities for young people and raising aspirations  encouraging them to develop the skills theyll need in the future seeing so many young people attending events like this shows how important apprenticeships are to students as well as to businesses like ours our apprentices are the rising stars at drax  theyre the key to the longterm success of the business an apprenticeship is a brilliant way to begin a career in a variety of roles here the students who attended the open evening most of whom were in their gcse year met with some of the current apprentices at the power station to hear about their experiences the mainly 15 and 16yearold students were also able to sample a virtual tour of the power station and attend workshops on interview techniques and cv writing resourcing manager shelley lawton from draxs hr team said the evening showcased the career opportunities at the site which offers apprenticeships in both technical and officebased roles the event was part of draxs longestablished community programme and commitment to learning and skills it aimed to help students with their applications regardless of whether theyre planning to go on to further studies or pursue jobs at drax or elsewhere shelley said the evening was a real success and we hope to make it an annual event the students were really engaged and had some excellent discussions with our current apprentices and staff members our 2019 apprenticeship scheme opens to applications in a couple of weeks were looking forward to meeting our next generation of new starters who will help to continue to build our business we hope the cv skills and interview technique workshops were useful to everyone who attended  whatever they plan to do after school not all of them will apply for a role at drax but hopefully theyll have learnt new skills which will help them to be successful in the roles they apply for in the future nine engineering apprentices began their careers at the selbybased power station in september a 50 increase on apprentice numbers on previous years as drax continues to invest in and promote stem skills twelve apprentice roles will be available in 2019 the energy firm also sponsors a number of phds at sheffield university producing cuttingedge research into areas such as the impact of human behaviour on vehicle to grid technologies where in the future electric cars could store and discharge power back to the grid to support the electricity system drax will be accepting applications for technical apprenticeships from december 19 until january 31 with further

league of countries using technologies to limit climate change uk phase out of coal has been faster than any other country in the world cutting the carbon emissions from its power system by more than twice as much as some other countries however the uk has no largescale carbon capture facilities which are critical to climate targets being achieved the uk is second only to denmark when it comes to implementing measures to mitigate climate change according to a new global energy revolution league table in the report energy revolution a global outlook  researchers from imperial college london have assessed 25 countries covering 80 of the worlds population launched today at the un climate change conference in katowice poland the report looks at each countrys performance across five metrics including clean power fossil fuels uptake and sales of electric vehicles capacity for carbon storage energy efficiency of households buildings and transport the uks carbon price  its charge on greenhouse gas emissions which is stronger than elsewhere in europe  has led to rapid deployment of renewables and the fastest phase out of coal power making for worldleading progress in reducing the carbon emissions from power generation whilst most countries have reduced the amount of carbon dioxide produced per kwh of electricity by 100g kwh over the last decade the figure in the uk is more than double that at 260gkwh uptake of electric vehicles is also among the highest in the uk which is home to the worlds 5 th largest electric vehicle fleet however progress in the uk is being hampered by the fact it lags behind on the provision of largescale carbon capture and storage ccs facilities needed to limit the harmful greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere the research was conducted by imperial college london and e4tech facilitated by imperial consultants and commissioned by drax group figure 1 ranking of country progress in the energy revolution responding to the findings will gardiner drax group ceo said our global economy is changing and the transition to zero carbon lower cost energy is vital if countries are to be able to compete at drax weve converted two thirds of our power station to use biomass instead of coal transforming the business to become europes biggest decarbonisation project and helping to make the phase out of coal in the uk the fastest in the world but we want to do more were piloting the first bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs project of its kind in europe  which could make drax the worlds first carbon negative power station removal of carbon from the atmosphere is vital if we are to meet our climate targets commenting on his teams findings imperials dr iain staffell said we researched how the world is progressing on uptake of the five key technologies and measures needed to limit climate change to 2 degrees celsius this reveals denmark uk and canada to be world leading progress across these five areas is very mixed great strides are being made in cleaning up global electricity generation and renewable capacity is increasing rapidly all around the world electric vehicles are also rapidly taking off but still have only reached a 5 share of new cars sold in two countries improving the efficiency of our homes and industries needs urgent effort significant investment in carbon capture and storage will also be needed if it is to contribute to limiting climate change as only 6 countries are currently demonstrating this technology at scale energy and clean growth minister claire perry said  this confirms the uks position as a world leader in decarbonising the economy  phasing out coal as we move to a greener cleaner energy system with record levels of energy from renewables we have also led the way in transitioning to low emission vehicles and today one in five electric vehicles sold in europe is manufactured here in the uk but were determined to do more to reduce our emissions thats why last week we published plans for the uks first carbon capture usage and storage project to be operational in the mid2020s with the ambition of potentially rolling out this cuttingedge technology at scale in 2030s  commenting on the findings alyssa gilbert director of policy and translation from imperials grantham institute said ahead of cop24 this research provides a useful barometer of the progress countries are making in their uptake of technologies such as renewable power carbon capture and storage electric vehicles and energy efficiency measures the findings also highlight the benefit of supportive government policies in limiting climate change to 2 degrees celsius calls for carbon capture and storage the uk lags behind on rollout of carbon capture and storage ccs technologies only norway canada australia usa brazil and china currently have facilities to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at scale and worldwide only 25 kg of co 2 per person per year is captured versus an average annual carbon footprint per person of 5 tonnes of co 2  storage resources are not the barrier to deployment the international energy agency estimates that 100 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide must be stored underground by 2060 to limit temperature rise to 2c for least cost usa alone has estimated storage capacity for over 100 trillion tonnes of carbon and the uk has capacity for 70 billion tonnes instead the barriers are political usa benefits from tax credits that have been in place since 2008 for geological storage of carbon and chinas last two five year plans have included specific goals to develop ccs with most estimates outlining that significant ccs deployment is needed to limit the impact of climate change the uk needs large scale deployment of the technology to remain a world leader in environmental progress wider report findings the uk and denmark lead global efforts to move away from coal for power generation but many asian countries including indonesia india and japan are increasing their reliance on fossil fuels the countries with the cleanest power systems  norway france and new zealand rely heavily on hydro or nuclear power the uk is home to the worlds 5th largest electric vehicle fleet and 1 in every 40 new cars sold in the uk is electric but norway leads by far in terms of uptake of electric vehicles with half of all its cars now electric norway also leads in installation of car charging points with one charger for every 500 people in the uk there is one charger for every 5000 people europe remains the global leader in energy efficient housing residential homes in portugal germany netherlands and the uk are among the most energy efficient by comparison rising incomes mean china and south africa are increasing their energy intensity the study shows that rising incomes across the bric economies are displacing public transport as populations with rising disposable incomes move towards private vehicles as a result china india and indonesia have increased their energy consumption per person in transport by over 50 over the last decade figure 2 current largescale carbon capture capacity in

first bioenergy carbon capture and storage pilot now underway press releases commissioning of the beccs pilot plant at drax power station will begin on monday november 26  the tenth anniversary of the climate change act it puts britain at the forefront of the race to develop beccs and could enable drax to become the worlds first carbon negative power station the commissioning of an innovative bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot plant at drax power station has started with the first carbon dioxide expected to be captured in the coming weeks if successful the six month pilot project will capture a tonne of co 2 a day from the gases produced when renewable power is generated using biomass at drax  the uks biggest power station near selby in north yorkshire beccs is vital to global efforts to combat climate change because the technology will mean the gases that cause global warning can be removed from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced this means power generation would start to reduce the carbon accumulating in the atmosphere  vital for tackling climate change drax is partnering with leedsbased ccapture and is investing 400000 in what could be the first of several pilot projects undertaken at the power station to deliver a rapid lower cost demonstration of beccs drax power station became the largest decarbonisation project in europe by upgrading two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal and if the beccs pilot is successful it will examine options for a similar repurposing of existing infrastructure to deliver more carbon savings the royal society and royal academy of engineering have estimated that beccs could enable us to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050  approximately half the nations emissions target will gardiner ceo drax group said our beccs pilot project is the uks first step to delivering a key technology in the fight against climate change if this project is successful it could enable drax to become the worlds first carbon negative power station  something many would never have dreamed possible a decade ago starting to commission the pilot plant on the tenth anniversary of the climate change act demonstrates the progress made in decarbonising energy in the uk  but there is much more to do and this will be our focus at the edinburgh ccs summit later this week at drax we want to create a low carbon future  to do that we have to test the technologies that could allow us as well as the uk and the world to deliver negative emissions and start to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lr andy koss drax power ceo with prof chris rayner technical director ccapture ltd foreground eva penalver garcia drax group research and

remove emissions from the atmosphere and help achieve long term decarbonisation energy  clean growth minister claire perry said this major milestone in developing cuttingedge technology to reduce emissions while growing the economy shows our modern industrial strategy in action backed by government funded innovation drax has helped put the uk on the map when it comes to carbon capture ahead of pivotal talks with global leaders in edinburgh this week which aim to supercharge the global deployment of this gamechanging technology over the summer work was undertaken to ensure the solvent ccapture has developed is compatible with the biomass flue gas at drax power station this was completed successfully along with a labscale study into the feasibility of reutilising the flue gas desulphurisation fgd absorbers at the power station fgd equipment is vital for reducing sulphur emissions from coal but it is no longer required to control sulphur on four of the generating units at drax that have been upgraded to use biomass because the wood pellets used produce minimal levels of sulphur the ccapture team has now proceeded to the second phase of the pilot with the installation of a demonstration unit once commissioned it will isolate the carbon dioxide produced by the biomass combustion chris rayner founder of ccapture and professor of organic chemistry at the university of leeds said its clear that beccs is one of a very limited number of viable negative emissions technologies and is vital if we are to reach our co 2 emissions targets not just in the uk but around the world being a key part of europes first beccs demonstration project is a great opportunity to showcase ccaptures technology and through working with drax show how we can make a real impact on climate change caspar schoolderman director of engineering at ccapture added this is a very important milestone on the pathway to demonstrating and scaling up our exciting new technology working closely with the team from drax has been a great experience and we look forward to getting the demonstrator fully operational and showing just how good our technology is ccapture is a spinout from the department

the world  around 70 of the electricity it produces is renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 drax is in discussions with the british beer and pub association to see if it could help keep the fizz in the drinks industry as part of its efforts to ensure the carbon captured during the beccs pilot project is used in another process or industry ccapture is a spin out from the chemistry department at leeds

green shipping alliance partners with drax and ultrabulk to cut shipping supply chain emissions 20 november 2018 press releases drax operator of the uks largest power station is partnering with the smart green shipping alliance ssga leading dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design naval architects of dame ellen mcarthurs  kingfisher  yacht to tackle the mounting issue of co 2 emissions from the shipping industry a 100000 12month feasibility study funded by innovateuk the institution of mechanical engineers imeche and private investors has begun which will examine the potential of fitting an innovative sail technology called fastrig onto ultrabulk ships importing biomass into the uk for cutting both carbon emissions and costs the shipping industry emits roughly 3 of global co 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions co 2 equivalent or approximately 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other ghgs per year thats over twice as much as the uks total emissions from all sources drax power station in north yorkshire has transformed its business having converted two thirds of the power station to use biomass instead of coal  it is now europes biggest decarbonisation project last year it imported 68 million tonnes of the compressed wood pellets in 221 deliveries to the ports of immingham hull tyne and liverpool to enable it to generate 14 of the uks renewable electricity using biomass at drax has delivered carbon savings of more than 80 compared to coal  this includes supply chain emissions but shipping remains one of the most carbon intensive parts of the biomass supply chain draxs desire to drive down emissions even further enabled smart green shipping to partner with an end user looking for the lowest carbon cargo provider diane gilpin ceo and founder of smart green shipping alliance said this is a project that could really make a difference to the way the industry operates draxs determination to cut carbon emissions creates real demand reducing emissions is good business it saves costs and improves longterm operational certainty this study aims to find the sweet spot between reducing emissions and saving fuel costs were engaging across shipping working with port owners shipbuilders cargo owners and financiers to design pragmatic and effective new systems solutions the prototypes were looking to develop are really exciting a 21st century sailinghybrid ship will look as much like the cutty sark as a tesla does a model t ford gilpin is an expert on the uk governments clean maritime council which will devise a strategy to reduce emissions from the shipping sector uk shipping minister nusrat ghani said at the councils inaugural meeting the clean maritime plan will bring new opportunities for britains businesses to design develop and sell green solutions to this global challenge drax group ceo will gardiner said smart green shipping alliances pioneering efforts to deliver cleaner greener transportation could help achieve the clean growth required for the uk to meet its climate targets if were serious about meeting those targets decarbonising transportation is the next big challenge the combination of green shipping with renewables makes an even greater contribution to decarbonisation globally this is a key development in achieving draxs aim  to deliver a zero carbon low cost future for all the innovation leads on the project rob and tom humphreys of humphreys yacht design explained how their teams background in ocean racing has helped them to make technical advances in an industry that has used the same technology for the past century tom said transferring knowledge and technologies from offshore yacht racing to improve the performance of commercial merchant ships mirrors the way formula one drives design development in the automotive industry weve worked on americas cup and volvo ocean race campaigns competing at the highest level applying this technology to the commercial shipping industry means that we are able to make very significant fuels saving advances said rob the first six months of the project will be a technical feasibility study establishing the mechanical parameters for retrofitting the fastrig solution onto ships the next six months will focus on putting together a business case and calculating detailed costings for the project the aim is to retrofit a ship with the fastrig technology  depending on the outcome of the feasibility study the launch of the commercial demonstrator could be done as soon as 2021 the technology could drive down not only carbon emissions but also cost diane gilpin explained fuel prices are vulnerable to oil market volatility but once the technology is developed wind is free at the point of use the first onshore wind turbines were single devices producing 45kw now were seeing fleets of 10mw producing energy without subsidy we can expect to mirror that speed of transition in the shipping industry the sgsa has been pioneering the uptake of renewables in the maritime industry since 2014 identifying wind power as the first choice of exploration the longterm aim of the company is to develop commercially viable zeroemission vessels the eventual aim is to combine renewable energy from wind power with biofuels per lange ceo of ultrabulk said we are very much looking forward to working with our partners at drax and smart green shipping alliance the feasibility study initiated is very much in line with the environmental focus of ultrabulk and the shipping industry at large we have made considerable improvements to nox and sox emissions the latter being the focus as in 2019 the sox emission has to be reduced by 85 per cent as an industry we are under way to deliver on these limits but we shall naturally not stop there co 2 still needs to be reduced as well as the shipping industrys commitment through international maritime organisation targets ultrabulk is committed to achieving significant additional reductions the smart green shipping alliance is an exciting step in that direction dr jenifer baxter head of engineering imeche said this is an exciting project that addresses one of the more difficult decarbonisation challenges and represents the ingenuity of engineering that the institution of mechanical engineers seeks to support shipping has been a part of our global transportation system for hundreds of years moving through wind and manpower to coal and diesel power this project presents a new phase taking us full circle forward again to wind power leading the way with stateoftheart power and engine technologies enabling shipping to remain relevant and commercially viable in an increasingly lowcarbon world ends for more information contact sgsa diane gilpin
