Press Release
Companies meet to discuss negative emissions ambitions
10 January 2020
Press releases

In August 2019 Velocys’ subsidiary
Altalto
Immingham Limited, a collaboration with British Airways and Shell, submitted plans for Europe’s first commercial waste-to-jet-fuel plant near Immingham on the South Bank of the Humber. The company has since voiced its support for the Zero Carbon Humber campaign, which is seeking to develop a large-scale carbon dioxide transport and storage network in the Humber that would significantly reduce emissions and create new job opportunities for the region.
Dr Neville Hargreaves, VP Waste to Fuels, Velocys, said:
“Subject to planning consent and financing, our Altalto Immingham project could be producing sustainable aviation fuel as soon as 2024. Velocys has a robust technological solution for this challenging sector which addresses one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise and can help the UK meet its net zero target.”
“Furthermore, we’ll also produce a capture-ready stream of carbon dioxide, and thus a transport and storage network in the Humber would allow us to make negative emission fuels, delivering a further environmental benefit.”
Steve Drayton (Director of Innovation, Drax),  Dr Neville Hargreaves (VP Waste to Fuels, Velocys), Brian Greensmith (Drax), Richard Gwilliam (Drax), Martin Hopkins (Velocys)
Steve Drayton, Director of Innovation at Drax said:
“There are some interesting synergies between our ambitions at Drax to become the world’s first carbon negative company and Velocys’ plans to produce carbon negative fuels in the Humber.
“Having innovative businesses like Velocys in the Humber region makes a zero carbon industrial cluster here an exciting possibility, which will result in new jobs and clean growth delivering for the environment as well as the economy.”
The Zero Carbon Humber campaign
aims to create the UK’s first net zero industrial cluster in the region which could make a bigger contribution to UK’s climate goals than any other industrial cluster – capturing 15% of the UK’s current annual CO
2
emissions.
By using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) Drax will be able to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces, creating a negative carbon footprint for the company.

Notes to editors:
Drax was the first company in the world
to announce an ambition
to become carbon negative by 2030 when CEO Will Gardiner spoke at COP 25 in Madrid in December.
Sustainable biomass is an important part of the UK’s long-term energy mix. Combining this renewable fuel with carbon capture and storage technology on Drax’s biomass generating units at its power station in North Yorkshire, England, means the Group’s operations could capture 16 million tonnes of CO
2
a year or more – a significant proportion of the UK’s target.
Drax
announced it had captured the first carbon dioxide
from its pioneering BECCS pilot project earlier this year.
The UK Committee on Climate Change’s ‘
Net Zero
’ report states that BECCS could generate up to 173 TWh of electricity by 2050, capturing up to 51 million tonnes of CO
2
– around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the UK will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.
Drax
launched the Zero Carbon Humber
campaign in September with partners Equinor and National Grid Ventures, aimed at creating the world’s first zero carbon industrial cluster in the region.
About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. Its 2,900-strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
Customers:
Drax owns two B2B energy supply businesses:
Haven Power, based in Ipswich, supplies electricity and energy services to large Industrial and Commercial sector businesses.
Opus Energy, based in Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, provides electricity, energy services and gas to small and medium sized (SME) businesses.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.

New tartan to commemorate workers who died building unique Scottish power station
23 December 2019
Press releases

The design, based on the Clan MacColl tartan sett, uses 15 strands of a special dark blue thread to represent those who tragically lost their lives building what was the world’s first reversible pumped storage hydro system, located in the Western Highlands of Scotland.
Ian Kinnaird, Head of Hydro at Drax, said:

“Building this unique power station was an astonishing feat of engineering, completed in challenging conditions. The work was physically demanding and at times, incredibly dangerous. Sadly, during the course of the construction, 15 men lost their lives.
“When we were commissioning this new tartan, we decided it was a fitting tribute to incorporate 15 dark blue threads in memory of those who tragically died – many of whom were very young.”
Between 1959 and 1965, a 4,000-strong workforce built the power station on the shore of Loch Awe in Argyll and Bute – 1,300 of them were known as ‘Tunnel Tigers’ – the men at the forefront of the work. They drilled, blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of the mountain.
Barbara McCabe, aged 81. Click to view/download.
One of those who died was 23-year-old Edward Gallagher, from Donegal – the fiancé of Barbara McCabe, now 81, who lives in Inverness-shire.
Mrs McCabe explained how she got engaged to Edward on December 21, 1961 and they were planning to get married the following September.
However, tragedy struck just before Easter 1962, when loose rock in the ceiling of a tunnel  fell down – the force of which was so strong, it pulled Edward out of his protective footwear.
“He was such a lovely, lovely man,”
Mrs McCabe, recalled.
“Eddie’s father sent me a telegram and what it said was: ‘Is Eddie alright?’ I didn’t know what it meant, I was busy getting ready for Eddie coming down so we could spend Easter together.
“He shouldn’t have been at work, but he’d swapped shifts with someone else who wanted to go home early for Easter – that was what Eddie was like. He was a great young man, always doing things like that to help people.”

Mrs McCabe explained that Mr Gallagher’s father travelled across from Ireland and they went together to the cottage hospital at Oban where Edward was being treated.
“When I saw Eddie, there wasn’t a mark on his face – but we were told his injuries were so severe there was no hope of survival. He passed away in the early hours of Easter Monday – the 23
rd
of April 1962.”
Mrs McCabe has always stayed in touch with Mr Gallagher’s family in Donegal and has visited his grave at a chapel in the village of Termon, near Letterkenny.
Of the tartan Drax has commissioned, she said:
“I think it’s a lovely way to make sure Eddie and the others who died are always remembered. I’ve told his family about it and I’m going to be sending them one of the new tartan scarves this Christmas.”
Edward Gallagher (L), February 1962. Click to view/download.
Hollowing out the Ben Cruachan mountain was done by hand-drilling two to three-metre-deep holes into the granite rockface. Gelignite was packed into the drilled holes and detonated – blasted rocks were then removed by bulldozers, trucks and shovels, before drilling began on a fresh section of exposed granite. Eventually some 220,000 cubic metres of rubble was removed.
Ian MacLean, from Oban, was a 20-year-old joiner when he started working at Cruachan in 1962. He said:
“I worked as a joiner on the roof of what is the machine hall now. The noise from the blasting was incredible – you didn’t just hear it, you felt it too.
“There was a lot of dust, but what bothered us the most was the smell – it was horrible. There were fumes from the explosives as well as the dump truck’s diesel engines that were running all the time – and we didn’t have masks to wear. Some days the air was so thick you could only see a few yards in front of where you were standing.”

In total, 20km of tunnels and chambers were excavated, including the kilometre-long entrance tunnel and the 91-metre-long, 36-metre-high machine hall.
The 77-year-old says that despite the conditions he worked in, it was an interesting job and he earned good money:
“When I finished as an apprentice joiner I was earning £9 a week – when I started working at Cruachan I was on treble that. The conditions we were working in were tough – but I met some great people and we were young. It’s just what we did.”

Polish and Irish labourers worked alongside Scots, as well as displaced Europeans, prisoners of the second world war and even workers from as far away as Asia.
The 15 men who died are remembered at Cruachan in a mural on the wall of the turbine hall at the heart of the power station and now visitors to the award-winning ‘Hollow Mountain’ visitor centre will see the new tartan waistcoats worn by guides.
Sarah Cameron, Drax’s Manager of the Hollow Mountain visitor centre at Cruachan, added:
“Our visitor centre guides will proudly wear the tartan on their waistcoats and continue to tell the stories about how this unique power station was built. It’s important that we remember the 15 men who died and the many others who were injured building this unique power station.”
The new tartan, made by Kinloch Anderson in Edinburgh, based on the Clan MacColl Sett, which was created in respect of Sir Edward MacColl, the brainchild and pioneer of Cruachan Power Station, has also been used to make some special scarves, available to buy from the visitor centre shop.
The Hollow Mountain visitor centre’s interactive exhibitions and displays help bring the history of the power station to life and explain how electricity is generated. There is also a café, gift shop and picnic area.
The visitor centre is closed now for Christmas and the New Year – reopening in February. To find out more or to book a tour go to

Editor’s Notes
Read more about the men who built Cruachan on the Drax
website
.
Drax acquired Cruachan power station at the end of 2018, when it bought a portfolio of flexible, renewable and low-carbon power stations located across Scotland and England.
Since then, the visitor centre has been renovated and Drax has also introduced free school tours during term time as part of the company’s efforts to boost STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) skills.
50,000 people visit Cruachan Power Station each year and take guided tours inside the subterranean world of the power station, where they can see the machine hall and learn about its history and the feat of engineering required to build it.
Cruachan is one of four pumped hydro storage stations in the UK and has a capacity of 440 MW – enough to power more than 90,000 homes during peak demand.
Built on the shores of Loch Awe in Argyll and Bute, it was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on this scale to be built in the world.
The turbine hall is located 1 km within the hollowed-out mountain of Ben Cruachan and houses four generators, supplying a range of vital balancing and ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency control, spinning and operating reserves, helping to maintain secure power supplies.
Drax’s Scottish operations include hydro facilities in Galloway and Lanark and a biomass-from-waste plant at Daldowie, near Glasgow, along with Cruachan, all of which were acquired at the end of last year.

Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I offers green energy to pubs
20 December 2019
Press releases

The programme supports the brewer’s ambitious Sustainability Goals while helping customers save on their monthly energy bills
The programme, in partnership with Opus Energy, is currently in a pilot phase and will roll out nationwide in Spring 2020
The launch follows customer research which revealed that energy bills score high on the list of priorities for pubs and bars looking to reduce costs.
[1]
As such, Budweiser Brewing Group is evolving its offering — directly addressing the needs and demands of pub and bar operators up and down the country, while helping to reduce their environmental impact.
The exclusive renewable electricity tariff is offered by
Opus Energy
, part of Drax Group, and is guaranteed to be cheaper than any other deal found through price comparison or third-party alternatives, with a saving of up to 30% from existing standard renewal prices from other suppliers.
Pubs and bars which take advantage of the exclusive deal will join over 355,000 business premises in the UK currently powered by renewable electricity from Opus Energy. The programme is currently in pilot phase with 100 pubs and will roll out in Spring 2020, helping more businesses to reduce their carbon emissions and contribute to tackling the climate crisis.
Paula Lindenberg, President at Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I says,
“For us, sustainability isn’t just about looking at our own operations — it’s also about looking outward and supporting our customers. We know that our customers are eager to save on energy costs, and that consumers are more environmentally conscious than ever, so this really is a sweet spot where we can make a difference.”
Marc Montgomery, Director of SME Direct, Opus Energy says,
“We’re thrilled to team up with Budweiser Brewing Group to supply renewable electricity to more pubs and bars across the UK. Enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future for businesses is our purpose, and this partnership will help more pubs to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute towards the UK’s net zero carbon targets.”
This deal is the latest in a series of sustainability initiatives by Budweiser Brewing Group. Last year, it signed the UK’s biggest unsubsidised solar power deal with Lightsource BP to brew Budweiser with 100% renewable electricity for its UK operations by the end of 2020.
With completion of the new UK solar farm expected by mid-2020, all UK-brewed Budweiser will begin to feature a new symbol to encourage consumers to choose a beer brewed with 100% renewable electricity. Similarly, Budweiser Brewing Group will offer window decals for pubs that sign up to the Opus Energy deal.
The investment in UK solar reinforces the brewer’s commitment to its 2025 Sustainability Goals, which includes the target of a 25% reduction to carbon emissions across its value chain against a 2017 baseline – the equivalent of taking more than 1.5 million cars off the road each year.
Drax Group is the first business in the world to
announce an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030
– making a major contribution towards global efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), Drax will remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces, creating a negative carbon footprint for the company.

Drax employees raise £5K and give 262 kilos of goods to local food banks at Christmas
Press releases

Following a successful year, during which two major turbine outages were completed at the power station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, the turbine outage team at Drax continued its annual tradition of raising money for charity. This year the total reached £5,000, the largest amount ever raised.
The money raised was split between the two food banks and ‘Baby Dinosaurs’, a local charity selling pre-loved toys at an affordable price. Drax members of the union Unite, also donated a cheque of £200 to each food bank in addition to the £5,000 raised by Drax.
Employees across the power station also contributed to the Christmas cheer through a food bank appeal. Throughout December, employees donated food, toiletries and other treats to help make sure local people who may be struggling with food poverty can enjoy Christmas.
In total 262 kilos were donated, consisting of tins, packets and jars of goods.
Vicky Bullivant, Drax’s head of sustainable business, said:
“Christmas is a time for giving and sharing. At Drax we recognise the vital work of the local food banks and employees across the business have contributed to the total raised – with special thanks to the turbine outage team for their outstanding fundraising efforts this year.
“The smallest donation can make a big difference to someone who is struggling financially – especially at this time of year. We hope that everyone in our communities has a happy Christmas.”
The donations were delivered to two local food banks: Selby and District Foodbank and Mission Trinity at Goole Methodist Church.
Mark Barnett from Selby and District Foodbank said:
“Receiving donations like this from Drax make a huge difference to the number of people we can help at Christmas – a time which can be very difficult for people facing financial difficulties. Food poverty is a growing issue in the UK with one in five of the population living below the poverty line.”
Caroline Sample from Mission Trinity at Goole Methodist Church said:
“We want to say a big thank you to everyone at Drax who has helped raise this money or donated food and other items this Christmas – it will mean a lot to the people who need our help at this time of year.”
The Selby and District Foodbank is one of 1,200 foodbanks supported by the Trussell Trust’s Foodbank Network. Between April 2018 and March 2019, Trussell Trust food banks provided a record 1.6 million food supplies to people in crisis.

Will Gardiner comments on Scotland progress report from the Committee on Climate Change
17 December 2019
Press releases

“Drax recognises the need for ambitious action to address the climate crisis. We’re investing in our flexible, renewable, and low-carbon power stations in Scotland, which play a critical role in supporting more renewables whilst maintaining secure power supplies
. It is vital that Scotland’s workforce has the skills needed to deliver these ambitious climate targets, which is why
we have introduced a new apprenticeship scheme across Drax’s Scottish sites
. Drax is ready to work with both the Scottish and UK Governments to secure a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.“



Oban apprentices impress at Cruachan Power Station
16 December 2019
Press releases

Two apprentices from Oban are kick starting their careers with Drax after the company extended its apprenticeship scheme to budding engineers across Scotland.
Drax is continuing its commitment to STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) skills by offering apprenticeships at its Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station, in Argyll and Bute, Galloway hydro power scheme and the Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow.
Iain Macpherson, aged 17, from Oban, has joined Drax’s Cruachan power station as a technical apprentice.
He said: “I have always been interested in engineering. Whilst I was at school I was fortunate enough to do work experience here at Cruachan Power Station. Since then, I knew engineering was for me. Drax is a brilliant company to work at, so becoming an apprentice was an opportunity not to be missed.”
Joshua Smith, aged 24, also from Oban, said of his new apprenticeship at Cruachan Power Station:
“An apprenticeship is a great way to learn, you get the chance to learn new, hands on skills. At college, you only learn the theoretical side, but doing this apprenticeship I’m learning so much more. Drax has great values and really cares about all of their employees.”
Both Iain and Joshua will be working at Cruachan once they have completed formal training at East Kilbride Group Training Association (EKGTA).
Drax’s apprenticeship scheme has been running for over 15 years at its North Yorkshire power station, and since it acquired a wider portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable generating assets, some of which are in Scotland, it has sought to extend the scheme to other locations.
Andy Koss, CEO Generation said:
“To be able to open up new opportunities for apprentices in Scotland is a really proud moment for us. It demonstrates our commitment to education and skills, as well as our dedication to our workforce and the future of these new Drax sites.
“The energy sector is experiencing unprecedented change with Drax right at the forefront of it. We’re going to continue to need talented, hard-working young people to help us deliver the changes needed to meet the UK’s net zero carbon ambitions. As we’ve seen with our apprentices elsewhere, supporting ambitious young people to develop their skills is critical to the ongoing success of our business.”
Drax’s technical apprenticeship scheme
gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside highly qualified engineers. It is a four-year programme, and specialises in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation.
Drax offers apprenticeships in business support areas too, such as Finance and Business Administration, as well as engineering.
All opportunities are advertised on its website
.
This year’s apprentices at Drax’s Scottish operations are:
Danielle Nicholson (19) who will be working at Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow
Gregor Fraser (19) who will be working at Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow
Iain MacPherson (17) who will be working at Cruachan pumped hydro power station, Argyll and Bute
Joshua Smith (24) who will be working at Cruachan pumped hydro power station, in Argyll and Bute
Ryan Connelly (19) who will be working at Galloway hydro power scheme.
