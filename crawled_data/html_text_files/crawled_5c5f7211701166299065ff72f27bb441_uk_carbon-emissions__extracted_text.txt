climate change targets our carbon negative ambition our purpose  to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future  means drax is investing to play a leading role in the uks journey to a net zero economy in december 2019 at cop25 in madrid we set an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 this purpose and ambition drive our commitment to address climate change since 2012 the groups actions have reduced our generation scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by approximately 99 at drax we have set an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 by removing more carbon from the atmosphere than we produce scope 1 and 2 helping the uk achieve its net zero target by then beccs at drax could deliver up to 8mt of co2 removals a year this would deliver over 15 of the carbon removals the uk requires to achieve net zero by 2050 according to figures provided by the ccc in their 2019 net zero report we aim to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030 by reducing our emissions as far as possible groupwide while using removals delivered through beccs to neutralise our remaining emissions in doing so we will also support the uk government and other businesses to achieve net zero carbon emissions we are committed to the science based targets initiative sbti and have submitted our targets for validation to align with our sbti targets drax set a new baseline for our carbon emissions data to ensure comparability to our 2020 base year towards carbon negative a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation the uks plans to achieve net zero by 2050 will require the electrification of sectors such as heating and transport systems resulting in a significant increase in demand for electricity we believe that intermittent renewable and inflexible lowcarbon energy sources  wind solar and nuclear  could help meet this demand however this will only be possible if the remaining power sources can provide the dispatchable power and nongeneration system support services required to ensure security of supply and to limit the cost to the consumer longterm biomass generation and pumped storage hydro can provide these increasingly important services and we are developing an option for new pumped storage  the expansion of cruachan power station  to provide an additional 600mw of dispatchable longduration storage to the power system a planning application was submitted in may 2022 and any investment remains subject to the right investment infrastructure and support the location flexibility and range of services cruachan can provide makes it strategically important to the uk power system a final investment decision could be taken in 2024 and the development operational by 2030 any investment decision will depend on the right regulatory framework understanding our
