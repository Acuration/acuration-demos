great britain is almost ready for coalfree summers coal accounted for less than 1 of the countrys electricity in june will the rest of the world follow its lead 14 august 2018 power generation every summer great britain uses less and less coal this june the fossil fuels share of the electricity mix dipped below 1 for the first time ever  for 12 days it dropped all the way to zero spurred on by the beginnings of an uncharacteristically dry hot summer and a jump in solar generation the possibility of the country going entirely coalfree for a full summer now looks more achievable than ever in modern times this is one of the key findings from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london it found that across q2 2018 there were as many coalfree hours as in the whole of 2016 and 2017 combined and while the reports findings are hugely positive they also hint at where development is still needed what else does the performance of this quarter tell us about what we can expect in the power sector  in great britain and around the world great britain is slashing coal generation the rest of the world needs to catch up great britain has reduced its coalfired power generation by fourfifths over the last five years last quarter the countrys coal fleet ran at just 3 of its 129 gigawatt gw capacity coal capacity is now lower than the capacity of solar pv panels 131 gw installed nationwide with the most recent decline resulting from draxs conversion of a fourth unit from coal to biomass  when coal generation was running it primarily provided system balancing services overnight in may and june rather than baseload electricity however this positive trend is not seen around the world the share of coal in national power systems during 2017 globally coal still provides 38 of the worlds electricity  the same amount it did 30 years ago this comes despite efforts in europe and north america to move away from coal and growing investment into renewable generation and technologies overall europes coal generation dropped from 39 to 22 over the last 30 years  despite some countries  such as poland and serbia  still drawing significant generation from the fossil fuel the us has also reduced its coal generation from 57 to 31 over the past 30 years as natural gas proves more economical even in an era of procoal policies  coal train at rail station in india however in the middle east and africa which draw significant generation from their oil and gas reserves and south america where coal accounts for less than 3 of generation total coal generation is growing in fact globally only seven countries use less coal today than 30 years ago germany poland spain ukraine the us great britain and canada electric insights attributes part of this global growth to the continued increase in demand for electricity particularly in asia china south korea and indonesia collectively burn 10 times more coal than they did 30 years ago indias coal habit has also increased over the past decade to account for 76 of its electricity generation while japans usage has grown from 15 to 34 in the same period as well as the stresses created by growing demand this highlights a global disparity in the approach to decarbonising electricity systems and a need for longerterm environmentally and sociallyconscious marketbased initiatives that encourage meaningful movement to lowercarbon electricity sources such as the uk and canadas powering past coal alliance  read the full articles here lack of progress in global electricity generation britain edges closer to zero coal solar farm in south wales decarbonisation is growing but its going to get harder great britains decline in coal use has rapidly accelerated its decarbonisation efforts annual coal power station emissions have shrunk over the past five years from 129 to 19 million tonnes of co 2 and helped reduce the average carbon intensity of electricity generation to a record low of 195 gkwh last quarter however this rapid pace of decarbonisation is unlikely to be sustained as growth in renewables faces a plateau the countrys current nuclear capacity reaches retirement and the target of moving beyond coal by 2025 is completed renewable sources now account for a steady 25 of annual electricity generation these sources largely came onto the system through policies such as the governments renewables obligation which is now closed to entrants contracts for differences the future of which is uncertain for mature technologies like onshore wind and solar and feedin tariffs for rooftop solar installations which will close in april 2019 the end of these initiative paints a hazy picture of how future renewable capacity will be brought into the system nuclear capacity also looks unlikely to expand at the rate needed to plug gaps in demand with half of the countrys fleet expected to close for safety reasons by 2025 the hinkley point c nuclear power station meanwhile is only expected to come online at the end of that year  read the full article here has britains power sector decarbonisation stalled ramsgate kent during summer 2018 heatwave weather will continue to play a major part in renewable generation if the first quarter of 2018 was defined by low temperatures and heavy snowfall  the second quarter saw the impact of the opposite in weather conditions from 23 june a heatwave set in around the country that saw temperatures increase by 33 o c in a week driving demand to jump 860 mw  the equivalent of an extra 25 million households or an area the size of scotland  the increase in demand isnt as drastic as when cold fronts hit but if summers continue to get hotter this could change today wintertime demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it drops below 14 o c as electric heaters are plugged in to aid largely gasbased centralheating systems when the mercury rises however demand increases by 350 mw for every degree rise over 20 o c as businesses turn on air conditioning and the countrys refrigerators work harder these heatwave spikes are at the moment more easily dealt with than winter storms while the beast from the east saw demand reaching a peak of 533 gw junes topped out at 325 gw the clear skies and long days of june also meant solar pv generation soared making up for the wind drought caused by the highpressure weather wind output floated between 03 gw and 43 gw in june far below its quarter peak to 13 gw however solar made up for this by peaking past 8 gw for 13 days in june and setting a new record of 939 gw at lunchtime on 27 june read the full articles how the heat wave affects electricity demand the summer wind drought and smashing solar explore
