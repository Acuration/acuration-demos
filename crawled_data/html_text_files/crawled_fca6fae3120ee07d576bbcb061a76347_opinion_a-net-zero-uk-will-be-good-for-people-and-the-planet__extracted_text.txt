net zero uk will be good for people and the planet from our work to our health a zero carbon economy offers opportunities for society says drax ceo will gardiner will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 24 november 2020 opinion for the uk to reach net zero co 2 emissions by 2050 and do its part in tackling the biggest challenge of our time all sectors of the economy must reduce their emissions and do it quickly i believe the best approach to tackling climate change is through cobenefit solutions solutions that not only have a positive environmental impact but that are economically progressive for society today and in the future through training skills and job creation as an energy company this task is especially important for drax we have a responsibility to future generations to innovate and use our engineering skills to deliver power thats renewable sustainable and that doesnt come at a cost to the environment wwwdraxcomcaptureit our work on zero carbon humber  in partnership with 11 other forwardthinking organisations aims to deploy the negative emissions technology beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as well as ccus carbon capture usage and storage in industry and power and ramp up hydrogen production as a low carbon fuel these are all essential technologies in bringing the uk to net zero but they are also innovative projects at scale that can benefit society and the lives of people in the humber and around the uk new jobs in a new sector the humber region has a proud history in heavy industries  what began as a thriving ship building hub has evolved to include chemicals refining and steel manufacturing however these emissionsintensive industries have grown increasingly expensive to operate and many have left for countries where they can be run cheaper leading to a decline in the humber region if they are not decarbonised these industries will face an even greater cost by 2040 emitters could face billions of pounds per year in carbon taxes making them less competitive and less attractive for international investment deploying carbon capture and hydrogen are essential steps towards modernising these businesses and protecting up to 55000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the region capturing carbon at drax delivering jobs clean growth and levelling up the humber click to view executive summary and case studies from vivid economics report for drax a report by vivid economics commissioned by drax found that carbon capture and hydrogen in the humber could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades as well as protecting peoples livelihoods decarbonisation is also a matter of public health in the humber alone higher air quality could save 148 million in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 i believe the uk is well position to rise to the challenge and lead the world in decarbonisation technology there is a clear opportunity to export knowledge and skills to other countries embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys beccs alone could create many more jobs related to exporting the technology and operational knowhow and deliver additional value for the economy as interest in negative emissions grows around the world the uk needs to move quickly to secure a competitive advantage a fairer economy this is in many ways the start of a new sector in our economy  one that can offer new employment earnings and economic growth it comes at just the right time without intervention to spur a green recovery the covid19 crisis risks subjecting longterm economic damage being at the beginning of the industrial decarbonisation journey means we also have the power to shape this new industry in a way that spreads the benefits across the whole of the uk weve previously seen sector deals struck between the government and industry include equality measures for example the nuclear industry aims to count women as 40 of its employees by 2030 while offshore wind is committed to sourcing 60 of its supply chain from the uk  wind turbines at bridlington east yorkshire at present the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk contributing to a pronounced skills gap among the workforce in addition almost 60 of construction workers across the wider yorkshire and humber region were furloughed as of august 2020 a project such as zero carbon humber could address this regional imbalance and offer skilled long term jobs to local communities thats why i welcome the prime ministers announcement of 1bn investment to support the establishment of ccus in the humber and other superplaces around the uk as the governments ten point plan says ccus can help decarbonise our most challenging sectors provide low carbon power and a pathway to negative emissions healthier forests the cobenefits of beccs extend beyond our communities in the uk we aim to become carbon negative by 2030 by removing our co 2 emissions from the atmosphere and abating emissions that might still exist on the uks path to net zero this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use continues to be sourced from sustainable forests that positively benefit the environment and the communities in which we and our suppliers operate engineer working in turbine hall drax power station north yorkshire i believe we must continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light we can help ensure the uks biomass sourcing is led by the latest science  best practice and transparency  supporting healthy biodiverse forests around the world and even apply it internationally global leadership delivering deep decarbonisation for the uk will require collaboration from industries government and society what we can achieve through largescale projects like zero carbon humber is more than just the vital issue of reduced emissions it is also about creating jobs protecting health and improving livelihoods these are more than just benefits they are the makings of a future filled with opportunity for the humber and for the uks green industrial revolution  by implementing the ten point plan and publishing its national determined contributions ndcs ahead of cop26 in
