centre of drax power station in a corner of the cavernous turbine hall is a white box the inside of this box is spotlessly clean not only are its white walls free of dirt they are free of even dust but there is one outlier inside this sterile environment a 300tonne chunk of industrial equipment this equipment is a generator core  the central component for converting the mechanical energy to electrical power the core is driven by the steam turbine ninety tonnes of generator rotor spinning at 3000 rpm with just millimetres of clearance from the core produce 660 megawatts mw of electricity thats enough  645 mw when exported from drax into the national grid  to power a city the size of sheffield the generator is a serious piece of industrial machinery and despite the pristine conditions this white box is the site of serious engineering a process normally done by largescale manufacturers in dedicated factories rewinding a generator core  as the process is called  is a major operation no other uk facility is capable of doing this complex job so its here in a white box in the middle of an operational power station in north yorkshire that a team of engineers is undertaking work that will secure the generators use for decades this is the drax rewinding facility how a generator works a generator consists of two main components a spinning rotor and a stationary stator the rotor which is directly connected to the main turbine and spins 50 times every second sits inside the stator both the stator and the rotor contain a large number of copper coils known as windings these windings are what carry the electrical current the rotor acts like a very strong electromagnet which when a voltage is applied produces a strong magnetic field because the rotor sits inside the stator this magnetic field intersects the copper windings of the stator and induces a voltage in these windings allowing current to flow this voltage is then brought out of the stator and passed through a stepup transformer where it is increased to a level suitable for transmission through the national grid the stator core is made from many elements with hundreds of thousands of laminations 84 watercooled insulated copper bars each 11 metres long and weighing 200kg forming the windings various insulating materials blocks packing wedges and condition monitoring equipment generator stators can operate for decades without fault diy at drax in 2016 a team of engineers at drax embarked on a project to construct a facility to rewind the stator on site this required crosscompany collaborative working to design and construct this huge purpose built facility contamination can cause operational problems so the team built a sterile white room within the turbine hall  one of just two places within the power station with foundations strong enough to support the incredible 450 tonnes required for the rewind facility designed to hold the stator core and the conductor bars air is forced out of the room to limit the possibility of contamination to the core during the rewind when the unit is in service it becomes magnetic so any metallic particles left in the space will be attracted to the core explains drax electrical engineer thomas walker once magnetised any metal particles could be drawn in burrowing into the insulation and core lamination this is the kind of event that an electricity generator wants to avoid  but when it happens be prepared to fix it roll with it when draxs stators were manufactured in the 1980s completing their construction relied on manual handling techniques modern day facilities however rotate the core to minimise human contact it took just six months for a partnership involving drax siemens and enser to manufacture what could be the largest stator rollers in the world and within that time ship them from the us to north yorkshire with the rollers installed the next step was to move in the core two of the turbine halls cranes each capable of lifting 150 tonnes were combined to lift it hoisting the core onto the mechanical roller within the rewind facility once in place the roller rotates the core allowing for the copper conductor bars to be safely removed and inserted despite this mechanical help the removing and replacing of each one is still at its heart a human job we still need 10 men to physically move the conductor bars with lifting aids which makes it not an easy process says walker using this method the bars weighing 200kg each can be safely and precisely fitted into the core opting for inhouse rewinding a stator is a complex process however when the time logistics and costs of shipping the core to siemens  the germanbased manufacturers  was factored in the decision to do the work at drax power station was an easy one  a 300tonne core is not easy to transport and the highways agency do not like things like that on the roads theyd want us to use waterways says drax lead engineer mark rowbottom logistically it just wasnt worth it its too much money to move and ship that weight to germany so we looked at what we could do onsite more than just an economical and logistical decision and with the uks diminishing manufacturing facilities drax is now equipped to support generator rewinds for many years to come building and operating the rewind facility was a project that leveraged the engineering abilities of drax employees they are increasingly doing engineering traditionally outsourced to equipment manufacturers the experience we have gained and the close working relationship we have established with siemens enables us to support the generator for the remaining life of the station says rowbottom to see the core in that many pieces and stripped down to this level is very rare says walker who began working at the plant as an apprentice  of the 84 conductor bars half have been fitted and the team is scheduled to complete the stator rewind in early 2018 i never thought id do anything like this but am proud to say that ive done it tags drax power station  engineering  investors  technology what will happen to the carbon price after 2020 21 november 2017 power generation great britains electricity is cleaner than ever as wind solar biomass and hydro continue to make up more and more of our energy mix the power system edges ever closer to being entirely decarbonised the gb power system has leapt up the big economies low carbon league table from 20th in 2012 to seventh in 2016 but this shift to lowercarbon power isnt owed only to growing renewable electricity capacity a fall in gas prices has helped and importantly government policy has ensured coal power generation has become increasingly uneconomical vs electricity produced with gas gas and coal compete for contracts to supply power to the national grid introduced in 2013 great britains carbon price floor sets the minimum price on carbon emissions  a stricter policy than the eus volatile eu emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on carbon dioxide co 2  emissions the carbon price support as the british policy is also known tops up the eu ets together they have had a significant impact according to aurora energy research the carbon price floor is a major factor in coal generation emissions falling in great britain the carbon price floor cpf is currently capped at 18 per tonne of co 2 and the eu ets sits at around 5 tco 2  meaning power generators and heavy industry pay around 23 tco 2 altogether when initially formulated by the coalition government in 2010 it was intended the cpf would reach 30 per tonne by 2020 and 70 per tonne by 2030 however the eu ets has since fallen therefore the uk government chose to cap the carbon price support at 18 per tonne until 2020 now as we reach the end of the decade questions remain as to what will happen to this crucial mechanism post2020 will the government price coal off the system once and for all or will the fossil fuel make an unlikely comeback  four visions of carbon pricings future in its research aurora has identified four potential future scenarios for the uks carbon pricing strategy status quo if the uk chooses to continue supporting the phaseout of coal and promotes lowcarbon investment the carbon price floor will steadily increase post2020 reaching an estimated 52 per tonne by 2040 in this scenario the uks carbon pricing structure remains about 18 per tonne higher than the eu ets which is currently around 5 per tonne catchup in the postbrexit landscape whatever it may look like the uk may choose to seek parity with the eu over decarbonisation in this scenario the total uk carbon price remains flat with eu ets which rises until convergence in this scenario the uk and eus price per tonne of carbon reaches 35 by 2040 low priced carbon in the event that the uk government removes the carbon price from 2021 and the eu ets never recovers beyond its 2017 level the shortterm effects could be a drop in the price of coal power and cheaper energy bills co 2 emissions increase in the uk as demand for power rises in the late 2020s and beyond as recently witnessed in the netherlands where coal generation has increased  in part due to a low eu ets the expected price per tonne of carbon could be as low as 6 by 2040 and investment in lower carbon and renewable forms of power generation stalls high priced carbon in order to meet the uks fourth and fifth carbon budgets set by the committee on climate change this scenario sees the electricity system decarbonise more quickly with coal removed as an energy source the carbon price rises dramatically over the next two decades to hit 153 per tonne by 2040 stopping the coal comeback of these four scenarios the steadily increasing prices of the status quo scenario could see the uk meet its power sector target within the fourth carbon budget of 100 g co 2 eqkwh  achieving a 51 reduction from 1990 emission levels by 2030  but aurora found that keeping things as they are could see a radical swing the other way some years earlier in its scenario coal could make a comeback in the early 2020s in july this year coal accounted for just 2 of electricity generation in great britain and in 2016 as a whole it accounted for 9  producing the lowest amount of electricity since the start of world war ii without solid growth of the carbon price floor it could become a much more competitive fuel this potential is further increased by a predicted rise in natural gas prices post2020 when the current surplus of liquefied natural gas lng is set to end if the government chooses not to set tough prices on carbon emissions aurora predicts that on average coal will account for 9 of electricity generation between 2021 and 2025  a change in the declining coal power trend seen in recent years a low carbon price future would see coal grow to almost 12 of the total electricity generation mix during the same period by contrast in the high carbon price scenario coal is almost completely driven out of the energy system accounting for an estimated 2 of electricity generation between 2021 and 2025 signalling to the future what is crucial for british power generators at this stage is clarity beyond 2020 when the 18 per tonne cap ends this can allow the industry to react to future carbon pricing and prepare for whatever future scenario the government is most likely to adopt if the government chooses to continue decarbonising the energy system in a significant way  as it should do  coal facilities can be converted to renewable or lowercarbon units such as biomass or gas  new interconnectors renewable sources storage facilities and demandside response will also need to be installed at a greater capacity to meet the energy systems demands as the amount of low carbon generation continues to grow it will increasingly be the marginal generator this means that power stations such as draxs biomass units which run with an 87 lower carbon footprint compared to coal across their entire supply chain  could be used to meet the last megawatt hour mwh of demand  and this would see the carbon price having a diminishing impact on the wholesale price of power as has already been shown the carbon price floor is one of the most effective ways to reduce great britains electricity emissions  but to continue this impressive progress the government needs to use it appropriately to set a path towards a decarbonised future in october drax joined british energy company sse climate ngo sandbag and others to write to chancellor philip hammond calling on him to back the carbon price floor beyond 2020 and in doing so provide certainty for businesses investing in lower carbon and renewable capacity read the letter here  tags carbon pricing  coal  energy policy  investors what happened to great britains electricity over summer 2017 15 november 2017 power generation what a difference four years can make back in 2012 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity production was almost 600g per kwh kilowatt hour jump forward to 2016 and this has halved to make britain one of the least carbonintense power systems in the world this good news comes from electric insights  a quarterly research paper on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by imperial college london academics the latest reports key finding is just how much britains energy system has decarbonised compared to other nations here is what the data from q3 2017 tell us about great britains energy system today and how it will continue to change into the future climbing the low carbon league tables comparing the electricity mix and carbon intensity of nations producing more than 100 twh terawatt hours a year the report has established a league table that tracks the progress or regress of countries efforts it shows britains energy system has decarbonised at a greater pace than any other nation in 2012 britain was ranked 20 th  sitting midtable alongside italy and saudi arabia but in the four years following britain rocketed up to become the seventh leastcarbon intense energy system in the world in 2016 the 47 drop in carbon intensity is the biggest change of any of the countries analysed and puts britain just behind norway and sweden which have the resources to support substantial hydropower generation as well as nucleardependent france the most any other country moved was eight places  in the opposite direction to britain this was the netherlands where new coal power stations were built at a time when use of coal across england scotland and wales combined reduced by around 80 the additional coal capacity and power generated from that fuel in the netherlands led to a dramatic increase in carbon emissions a major force in helping drive britains rapid move away from coal is the carbon price floor  this currently sits at 18 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  emitted on top of just 5 per tonne in the rest of europe read the full analysis at the low carbon electricity league table and view full chart here  importing problems imports are making up an increasing amount of the uks electricity mix and in july and august they reached an alltime high of 9 the majority 60 of these imports in q3 2017 came from france while 30 was from the netherlands and 10 from ireland however while importing electricity from overseas has become crucial in helping meeting demand and maintaining a flexible grid questions remain around the practices carbon intensity france generates much of its electricity from lowcarbon nuclear sources however irish and dutch exports rely heavily on fossil fuels as a result the electricity britain imported had a 30 higher carbon intensity than that generated domestically  314 vs 245 gkwh over the last 12 months over the next five years 7 gw gigawatts of new interconnectors are planned for construction including with france norway and denmark which could increase electricity imports to provide as much as 1024 of the countrys electricity as these continue to play a bigger role in our electricity mix it is important we ensure it comes from lowercarbon sources where possible and supports the continuing decarbonisation of electricity rather than exporting emissions read two articles on the topic of interconnectors in electric insights importing electricity exporting emissions the future of britains interconnectors coal firmly relegated to the bench the nosedive of coal generation in britain since 2012 highlights just how outoffavour the carbonintensive fossil fuel has become in the energy system now it occupies a role solely as a backup to lowcarbon and renewable sources over the summer months coal generation stayed at a historic low of 19 of total electricity generation between april and august britains 14 gw of installed coal stations only produced 06 gw in an average hour this follows a year of milestones in the decline of coal most notably in april when britain saw its first day without burning any coal since 1882  but this is not to say it has disappeared completely as temperatures dropped in late summer coal was called upon to meet sudden demand on september 19 th 40 of the coal fleet was called upon to produce 57 gw on average across that day showing that even as coal capacity plummets  dropping from 28 gw in 2012 to 14 gw in 2016  it still plays a necessary role in helping meet peaks in demand whats clear however is that this role is only growing smaller and smaller as our

them 10 november 2017 power generation drax power station produces 17 of the uks renewable electricity but it has a long history as a coalfired generator  and while today around 70 of draxs output is from renewable biomass  there are still instances when coal is used  for example at times of high demand such as in the winter months  beyond just meeting demand for power maintaining some operational coal capacity until it can be replaced with more biomass or gas  also allows drax to offer flexibility and grid stability through ancillary services such as inertia  reactive power and frequency management  ensuring these remaining coal units run as efficiently as possible is key to drax being able to economically provide support services to the grid and for this alongside more conventional coals it uses something termed as advantaged fuels what are advantaged fuels advantaged fuels are coals outside of draxs conventional specification that are slightly more affordable than standard coals blending advantaged fuels with standard coal before burning allows generators to remain economical while meeting demand at drax these include offspecification coal and mine remnants such as pond fines which are produced from former deep mine sites  these are offered at lower prices than standard fuels because they often have a lower calorific value meaning they produce less energy when burned or are difficult to work with and transport the benefit however is that power stations are able to ramp up generation as well as provide essential system services while remaining economical getting the balance right each time an advantaged fuel is used the right blend must be found depending on how much and what type is being utilised to ensure maximum efficiency and reliability this requires coordination across drax between the fuel procurement team aiming to source these lowerpriced fuels the materials handling and power generation teams who must quickly understand and resolve any issues surrounding fuel blends and the trading team responsible for selling into the power market the cost savings achieved from using advantaged fuels combined with the highly efficient units drax group operates helps keep costs down and that means lower electricity costs for everyone but this doesnt mean these fuels will be used for the long term drax is continuing to decarbonise its power generation business at drax power station where three of its six power units have been upgraded to low carbon biomass trials were underway in the spring and summer of 2017 to test a lower cost way of converting one of the three remaining coal units to run on compressed wood pellets  the selby north yorkshire site is currently consulting with its local community on plans to repower one or two coal units to run on another flexible fuel  natural gas if constructed the gas power plant could be joined by a large battery storage facility  one which could provide immediate power and system services to the countrys electricity system while the gas turbines power up in the minutes that follow coals days in the uk are numbered  and this is certainly a good thing  but while it remains a necessary part of meeting winter demand and balancing the system advantaged fuels will be key to keeping it an affordable one too tags coal  energy policy  investors appointment of interim chief financial

stabilise the national grid  drax power stations impact to our electricity network is far reaching but it doesnt stop at generating and supplying power a new report by oxford economics  commissioned by drax has found that in addition to its important role powering britain drax group also provides an economic boost to areas across the country here are three ways drax group contributed to the uk economy in 2016 167 billion added to uk gdp drax group contributed an estimated 167 billion to uk gross domestic product gdp in 2016 an increase from 124 billion in 2015  of that figure 301 million was added directly  as a result of the groups own activities such as the generating and selling of power and while this is an impressive 61 increase on 2015 the numbers are even more significant when looking at the benefit beyond the groups core activities in 2016 drax groups spending with external suppliers such as rail freight wagon manufacturer wh davis and imserv  which supplies automated meter reading technology to opus energy reached 872 million a further 36m was spent by these suppliers across their own supply chain to help them provide their services to drax there is an even greater impact when considering how this money filters through employees and suppliers into local retail leisure and service economies something which is especially important when the number of jobs drax supports is taken into account 18500 jobs supported across the country drax group directly employed more than 2000 people in 2016 but across the country it supports far more  18500 a significant increase from the 14150 of 2015 these jobs are primarily in highskilled manufacturing engineering construction it professional business services and transport while 3650 of these were in drax power stations native yorkshire and humber area this year saw the groups overall impact extend much further an i mpact beyond the northern powerhouse roughly a quarter 419 million of draxs total contribution to uk gdp was generated in the yorkshire and the humber region when the north west and north east were included the company impacted the northern economy to the tune of 577m and supported over 6000 jobs yorkshire and the humber was closely followed by the east of england  the home of haven power  which saw the second highest impact  registering more than 200 million contributed in gva  and london and the east midlands  this is thanks in part to the growing activities of drax group companies both haven power and opus energy which became a part of drax group in february 2017 are helping the uk move towards a low carbon future by supplying an increasing amount of british companies with renewable power  with offices in ipswich oxford northampton and cardiff haven power and opus energy highlight how drax group businesses are direct drivers for local gdp and employment opus energy supported 1600 jobs and 130 million in gva in wales  while haven power contributed 232 million to the east of england these numbers are noteworthy but what makes them all the more significant is how this translates into tax revenue operations at drax group generated an estimated 327 million for

plans to ban the sale of petrol and dieselpowered cars  while the falling prices of batteries will serve to make the vehicles more affordable to consumers and more profitable for manufacturers a recent report by bloomberg increased its earlier 2016 forecast for electric vehicle ev adoption it now estimates that by 2040 54 of new car sales and 33 of the global car fleet will be electric  this vision of the future points to considerably better air quality in urban and roadside environments across the world but while evs emit none of the tailpipe fumes of traditional fossil fuelpowered cars there is still potential for associated emissions depending on how that electricity is generated for example if the growing demand caused by evs is met with fossil fuels then welltowheel emissions are still in play however as electricity grids decarbonise and become smarter and more efficient evs will become cleaner researchers at imperial college london have shown that in the uk yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to cleaner electricity generation  what this greater reliance on electricity for transport will certainly do however is massively drive up global power demand investment will be needed not only in electricity generation but also in smart technology that can allow the charging and eventually usage of evs to be managed efficiently the growing demand of evs the bloomberg report states global electricity consumption from evs is expected to grow from just 6 twh in 2016 to 1800 twh by 2040 while the figure represents a massive increase in the electricity required to power evs 1800 twh represents just 5 of the projected global power consumption in 2040 by comparison the uk as a whole consumed just 304 twh of electricity in 2016 this clearly highlights the widespread need for global investment in electricity generation on the whole beyond just what will be required to power evs however the unique challenge evs pose is less how they recharge but when they will recharge smoothing spikes assuming supporting infrastructure and technology progress to enable widespread onstreet and home charging then the demand for electricity to charge evs will mostly likely come in the evening this could result in additional pressure being placed on energy generators and national grids due to mass ev charging utilities and regulators will need to implement policies to encourage offpeak charging for example overnight and spread out the demand from evs one way these spikes will be managed is through timeofuse rates to encourage drivers to charge their vehicles at offpeak times to avoid higher electricity bills however technological improvements will also help to manage the demand evs place on energy systems  tech solutions smart charging tech is one of the most important aspects of this in allowing cities utilities and consumers to automate vehicle charging at times when overall demand is lower storage technology will also play a key role in managing increasing demand on both consumer and operator ends adoption of home power storage systems is expected to grow as fast as solar photovoltaic energy has in recent years  which will enable consumers with home solar arrays to store energy and charge vehicles at times to avoid peakhour charges on the supplier end advancement in storage technology will allow generators to deliver electricity above their usual capacity and meet spikes in demand autonomous vehicles while the report suggests autonomous vehicles will not have a significant impact over the next decade the longerterm influence of selfdriving vehicles will have direct consequences on demand autonomous cars will be able to drive in a way that is significantly more efficient than humans by driving closer together and interacting with the surrounding city to prevent congestion with widespread adoption this greater efficiency would mean cars would use less energy and require less time to recharge however ownership of these types of vehicles will likely be shared particularity in urban environments resulting in fewer overall cars on the roads and ultimately plateauing or even declining demand from evs in the 2040s and beyond globally investment is needed to meet and support the growth of evs over the next two decades governments and businesses must begin to roll out charging infrastructure and clean energy solutions to meet future demand as well as the smart city technology that will enable the mass adoption and eventual automation of evs tags electric vehicles
