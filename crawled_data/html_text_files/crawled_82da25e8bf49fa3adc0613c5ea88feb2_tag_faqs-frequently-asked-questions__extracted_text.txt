faqs frequently asked questions what is the carbon cycle 25 march 2022 carbon capture what is the carbon cycle all living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are vital carbon sinks absorbing around 76 million tonnes of co 2 every year go deeper can carbon

questions  biomass  carbon capture what is direct air carbon capture and storage dacs 9 july 2021 carbon capture what is direct air carbon capture and storage dacs direct air carbon capture and storage dacs sometimes referred to as dac or daccs is one of the few technologies that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere unlike other carbon removal technologies that capture co 2 emissions during the process of generating electricity or heat dacs can be deployed anywhere in the world it can tap into a supply of electricity co 2 removal is crucial to meeting the international climate goals set by the 2015 paris agreement but its not enough just to cut co 2 emissions to achieve net zero  it will also be necessary to remove the co 2 that two centuries of industrialisation have released into the environment as a technology that removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases  assuming it is powered by green electricity  dacs has the potential to play a key role in this process how does dacs work dacs could be described as a form of industrial photosynthesis just as plants use photosynthesis to convert sunlight and co 2 into sugar dacs systems use electricity to remove co 2 from the atmosphere using fans and filters air is drawn into the dacs system using an industrial scale fan liquid dacs systems pass the air through a chemical solution which removes the co 2 and returns the rest of the air back into the atmosphere solid dacs systems captures co 2 on the surface of a filter covered in a chemical agent where it then forms a compound the new compound is heated releasing the co 2 to be captured and separating it from the chemical agent which can then be recycled the captured co 2 can then be compressed under very high pressure and pumped via pipelines into deep geological formations  this permanent storage process is known as sequestration alternatively the co 2 can be pumped under low pressure for immediate use in commercial processes such as carbonating drinks or cement manufacturing a 2021 study by the coalition for negative emissions shows that dacs could provide at least 1gt of sustainable negative emissions by 2025 dacs fast facts human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of co 2 by 48 above preindustrial levels found in 1850 during prehistoric ice ages co 2 levels were around 200 parts per million ppm the average level in 2020 was more than 417ppm 101 out of 116 of the ipcc scenarios mitigating greenhouse gas emissions depend on using negative emissions technology  including dacs what role can dacs play in decarbonisation co 2 is in the air at the same concentration everywhere in the world this means that dacs plants can be located anywhere unlike carbon capture systems that remove co 2 from industrial processes at source there are 15 dacs plants currently in operation worldwide  climeworks operates three in switzerland iceland and italy together these smallscale plants capture approximately 9000 tonnes of co 2 per annum the first largescale plant  currently being developed in the permian basin texas is expected to capture 1000000 tonnes one megatonne per annum when it becomes operational in 2025 at just 004 the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere is very dilute which makes removing and storing it a challenge this means that dacs costs significantly more than some other co 2 capture technologies  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne the process also requires large amounts of energy which adds to the demand for electricity however dacs has the potential to become an important piece in the jigsaw of co 2 removal technologies and techniques that includes naturebased solutions such as planting forests along with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  soil

storage beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is the process of capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide co 2  from biomass organic matter energy generation why is beccs important for decarbonisation sustainably sourced biomassgenerated energy bioenergy can be carbon neutral as plants absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow this in turn offsets co 2 emissions released when the biomass is combusted as fuel when sustainable bioenergy is paired with carbon capture and storage it becomes a source of negative emissions as co 2 is permanently removed from the carbon cycle experts believe that negative emissions technologies nets are crucial to helping countries meet the longterm goals set out in the paris climate agreement as beccs is the most scalable of these technologies this decade it has a key role to play in combating climate change how is the bioenergy for beccs generated most bioenergy is produced by combusting biomass as a fuel in boilers or furnaces to produce highpressure steam that drives electricitygenerating turbines  alternatively bioenergy generation can use a wide range of organic materials including crops specifically planted and grown for the purpose as well as residues from agriculture forestry and wood products industries energydense forms of biomass such as compressed wood pellets  enable bioenergy to be generated on a much larger scale fuels like wood pellets can also be used as a substitute for coal in existing power stations  how is the carbon captured beccs uses a postcombustion carbon capture process  where solvents isolate co 2 from the flue gases produced when the biomass is combusted the captured co 2 is pressurised and turned into a liquidlike substance so it can then be transported by pipeline  how is the carbon stored captured co 2 can be safely and permanently injected into naturally occurring porous rock formations for example unused natural gas reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers water permeable rocks saturated with salt water this process is known as sequestration  over time the sequestered co 2 may react with the minerals locking it chemically into the surrounding rock through a process called mineral storage beccs fast facts two 600 megawatt mw biomass units upgraded with carbon capture technology could deliver 40 of the negative emissions the climate change committee indicates will be needed from beccs for the uk to reach netzero by 2050 beccs has the potential to remove 2070 million tonnes of co 2 per year in the uk by 2050 all national

the british geological survey is beccs sustainable bioenergy can be generated from a range of biomass sources ranging from agricultural byproducts to forestry residues to organic municipal waste during their lifetime plants absorb co 2 from the atmosphere this balances out the co 2 that is released when the biomass is combusted whats crucial is that the biomass is sustainably sourced  be it from agriculture or forest waste responsibly managed sources of biomass are those which naturally regenerate or are replanted and regrown where theres a increase of carbon stored in the land and where the natural environment is protected from harm biomass wood pellets used as bioenergy in the uk for example are only sustainable when the forests they are sourced from continue to grow sourcing decisions must be based on science and not adversely affect the longterm potential of forests to store and sequester carbon biomass pellets can also create a sustainable market for forestry products which serves to encourage reforestation and afforestation  leading to even more co 2 being absorbed from the atmosphere go deeper the triple benefits for the environment and economy of deploying beccs

forest residues and sawdust into energydense pellets biomass can be used for heating or renewable bioenergy generation at a much greater scale why are pellets powerful the advantage of using biomass in the form of a pellet is its energy density this refers to the amount of energy that can be stored in a given amount of a material on their own the wood and residues like wood chips and sawdust that make up biomass do not have a high energy density a kilogram of wood for example stores little energy compared to fuels like coal diesel or uranium however by compressing forest industry residues into a pellet biomass becomes significantly more energy dense wood pellets can also have very low moisture content giving them a high combustion efficiency  an important feature in power generation how are biomass pellets made biomass pellets are made at a pelletisation plant  here wood that is unsuitable for other industries like sawmill residues are brought together the wood is chipped screened for quality heated to reduce its moisture content to below 12 and then converted into a fine powder this is then pressed through a grate at high pressure to form the solid short dense biomass pellet how are pellets used in power generation biomass pellets can be used to generate power in a similar way to coal allowing existing coal power stations to be transformed to use renewable bioenergy instead a conveyor system takes pellets from storage through to pulverising mills  where they are crushed into a fine powder that is then blown into the power stations boiler here the biomass is combusted as fuel the heat from this combustion is used to make steam which powers the generators that produce electricity biomass pellets density and uniform shape also makes them easier to transport and store in large quantities however it is essential that they are kept dry while in transit and that when stored in biomass domes the atmospheric conditions are carefully monitored and controlled to prevent unwanted combustion biomass pellet facts biomass pellets produce 80 less co 2 emissions when combusted than coal  as well as lower levels of sulphur chlorine nitrogen wood pellets have an energy density of 11 gigajoulesm 3  compared to 3 gigajoulesm 3 from fresh wood or wood chips according to the international renewable energy agency irena global wood pellet consumption for heating as well as power reached 35 million tonnes in 2018  excluding china when used in highefficiency wood pellet stoves and boilers biomass pellets can offer combustion efficiency as high as 85  are biomass pellets renewable when forests are sustainably managed and trees naturally regenerated or replanted and regrown in a human timeframe it makes the biomass pellets sourced from them renewable its vital for the longterm energy generation that biomass pellets are sourced from responsibly managed forests and other industries that protect the environment and do not contribute to deforestation sourcing decisions must be sciencebased and not adversely affect the longterm potential of forests to store and sequester carbon sustainable wood pellets are considered to be carbon neutral at the point of combustion as they grow forests absorb carbon from the atmosphere when a biomass pellet is combusted the same amount of atmospheric co 2 is released the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains neutral unlike with fossil fuels which release ancient carbon that has long fallen out of the natural carbon cycle because sustainable bioenergy is low carbon when its lifecycle emissions including supply chain co 2  are factored in it is possible to turn it into a source of negative emissions with the addition of carbon capture technology go deeper how as an oil crisis led an aviation engineer to develop biomass pellets the ports trains and domes that gets biomass where it needs to be  how a process known as torrefaction could supercharge biomass pellets ensuring biomass demand

electricity trading is the process of power generators selling the electricity they generate to power suppliers who can then sell this electricity on to consumers the system operator  national grid eso in great britain  oversees the flow of electricity around the country and ensures the amounts traded will ultimately meet demand and do not overwhelm the power system who is involved in electricity trading there are three main parties in a power market generators  thermal power plants and energy storage sites  sources such as wind turbines and solar panels producing electricity consumers hospitals transport homes and factories using electricity and suppliers in the middle from whom you purchase electricity electricity is generated at power stations then bought by suppliers who then sell it on to meet the needs of the consumers electricity trading refers to the transaction between power generators who produce electricity and power suppliers who sell it on to consumers how are electricity contracts made electricity trading occurs in both long and shortterm time frames ranging from years in advance to deals covering the same day generation and supply must meet exact demand for every minute of the day which means that traders must always be ready to buy or sell power to fill any sudden gaps that arise when trading electricity far in advance factors such as exchange rates the cost and availability of fuel changing regulations and policies all affect the price shortterm price is more volatile and factors such as weather news events and even whats on television having the biggest impact on price traders analyse live generation data and news reports  to predict ahead of time how much electricity will be needed during periods of high demand and then determine a price traders then make offers and bids to suppliers and strike a deal  these deals then dictate how and when a power stations generators are run every day why is electricity trading important running a power station is an expensive process and demand for electricity never stops the electricity market ensures the countrys power demands are met while also aiming to keep electricity businesses sustainable through balancing the price of buying raw materials with the price at which electricity is sold to ensure the grid remains balanced and meets demand the systems operator also makes deals with generators for ancillary services  either far in advance or lastminute this ensures elements such as frequency voltage and reserve power are kept stable across the country and that the grid remains safe and efficient electricity trading ensures there is always a supply of power and that the market for electricity operates in a stable way electricity trading fast facts the history of modern electricity trading can be traced back to chile in 1980  when the country privatised its power industry this led to traders jostling to supply consumers with energy the uk was the first european nation to take up this model in 1990 electricity prices in the uk have actually occasionally gone negative  this happens when demand is low but weather conditions such as high winds or prolonged sunshine lead to an abundance of power ie through wind and solar generation this can lead to consumers being paid to use electricity  up to 4p per unit used  or to generators being paid to turn their output down or even switch off go deeper how the market decides where great britain gets its electricity from how to calculate gas and electricity prices the night shift how a power station

frequently asked questions what is renewable energy 17 december 2020 sustainable bioenergy these differ to nonrenewable energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric insights the cost of electricity from solar panels dropped by 82 between 2010 and 2019 while the cost of onshore wind fell 40 and offshore

and two oxygen atoms  as a greenhouse gas ghg it traps heat making sure the planet isnt uninhabitably cold however fast rising levels of co 2 and other longlasting ghgs in the atmosphere are currently causing global warming to occur at an alarmingly rapid rate what is the carbon cycle carbon is the basis of all life on earth  it is a key ingredient in almost everything on the planet as the earth has a closed atmosphere there has always been the same amount of carbon on the earth but it is in a constant state of change transitioning from gas to solid to liquid and moving between the atmosphere and the earth this process is called the carbon cycle  and it is key to ensuring the earth is capable of sustaining life co 2 forms one part of this process and makes up the largest available source of carbon on earth how is co 2 made carbon is stored in oceans soil and living things and is released from this storage into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together through a number of processes including the decay of organic matter the combustion of materials such as wood coal and natural gas through the breathing of humans and animals and from events such as volcanic eruptions how does co 2 affect the planet an abundance of co 2 in the earths atmosphere means more heat gets trapped which in turn contributes to a rise in global temperatures and climate change  this acceleration in carbon entering the atmosphere began during the industrial revolution around the 1800s when fossil fuels were mined and burned to create energy which released longstored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  from the beginning of the industrial revolution until today the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per million to 387 parts per million which constitutes a 39 increase  today co 2 levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together when organic materials containing carbon are burned wood coal and natural gas how can countries reduce co 2 in the atmosphere according to the paris climate agreement  nations must work to limit warming of the globe to be well under two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in the first half of 2015 the earth registered a one degree celsius rise in global temperatures above preindustrial levels which means drastic and meaningful action must be taken to decarbonise within the next few years there are many ways to reduce the earths carbon footprint including reforestation and using alternative ways to generate energy that dont rely on fossil fuels for example wind  solar  biomass and hydro can all provide sustainable carbonneutral and low carbon

in the paris agreement there is a need to not only reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases into the air but actively work to remove the excess carbon dioxide co 2  currently in the atmosphere and the co 2 that will continue to be emitted as economies work to decarbonise the process of greenhouse gas removal ggr or co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere is possible through negative emissions  where more co 2 is taken out than is being put into the atmosphere negative emissions can be achieved through a range of naturebased solutions or through manmade technologies designed to remove co 2 at scale what naturebased solutions exist to remove co 2 from the atmosphere one millenniaold way of achieving negative emissions is forests  trees absorb carbon when they grow either converting this to energy and releasing oxygen or storing it over their lifetime this makes forests important tools in limiting and potentially reducing the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere planting new forests and regenerating forests has a positive effect on the health of the world as a result however this can also go beyond forests on land vegetation underwater has the ability to absorb and store co 2  and seagrasses can in fact store up to twice as much carbon as forests on land  an approach to negative emissions called blue carbon did you know bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world  its thick forests absorb three times the amount of co 2 the small country emits what manmade technologies can deliver negative emissions many scientists and experts agree one of the most promising technologies to achieve negative emissions is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this approach uses biomass  sourced from sustainably managed forests  to generate electricity as the forests used to create biomass absorb co 2 while growing the co 2 released when it is used as fuel is already accounted for  making the whole process low carbon by then capturing and storing any co 2 emitted often in safe underground deposits the process of electricity generation becomes carbon negative  as more carbon has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added direct air carbon capture and storage daccs is an alternative technological solution in which co 2 is captured directly from the air and then transported to be stored or used while this could hold huge potential the technology is currently in its infancy and requires substantial investment to make it a more widespread practice the process of removing co 2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions because more co 2 is being taken out of the atmosphere than added into it how much negative emissions are needed according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change  negative emissions technologies could be required to capture 20 billion tonnes of carbon annually to help prevent catastrophic changes in the climate between now and 2050 negative emissions fast facts humans are currently moving carbon from the lithosphere the crust of the earth to the biosphere where we live at 100 times the rate of the natural carbon cycle there is enough sustainable biomass available to the uk to support beccs to remove 51 megatonnes of co 2 every year by 2050 according to the committee on climate change more companies are beginning to invest in negative emissions technologies with apple conserving mangroves  stripe allocating 1 million annually to purchasing sequestered carbon and microsoft declaring it will be carbon negative by 2030 go deeper drax sets worldfirst ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 negative emissions and international climate goals learning from and about mitigation scenarios renewables revolution delivers a decade of decarbonisation the ups and downs of beccs  where do we stand today negative emissions techniques and technologies you need to know about uk could become  net zero by 2050  using negative emissions tags technology  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  faqs frequently asked questions  negative emissions what is biomass sustainable bioenergy what is biomass in ecological terms biomass refers to any type of organic matter when it comes to energy biomass is any organic matter that can be used to generate energy for example wood forest residues or plant materials how is biomass used biomass used and combusted for energy can come in a number of different forms ranging from compressed wood pellets  which are used in power stations that have upgraded from coal  to biogas and biofuels a liquid fuel that can be used to replace fossil fuels in transport the term biomass also refers to any type of organic material used for energy in domestic settings for example wood burned in wood stoves and wood pellets used in domestic biomass boilers  biomass is organic matter like wood forest residues or plant material that is used to generate energy where does biomass come from biomass can be produced from different sources including agricultural or forestry residues dedicated energy crops or waste products such as uneaten food drax power station uses compressed wood pellets sourced from sustainably managed working forests in the us canada europe and brazil and are largely made up of lowgrade wood produced as a byproduct of the production and processing of higher value wood products like lumber and furniture biomass producers and users must meet a range of stringent measures for their biomass to be certified as sustainable and responsibly sourced  is biomass renewable biomass grown through sustainable means is classified as a renewable source of energy because of the process of its growth as biomass comes from organic living matter it grows naturally absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere in the process it means when biomass is combusted as a source of energy  for example for heat or electricity production  the co 2 released is offset by the amount of co 2 it absorbed from the atmosphere while it was growing fast facts in 2019 biomass accounted for 6 of great britains electricity generation more than 16 of the total generation of all renewable sources there is about 550 gigatonnes of biomass carbon on earth in total humans make up around 110000 th of that mass modern biomass was first developed as an alternative for oil after its price spiked as a result of the 1973 yom kippur war the international energy agency iea estimates bioenergy accounts for roughly 110 th of the worlds total energy supply biomass is a renewable sustainable form of energy used around the world how long has biomass been used as a source of energy biomass has been used as a source of energy for as long as humans have been creating fire early humans using wood plants or animal dung to make fire were all creating biomass energy today biomass in the form of wood and wood products remains a widely used energy source for many countries around the world  both for domestic consumption and at grid scale through power stations where its often used to replace fossil fuels with much higher lifecycle carbon emissions drax power station has been using compressed wood pellets a form of biomass since 2003 when it began research and development work cofiring it with coal it fully converted its first full generating unit to run only on compressed wood pellets in 2013 lowering the carbon footprint of the electricity it produced by more than 80 across the renewable fuels lifecycle today the power station runs mostly on sustainable biomass go deeper how working forests ensure biomass and wood products are sustainable  looking at the numbers behind the forests drax sources its biomass from  responsible sourcing biomass is key to ensuring a zerocarbon future international energy agency expects the role of bioenergy to increase biomass energy s journey from the earliest humans to todays electricity the biomass in forests goes beyond just
