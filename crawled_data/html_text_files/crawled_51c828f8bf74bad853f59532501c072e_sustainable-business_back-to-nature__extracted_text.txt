registered office visit procurement visit us tours and events visit skylark centre and nature reserve drax power station visit power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station back to nature there are many reasons to visit the skylark centre and nature reserve this season 28 november 2017 sustainable business take a walk up the banks of barlow mound this weekend and you could encounter sheep roe deer rabbits falcons bats and impressive views of north yorkshire as well as a host of other fauna and flora what you might not realise is the hill youre standing on is entirely manmade and is largely made of ash that this might be a surprise to visitors is testament to the success of barlow mound a project which was conceived in the 1970s as a disposal solution for the leftover power station product of ash that has gone on to provide a thriving natural habitat to be enjoyed by wildlife and local residents alike whilst barlow mound has a fascinating recent history  it is by no means a thing of the past today its a unique environment that is continually managed by a passionate team and offers plenty for visitors to see the mound under construction a mound out of a molehill when drax power station was first opened in 1974 it was the largest coal power station in western europe burning around 250000 tonnes of coal a week burning that much coal resulted in a lot of pulverised fuel ash left over as a byproduct today much of the ash byproduct from burning biomass and coal at drax is sold to the building industry  but before the market for this product emerged building a mound was the thing to do the aberfan disaster happened at around the same time as construction began at drax so there was a lot of persuading people that it was the right thing to do fgd and byproducts section head andrew christian says so its an engineered mound to make sure it wont ever move there was a lot of engineering that went into it and the central electricity generating board which then ran drax were brilliant at engineering as part of the planning permission for building the mound drax proposed to turn the mound into a natural habitat supporting trees and a variety of wildlife today the mound is continually managed by a passionate drax team as well as contracted ecologists and tenant farmers to ensure the nature reserve is an environment that supports all those who call it home all of a sudden ive got a farmer explaining sheep digestion systems to me and thats obviously not my area of expertise christian says for the ecologists its a bit of a dream because not that many people go on there so theres not many landmasses like that that have got wildflower meadows grassland trees wet areas where there arent human inhabitants so things are left to naturally evolve the team of ecologists provide regular advice to drax and that advice leads to installations such as the reptile hibernacula which provides a suitable home for grass snakes  dig a hole fill it full of rocks and logs put the grass on top they love it christian says another reason the ecological advice is important is due to the selfcontained nature of the habitat  a fence around the entire site means species numbers must be closely monitored what you can see at the nature reserve there are four marked walks for visitors to enjoy that wind through the changing landscapes of the nature reserve from fentons pond and its wildlife to the moundtop viewing platform offering panoramic views of yorkshire lincolnshire and humberside drax have recently improved facilities for walkers by installing new signage a bird hide and better identification of the walks the nature reserve is also home to the yorkshire wildlife and swan rescue centre which rehabilitates up to 2000 birds a year another new addition is the new outdoor classroom next to the skylark centre the classroom is now regularly used by outdoor ted  an outdoor learning programme for primary schools in yorkshire designed and delivered by education specialist stacey howard children can enjoy the nature reserve and can take part in activities such as archery shelter building and making campfires photo steve parker photo steve parker and in december 2017 the skylark centre is hosting two special christmas wonderland events for the public this years events will see the centre transformed into an elves workshop featuring christmas traditions from around the world face painting christmas quizzes arts  crafts and marshmellow roasting around the outdoor fire pit you can see more information on the christmas wonderland events here  everyone is welcome and entry is free with charitable donations welcomed a view to the future its part of the original planning condition of barlow mound to maintain the habitat and natural resource but the maintenance of the nature reserve is also about social responsibility as christian says if you live in barlow village when you come in and walk around it its a fantastic place and its free the skylark centre and nature reserve are temporarily closed the closure is to reduce the risk to businesscritical areas of our operation we are planning to reopen in 2021
