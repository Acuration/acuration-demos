approximately twothirds of that land is working timberland producing wood used for construction and furniture in short us forestry is a massive industry enviva is the worlds largest wood pellet producer and biggest biomass supplier to drax power station  but in the context of the us forestry industry in which it operates enviva does things differently were leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices says jennifer jenkins vice president and chief sustainability officer at enviva weve created unique tracking systems and we conduct sciencebased sourcing both of which encourage sound forest stewardship specifically enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesnt protecting bottomland forests a bottomland forest is an area of lowlying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species these forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important however theyre also a part of southeastern americas working forest landscape in fact enviva sources 34 of its wood from these areas  but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest for example in some cases harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive more than that harvesting can also help keep forests as forests in the areas where we work one of the biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use  specifically to developed or agricultural land explains dr jenkins our goal is to keep forests as forests we want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use if landowners can gain a steady income from regular harvests theyre likely to keep their land as working forests however this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe any land that doesnt meet envivas set of strict criteria means enviva wont source from it  it can simply walk away the landowners on the other hand dont have that luxury isnt it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest asks dr jenkins maybe they recognize its value maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead in recognition of our responsibility we made a commitment a fund that keeps forests as forests envivas commitment was to partner with the us endowment for forestry  communities to set up the enviva forest conservation fund  a 5 million 10year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the virginianorth carolina coastal plain it works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects more recently in june 2017  the enviva forest conservation fund announced a total of 500000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as ducks unlimited  an organization which  with the grant  plans to acquire more than 6000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public wildlife management area the fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes including a strict supplier assessment process and the companys track  trace tool  a oneofakind publiclyaccessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced it is entirely transparent and is a testament to envivas commitment to sustainability and doing things differently as dr jenkins explains this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004 as a company that makes wood pellets envivas reason for being is to help lower greenhouse gas emissions an emphasis on sustainability has always been a part of envivas dna tags forests  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets longleaf pine how wood product markets help to conserve a protected species 22 september 2017 sustainable bioenergy longleaf pine forests were once a dominant ecosystem across the southern us gulf and atlantic states spanning from the east coast in virginia as far west as texas however centuries of overuse and conversion to agriculture and to faster growing pine species mean today less than 5 of the estimated 90 million acres remain restoration of the longleaf pine savanna is now underway and the careful management of both public and private forests is key to preserving this ecosystem wood product and biomass markets play an important role in this ensuring there is an economic incentive for landowners to plant highvalue longleaf pines and manage them in a way that promotes conservation an ecosystem shaped by fire the ancient abundance of longleaf pines across the southern us owes to their highly pyrophytic nature meaning they are resistant to fire this allowed the trees to survive both the naturally occurring forest fires from summer thunderstorms and those started as land management by native americans these regular fires help give the longleaf savanna its distinctive features with a limited canopy providing ample sunlight and allowing grasses and herbs to grow in the nitrogenrich soil as colonial settlements expanded across north america the long straight timber offered by the pines as well as the resin and turpentine made these forests a valuable resource longleaf pine ecosystems reached a depleted state the restoration push today americas longleaf restoration initiative alri is taking strides to restore the species the collaborative effort between public and private sector partners has set a 15year goal of increasing longleaf acreage from 34 million to 80 million acres by 2025 these ecosystems are currently home to an estimated 900 endemic plants and 29 federally listed species including the redcockaded woodpecker gopher tortoise and indigo snake restoring the environment in which the flora and fauna can flourish is not as simple as planting large numbers of longleaf pine trees conservation efforts must focus on not only the planting of the pine but also the restoration development and maintenance of the pine savanna ecosystem says kyla cheynet a forest ecologist at drax biomass this system requires predictable disturbance to maintain the open canopy and rich herbaceous vegetation the role of the wood product market these disturbances include prescribed fires and the careful harvesting of trees to ensure the landscape maintains its open canopy that allows plenty of sunlight to reach the grasses and other vegetation along the forest floor the alris 2016 report highlighted the importance of thinning and prescribed fires in conserving longleaf savanna it found that while new planting of longleaf pines declined slightly 8 from 2015 the wildlife quality plant diversity and overall health of forests improved by removing competing tree species and allowing more sunlight to enter the forest harvesting or thinning longleaf pine forests provides a small percentage of the fibre used to manufacture compressed wood pellets used at drax power station but these markets help to incentivise responsible forest management and offer a source of profit for landowners these revenuegenerating practices are crucial to ensuring the continued survival of longleaf pine forests by preventing them from being converted to agricultural land or lost to development  tags forests  sustainability 15 words foresters use 16 august 2017 sustainable bioenergy in japanese theres a single word to describe sunlight filtering through the leaves of a tree komorebi its a poetic term to describe an image almost everyone recognises however english has no direct translation but while english lacks a komorebi equivalent it does contain a significant number of words that speak to the very specific features of the forestry industry  terms that describe the crooked nature of a tree open to the elements on a mountain side or words for the process of stripping a grown tree of its limbs here we look at the unusual the uncommon and the whimsical words that make up the language of forestry silviculture seen as both a science and an art silviculture is the practice of controlling the establishment growth composition health and quality of forests this goes beyond just managing working forests for wood products markets however and includes those dedicated to everything from leisure to wildlife comminution one of the first steps in the production of biomass such as wood pellets is reducing down the raw materials like the fresh felled green wood and this relies on a process known as comminution this is carried out by a range of specifically designed machinery such as rotary hammer mills chippers and grinders but can also be done in the forest using mobile chippers to reduce tops and branches krummholz from the german word krumm meaning crooked bent or twisted krummholz is a term for trees that are stunted and sculpted by harsh winds found near the tree line of mountains or on coastlines where there are large quantities of salt in the air exposure to the elements often means these trees are windblown into surreal shapes while branches on one side are often deformed or dead underdog a key component of any sports movie the origins of the word underdog may actually have come from the logging industry in premechanised times logs would be placed over a sawpit and cut up the middle with a long twohandled saw the unfortunate sawyer working at the bottom often knee deep in rainwater under a falling rain of sawdust was known as an underdog however other theories exist which claim the term originates from dog fighting a hypsometer used to measure angles to determine the height of trees hypsometer a hypsometer is a tool used to measure angles when used by foresters it can determine the height of a tree to use it foresters measure the top and bottom of the tree from a measured distance away and use trigonometry to calculate the height hoppus foot the standard measurement of volume used for timber across the british empire the hoppus foot was introduced by english surveyor edward hoppus in 1736 the imperial measurement was developed to estimate how much squared useable timber could be converted from a round log while allowing for wastage a mobile wood chipper in operation in arkansas slash and brash slash and brash are both terms for the woody debris left by logging operations however while slash can be chipped and sold as biomass brash is not normally removed instead it can be spread along routes used by forestry machinery to prevent ground damage in what are known as brash mats leader the very top stem of a tree this typically develops from a trees terminal bud which is the main area of growth in a plant and is found at the end of a limb foresters using horses and rail carts to transport timber in california 1904 hot logging hot logging is the process of loading logs onto lorries and removing them from forests immediately after felling  when theyre still hot from the saw this is in contrast to the more common process of storing or decking logs on site before removing hot logging is often used when whole tree harvesting as the trees are removed from site and processed at the mill to maximise recovery of high value saw timber material snag dead trees might not seem like the most useful plants in a forest but snags prove otherwise snags are standing dead or dying trees and they serve an important role in forest ecosystems often missing their top or most of their smaller branches snags provide habitats for wide varieties of birds mammals and invertebrates as well as supporting decomposers such as fungi in fresh water environments snags also make essential shelter for fish spawning sites beating up towards the end of the growing season trees that have died shortly after planting are counted and replanted in what is known as beating up this process also allows foresters to identify and address any issues that may have affected growth thinning a staple of responsible forestry thinning is the practice of periodically removing a proportion of trees from a forest to reduce competition and provide the healthiest most valuable trees with greater access to water sunlight and nutrients as well as opening up more resources for the remaining trees this process also provides feedstock for the biomass and paper industries rotation in managed forests foresters keep a range of different age trees to ensure a constant flow of healthy and mature wood rotation is the term for the number of years required between new planting typically of seedlings and final harvesting in the us south rotations of plantation pine are commonly about 25 years and 45 years for naturally regenerated pine while in the uk this is closer to 60 for the same species in even more northerly finland rotations are typically between 80 and 90 years snedding coming from the scandinavian word snäddare meaning smooth log snedding is the process of stripping shoots and branches from a branch or felled tree known as limbing in us snedding is carried out with by chainsaws or more heavyduty harvesters and stroke delimbers mensuration how to you measure the total wood of a forest mensuration thats how mensuration is a form of mathematics that allows foresters to measure the volume of standing or felled timber it is an important tool in not only the quantifying of how much product there is to sell but in monitoring and managing the health and growth of a forest tags forests active management of forests increases growth and carbon storage 28 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy a study on the historical trends in the forest industry of the us south  carried out by supply chain consultancy forest2market and commissioned by drax group the national alliance of forest owners and the us endowment for forestry and communities  found that over the last 60 years as demand for forestry products has increased the productivity of the areas forests has increased too in short the more weve come to use them the more forests have grown a forest is not like a mine  there is not a finite amount of wood in the ground that disappears when it is extracted never to return forests are a renewable resource that can be replanted improved and harvested for as long as the land is managed responsibly whats more landowners have a strong financial incentive to not only maintain their holdings but to improve their productivity  after all the more of something you have the more of it you have to sell it is an economic incentive that works six decades of growth the forest2market report found that increased demand for wood is statistically correlated with more annual tree growth more wood volume available in the forest and more timberland for example between 1953 and 2015 tree harvests increased by 57 largely driven by us economic growth and increased construction over the same period annual wood growth increased by 112 and inventory increased by 108 in total annual growth exceeded annual removals by 38 on average annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million cubic metres in 1953 to 408 million cubic metres in 2015 inventory increased from 4 billion to 84 billion cubic metres the forest products industry funded privatepublic research projects to enhance the quality and performance of seedlings and forest management practices to ensure a stable supply of wood because of these efforts landowners saw the value of active management techniques changing their approach to site preparation fertilization weed control and thinning  and the use of improved planting stock healthy demand made it easy for landowners to take a longterm view investing in more expensive management practices up front for greater returns in the future and the results were extraordinary seedlings established in the last 20 years have helped plantations to become nearly four times as productive as they were 50 years ago a changing market markets for wood have changed over the last two decades precipitated by decreased demand for writing paper and newsprint increased demand for absorbent hygiene products and containerboard and increased demand for biomass these changes in demand have not impacted the way that landowners manage timberland however as sawtimber the largest trees in the forest remains the most valuable timber crop it also remains the crop the landowners want to grow  pulpwood is harvested from the forest only when the forest is being thinned to create optimal conditions for growing sawtimber or when sawtimber is harvested and the forest is being cleared for replanting pellet production has expanded rapidly in the us south though its overall footprint is still small in comparison to more traditional forest product industries in some local wood basins however like the one surrounding bastrop louisiana the location of one of draxs us production facilities the use of biomass to create pellets has filled a gap left by the closure of an 80year old paper mill  draxs decision to locate in this area is integral to supporting forest industry jobs and landowners who carefully consider local demand when deciding whether to continue growing trees according to tracy leslie director of forest2market s biomaterials and sustainability practice as history has shown forests in the us south have benefitted from increased demand for all types of wood the rise of the pulp and paper industry did not detract from landowner objectives to maximize production of higher value sawtimber nor did it result in a shift in focus to growing only pulpwood this new demand did however provide landowners with important interim and supplemental sources of income forest2markets research shows that an increase in demand for pellets will have the same effect incentivizing landowners to grow and regrow forests increasing both forest inventory and carbon storage the real threat to forests not only does demand for forest products increase the productivity and carbon storage of forests and provide an incentive for landowners to continue growing trees but it also helps counter factors that irrevocably destroy this natural resource the real threat to forests in the us is not demand for wood but urbanisation nearly half of all us forestland that converted to another use between 1982 and 2012 was cleared for urban development commercial forestry protects forested lands from development between 1989 and 1999 just 1 of managed pine plantations in the us south were cleared for nonforest development compared to 3 of naturallyregenerated forest types urbanisation not the forest products industry places the most pressure on forests in the us south forest2markets findings demonstrate that demand associated with healthy timber markets promotes the productivity of forests and mitigates forest loss by encouraging landowners to continue to grow harvest and regenerate trees read the full report historical

forests  investors  united states  wood pellets the science behind keeping soil healthy 27 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy read here tags biomass energy  forests what is a working forest 1 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy for centuries civilizations have relied on forests and forest products forests provided fuel food and construction materials and there were plenty of them but when in 18 th century europe the needs of growing industrialisation sent development into overdrive a problem arose forests were struggling to meet demand in germany the problem was acute the growing steel industry had increased demand for wood to power its smelters and for wood used in mining operations large areas of forestland were stripped to meet industrys needs and overall supply was quickly decreasing no one was more acutely aware of the challenge than hans carl von carlowitz who at the time was the head of the saxon mining administration so in 1713 he published silvicultura oeconomica a book which advocated the conservation and management of german forests so they could provide for industries in the long term although he drew on existing knowledge from around europe it was the first time an important term was used nachhaltigkeit the german word for sustainability  carlowitz explained this new term conservation and growing of wood is to be undertaken in order to have a continuing stable and sustained use as this is an indispensable cause without which the country in its essence cannot remain it was arguably the start of the scientific approach to forestry and although our needs of forests have changed as have the words we use to describe them  working forest plantation forest and managed forest all refer to largely the same thing that same principle is at the heart of how a modern working forest functions to ensure what exists and is useful today will still be there tomorrow this approach relies on responsible forest management which sets out a few key principles on how a forest should be managed to sustain its life providing room to breathe working forests are commonly managed to produced sawlogs  high value wood that can be sawn to make timber for construction or furniture for a forester to optimise the quality and quantity of sawlogs regular thinning is required thinning is the process of periodically felling a proportion of the forest to aid its overall health and vigour this means there are fewer trees fighting for the same resources water sunshine soil more than that thinning can promote diversity by providing more light and space for other flora thinning can occur several times in a forests cycle it can be used to increase the size and quality of the remaining trees and also to encourage new seedlings to establish in place of the harvested trees when managing for continuous forest cover httpswwwdraxcomuswpcontentuploadssites10201705whatisaworkingforestfinalmp4 nothing should be wasted the roundwood produced by thinning is often too small to be sold as sawlogs but that doesnt mean its worthless it can be sold to the pulp industry to make paper or for particleboard or to the biomass industry to make compressed wood pellets  which can be used to fuel power generation  as is done at drax power station  these industries also provide a market for the lower grade roundwood removed when the more mature trees are finally harvested in areas where there was no robust market for this low grade wood it would often be left on site and become a fire risk or a haven for pest and disease attack too much low grade material left on site can also inhibit the regrowth of the next tree crop so markets for this material are important for the health of the forest and the value of the land to the forest owner also in the baltic countries markets for pulpwood are limited and the energy sector provides a valuable opportunity to clear the site for replanting and provide additional revenue to the forest owner this process of utilising all parts of the forest is essential for a healthy working forest on the one hand the revenue can cover the cost of thinning this husbandry enhances the quality of the final tree crop and ensures that money is available to invest in future planting and regeneration ensuring the forest area is consistently maintained and improved young regeneration in a shelterwood system demonstrating the continuous forest lifecycle the carbon benefits of a working forest rather than diminishing it actively managing a forest helps its ability to sequester  or absorb and store  more carbon  carbon sequestration is directly related to the growth rate of a tree  a young growing tree absorbs more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than an older one  older trees will have more carbon stored after a childhood spent absorbing it but if these are not harvested they are more susceptible to fire damage pests and diseases and their carbon absorption plateaus in an actively managed forest older trees ready for sawlog production can be harvested and replaced with vigorously growing young trees and in the process maximise the co 2 absorption potential of the forest the byproducts of this process  the low grade wood and thinnings  can be used for the pulp and biomass industry which both aids the health of the remaining forest and provides revenue for the forester to invest in the long term life of his or her forest  three centuries of sustainability in the 300 years since carlowitz published his book on sustainability a lot has changed and while its unlikely he foresaw forests providing fuel for renewable electricity and renewable heat  the approach remains as relevant what is a working forest it is one that is as productive and healthy tomorrow as it is today that were using the same resource today as we were 300 years ago is evidence to suggest its a practice that works tags forests  investors  sustainability how space tech helps forests 20 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy can you count the number of trees in the world accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than

energy  forests  investors  sustainability  technology forests are more powerful than you think  heres why 21 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy almost one third of the earths land mass is covered by forests thats an area of around 4 billion hectares or roughly four times the size of the us in addition to being a prominent feature across the global landscape forests also play a significant role in how we live they make the air cleaner in cities and absorb carbon from the atmosphere they provide biodiversity and habits for wildlife they also provide essential forest products such as paper building materials and wood pellets for energy to celebrate the uns international day of forests  were looking at some of the reasons why forests and wood fuel are more powerful than you might think theyre a major source of renewable energy nearly half of the worlds renewable energy comes from forests in the form of wood fuel roughly 24 billion people around the world use it for things like cooking heating and generating electricity in fact about 50 of the total global wood production is currently used for these purposes however it is critical that this resource is managed sustainably and responsibly  one of the key aims of the international day of forests is to encourage people to utilise their local forest resources sustainably to ensure it endures for future generations they can revitalise economies because wood fuel is such a widely used energy source it also supports a healthy vibrant industry roughly 900 million people work in the wood energy sector globally  more than that rural economies built on wood energy can be revitalised by modernisation which can then stimulate local business  investment can help finance better forest management which in turn leads to forest growth improvements in sustainability standards and in some cases increased employment they can help mitigate climate change the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the global annual primary energy consumption which makes it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand in a sustainable and renewable way when wood is used as fuel it releases carbon dioxide co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or sustainable system of growing forests this carbon is offset by new tree plantings the only emissions produced therefore are the ones involved in transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predict that by 2030 forestry mitigation with the help of carbon pricing could contribute to reductions of 02 to 138 gigatonnes gt co 2 a year  tags biomass energy  forests  sustainability the biomass carbon story matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 23 february 2017 sustainable bioenergy there is an important difference between carbon dioxide co 2  emitted from coal and other fossil fuels and co 2 emitted from renewable sources both do emit co 2 when burnt but in climate change terms the impact of that co 2 is very different to understand this difference it helps to think small and scale up it helps to think of your own back garden one tree every year for 30 years imagine you are lucky enough to have a garden with space for 30 trees three decades ago you decided to plant one tree per year every year in this example each tree grows to maturity over thirty years so today you find yourself with a thriving copse with 30 trees at different stages of growth ranging from one year to 30 years old at 30 years of age the oldest has now reached maturity and you cut it down  in the spring of course before the sap rises  and leave the logs to dry over the summer you plant a new seedling in its place through the summer and autumn the 29 established trees and the new seedling you planted continue to grow absorbing carbon from the atmosphere to do so winter comes and when it turns cold and dark you burn the seasoned wood to keep warm burning it will indeed emit carbon to the atmosphere however by end of the winter the other 29 trees plus the sapling you planted will be at exactly the same stage of growth as the previous spring contain the same amount of wood and hence the same amount of carbon as long as you fell and replant one tree every year on a 30year cycle the atmosphere will see no extra co 2 and youll have used the energy captured by their growth to warm your home harvesting only what is grown is the essence of sustainable forest management if you didnt have your seasoned selfsupplied wood to burn you might have been forced to burn coal or use more gas to heat your home over the course of the same winter these fuels would have emitted carbon to the atmosphere which endlessly accumulates  causing climate change not only does your tree husbandry provide you with an endlessly renewable supply of fuel but you also might enjoy other benefits such as the shelter your trees provide and the diversity of wildlife they attract no added carbon this is a simplified example but the principles hold true whether your forest contains 30 trees or 300 million  the important point is that with these renewable carbon emissions provided you take out less wood than is growing and you at least replace the trees you take out you do not add new carbon to the atmosphere that is not true with fossil fuels it is true that you could have chosen not to have trees you could instead build a wind turbine or install solar panels on your land that would be a perfectly reasonable choice but youll still need to use the coal at night when the sun doesnt shine or when the wind isnt blowing worst of all you dont get all the other benefits of a thriving forest  its seasonal beauty and the habitat thats maintained for wildlife of course the wood
