U.S. BECCS by Drax


Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) by Drax will generate millions of tons of high integrity, permanent carbon removals in the U.S. as early as 2025.
Engineered carbon removal technologies are crucial to achieving long-term climate goals, and BECCS is the most scalable and affordable of these technologies that can be deployed rapidly. BECCS by Drax will be the first at-scale 24/7 renewable energy facility with carbon removals in the U.S. and will play a key role in achieving a clean energy grid by 2035 while also providing high integrity carbon removals.

The high integrity carbon removals from BECCS offer a permanent solution, which can complement companies’ actions to decarbonize directly, and enable them to meet their net zero goals.

We’re Future Positive
We recognize that the world is changing – so here at Drax we’re acting now. Our plan is three-fold: people, nature, and climate positive.
We’ve invested $2.5 billion of funding towards enabling these outcomes, with plans to invest an additional $3.7 billion. Underpinning it all we’re using sustainable biomass to deliver people, nature, and climate positive outcomes.
