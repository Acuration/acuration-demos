power station visit drax power station joined at the volts what role will interconnectors play in great britains electricity future importing electricity is only part of the solution to a flexible secure grid 14 june 2018 power generation for more than 50 years great britain has been electrically connected to europe the first undersea interconnector between british shores and the continent was installed in 1961 and could transmit 160 megawatts mw of power today there is 4 gigawatts gw in interconnector capacity between great britain france ireland and the netherlands  and theres more on the way by the mid2020s some estimates suggest interconnector capacity will reach 18 gw thanks to new connections with germany denmark and norway the government expects imports to account for 22 of electricity supply by 2025 up from 6 in 2017  this increased connectivity is often held up as a means of securing electricity supply and while this is largely true it doesnt tell the full story in fact this plan could risk creating a dependency on imported electricity at a time when flexibility and diversity of power sources are key to meeting demand in an increasingly decentralised  decarbonising system great britain needs to be connected and have a close relationship with its european neighbours but this should not come at the expense of its power supply power price or ongoing decarbonisation efforts yet these are all at risk with too great a reliance on interconnection to secure a long term stable power system tomorrow these issues need to be addressed today unfair advantage at their simplest interconnectors are good for the power system they connect the relatively small british isles to a significant network of electricity generators and consumers this is good for both helping secure supply and for broadening the market for domestic power but the system in which interconnectors operate isnt working since 2015 interconnectors have had the right to bid against domestic generators in the governments capacity market auctions the government uses these auctions to award contracts to generators that can provide electricity to the grid through existing or proposed facilities the original intention was also to allow foreign generators to participate as an interim step the transmission equipment used to supply foreign generators power into the gb market  interconnectors  have been allowed to take part in practice interconnectors end up with an economic advantage over other electricity producers firstly interconnectors are not required to pay to use the national transmission system like domestic generators are this charge is paid to national grid to cover the cost of installation and maintenance of the substations pylons poles and cables that make up the transmission network plus the cost of system support services keeping the grid stable  interconnectors are exempt from paying these despite the fact imported electricity must be transported and balanced within england scotland and wales in the same way as domestic electricity secondly interconnectors dont pay carbon tax in the gb energy market the carbon price floor is one of the cornerstones of great britains decarbonisation efforts and has enabled the countrys electricity system to become the seventh least carbonintense of the worlds most power intensive systems in 2016 up from 20 th in 2012 interconnectors themselves do not emit carbon dioxide co 2  in great britain but this does not mean they are emissionfree frances baseload electricity comes largely from its lowcarbon nuclear fleet but the netherlands and ireland are still largely dependent on fossil fuels for power because the european grid is so interconnected even countries which dont yet have a direct link to great britain such as germany with its high carbon lignite power stations also contribute to the european grids supply the neuconnect link is planned to connect germany and gb in the late 2020s not being subject to the uks carbon tax  only to the european unions emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on co 2  imported power can be offered cheaper than domestic lowercarbon power this not only puts great britain at risk of importing higher carbon electricity in some cases but also exporting carbon emissions to our neighbours when their power price is higher to that in the gb market this prevents domestic generators from winning contracts to add capacity or develop new projects that would secure a longerterm stable future for great britain in fact introducing more interconnectivity could in some cases end up leading to supply shortages be they natural or market induced under peak pressure the contracts awarded to interconnectors in the capacity market auctions treat purchased electricity as guaranteed but any power station can break down  any intermittent renewable can stop generating at short notice supply from neighbouring countries is just the same research by aurora found that historically interconnectors have often delivered less power than the system operator assumed they would and on occasion exported power at times of peak demand this happened recently during the beast of the east  when low temperatures across the continent drove electricity demand soaring this europeanwide cold spell meant ireland and france which has a largely electrified heating system experienced huge electricity demand spikes driving power prices up as a result for much of the time between 27 and 28 february great britain exported electricity to france to capitalise on its high prices this not only led to more fossil fuels being burned domestically but it meant less power was available domestically at a time when our own demand was exceptionally high even when the interconnectors do flow in our direction they cannot provide crucial grid services like inertia so our large thermal power stations are often still needed it is difficult to say for certain how interconnectors will function during times of high demand in the future due to a lack of longterm data but that which we do know and have seen suggests they dont always play to the countrys best interests there is still an important role for interconnectors on the great britain grid but to deliver genuine value the system needs to be fairer so they dont skew the market where interconnectors fit into the future interconnectors bring multiple benefits to our power system they can help with security of supply by bringing in more power at times of systems stress with the right system in place they can help reduce the need to rely on domestic fossil fuels and enable more renewable installation and if electricity is being generated cheaper abroad they can also create opportunities to reduce costs for consumers however the correct framework must be put in place for interconnectors to bring such benefits while allowing for domestic projects that can help secure the countrys electricity supply as a start interconnectors should be reclassified  known as derating  to compete with technologies on an equal footing draxs proposed ocgt plants which can very quickly start up and provide the grid with the power and balancing services it needs  before switching off again could offer a more reliable route to grid stability than such overwhelming dependence on interconnectors will in addition the coaltogas and battery plans at drax power station would prove to be a highly flexible national asset new gas and interconnectors should be able to compete fairly with one another policymakers should facilitate a system that allows competing technologies to exist in a cost beneficial way both interconnectors and domestic thermal power generators can play their part in creating stability transitioning towards a decarbonised economy and fitting within the uks industrial strategy in 1961 when the first interconnector was switched on it marked a new age of continental cooperation five decades on we should not forget this goal in an ever more complex grid what we need is different technologies systems and countries working together to achieve a flexible stable and cleaner power system for everyone share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero sustainable bioenergy forests net zero and
