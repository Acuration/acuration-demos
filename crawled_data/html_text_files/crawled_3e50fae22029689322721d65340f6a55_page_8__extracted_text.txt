energy mix than ever before and yet misconceptions about these new or alternative technologies  such as biomass solar and wind  are common some of these concerns are  for the time being  partly justified some completely subjective and some are demonstrably wrong heres a closer look at the most pervasive myths and what truth there is behind them renewables are unpredictable an oftrepeated misconception is that renewables arent a fulltime solution to our power needs its true that solar isnt generated at night and wind turbines dont operate in still weather but the canon of renewables is bigger than its two most wellknown technologies tidal power still depends on environmental factors but tides are much more predictable than wind or sunlight for countries lucky enough to have ready access geothermal power  which uses heat from the earths core to power generators  is even more reliable biomass solutions such as compressed wood pellets are a fuelbased power source meaning they are flexible so can be used to generate electricity on demand and operate as a baseload power option much like coal or gas at drax power station renewable electricity is generated on demand using compressed wood pellets and delivered to the national grid 24hoursaday now thanks to advances in weather forecasting the national grid can plan ahead to balance the system with other renewable and low carbon technologies when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing just a few years ago the primary fall back was relying on coal power stations to pick up any slack it might not be possible to power the world entirely with one renewable source but the right mix of technologies could provide an answer to the question of how to ensure a stable and secure low carbon energy supply renewables are expensive there is some truth in this but its important to note that these costs are falling many of the high costs associated with renewables have been down to a lack of infrastructure investment a number of the components required in construction of structures like wind turbines and solar panels are expensive and as many renewable facilities need to be located in different areas to existing traditional facilities extensive power grid extension is often needed but these are problems that once set up should bring down the costs of renewables such as solar and wind setting up biomasspowered facilities is considerably cheaper compressed wood pellets can be used in upgraded coal power stations so theres no need for expensive new connections to the highvoltage electricity transmission system there are even ways renewables could bring about cheaper power for consumers research commissioned by drax and published by nera economic consulting and imperial college london found that if the same government support offered to some renewable technologies ie wind and solar were open to all such as biomass consumers could see potential savings of 2 billion on their energy bills renewables are ugly while this isnt necessarily an opinion shared by everyone it is one that is often cited onshore wind farms often draw the most ire but they arent alone large investments are being made in offshore wind farms which are both more discrete and better positioned to take advantage of stronger offshore currents and hydropower projects like dams and tidal barrages can in the long term create whole new habitats ecosystems and leisure facilities in the form of artificial lakes and surrounding forests nobody uses renewables in 2015 99 of costa ricas electricity came from renewable sources including hydro geothermal wind biomass and solar closer to home sweden draws more than 50 of its electricity from renewable sources including 22 from bioenergy  90 of which comes from forestry in the uk renewables use is steady and rising accounting for 25 of all electricity generated domestically in 2015 in the first half of 2016 20 of the uks renewable power was supplied by drax contrast those figures against coal which in the uk declined from supplying 308 of uk power needs in q1 2015 to just 158 in q1 2016 and our increasing use of renewables is even more evident consumers have been buying 100 renewable electricity tariffs from companies such as good energy for more than a decade businesses are increasingly getting in on the act too two thirds of the power generated by drax in the first half of 2016 was sold directly to companies via drax groups business electricity supplier haven power  and with campaigns such as re100 challenging the worlds biggest firms to commit to renewableonly power household brands such as ikea ms and google are either already 100 renewable or only a few years away misconceptions about renewables will remain as long as were still in the transition out of fossil fuel use but the industry has made huge strides from where it was just 10 years ago thanks to better more affordable technology an increasingly friendly corporate sector and a greater awareness of environmental issues at large these products and services will continue to improve grow and increasingly becoming more mainstream tags biomass energy  energy policy  wind power an alternative way to heat your home sustainable bioenergy there are things we as a modern society expect in our homes running water electricity at the touch of a button heating for when temperatures drift south all are ubiquitous in the uk serviced by large networks that deliver these resources on demand but there are some areas in the country that exist apart in the uk there remains a large proportion of homes off the gas grid without the benefits of easytoaccess gas and gas boilers these households rely on other forms of heating often fuelled by expensive and highcarbon fuels like oil or liquid petroleum gas lpg but there are alternatives to these and of those fuels biomass is not only an increasingly affordable one but a cleaner one too how do you heat your home with biomass biomass boilers work in much the same way that a gas powered one does they use fuel to generate a heat source that then heats water which is passed through radiators and into your households hot water supplies whereas the majority of boilers in the uk use gas as a fuel source biomass boilers run on natural wood products such as compressed wood pellets its an efficient and effective way of heating homes and in europe its a common one in sweden 1400000 tonnes of pellets were used in 2014 for heating compare that with the uks 300000  in a country with six times the population  and the difference is stark biomass covers more of europes energy requirements than any other but in the uk were falling behind continental averages a cleaner cheaper alternative wood is a simple renewable fuel a growing tree absorbs carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere which is released when the wood is used to generate energy in the form of heat or electricity new trees are planted to replace the old ones and the carbon dioxide is absorbed all over again thanks to this cyclical process biomass fuel is sustainable this makes compressed wood pellets a more climatefriendly fuel source than the fossil fuels of the past such as diesel and oil as well as being renewable there are financial benefits too a woodfuelled biomass boiler offers significant savings when compared with electric heating support towards a cleaner future the government has recognised the importance of technologies such as biomassfuelled boilers in achieving a lower carbon future the renewable heat inventive rhi programme was introduced to provide incentives to homeowners landlords and commercial customers for installing generators of renewable heat such as wood pellet boilers its objective is to try to achieve the target of ensuring that 12 of the uks heating comes from renewable sources by 2020 currently it makes up just 5 of the total but with improving technology and a more regular supply of biomass fuel  such as that offered by amp clean energy previously billington bioenergy to domestic customers  domestic wood pellet heating could become something thats not just a niche option but a serious alternative to off grid homes tags biomass energy  energy policy how a new industrial revolution in green energy is transforming the north once again sustainable business the north of england has long been a proving ground for the kind of engineering innovations that have transformed the world the heartland of the first industrial revolution it is now at the centre of a new revolution focused on clean energy production and sustainable power led by organisations like drax europes largest decarbonisation project over the last decade drax has been carrying out a major hightech engineering and infrastructure project to upgrade half its generating units to use sustainable biomass in place of coal these converted units now produce enough electricity to power birmingham leeds sheffield liverpool manchester and newcastle  all using compressed wood pellets cutting carbon emissions by more than 80 but more than just having environmental benefits its provided a huge boost to the economy boosting the uk economy in 2015 drax contributed more than 1 billion to the uks gdp and supported some 14000 jobs across the country the economic benefit has reached all parts of the country says ceo dorothy thompson  weve been the catalyst for rejuvenation and growth across the northern powerhouse with port expansion on the coasts of east yorkshire the north west and north east this boost was particularly significant in the north where drax generated over 620 million for the local economy innovation driving a better future for britain its these kinds of innovative upgrades that are helping to tackle the urgent environmental challenges that our society faces as we make the transition to lower carbon and renewable power and changing the way we think about producing energy in the uk having nurtured the industrial revolution today the north of england is again the focus of a major paradigm shift where once coal fields and smoke stacks dominated the local landscape now draxs giant biomass storage domes speak of a new future for the region for the uk and for renewable energy production as a whole to find out more about how drax has benefited the uks economy please visit httpswwwdraximpactcouk tags economic impact  energy policy  investors the power industry in 2016 where are we now power generation britain is in the middle of a transition while at one point it was the centre of the global coal industry its now pushing further towards renewable resources but 2016 has been a tumultuous year marked by political changes that have sent shock waves through the whole country the energy industry is no exception  but that is not to suggest its on shaky ground here we look at some of the years major events and how theyve affected the energy landscape leaving europe britains vote to leave the eu could have a major impact on the domestic energy landscape europe has played a central role in setting emissions targets for power stations promoting renewable technologies and trading carbon the uk also benefits from being in the single energy market where energy market rules and regulations are harmonised across a number of european countries a postbrexit resolution to these issues is likely to remain uncertain for some time as drax ceo dorothy thompson told a conference in florida in late september it will take a number of years for the uk to actually exit the eu and we think politicians on all sides will push for an orderly departure implementing the paris agreement following last years paris agreement on climate change the uk government demonstrated its commitment to being a world leader in clean energy by setting its fifth carbon budget the budget initially proposed by the independent advisory body the committee on climate change sets a cap on the uks greenhouse gas emissions for the period 20282032 the cap is ambitious and would require the uk to reduce its emissions to a level 57 lower than they were in 1990 the government is working on a new emissions reductions plan that will map out how it intends to meet this goal and accelerate decarbonisation in the power heat transport and agricultural sectors political change the reshuffle following theresa mays election as conservative leader and therefore prime minister also marked the end of the department of energy and climate change decc previously responsible for overseeing the countrys energy policy and its transition towards greener more renewable energy sources while the decision raised concerns in some quarters over the governments commitment to decarbonisation placing energy policy at the heart of a modern industrial strategy under the new department for business energy and industrial strategy could reap dividends in the longterm green light for hinkley point perhaps the single most highly scrutinised energy issue of the year and an indirect fallout of the summers political drama was the government delaying its approval of the planned hinkley point c nuclear power station the project backed by edf and chinese investors was when first announced by the french governmentcontrolled energy company in 2007 due to be generating electricity by the festive period just a decade later jumping ahead to 2016 and having been approved by theresa may two months later than the industry anticipated expectations are that the development is unlikely to cook its first christmas turkey until 25 th december 2025  at the very earliest this raises serious questions over what will fill the gap left by aging nuclear power stations that are due to close over the next few years this said delays to hinkley point c present an opportunity for alternative energy sources such as offshore wind solar and compressed wood pellets to make their case to work together as smart affordable solutions that could be in place well ahead of 2025 whole system costs the research and thinking around the issue of whole system costs continued to grow a series of reports from nera consulting and imperial college london showed that intermittent technologies such as wind and solar make managing the national energy grid more expensive in the absence of flexible dispatchable technologies like biomass it is only when these hidden costs are taken into consideration that we can truly understand the affordability of different energy technologies recognising the importance of this issue to good policy making the government has commissioned its own research on whole system costs which is due to be published later this year coal closure 2016 saw some important landmarks in great britains history as a coalusing nation a 12hour stretch in may this year was the first time since 1882  the year gbs first coalfired power station went online  that the country was powered for more than half a day completely by other fuels plans outlined last year by then energy secretary amber rudd had aimed to ban unabated coal power stations by 2025 this year has already seen coalfired casualties full or partial closures of five major coal burning power plants in great britain have taken place in 2016 ferrybridge longannet rugeley fiddlers ferry some units of sses north west coal station will remain active until next year and eggborough reopened in late september for the winter 201617 by the end of 2016 the equivalent of between two and three hinkley cs 8 gw will have come off the system while rudds plans still stand delays to hinkley point c and a lack of new flexible power stations being built in great britain means that the government will need to think carefully about how to get coal off the grid in an orderly fashion to avoid a capacity crunch in the early 2020s ancillary  essential capacity crunched despite the strides made by renewables over the course of the year and the recent boon to the nuclear sectors future gb power infrastructure badly needs flexible fuels the ability to generate more power  or less  in mere seconds when the country demands it is becoming increasingly important with the growth of wind and solar power as more offshore wind arrays are constructed and solar farms and roofs proliferate there are an increasing number of gaps in our electricity supply being filled by power sources that can be dialled up and down when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine while drax and two planned power projects in the north east of england lynemouth and mgt teeside are turning to a coaltobiomass conversion and a new build biomass combined heat and power plant to meet these needs the government continues to look for ways to encourage companies to build new gas power stations as well as emerging battery storage technologies a critical route to incentivising these technologies is the notveryaptlynamed ancillary services market it involves the high voltage electricity system operator in great britain the national grid buying services to ensure the lights stay on the increasingly electric transport sector keeps running and our hightech world of work stays online energy future so far there have been some very big changes over the course of the year however the energy ecosystem in great britain should be robust and flexible enough that the transition from coal to low carbon and renewable technologies in the future should be a secure and affordable one this will require a mix of smart solutions a key enabling technology will be coaltobiomass upgrades that can run as both baseload and flexible generators tags energy policy  power station how does europe use biomass sustainable bioenergy at the heart of norse folklore is a figure called yggdrasil that connects its nine worlds and gods its an immensely important and holy icon but it is not a god itself  it is an ash tree that the central figure of mythical scandinavian cosmology should be something as humble as a tree is no surprise scandinavia is a heavily forested region sweden the largest country in the area is more than 68 forest wood is an inherent part of life there for thousands of years its been used as a resource and a fuel and today is no different throughout much of europe the same is true but while historically wood was used only for cooking heating and light today its use as a form of energy also includes generating electricity and heat when formed into compressed wood pellets europe and wood pellets nearly 22 million tonnes mt of wood pellets were used in the european union in 2015 making the region the leading wood pellet consumer in the world it is also the worlds leading producer creating roughly half of the worlds global output  largely from european trees a report from the standing forestry committee set up to represent the forestry industries in eu countries found that just 4 of the woody biomass used in the eu was imported of the 22mt used across europe 105mt was used for heating while 115mt was used for industrial uses like fueling power plants but in the uk the level of wood used for fuel falls some way behind eu averages thanks in large part to drax and its transition from coal to renewable wood pelletpowered electricity generation thats changing but the uk still has a way to go to catch the continental average where is the uk falling behind and how is wood being used to power the rest of the continent here we look at some of the largest consumers and producers of biomass in europe and how its being used sweden sweden is the third highest consumer of wood as a source of energy in europe trailing only finland and latvia in its use a key use of biomass in sweden is powering district heating systems in a district heating system rather than each building or home having its own boiler whole areas of cities are heated through a single central plant distributing heat to buildings these plants can be powered by a variety of fuels but many run on wood pellets or distribute the waste heat captured at power plants germany in 1713 an accountant and mining administrator hans carl von carlowitz published what is considered the first ever book to look in depth at forestry management effectively kickstarting the modern idea of sustainable forestry in the 300 years that have passed germany has embraced the cultivation of wood and has made wood and biomass a fixed part of its energy makeup more recently the renewable energy heating act and market incentive programme was passed in 2009 which requires new building owners to provide a percentage of their heat from renewable sources including woodfired boilers the aim is to increase the countrys share of renewable heat to 14 by 2020 finland nearly three quarters of finland is forestland making it one of the most forested countries in the world let alone europe as a result wood plays a large part in finnish culture stora enso one of the worlds leading paper and packaging manufacturers is finnish and more than 20 of the countrys exports are from wood and wood products coupled with a strong focus generating much of its energy from renewables energy derived from wood and products made from wood is high united kingdom in 2013 less than 10 of all energy used in the uk was generated from wood and wood products this places it some way behind countries like germany and sweden in part owing to a lack of infrastructure for providing heating derived from wood and wood biomass this could change if the government continues to back technologies equally in initiatives like the renewable heat incentive rhi available to homeowners landlords and commercial customers rhi provides incentives for installing generators of renewable heat such as wood pellet boilers  to reach climate goals the then department of energy and climate change noted that both biomassdriven electricity generation and heating should continue to increase in the uk and with the upgrade of drax and lynemouth power stations from coal to compressed wood pellets there are positive signs the uk can catch up to the european biomass average in doing so renewable biomass electricity generation can also help increase wind and solar power generation in the uk and help create a more sustainable energy future tags biomass energy  energy policy  wood pellets mind the gap dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 28 july 2016 opinion later today the edf board is expected to give the goahead for a new nuclear power station at hinkley this will provide some long overdue clarity for britains energy sector but we now need to quickly move on and make the right decisions to secure the best mix of power generation the drawn out debate around hinkley point c has diverted attention away from the sectors biggest challenge the government has made it clear that coal must come off the system by 2025 but coal still provides up to one fifth of the uks electricity and plugging that gap will be far from easy nor will doing so in a way that allows the country to meet its carbon targets while supporting the technologies that will deliver a modern energy system fit for the 21st century the governments intention is absolutely right but how does it intend to meet its target lets be clear a positive hinkley point c decision will play an important role in the necessary energy mix but will provide no silver bullet by most estimates when finally complete the nuclear plant will provide seven percent of the uks electricity needs however this isnt expected to come on grid much before 2030 and lets remember that in 2030 all but one of the uks current operating nuclear reactors are scheduled to be closed hinkley will therefore be replacing only some of the lost nuclear capacity not providing new energy to replace coal the last few years have seen a huge and welcome expansion in renewable sources of generation like wind and solar in the uk but they are intermittent and cannot fill the gap alone they still need to be supported by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine  a regular scenario on these shores as a form of lowcarbon baseload generation nuclear will undoubtedly be part of the answer however as weve already seen with hinkley point c planning funding and building new power stations can be a long and costly process  it has taken over a decade to reach todays decision in the past year alone more than 5 gigawatts gw of coal power generation hinkley point c is set to provide 32 gw  has come off grid well before the governments target of 2025  we dont have the luxury of time every day lost adds to the cost of addressing this challenge gas will play a role but many including the institution of mechanical engineers imeche have pointed out the huge number of gasfired power stations well need to plug the gap that ending coal creates  imeche estimates 30 will be required which is clearly unrealistic since the uk has built just four in the last 10 years at drax we have developed a solution to these challenges  we have used state of the art technology to upgrade some of our coal facilities to generate electricity from biomass in place of coal these facilities are already providing a reliable and flexible flow of electricity that also helps the uk meet its carbon targets the biomass we use is compressed wood pellets which perform in much the same way as coal and deliver an 80 co 2 saving our biomass facilities are already powering three million homes and with the right support we can double this helping to plug the energy gap that old plant coming off and delays to new build will leave us with using biomass is more costeffective than other renewables this was illustrated by a recent study from imperial college and economic consultancy nera when they analysed the hidden costs of the backup needed to meet demand created by intermittent renewables  our biomass facilities can provide all of the electricity services required to keep the uk electricity system stable providing these services is set to become increasingly important in the years ahead as a greater need to backup and balance the system will be required finding the right mix of power generation will not be easy but it is important we make every effort to get it right like hinkley point c biomass is not a silver bullet but it can and must play its part in helping the country transform to a lowcarbon future  tags biomass energy  energy policy  gas the true cost of replacing coalfired electricity generation dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 17 february 2016 opinion to make up for these closures the government is already planning to bring on new capacity a new gasfired power station will open at carrington this summer and were expecting to hear any day now that another nuclear power station will be created at hinkley point and of course more electricity from renewables must be added over the years ahead as we look to meet our go green targets in fact the government already has a plan in place to award contracts for new green energy off the back of three auctions over the next four years the first of them is due later this year drax understands that every one of those auctions is focused on offshore wind however new independent research published by nera economic consulting and imperial college london questions that single technology approach commissioned by drax group plc from leading economists the research reveals the true cost of the main forms of renewable energy  wind solar and biomass and the evidence shows that opening up these auctions to include other renewables could result in significant savings that could be passed on to consumers where could these savings come from renewables like wind and solar are vital but they are by their very nature intermittent that means other forms of power generation need to be available on standby at very short notice to meet the gap between supply and demand the costs of providing this standby electricity are passed on to consumers in their energy bills but crucially they are not reflected in how the government ranks the support that each type of renewable energy requires essentially the costs are hidden the neraicl research shows that if these hidden costs are added in the true picture is very different when the true costs are taken into account the governments preferred option  offshore wind  turns out to be the most expensive in fact the cheapest option is deploying new technology to existing power stations enabling them to use biomass  essentially replacing coal with compressed wood pellets all in all getting cheaper renewables into the mix could save consumers up to 22bn how support for renewables is already funded through a portion of your energy bill and bringing in a more costeffective mix reduces the support needed that is why we at drax are urging the government to look at the true costs of new renewable capacity and include us in the mix for new power contracts to do so would not only lead to a potential 2bn saving for consumers but replacing more coal with biomass gives the uk that reliable standby power we know we will need when other renewables cant deliver it using the latest technology weve already upgraded half of our power station to run on compressed wood pellets the jobs not done with the right support we want to carry on with the work were doing and help the government to achieve its target of getting coal off the system by 2025 tags biomass energy  coal  energy policy  gas rethinking the uks future energy mix andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 13 january 2016 opinion since the climate change summit in paris theres been a lot of talk about how we can remove coal from the energy mix in the uk and limit further climate change one way would be to close down all the coalfired power stations but coal still provides more than 20 per cent of the uks electricity and the department for energy and climate change decc predicts we will need almost 20 more electricity by 2035  not less chart below whats more building new capacity to replace those power stations would take years while buying in extra supplies of energy at short notice can mean extra costs being passed on to customers the good news is that at drax weve already developed a solution to the challenge as i told the yorkshire post recently  were doing it by converting our coalfired generating units to use compressed wood pellets and were using worldbeating technology developed by our own engineers here in the uk in fact were now producing more electricity from wood pellets than from coal at drax and were doing it day in day out in all around four per cent of the uks entire electricity needs every single day of the year are now being met thanks to our unique biomass technology at drax this enables us to take lowgrade wood and compress it into small highdensity pellets to use in our specially adapted generating units even including a minimal quantity of carbon emissions in the supply chain conversions still cut greenhouse gases by over 80 compared to coal  if we can get the support to convert the other three generating units at the power station then well cease using coal at drax this would help the governments proposed target date of ending unabated coal electricity generation in the uk by 2025  i think at a very high level that support is there we all know that wind and solar energy have the potential to take a bigger role in britains energy mix but to do so they need to be accompanied by another technology that can be turned up to fill gaps when the weather means they produce less energy than required our highdensity wood pellets are the only nonfossil fuel that can do this looking to the future as wind and solar grow and britain becomes more dependent on them it will be ever more important to have this reliable renewable support on hand were well behind our european neighbours in using wood pellets for energy  and a long way behind countries like germany and sweden taking steps to catch up with the european average is the fastest most affordable and most reliable way to move away from coal to the renewable fuels of the future to take those steps energy companies like drax and the government need more dialogue tags biomass energy  coal  energy policy  wind power  1  3 4 5 6 7 8 name email comment sign up for updates from drax
