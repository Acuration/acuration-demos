keep up 2 march 2018 electrification bitcoin is having a breakout year its price fluctuations are making headlines all over the world and major investment banks are finally beginning to take it seriously  in short bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency  its becoming a major player but for all the advantages it and other decentralised currencies offer such as lowtransaction fees and no intermediaries  theres a fundamental problem at their core they use an extraordinary amount of electricity according to bitcoin analysis site digiconomist  the bitcoin network now uses more than 52 terawatt hours twh every year  more than the whole of portugal ireland or peru if this rate of growth continues its forecast that by july 2019 it is expected to use more electricity than the us  so while bitcoin may be heralded as a saviour from the monopolies of big banks what does its incredible appetite for electricity spell for the worlds power networks why does bitcoin use so much electricity bitcoin might be an entirely digital currency but it still needs to be created and this requires a process called bitcoin mining bitcoin is a decentralised network meaning transactions are carried out directly between parties without any central authority instead bitcoin securely records all its transactions through a network made up of thousands of users computers bitcoin mining is essentially the process of recording and adding these transactions to the public network or ledger  known as the blockchain every 10 minutes each pending bitcoin transaction is converted into a complex mathematical problem that needs to be solved this is where the mining computers come in which use highpowered processing hardware to tackle the mathematical equations and solve each transaction the first miner to successfully crack one of these problems adds that bitcoin transaction to the ledger and is rewarded with an amount of newly mined bitcoins  currently set at 125 bitcoins btc worth roughly 140000 this process isnt a quick one and relies on large numbers of highpowered computers to solve the problems one of the largest bitcoin mining rigs in the world  in ordos inner mongolia  is made up of eight buildings crammed with 25000 machines  all cranking through calculations 24 hours a day unsurprisingly this huge amount of processing power uses a lot of electricity it also requires a huge amount of space and generates a lot of heat all of which have sent bitcoin miners around the world in search of cheap electricity plentiful space and cold weather the search for cheap tech power iceland and sweden have become popular destinations for bitcoin mining thanks to its climate which keeps computer equipment from overheating and plentiful electricity  in fact in iceland mining is set to reach 840 gigawatt hours gwh this year  more than the 700 gwh used by the countrys households icelands high level of geothermal and hydroelectric power means these mining operations have a low environmental impact however the same cant be said of the largest bitcoin miner in the world china while it has an abundance of hydropower and an increasing renewable capacity a large amount of chinas electricity still comes from coal  72 of its total generation came from the fossil fuel in 2015  this raises concerns around the environmental impact of bitcoins increasing electricity needs digiconomist estimates the emissions of just one largescale coalpowered bitcoin mining operation eg the operation in ordos could fall between 2440 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per hour  roughly the same as flying a full boeing 747400 for the same period however not everyone is convinced the network is as energy intensive as reports suggest  and part of the challenge is that  despite knowing how many bitcoins are in existence  theres no precise way of knowing how much mining is going on what is known however is that even as cryptocurrency prices fluctuate mining is increasing  in short bitcoins incredible appetite for electricity isnt going anywhere soon but could it get cleaner moving towards cleaner mining some companies are tackling the problem of making bitcoin more sustainable by bringing it off grid and linking it directly to cleaner sources of power much like how tech companies are striking deals with local renewable suppliers when locating data centres  hydrominer  for example is placing mining hardware directly into hydropower stations while harvest aims to use dedicated wind turbines to power mining which takes pressure off national grids and their electricity sources however a more fundamental change could be possible making the protocol used to create bitcoins less energyintensive ethereum arguably the main rival cryptocurrency to bitcoin this year switched from proofofworkbased mining to proofofstake  this means coin creation is not depended on highpowered computers cranking through calculations but instead through owners validating their stake in the cryptocurrency and voting on block creation  another alternative is chia network which harnesses unused hard drive storage space for blockchain verification chia farmers for offering storage space for the network both have significant ground to cover to catch the market leader however so the more pressing question remains whats next for bitcoin and what will happen as the number of available bitcoins decreases the future of bitcoin like gold there are a limited number of bitcoins that can ever be mined  21 million to be precise this means the reward for bitcoin mining halves roughly every four years as they become more abundant the next drop is scheduled for 2020 when the reward will slide to 625 btc but this doesnt mean theyre getting easier to mine in fact it is growing increasingly difficult and this means more computer power and a need for even more electricity which in turn means higher overheads a report from jp morgan estimates the price of mining a single bitcoin has grown tenfold in the last year to 3920  a change that could send miners in search of cheaper utilities more than this the added stress on grids could lead to a growth in dirtier and cheaper fossil fuels which can generate and power mining operations around the clock this could mean that as mining becomes more difficult and rewards drop it will be controlled by fewer largerscale operators which can absorb the spiraling costs either way its expected they will be forced to reduce their electricity consumption or at least the cost of it to remain economical as the rewards they earn cover less of their expenses ultimately however if cryptocurrency is set to play a positive role in our future it must become less electricity intensive and work with evolving energy systems to be as sustainable and progressive for the environment as it could be for the global economy share name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter to
