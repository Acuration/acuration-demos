independent catchment area analysis caa reports for around 68 of the total biomass wood pellet supply to drax power station in 2019 within that 73 of the pellets were manufactured in the us south accounting for 49 of that years total supply quantity a key component of caa analysis are measurements data and calculations provided by the national forest inventory nfi bespoke wood price data mill production capacity market trends and interviews with local experts complete the picture the nfi in each country or region can be quite different in its intensity and frequency of measurement and overall degree of accuracy in this article we examine the forest inventory and analysis fia database produced by the us department of agriculture forest service usda fs fia traces its origin back to the mcsweeney  mcnary forest research act of 1928 and began the first inventory in 1930 since that time it has been in continuous operation with a stated mission to make and keep current a comprehensive inventory and analysis of the present and prospective conditions of and requirements for the renewable resources of the forest and rangelands of the us the fundamental science behind measuring tree height and diameter to calculate growth and volume has not changed much over the decades a girth tape is used to measure the diameter at breast height dbh which is a point on the tree stem 137m above the base of the tree or the root collar the exact height can vary by country the height of a standing tree is conventionally measured using a clinometer or hypsometer which measures the angle from the top of the tree to a measured distance away from the base this forms a triangle from which the tree height can be calculated dbh measurement using girth tape tree height measurement using clinometer example of girth and height measurement in the us south the combination of height and girth are then used to estimate total tree volume based on historical models for that particular species in that country or region many decades worth of data measurements and modelling have been used to develop complex equations to estimate volume for each species and circumstance this calculation process needs to estimate the rate of taper of the stem or the difference in diameter between the base and the top of the tree this can be consistent within a single species but it can depend on growth rates and planting density for example closely stocked trees may grow taller and thinner but more openly planted trees tend to be shorter and wider whether the site has been thinned  how many times and at what age can impact the degree of taper in the stem through many years of research measuring and modelling the southern research station srs fia team has developed the following formula for underbark volume calculation this is then modified according to the parameters shown below depending on species and stem characteristics example of volume once the volume has been calculated the basic density solid wood per cubic metre and moisture content can be used to calculate wet and dry weight fibre content and yield a comprehensive record of data the us forest service has built up an extensive historical record of data points through years of physical measurements  from both sampling and cutting down individual sample trees to determine the actual dimensions and statistics to compare against the estimated values over time forest scientists are able to build up reasonably accurate tables for each tree species that can be used to estimate growth and volume based on the dbh and estimated tree height in the uk we have a foresters handbook known as the blue book which contains a vast quantity of modelled data to help a forester calculate volume and growth in a range of different forest types across the country this data has been collected and modelled by the forestry commissions forest research branch  in the us they have a similar system of data collection and modelling but on a bigger scale given the much larger forest area and greater variety in tree species and site type how can you measure an entire forest the forestland area of the us south covers more than 100 million hectares ha in total which can present quite a challenge to measure survey and accurately predict forest growth and health the fia does this through a network of sample plots randomly but sequentially distributed across the forestland in each state with undisclosed locations so as to avoid biased management field crews collect data on forest type site attributes tree species tree size and overall tree condition on accessible forest land recently the programme has involved a fiveyear rolling measurement system where 20 of the plots are measured in each state on an annual basis at the end of a fiveyear period all plots will have been measured and the process begins again this process is overseen by a robust quality assurance system to maintain and ensure the quality and accuracy of the fieldwork plots are distributed at a rate of 1 plot per 6000 acres of land or one per 2400 ha this degree of plot distribution is at an extremely course scale if attempting to understand the growth of an individual stand or forest area for example the blue book recommends using 812 plots and top height measurements for a relatively uniform stand of around 10 ha this degree of accuracy would be required to calculate the volume of standing wood for sale in comparison the fia data would be completely inaccurate if trying to monitor growth and trends at an individual forest level or even at county level this sampling intensity and the scale of measurement are the most critical factors in assessing the validity of data and trends that are identified through the fia and through the caa analysis quantifying the level of accuracy the physical measurement procedure and volume modelling are well established processes with data and analysis collected over many decades to support the findings this leads to a clearly quantifiable degree of error for each measured plot the challenge comes when using plot data to estimate the values in the surrounding forest at this scale the level of accuracy will depend on the ratio of plots to total forest area and the total number of plots measured the ratio of plots per ha in the us south is predetermined limited by the physical and financial constraints of actually measuring trees on the ground however the total number of plots used to evaluate trends can vary according to how large an area is assessed fundamentally if a single county is assessed then the total number of sample plots will be low and the potential for error will be high if an entire state is assessed then the number of plots is much larger despite the same ratio of plots per ha therefore the data and the trend is statistically much more accurate draxs caa analysis falls somewhere in between these two points with each catchment area including multiple counties but not quite at the same scale as state level analysis an example of the variation in error is shown in the table below degree of error for key metrics in draxs caa analysis the data showing total inventory volume of wood growing in the forest has been assessed for the chesapeake catchment area in north carolina and virginia when looking at each individual county the data error calculation is  465 therefore not very accurate if looking at state level the data error is only  27 this degree of error is much more accurate and demonstrates more credible and reliable data due to the much larger number of plots available across the entire state the drax caa analysis for inventory in the chesapeake area is  47 which is reasonably close to the state level accuracy due to the large number of countries that are included in the caa analysis since the catchment area boundary is defined by the pellet mills historical and future sourcing pattern this can vary in size according to each mills procurement strategy and local market conditions for example the amite bioenergy pellet plant sources from a much smaller area close to the mill and therefore the catchment area includes fewer counties this can lead to a higher degree of error than in the other caa reports as the total number of plots used is smaller a long history of measurement and analysis despite this the overall degree of error is still in single figures and can be considered reasonable in each caa report by the standards of forest measurement and modelling an error of under 10 is generally considered acceptable measuring standing trees that are still growing is not an exact science  it is an estimation trees cannot be accurately weighed or measured until they are cut down therefore there will always be degree of error in estimated data in the us south the long history of measurement analysis and data modelling and the relatively homogenous nature of the main commercial species southern yellow pine mean that the error is relatively uniform and predictable if a large sample area is considered the potential for remote sensing data collection and analysis to replace traditional field measurement is an interesting and developing field at an individual forest or stand level it is possible to carry out intensive measurement with laser or lidar to calculate volume and growth however there is currently no reliable accurate and costeffective way to do this at a largescale across several million hectares this may be a possibility as the technology and data interpretation tools continue to develop and drax is working closely with remote sensing specialists to trial and develop this process until then we can rely on boots on the ground and traditional fieldwork for an accurate view of the forest trends across our supply chain this blog supports a series of catchment area analyses around the forest biomass pellet plants supplying drax power station

positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business progressing our strategy to increase our selfsupply reduce our biomass production cost and create a longterm future for sustainable biomass drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload we expect to benefit greatly from pinnacles operational and commercial expertise and i am looking forward to what we can achieve together it will pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and become a carbon negative company by 2030  permanently removing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year negative emissions from beccs are vital if we are to address the global climate emergency whilst also providing renewable electricity needed in a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery duncan davies chief executive officer of pinnacle said pinnacles board of directors has unanimously determined that the transaction represents the best course of action for the company and its shareholders on closing the transaction will deliver immediate significant and certain cash value to our shareholders at the same time the combination of pinnacle and drax will create a global leader in sustainable biomass with the vision technical expertise and financial strength to help meet the growing demand for renewable energy products which is exciting for our employees customers and others around the world draxs sustainable biomass strategy sustainable biomass has an important role to play in global energy markets as a flexible and sustainable source of renewable energy as well as having the potential to deliver negative emissions drax believes that the acquisition accelerates the groups strategic objectives to increase its available selfsupply of sustainable biomass to five million tonnes per annum drax currently operates 16 million tonnes of capacity with 04 million tonnes in development and reduce the cost of biomass to 50mwh 4 by 2027 through the delivery of these strategic objectives drax aims to create a longterm future for sustainable biomass including thirdparty supply beccs and merchant biomass generation employee at morehouse bioenergy in louisiana the groups enlarged supply chain will have access to 49 million tonnes of operational capacity from 2022 of this total 29 million tonnes are available for draxs selfsupply requirements in 2022 increasing to 34 million tonnes in 2027 drax aims to increase the level of thirdparty sales and further expand its capacity to meet its target of five million tonnes of selfsupply by 2027 drax believes that the acquisition is highly complementary to the groups other longterm strategic options for biomass once optimised the enlarged groups biomass supply chain will support draxs own generation requirements including the potential development of beccs whilst also serving the growing biomass markets in europe and asia via longterm offtake agreements a major producer and supplier of goodquality lowcost sustainable biomass pinnacle which is listed on the toronto stock exchange operates 25 million tonnes of biomass capacity at sites in western canada and the southeastern us with a further 04 million tonnes of capacity in development commissioning in 2021 investment in this new capacity is expected to be substantially complete in the first half of 2021 once the new capacity is commissioned pinnacles nameplate production capacity is expected to increase to 29 million tonnes per annum pinnacle has ownership of c80 of this nameplate capacity with the remaining c20 coowned with its forestry industry joint venture partners ensuring strong commercial relationships and shared interests in security of supply pinnacle has sales and marketing rights to 100 of the output from all sites pinnacle is a key supplier of wood pellets for drax and other third parties in asia and europe with c67 billion of contracted thirdparty sales including sales to drax wood pellets loaded onto vessel at westview terminal british columbia through scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing pinnacle is currently produces biomass at a lower cost than drax with a likeforlike 2019 production cost of us124tonne 3  compared to draxs 2019 production cost of us161tonne 3  the pro forma 2019 production cost for the combined business is us141tonne pinnacles lower cost partially reflects the use of high levels of lowcost sawmill residues british columbia has a large and wellestablished commercial forestry industry which has in recent years seen increased harvest levels in part associated with management of a pine beetle infestation producing good levels of residue material availability for the production of biomass this infestation has now run its course and alongside other influences on the forest landscape including wildfire is resulting in a reduction in the annual harvest and sawmill closures the industry is adjusting to this with some production curtailment as well as developing approaches to fibre recovery and use which is expected to result in some increase in fibre costs since 2017 the sustainable biomass program has conducted annual audits of each of pinnacles operational sites allowing drax to ensure through its diligence that the material that it purchases from pinnacle is in line with its sustainability standards drax is committed to ensuring best practice in health and safety operational efficiency and sustainability across the enlarged group and intends to invest accordingly to deliver this outcome drax is committed to ensuring that its biomass sources are compliant with draxs wellestablished responsible sourcing policy and drax expects to invest in adapt and develop sourcing practices to ensure compliance with draxs policies to deliver both draxs biomass strategy and positive forest outcomes a large and geographically diversified asset base pinnacle has ownership interests in ten operational plants and one in development commissioning 2021 six of which are operated through joint venture arrangements providing access to nameplate production capacity of 29 million tonnes per annum seven of pinnacles sites are in british columbia 16 million tonne nameplate capacity and two are

production sites are located in areas with access to fibre and are able to operate with a range of biomass material from existing commercial forestry activities including sawmill residues precommercial thinnings and lowgrade wood combined with a geographic spread of production capacity and access to three separate export facilities pinnacle benefits from operational and sourcing flexibility further enhancing draxs security of supply further information is set out in appendix 1 to this announcement longterm biomass revenues with access to asian and european markets pinnacle has contracted sales of c67 billion with highquality asian and european counterparties including drax this equates to 99 of its current production capacity contracted to third parties through 2026 and a significant volume contracted in 2027 and beyond providing longterm highquality revenues vessel carrying biomass pellets at westview terminal british columbia pinnacle has been supplying biomass to europe since 2004 the location of the majority of pinnacles production capacity in western canada with access to the pacific ocean provides a strong position from which to serve the growing demand for biomass in asian markets in 2018 and 2019 pinnacle entered into 12 new longterm contracts in japan and south korea totalling over 13 million tonnes per annum valued at c46 billion with most contracts commencing between 2021 and 2023 the average contract duration is nine years with certain contracts extending significantly beyond this point contracts typically operate on a takeorpay basis global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the global biomass wood pellet market has a broad range of providers that are expected to expand their production capacity including operators such as enviva graanul invest pinnacle an viet phat fram and sy energy the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by asian demand 5  drax believes that increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and an improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand train pulling biomass wagons storage domes and wood pellet conveyor system drax power station north yorkshire as a vertically integrated producer and consumer of sustainable biomass drax is differentiated from its peers and well positioned to deliver supply chain efficiencies and an expanded range of sustainable biomass materials for ownuse and thirdparty sales through its expanding lower cost supply chain expertise in biomass generation and enhanced global footprint drax believes that there will be opportunities to work with other companies and countries in developing their own biomassenabled decarbonisation strategies strong return on investment the acquisition is expected to be cash generative and represent an attractive opportunity to create significant value for shareholders with expected returns significantly in excess of the groups weighted average cost of capital the addition of longterm contracts with highquality counterparties in growing international biomass markets will reduce the groups relative exposure to commodity prices in line with the groups objective to improve earnings quality and visibility in total the acquisition increases access to lower cost biomass by a further 29 million tonnes after the commissioning of the demopolis plant in 2021 the price paid for this capacity is consistent with the previously outlined strategy to invest in the region of c600 million to deliver draxs plans for five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity and a biomass cost of 50mwh by 2027 for the year ended 27 december 2019 pinnacle generated adjusted ebitda 6 of c47 million from pellet sales of 17 million tonnes pinnacles 2019 performance was impacted by fire at its entwistle plant reduced rail access due to rail industrial action and weather disrupted forestry activity at the same time pinnacle experienced regional canadian sawmill closures resulting in some reduction in sawmill residues and an increase in provincial fibre prices fibre diversification and the development of a second hub in the southeastern us is expected to partially mitigate the risk of fibre price rises taking these factors into account alongside the commissioning of new capacity and the commencement of asian supply contracts pinnacles 2022 consensus ebitda is c99 million increasing to c126 million in 2023 bloomberg the acquisition strengthens the groups ability to pay a sustainable and growing dividend drax does not expect the acquisition to have any impact on its expectations for the final dividend payment for 2020 financing the acquisition the acquisition is expected to be funded from cash and existing agreements on 15 december 2020 the group issued a trading update which noted cash and total committed liquidity of 643 million at 30 november 2020 following the completion on 31 january 2021 of the sale of four gas power stations previously announced on 15 december 2020 the group received cash of 188 million being the agreed purchase price consideration of 164 million and 24 million of customary working capital adjustments net debt to adjusted ebitda 7 in 2021 is expected to be above draxs longterm target of around 2 times immediately after completion of the acquisition but is expected to return to around this level by the end of 2022 management of foreign exchange exposure the acquisition price will be paid in canadian dollars pinnacles existing contracts with drax and third parties are denominated in canadian and us dollars and drax expects to manage any exposure within its foreign exchange processes draxs policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposure on contracted biomass volumes over a rolling fiveyear period this has given rise to an average foreign exchange rate hedge around 140 usgbp sustainable sourcing sustainably sourced biomass is an important part of uk and european renewable energy policy the renewable status of sustainably sourced biomass is based on wellestablished scientific principles set out by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and reflected in the european unions eu second renewable energy directive and the uk renewables obligation drax maintains a rigorous approach to biomass sustainability ensuring the wood fibre it uses is fully compliant with the uks mandatory standards as well as those of the eu dead pine trees in background infected with mountain pine beetle british columbia drax recognises that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to commercially managed forests in the southeastern us working in partnership with engo earthworm drax has a good understanding of the considerations associated with sourcing residues from harvesting of primary forest and the particular characteristics of the forests in british columbia and alberta in line with its responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with engo partners indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas operational efficiencies improvements and savings the strong financial returns associated with the acquisition are not dependent on synergy benefits but the group has identified areas for potential operational improvements and efficiencies and opportunities to invest across the supply chain to achieve consistent standards and improve outputs across the enlarged group portfolio optimisation drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio drax believes that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers with existing plans to widen of the groups sustainable biomass fuel mix to include a wider range of lower cost sustainable biomass materials drax expects to create further opportunities to optimise fuel cargos for own use and thirdparty supply logistics optimisation drax believes that the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged group will provide greater opportunities to optimise logistics with delivery of cargos to a counterpartys closest port reducing distance time carbon footprint and cost enhanced security of supply control of draxs biomass supply chain with geographically diverse production and export facilities is expected to enhance security of supply further mitigating the risk of supply interruptions thereby resulting in improved reliability and a reduced risk of supply interruption combined expertise drax believes that there will be opportunities to share best practice and drive improved production performance across the enlarged group by leveraging combined expertise in the production of goodquality lowcost pellets across the enlarged supply chain drax also expects to leverage pinnacles experience in developing and managing thirdparty offtake agreements alongside its existing commercial and trading capabilities to develop new agreements for supply to thirdparties stronger counterparty credit drax has a stronger credit rating which could enable pinnacle to develop its supply capability and contracts in asian and european markets beyond its current position reduced cost of debt draxs average cost of debt is lower than pinnacles giving rise to potential future

opinion tackling climate change requires global collaboration as a ukus sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated collaborative energy system the technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions such as the us south where our american communities operate carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help drax to be carbon negative by 2030  an ambition i announced at cop25  just over a year ago in madrid will gardiner announcing draxs carbon negative ambition at cop25 in madrid december 2019 our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but are also a vital economic force as the world begins to recover from the effects of covid19 engineer inside the turbine hall of drax power station we all want the uks recovery to be a green recovery  one which benefits the north along with the whole of the country government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station  for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south  we are also partnered with 11 other organisations in the uks humber region to develop a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200000 jobs around the uk in 2039 the expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for ccus and biomass sustainability  clear longterm policies are essential here not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment these are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact co 2 emissions and lives of people engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station at drax we directly employ almost 3000 people in the us and uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cuttingedge carbon capture and removal technology we can then share our expertise with the united states

to nonrenewable energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric insights the cost of electricity from solar panels dropped by 82 between 2010 and 2019 while the cost of onshore wind fell 40 and offshore wind 29 the worlds largest power station of any kind  the three gorges dam in china runs on a renewable energy source

located in the southeast of england and blackburn mill 60mw commissioned in 2002 in lancashire england drax acquired the ccgts from iberdrola in december 2018 as part of a portfolio of pumped storage hydro and gas generation the majority of the value in the acquisition was ascribed to the pumped storage and hydro assets which in the first six months of 2020 provided 35 million of adjusted ebitda 3  in the same period the ccgts provided 18 million of adjusted ebitda group adjusted ebitda for the first six months of 2020 was 179 million as at 30 june 2020 the gross fixed assets for the ccgts were 182 million the ccgts also have 89 million of capacity market income between 2021 and 2024 4 which will remain with dgel on completion the ccgt business currently employs 121 people in operational roles who will transfer with dgel on completion drax has agreed a series of transitional services to support the transition through 2021 other gas projects drax continues to evaluate options for the development of four open cycle gas turbines and drax power station following the end of coal operations financial total consideration is 1933 million subject to customary completion accounts adjustments comprising 1643 million for the four ccgt power stations and a further 290 million of contingent consideration payable on satisfaction of certain triggers in respect of the option to develop a new ccgt at damhead creek the payment of 1643 million in respect of the four ccgts is payable in cash on completion with an option to defer the payment of 500 million until april 2022 the deferred component would carry an interest rate of four percent and be backed by a letter of credit in the event that the deferral option is exercised drax intends to convert the payment obligation to cash upon completion for the face value subject to fulfilment of preclosing conditions completion is to take place by 31 january 2021 the sale price represents an expected premium compared to the book value of the assets subject to customary adjustments and a return over the period of ownership significantly ahead of the groups wacc biomass strategy  investment in capacity expansion and cost reduction sustainable biomass wood pellet storage domes at baton rouge transit a renewable fuel storage and logistics site operated by drax at the port of greater baton rouge louisiana click to viewdownload the proceeds from the sale of the ccgts are expected to be used to support the development of the groups biomass strategy through which drax aims to build a longterm future for sustainable biomass drax aims to do this by expanding its supply chain to five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity by 2027 15 million today plus 05 million tonnes in development and reducing the cost of biomass to 50mwh 5  these savings will be delivered through the optimisation of existing biomass operations greater utilisation of lowcost wood residues and an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other lowcost renewable biomass across the groups expanded supply chain drax believes that the additional capital and operating cost investment required to deliver this supply chain expansion is in the region of 600 million which the group expects to invest ahead of 2027 drax remains alert to sector opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth the group has identified three models through which it believes it can deliver a longterm future for sustainable biomass all of which are underpinned by the delivery of its supply chain expansion and cost reduction plans these options which are not mutually exclusive are summarised below the delivery of one or more of these models by 2027 would enable drax to continue its biomass activities when the current uk renewable schemes for biomass generation end in march 2027 1 merchant biomass generation at drax power station drax believe that biomass has an important role to play in the uk as a flexible and reliable source of renewable energy supporting increased utilisation of intermittent and inflexible generation across the uk power grid in march 2027 when the current cfd6 and roc 7 renewable schemes end drax believes that through a combination of peak power generation system support services capacity market income and a lowcost operating model for drax power station including lowcost biomass this site can continue to operate as a merchant renewable power station the four biomass units located in the turbine hall at drax power station have a total capacity of 26 gw click to viewdownload 2 beccs the uks climate change committee ccc has set out what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding objective of being net zero by 2050 this includes an important role for beccs to remove co 2 from the atmosphere creating negative emissions beccs is the only largescale solution for negative emissions with renewable electricity and system support capabilities through combining beccs with its existing four biomass generation units at drax power station drax believes it could remove up to 16 million tonnes of co 2 per year  over two thirds of the cccs 2035 target for beccs in doing so drax aims to become a carbon negative company by 2030 the technology to deliver postcombustion beccs exists and is proven at scale in september 2020 drax commenced a trial of one such technology provided by mitsubishi heavy industries mhi in addition drax is developing innovative technology options including ccapture a partnership between leeds university drax ip group and bp which has developed an organic solvent which could be used for beccs innovation engineer inspects pilot carbon capture facility at drax power station click to viewdownload 3 third party biomass supply drax expects global demand for wood pellets to increase in the current decade as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes which recognise the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation whilst there is an abundance of unprocessed sustainable biomass material globally there remains limited capacity to convert these materials into energy dense pellets which have a lowcarbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation as a result drax expects the global market for biomass to remain under supplied drax is therefore exploring options to service biomass demand in europe north america and asia alongside the uk establishing a presence in these markets could offer the potential for longterm offtake agreements providing diversified revenues from other biomass markets trading update since publishing its half year results on 29 july 2020 the trading and operational performance of the group has remained robust in the usa the groups pellet production business is commissioning 100000 tonnes of new production capacity at its morehouse facility in louisiana as part of its previously announced plans to add 350000 tonnes across its three existing production sites by 2022 the project is part of the groups plan to expand its sustainable biomass supply chain and reduce costs the generation business has continued to perform well in the provision of system support services responding to both the low and high demand needs of the uk electricity system in addition to the successful completion of a major planned outage and upgrade of a biomass unit at drax power station the group has progressed its earlier stage development work on beccs alongside the commencement of a solvent trial with mhi drax has awarded prefeed front end engineering design contracts and expects to incur incremental operating costs associated with the development of a full feed study during 2021 at its half year results in july 2020 drax noted that further lockdown measures in the uk in the second half of 2020 could create a small downside risk on the performance of the customers business principally in the sme 8 market drax is continuing to assess operational and strategic options for this part of the group the groups expectations for 2020 adjusted ebitda remain in line with market expectations 9  inclusive of the impact of covid19 principally in relation to its customers business

was due to mature in 2021 and provides increased liquidity enabling the full facility to be drawn as cash the previous facility restricted cash drawn to support liquidity to 165 million the esg rcf is currently undrawn for cash in addition to the esg rcf the group has agreed new infrastructure facilities 213 million and a euro denominated bond issue 250 million which replace an existing rcf sterling bond and esg termloan reducing the groups overall cost of debt and extending its maturity profile to 2030 as at 30 november 2020 drax had adjusted cash and total committed facilities of 643 million capital allocation and dividend the group remains committed to its capital allocation policy through which it aims to maintain a strong balance sheet invest in the core business pay a sustainable and growing dividend and return surplus capital beyond investment requirements subject to the continued good operational performance and overall impact from covid19 remaining in line with
