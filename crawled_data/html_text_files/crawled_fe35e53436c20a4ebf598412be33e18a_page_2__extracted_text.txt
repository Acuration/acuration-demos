britains electricity system is in the middle of a revolution where power supply was once dominated by some big thermal coal gas and nuclear power stations  it now comes from an array of sources thousands of new individual points have been added to the mix ranging from large interconnectors that bring in power from neighbouring countries through to wind farms solar panels small gas and diesel engines the energy mix has been changing radically with low carbon sources expected to provide 58 of great britains power by 2020  up from 22 in 2010 and 53 in 2018  however the security standards at which the electricity grid needs to be operated remain the same these are predominantly voltage and frequency and nominally 230 v and 50hz for a domestic consumer the operation of the transmission system including maintaining these standards is overseen by the national grid electricity system operator eso using a set of vital tools it needs to have available known as ancillary services some of this capability was inherent in large generators which could provide the ancillary services required to keep a stable transmission system maintaining system stability with thousands of generation points  a large part of which are not directly controllable  is increasingly challenging click graphic to viewdownload ancillary services enable electricity to reach the end customer when and where it is required in a safe manner within acceptable quality standards in addition to managing voltage and frequency levels these standards also include maintaining adequate reserves to accommodate demand forecast uncertainties generator breakdown and system faults 1 as the electricity mix changes so must the process by which these services are secured a diverse set of existing and genuinely new solutions will be needed to keep the lights on in the net zero carbon future three steps to creating the right environment for a stable resilient future grid 1 make the value of ancillary services transparent in order for companies to help the eso be they generators or other service providers it must be open and transparent about whats needed to maintain grid stability and build resilience for the future the eso is the only buyer in the ancillary services market and is wellpositioned to understand how the system is evolving it should be proactively flagging how its needs may evolve in the future so that the market can develop solutions to meet them says marcelo torres draxs regulation manager  markets certain ancillary services still dont have their own competitive markets and are provided as a byproduct of the generation of electricity an example is reactive power  for which there are no developed functioning regional markets yet generally all power stations connected to the transmission network with a generation capacity of over 50mw are required to have the capability to provide this service at a default price that may not reflect its real value to the system another example is inertia  provided today largely through the heavy spinning turbines of thermal and pumpedstorage hydro stations which serve as stored energy that can slow down or smooth out sudden changes in network frequency if ancillary services were valued explicitly market participants would have an insight into how much they are actually worth to the eso and the grids stability which would in turn incentivise new competitive products to reach the market torres points to technologies such as synchronous compensators  which are machines capable of providing ancillary services including inertia and reactive power without generating potentially unneeded electricity click graphic to viewdownload these solutions will enable more renewables to connect safely to the network at a lower cost to consumers for these solutions to come forward ascribing the right value to ancillary services will be key without clear price signals there is a risk of underinvestment in those technologies that provide the services needed potentially resulting in price shocks for consumers the eso is moving in the right direction with its recent network development pathfinder projects it has accelerated this work launching its first ever tender for inertia and should roll out similar initiatives gbwide such procurements should align with existing investment signals such as those provided by the capacity market  this should allow for the right type of capacity to be built where it is most needed delivering a secure and resilient grid 2 create market confidence constructing the machinery and infrastructure that will enable the eso to operate a carbonfree system will require major financial investment as well as years to plan and build says torres this can only be achieved if ofgem designs the esos incentives in a way that rewards it for taking bold strategic initiatives that have the potential to deliver good value for money to consumers in the longterm evidence of this working is shown in the success of offshore wind which now provide around a sixth of great britains electricity at record low prices this is partly due to the government providing offshore wind developers with revenue stabilisation mechanisms known as  contracts for difference  cfds this is not a new concept for government and regulators around the world looking to enable investment in energy infrastructure financing renewables to achieve decarbonisation is enabled through cfds or marketled hedging tools like power purchase agreements  investment to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet peak demand is secured through longterm contracts competitively awarded through the capacity market similarly investment in interconnection is supported through ofgems cap  floor regime subsidy isnt required for investment in ancillary services whats needed says torres is a clear and stable market framework designed around the systems needs which provides a mix of short and longterm signals more certainty over the market landscape and the expected returns will lower the risk of these investments and get the solutions needed at a lower overall cost to consumers longterm procurement is not the right answer everywhere where there is already a mature and liquid market such as the case for frequency response buying services closer to real time makes sense for two reasons first it allows prices to reflect more accurately the market conditions and therefore the real value of a service at the time when it is needed second it allows a wider range of resources to participate in the market increasing competition striking the right balance between short and longterm procurement is key to create a sustainable ancillary services market currently the eso requests that electricitygeneration firms commit to supplying a certain amount of power for the purpose of frequency response a month ahead of time for resources such as wind farms or solar which are dependent on the weather this makes it extremely difficult for them to enter this market even for conventional large thermal generators it can be a problem as many of them do not know how or if they will be running beyond a few days the eso is currently conducting some trials procuring frequency response one week in advance while this is an improvement it is still too long a lead time for intermittent sources or demandside response which ideally need dayahead or almost real time auctions to unlock their full potential says torres the ancillary services market has been through a prolonged period of change since the eso published its system needs and product strategy in 2017  without knowing how the market landscape will look like by the end of these reforms its difficult for providers to develop the right solutions a shift in thinking which considers what the electricity network might require in the future  and how to provide the market with financial incentives to make it a reality is needed a resilient stable future system is to the advantage of consumers 3 diversify there will be no silver bullet that can solve all the challenges the energy transition poses maintaining system reliability in a high renewables world will require large amounts of dispatchable power with different response time and duration from small batteries and demandside response that will manage instantaneously frequency fluctuations  through to large pumped storage hydro plants that will provide backup power during the days when the wind wont blow and the sun wont shine a framework structured around the systems different needs should aim at harnessing flexibility across a range of technologies and sizes source the road to 2050 the need for flexibility in a high renewables world  by ana barillas aurora 2019 truly diversifying will also involve unlocking the flexibility potential on the distribution grid to achieve this the way that access to the distribution network is managed and paid for will need to evolve today with big parts of the distribution network being congested small flexible assets are asked to wait in the queue for several years or face disproportionate amount of network reinforcement costs to get connected machine hall cruachan power station the ongoing review of the network access and forwardlooking charging arrangements needs to address these barriers soon if we are serious about making use of flexibility to foster the energy transition while keeping consumer bills as low as possible since 2018 gbs distribution network operators dnos have been tendering and procuring for various flexibility services to manage congestion in regional electricity grids in 2019 they published a roadmap setting out the steps they intend to take to enable a smarter and more flexible energy system as we transition from dnos towards distribution system operation  a wider set of functions and services to run a smart distribution grid  the regional networks will be open to marketbased flexibility solutions dsos will be able to compete on a level playing field offering options for network reinforcement as dnos move from trials to more structured flexibility procurement harmonisation and effective coordination with the national markets will be the key prerequisites to reveal the true value that flexibility can bring to the energy system argues torres to build a modern and resilient grid we will need a wider lens on whats possible its going to be an exciting journey on the road to net zero this story is part of a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the

power station  electric vehicles evs  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  flexibility and stability and power system security  investors  national grid  power station  smart grid in energy storage timing is everything 21 august 2019 power generation electricity is unlike any other resource the amount being generated must exactly match demand for it around the clock managing this delicate balancing act is the job of the national grid electricity system operator eso which works constantly to ensure supply meets demand and the grid remains balanced  one of the ways it does this is by storing energy when there is too much and deploying it when there is too little although there are many different ways of storing energy at a small scale at grid level it becomes more difficult one of the few ways it is currently possible is through pumped hydro storage cruachan power station in the highlands of scotland is one of four pumped storage facilities in great britain it uses electricallydriven turbines to pump water up a mountain into a reservoir when there is excess electricity on the grid and then releases the water stored in the reservoir back down to spin the same turbines to generate power when its needed quickly the dual capabilities of these turbines are unique to pumped hydro storage and contribute to the overall grids stability however what dictates when cruachans turbines switch from pump to generate and vice versa is all a matter of what the grid needs  and when the switch from pump to generate while the machine hall of cruachan power station is an aweinspiring place for its size and location 396 metres beneath ben cruachan it generates electricity much like any other hydropower station harnessing the flow of water to rotate any number of its four 100 megawatt mw turbines this mode  simply called generate mode  is usually employed during periods of peak power demand such as mornings and evenings during a major national televised event  or when wind and solar energy output drops below forecast as a result starting up and generating millions of watts of electricity has to be fast it takes just two minutes for a turbine to run up from rest to generate mode says martin mcghie operations and maintenance manager at the power station it takes slightly longer for the turbines to run down from generate to rest but whatever function the turbines are performing they can reach it within a matter of minutes the reverse of generate mode is pump mode which changes the direction of travel for the water this time using electricity from the grid to pump water from the vast loch awe at the foot of ben cruachan to the upper reservoir where it waits ready to be released in contrast to generate mode pump mode typically comes into play at times when demand is low and there is too much power on the system such as during nights or at weekends when there is excessive wind generation  however the grid has evolved since cruachan first began generating in 1965 and this has changed when it and how it operates in the early days cruachan was used in a rather predictable way pumping overnight to absorb excess generation from coal and nuclear plants and generating during daytime peak periods says martin the move to more renewable energy sources like wind mean overall power generation is more unpredictable he continues there has also been a move from cruachan being primarily an energy storage plant to one which can also offer a range of ancillary services to the grid system operator the benefits of spin mode in between pumping water and generating power cruachans turbines can also spin in air while connected to the grid neither pumping not generating this is essentially a standby mode where the turbines are ready to either quickly switch into generation or pumping at a moments notice they spin one way for spin pump the other for spin generate these spin modes are requested by the eso to ensure reserve energy is available to respond rapidly to changes on the grid system in spin generate mode the generator is connected up to the grid but the water is ejected from the space around the turbine by injecting compressed air the turbine does not generate power but is kept spinning allowing it to quickly start up again as soon as the grid has an urgent need for power the air is released and the water from the upper reservoir flows into the turbine to begin generation in under 30 seconds spin pump works on the same basis as spin generate but with the turbine rotating in the opposite direction ready to pump at short notice this allows cruachan to absorb excess generation and balance the system as soon as the eso needs it the use of spin mode by the eso is highly variable and dependant on a number of factors eg weather conditions or the state of the grid system at the time says martin this unpredictability of the increasingly intermittent electricity system makes the flexibility of cruachans multiple turbines all the more important ready for the future grid its not only the types of electricity generation around the system that are changing how cruachan operates martin suggests that the way energy traders and the eso use cruachan will continue to evolve as the market requirements and opportunities change technology is also changing the market and martin predicts this could affect what cruachan does in the future we will face competition from alternative storage technologies such as batteries electric vehicles  as well as competition for the other ancillary services we offer however cruachans flexibility to generate absorb or spin in readiness means it is prepared to adjust to any future changes cruachan is always ready to modify or upgrade to meet requirements as we have done in the past says martin the priority is always to be able to deliver the services required by the grid system operator  in characteristic quick time visit cruachan  the hollow mountain to take the power station

jonathan kini ceo customers 1 february 2019 opinion think of the phrase 3d and may people instantly think of video games television or cinema along with the special glasses you needed to watch it but another form of 3d is i believe going to be at the heart of the energy revolution which is rapidly gathering place the three ds in this case are data diversification and decarbonisation together they will transform the way businesses buy use and sell their energy help companies take control of their energy use and save money and also play a key part in our journey towards a zero carbon lower cost energy future were already seeing some real innovations in the energy sector our trial of a storage battery with a customer of opus energy is an example offering a farming business in northampton the chance to sell stored energy generated by solar panels back to the grid at times of peak demand  a potential new revenue stream but other innovations and advances will maintain the pace of change and data will be at the core of this now the new generation of smart meters are being installed in businesses  revolutionising customer relationships with their energy suppliers the data from the new meters will finally give customers insight into where and when they use energy suppliers will have to work much more closely with customers to help them access new opportunities for cost savings access to new markets and even new revenue streams an example would be a restaurant with the data smart meters will provide the restaurants supplier will be able to tell the owners how their energy use compares to the local competition and where improvements can be made the detail could go as far as identifying whether the restaurants equipment is older and less efficient whether rivals have installed newer kit or whether other businesses are switching off their equipment earlier or using it at different cheaper times using energy during the peak weekday morning and early evening hours is often the most expensive time to do so data will give businesses the insight into how they can use energy more efficiently and when they use it offering them the chance to avoid buying at peak times whenever possible and driving efficiencies this is why haven powers trading team is now working closely with gridbeyond  the partnership allows our customers to trade the power they produce as well as optimise their operations to help balance the grid at times of peak demand the really smart thing is that in doing so customers are reducing their energy costs and making their operations more sustainable trading desks at haven powers ipswich hq the way demand changes and is managed by businesses and consumers on a diversified power system will also be key the business energy sector is already diversifying as many customers are able to generate and store their own power but the next step is for more customers to be paid to reduce their usage at peak times think of a busy time for the national grid  half time in the fa cup final or after the results in strictly come dancing previously the grid would have to pay a power station to ramp up generation to meet demand but these days customers are paid to reduce demand for 30 minutes or so  in effect becoming a huge virtual power station  this has happened for some time of course with larger industrial customers but now smaller companies can benefit from this too thanks to the data and insight they will have from their smart meters this empowers customers and puts them not the energy companies in control of the key decisions about their energy a close advisory relationship between energy suppliers and their customers will become ever more important to make sure business can choose to avoid the high demand periods and maximises use during the lower cheaper times in fact i can see a time when customers will end up paying more for insight and advice than they do for the power they buy  and theyll save money overall in doing so and if we get all this right it will help drive one of the most important of the three ds  decarbonisation sustainability is increasingly becoming a primary focus for businesses and demand for renewable energy is growing because it is now costeffective that will help us in our drive towards a zero carbon future as more and more renewable energy comes onstream though the uk will continue to need power generated from more flexible assets as well so there are huge opportunities out there to transform our energy landscape but they have to be viewed positively the smart metering programme can be viewed as a regulatory burden or it can be seen as an opportunity we take the positive view likewise batteries were once the preserve of massive companies only but now as technology develops they are becoming available for smaller firms too the more we can innovative on a larger scale the more the technology will work its way into smaller markets too adding momentum to the energy revolution the opportunities are huge if we get it right so too will be the benefits to one of the biggest priorities of all  the work to decarbonise the uk and create the lower carbon future we all

homes and properties across lancaster were plunged into darkness storm desmond had unleashed torrents of rain on great britain causing rivers to swell and spill over with waters rising to unprecedented levels the river lune began threatening to flood lancasters main electricity substation the facility where transformers step down electricitys voltage from the transmission system so it can be distributed safely around the local area to prevent unrepairable damage the decision was taken to switch the substation off cutting all power across the region lights phones internet connections and atms all went dead across the city it would take three days of intensive work before power was restored it was a bigger power outage than most but it offers a unique glimpse into the mechanisms behind a blackout  not only how theyre dealt with but how theyre caused what causes blackouts in great britain flooded electricity sub station in lancaster sunday 6 december 2015 when the lights go out a common thought is that the country has run out of electricity however a lack of electricity generation is almost never the cause of outages only during the miners strikes of 1972 were major power cuts the result of lack of electricity production rather than meeting electricity demand power cuts in great britain are more often the result of disruption to the transmission system caused by unpredictable weather if trees or piles of snow bring down one power line the load of electric current shifts to other lines  if this sudden jump in load is too much for the other lines they automatically trip offline to prevent damage to the equipment this in turn shifts the load on to other lines which also then trip potentially causing cascading outages across the network last marchs beast from the east  which brought six days of near subzero temperatures deep snow and high winds to great britain is an example of extreme weather cutting electricity to as many as 18000 people  highwinds brought trees and branches down onto powerlines while ice and snow impacted the millions of components that make up the electricity system engineering teams had to fight the elements and make the repairs needed to get electricity flowing again lancaster was different however with the slow creep of rising rainwater approaching the substation the threat of long lasting damage was plain to see in advance and so rather than waiting for it to autotrip authorities chose to manually shut it down getting reconnected an emergency generator brought from london is reversed into position adjacent to the sub station in bold street morecambe near lancaster monday 7 december 2015 electricity north west is lancasters network operator and after shutting down the substation it began the intensive job of trying to restore power on monday 7 december two days after the storm hit the first step of pumping the flooded substation empty of water had finally been completed and the task of reconnecting it began to begin restoring power to the region 75 large mobile generators were brought from as far away as the west country and northern ireland and hooked up to the substation allowing 22000 customers to be reconnected once partial power was restored the next challenge lay in repairing and reconnecting the substation to the transmission network while shutting the facility had prevented catastrophic damage some of the crucial pieces had to be completely replaced or rebuilt after three days of intensive engineering work the remaining 40000 properties that had lost power were reconnected preventing blackouts in a changing system the cause and scale of lancasters outage were unusual for great britains electricity system but it does highlight how quickly a power cut may arise in a time of transition when the grid is decarbonising and the network is facing more extreme weather conditions because of climate change it could create even more new challenges coal is scheduled to be taken entirely off the system after 2025 making the country more reliant on weatherdependent sources such as wind and solar  potentially increasing the volatility of the system on the other hand growing decentralised electricity generation may reduce the number of individual buildings affected by outages in the future solar generation and storage systems present on domestic and commercial property may also reduce dependency on local transmission systems and the impact of disruptions to it the cables and poles that connect the transmission system will always be vulnerable to faults and disruptions however by preparing for the future grid great britain can reduce the impact of storms on the electricity system if youre experiencing a power cut in your area please call the tollfree number 105 in england scotland and wales to reach your local network operator tags electricity  electricity generation  national grid  power station  technology balancing for the renewable future 6 july 2018 power generation its not news to say great britains electricity system is changing low carbon electricity sources are on course to go from 22 of national generation in 2010 to 58 by 2020 as installation of wind and solar systems continue to grow but while there has been much change in the sources fuelling electricity generation the system itself is still adapting to this transformation when the national grid was first established in the 1920s it was designed with coal and big spinning turbines in mind it meant that just about every megawatt coming onto the system was generated by thermal power plants as a result the mechanisms keeping the entire system stable  from the way frequency and voltage is managed to how to start up the country after a mass black out  relied on the same technology these ancillary services  those that stabilise the system  are crucial to maintaining a balanced electricity system ancillary services are needed to make sure demand is met by generation and that generation gets from one place to the next with no interruptions explains ian foy head of ancillary services at drax because whats important is that all demand must be met instantaneously in todays power system however weather dependent technology like offshore wind and home solar panels are increasingly making up the countrys electricity generation their intermittency or variability is in turn impacting both the stability of the grid and how ancillary services are provided running a large power system with as much as 85 intermittent generation  for example on a very windy clear sunny day  is thought to be achievable it isnt a scenario anticipated for the large island of great britain but to deal with the fastpace of change on its power system which recently managed to briefly achieve 47 wind in its fuel mix  there is a need to develop new techniques technologies and ways of working to change how the countrys grid is balanced new storage tech takes on balancing services one of the technologies thats expected to provide an increasing amount of balancing services is gridscale batteries  one stabilisation function offered by batteries and other electricity storage options is to provide reserve at times when demand peaks or troughs this matches electricity demand and generation combined with their ability to respond quickly to changes in frequency batteries can be a significant source of frequency response batteries can also absorb and generate reactive power  which can then be deployed to push voltage up or down when it starts to creep too far from the 400kv or 275kv target depending on the powerlines the electricity is travelling along needed to safely move electricity around the grid the challenge with batteries is that the quantity of megawatt hours mwh required to compensate for intermittency is very large the difference between the peak and trough on any day may be more than 20 gw for several hours see for yourself at electric insights  the significant price reductions in battery storage apply to technologies with short duration or low volume mwhs these are the technologies which have been developed at scale recently but will probably struggle to make up in any large quantity any shortfalls in generation resulting from prolonged periods of low intermittent generation a challenge currently being addressed relates to maintenance of battery state of charge this is a consequence of battery storage having a cycle efficiency of less than 100 this means that losses from continuous charging and recharging will have to be replenished from the available generation to avoid batteries going empty and being unavailable for grid services ultralow carbon advances rather than relying on batteries to provide ancillary services to support intermittent generation technical advancements are allowing the wind and solar facilities  which are generating more and more of the countrys electricity  to do so themselves the traditional photovoltaic pv inverters found on solar arrays were initially designed to push out as much active or real power as possible however new smart pv inverters are capable of providing or absorbing reactive power when it is needed to help control voltage as well as continuing to provide active power the major advantage of smart inverters is the limited equipment update required to existing solar farms to allow them to offer reactive power control the challenge here is that pv is embedded in distribution systems and therefore reactive services they provide may not cure all the problems on the transmission system similarly existing wind installations have traditionally focused on getting the greatest amount of megawatts from the available resources but with fewer thermal power stations on the grid ways of balancing the system with wind turbines are also being developed inertia is the force that comes from heavy spinning generators and acts as a damper on the system to limit the rate of change of frequency fluctuations while wind turbines have massive rotating equipment they are not connected to the grid in a way that they automatically provide inertia however research is exploring whats known as inertial response emulation that may allow wind turbines to offer faster frequency response this works through an algorithm that measures grid frequency and controls the power output of a wind turbine or whole farm to compensate for frequency deviations or quickly provide increases or decreases in power on the system inertial response emulation cannot be a complete substitute for inertia but can reduce the minimum required inertia on the system even in a future where the majority of the countrys electricity comes from renewable sources thermal generators may still be able to provide benefits to the system by running in synchronous compensation mode ie producing or consuming reactive power without real power however what is vitally important for the future of balancing services in great britain is a healthy transparent and investable market for generators demand side response and storage whether connected on the transmission or distribution networks a market for the future grid one of the primary needs of balancing service providers is greater transparency into how national grid procures and pays for services currently national grid does not pay for inertia with it becoming more important to grid stability incentive is needed to encourage generators with the capability to provide it those technologies that cant provide inertia could be encouraged to research and develop ways they could do so in the future standardising the services needed will help ensure providers deliver balancing products to the same level needed to support the grid it would also benefit from fixed requirements and timings for such services bundling related products such as reserve and frequency control and active power and voltage management will also offer operational and cost efficiencies to the providers driving investment in balancing services for the future ultimately requires the availability of longerterm contracts to offer financial certainty for the providers and their investors bridge to the future click to view larger graphic for the challenges of decarbonisation to be met in a socially responsible way great britains power system must be operated at as low a cost as possible to consumers with new technologies almost anything could be possible but operating them has to be affordable in many cases

national grid joined at the volts what role will interconnectors play in great britains electricity future 14 june 2018 power generation for more than 50 years great britain has been electrically connected to europe the first undersea interconnector between british shores and the continent was installed in 1961 and could transmit 160 megawatts mw of power today there is 4 gigawatts gw in interconnector capacity between great britain france ireland and the netherlands  and theres more on the way by the mid2020s some estimates suggest interconnector capacity will reach 18 gw thanks to new connections with germany denmark and norway the government expects imports to account for 22 of electricity supply by 2025 up from 6 in 2017  this increased connectivity is often held up as a means of securing electricity supply and while this is largely true it doesnt tell the full story in fact this plan could risk creating a dependency on imported electricity at a time when flexibility and diversity of power sources are key to meeting demand in an increasingly decentralised  decarbonising system great britain needs to be connected and have a close relationship with its european neighbours but this should not come at the expense of its power supply power price or ongoing decarbonisation efforts yet these are all at risk with too great a reliance on interconnection to secure a long term stable power system tomorrow these issues need to be addressed today unfair advantage at their simplest interconnectors are good for the power system they connect the relatively small british isles to a significant network of electricity generators and consumers this is good for both helping secure supply and for broadening the market for domestic power but the system in which interconnectors operate isnt working since 2015 interconnectors have had the right to bid against domestic generators in the governments capacity market auctions the government uses these auctions to award contracts to generators that can provide electricity to the grid through existing or proposed facilities the original intention was also to allow foreign generators to participate as an interim step the transmission equipment used to supply foreign generators power into the gb market  interconnectors  have been allowed to take part in practice interconnectors end up with an economic advantage over other electricity producers firstly interconnectors are not required to pay to use the national transmission system like domestic generators are this charge is paid to national grid to cover the cost of installation and maintenance of the substations pylons poles and cables that make up the transmission network plus the cost of system support services keeping the grid stable  interconnectors are exempt from paying these despite the fact imported electricity must be transported and balanced within england scotland and wales in the same way as domestic electricity secondly interconnectors dont pay carbon tax in the gb energy market the carbon price floor is one of the cornerstones of great britains decarbonisation efforts and has enabled the countrys electricity system to become the seventh least carbonintense of the worlds most power intensive systems in 2016 up from 20 th in 2012 interconnectors themselves do not emit carbon dioxide co 2  in great britain but this does not mean they are emissionfree frances baseload electricity comes largely from its lowcarbon nuclear fleet but the netherlands and ireland are still largely dependent on fossil fuels for power because the european grid is so interconnected even countries which dont yet have a direct link to great britain such as germany with its high carbon lignite power stations also contribute to the european grids supply the neuconnect link is planned to connect germany and gb in the late 2020s not being subject to the uks carbon tax  only to the european unions emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on co 2  imported power can be offered cheaper than domestic lowercarbon power this not only puts great britain at risk of importing higher carbon electricity in some cases but also exporting carbon emissions to our neighbours when their power price is higher to that in the gb market this prevents domestic generators from winning contracts to add capacity or develop new projects that would secure a longerterm stable future for great britain in fact introducing more interconnectivity could in some cases end up leading to supply shortages be they natural or market induced under peak pressure the contracts awarded to interconnectors in the capacity market auctions treat purchased electricity as guaranteed but any power station can break down  any intermittent renewable can stop generating at short notice supply from neighbouring countries is just the same research by aurora found that historically interconnectors have often delivered less power than the system operator assumed they would and on occasion exported power at times of peak demand this happened recently during the beast of the east  when low temperatures across the continent drove electricity demand soaring this europeanwide cold spell meant ireland and france which has a largely electrified heating system experienced huge electricity demand spikes driving power prices up as a result for much of the time between 27 and 28 february great britain exported electricity to france to capitalise on its high prices this not only led to more fossil fuels being burned domestically but it meant less power was available domestically at a time when our own demand was exceptionally high even when the interconnectors do flow in our direction they cannot provide crucial grid services like inertia so our large thermal power stations are often still needed it is difficult to say for certain how interconnectors will function during times of high demand in the future due to a lack of longterm data but that which we do know and have seen suggests they dont always play to the countrys best interests there is still an important role for interconnectors on the great britain grid but to deliver genuine value the system needs to be fairer so they dont skew the market where interconnectors fit into the future interconnectors bring multiple benefits to our power system they can help with security of supply by bringing in more power at times of systems stress with the right system in place they can help reduce the need to rely on domestic fossil fuels and enable more renewable installation and if electricity is being generated cheaper abroad they can also create opportunities to reduce costs for consumers however the correct framework must be put in place for interconnectors to bring such benefits while allowing for domestic projects that can help secure the countrys electricity supply as a start interconnectors should be reclassified  known as derating  to compete with technologies on an equal footing draxs proposed ocgt plants which can very quickly start up and provide the grid with the power and balancing services it needs  before switching off again could offer a more reliable route to grid stability than such overwhelming dependence on interconnectors will in addition the coaltogas and battery plans at drax power station would prove to be a highly flexible national asset new gas and interconnectors should be able to compete fairly with one another policymakers should facilitate a system that allows competing technologies to exist in a cost beneficial way both interconnectors and domestic thermal power generators can play their part in creating stability transitioning towards a decarbonised economy and fitting within the uks industrial strategy in 1961 when the first interconnector was switched on it marked a new age of continental cooperation five decades on we should not forget this goal in an ever more complex grid what we need is different technologies systems and countries working together to achieve a flexible stable and cleaner power system for everyone tags decarbonisation

recognisable and perhaps divisive symbols of great britains electricity system there are plenty who decry these metal giants as blotches strung across the countrys green and pleasant landscape but time has turned the 1930s designs of great britains pylons into something of a modernist classic even beloved by some  what pylons symbolise however is more than just the modernisation of the country in the first half of the 20 th century they also represent the promise of safe and reliable electricity for all there are now more than 90000 pylons across great britain and while the energy system continues to evolve pylons have changed little since they first went up outside edinburgh in the 1920s miesbach to munich the first successful attempt to transmit electricity over long distances using overhead wires took place in 1882 german engineer oskar von miller and his french colleague marcel deprez successfully transmitted 25 kilowatts of electricity 57km along a telegraph line the simple iron line transmitted a 200 volt current from a steam enginepowered generator near miesbach to the glass palace of munich where it was used to power the motor for an artificial waterfall the line failed a few days later and even though it may be a world away from todays 800000 volt ultrahigh voltage transmission lines this first trial laid the foundation for the way we move energy today egypt to edinburgh jump to 1928 and there was something new arising on edinburghs horizon the first grid tower was erected here on july 14 th as part of the recently established central electricity boards ambitious project to create a national gridiron  connecting 122 of great britains most efficient power stations to consumers was a mission that required 4000 miles of cables mostly overhead sir reginald blomfield was called in to tackle this grand challenge blomfield adopted a design submitted by the american firm milliken brothers for the grid towers that would crisscross the country a staunch antimodernist  as he made clear in modernismus his attack on modern architecture  blomfield looked to ancient egypt to name his steel towers in egyptology a pylon is a gateway with two monumental towers either side of it  these represented two hills between which the sun rose and set with rituals to the sun god ra often carried out on the structures it was an epic name to match the grand ambitions of creating a national grid by september 1933 the last of the initial 26000 pylons that made up the national grid were installed  less than a third of the 90000 that make up the system today the grid was now ready to operate on time and on budget around the world to underground as the energy system continues to evolve great britains pylons are changing too in 2015 the national grid unveiled a new danishdesigned pylon that shifts away from the classic industrial tower to a tframed skilift style model designed to minimise the visual impact of the pylons on the landscape another approach also being adopted is burying cables underground the process of digging tracts and burying cables for thousands of miles could cost as much as 500 million but could help preserve areas of natural beauty while ensuring the whole country has access to the safe and reliable electricity it has come to expect as with all change these announcements have caused a surge in nostalgia for the pylon remembered from childhood car journeys across the country around the globe electricity pylons are now ubiquitous and are being pushed to new technological limits in 1993 greenland became home to the longest stretch of overhead powerline between pylons in the ameralik span  while chinas zhoushan island overhead powerline tie set the record for the worlds tallest pylons in 2010 with two 370meter towers despite the advancements its notable how little these structures have changed from the those first installed around the world the proposed humanoid sculptures of icelandic architecture firm choishine bare a resemblance to the original skeletal towers of the 30s and it shows just how successful those original pylons have been at delivering muchneeded electricity to homes and businesses around the country tags national grid  technology going off grid the companies generating their own energy 11 january 2018 power generation the residents of cupertino california are getting used to their new spaceaged neighbour in this silicon valley city a sleek doughnutshaped flying saucer sits on a hillside overlooking the population but this is no extraterrestrial this is the new home of cupertinos mostfamous inhabitant apple the socalled apple campus 2 spaceship has caused a stir since it opened this year with its abundance of trees 100000 squarefoot wellness centre revolutionary chairs and specially designed pizza boxes  it aims to be as the late steve jobs declared it the best office building in the world but theres also something interesting going on outside the building where women and men think up the next iphone around the 175acre campus sits 805000 squarefeet of solar arrays the 17 megawatts mw of solar panels on the spaceships roof and 4 mw of fuel cell storage will provide 75 of the buildings daytime electricity with the rest coming from a nearby 130 mw solar farm the aim is to not only power operations with renewable energy but to do so with selfgenerated renewable energy  and apple arent alone in this endeavour driven by a need to operate more cleanly and enabled by increasingly accessible renewable energy technologies many companies are now pursuing their own energy independence could we soon see the first entirely offgrid multinational going off grid think of ikea and you might think of long afternoons wrestling woodwork and allen keys  what you dont think of is wind turbines however the swedish retailer which boasts 355 locations across 29 countries recently saw the number of wind turbines it owns exceed the number of stores  by 2020 it aims to generate more renewable energy than it uses worldwide  something its already achieved in the nordics and canada  ikea isnt the only retailer exploring innovative energy models us shopping and leisure mall giants target and walmart which count almost 7000 locations between them are also looking to selfgenerate renewable energy at mass scale making use of the space available at their massive stores the retailers are looking to rooftop solar systems to power their efforts to reach 100 renewable energy at the end of last year target was the us leading corporate solar installer with 1475 mw of capacity  followed by walmart with 145 mw unsurprisingly the tech industry is making a big push towards selfsupply or sourcing power from 100 renewable generators this is largely down to just how much electricity they use particularly when it comes to things like data centres estimated by some to become the largest users of electrical power on the planet by the 2020s datacentres house hundreds of rows of servers that remotely store and process internet and mobile data from around the world they are the physical footprint of our digital cloud computing age and already theyre estimated to use roughly 3 of the global electricity supply  one big user of datacentres  crypto currency blockchain  is projected by 2020 to use about the same amount of power each year as denmark  microsoft has tackled its datacentre demand by both developing inhouse generation capabilities and by partnering with local utilities suppliers to source renewable energy for their centres not only does this make operations cleaner but the independence can also increase the reliability of their power supplies which are often backed up by batteries  there are other obvious benefits for companies going energyindependent  one being the pr boost but there is also a significant bottom line benefit even for partly selfgenerating organisations in the first half of 2017 thames water cut 12 million from its annual energy bills by producing 23 of its own electricity while solar and wind made up part of this the water management company generated much of the 146 gwh it produced through biogas made from its own sewage management facilities the power it didnt generate itself was sourced from haven power in the form of renewable biomass electricity what it means for the grid the cynical view may be one that says energy independence is a further step towards entirely independent and unregulated multinationals but there are signs it can benefit the wider population too some selfgeneration operations can feed electricity back into the grid serving as a backup resource at times of high demand this idea of prosuming both producing and consuming electricity is growing outside of big businesses in the residential space  with the rise of electric vehicles and their potential to store and feed power back to the grid it is one likely to grow even further and big companies are taking note microsoft points to its cheyenne wyomingbased data centre as an example of this local utility black hills energy which it has partnered with to source renewable power has the ability to draw from the datacentres normally dormant backup generators in times of need in the uk this is happening on a smaller scale hamerton zoo park in cambridgeshire generates its own onsite wind solar and biomass power making it the most environmentally friendly zoo in europe  excess power not used on site is then sold back to the grid through opus energy  generating extra revenue for the zoo and contributing to overall grid supply even with growing numbers of prosuming and energyindependent companies however there will still be a need for gridstabilising services provided by large scale generators companies perform well when they focus on their core business partnering with energy suppliers to help them manage their electricity  including their selfgenerated power  can make sense but what increasing levels of distributed renewable energy generation offers is the potential to reduce usage of fossil fuels at a countrywide level coordinating the give and take of this energy across the entire system will take significant effort but smart technologies and improving storage will help grids and energyindependent companies work together to make the whole system cleaner tags energy
