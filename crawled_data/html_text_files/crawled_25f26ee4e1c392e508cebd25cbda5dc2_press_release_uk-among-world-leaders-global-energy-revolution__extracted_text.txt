among world leaders in global energy revolution new report launched at cop24 5 december 2018 the uk ranks 2 nd in a global league of countries using technologies to limit climate change uk phase out of coal has been faster than any other country in the world cutting the carbon emissions from its power system by more than twice as much as some other countries however the uk has no largescale carbon capture facilities which are critical to climate targets being achieved the uk is second only to denmark when it comes to implementing measures to mitigate climate change according to a new global energy revolution league table in the report energy revolution a global outlook  researchers from imperial college london have assessed 25 countries covering 80 of the worlds population launched today at the un climate change conference in katowice poland the report looks at each countrys performance across five metrics including clean power fossil fuels uptake and sales of electric vehicles capacity for carbon storage energy efficiency of households buildings and transport the uks carbon price  its charge on greenhouse gas emissions which is stronger than elsewhere in europe  has led to rapid deployment of renewables and the fastest phase out of coal power making for worldleading progress in reducing the carbon emissions from power generation whilst most countries have reduced the amount of carbon dioxide produced per kwh of electricity by 100g kwh over the last decade the figure in the uk is more than double that at 260gkwh uptake of electric vehicles is also among the highest in the uk which is home to the worlds 5 th largest electric vehicle fleet however progress in the uk is being hampered by the fact it lags behind on the provision of largescale carbon capture and storage ccs facilities needed to limit the harmful greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere the research was conducted by imperial college london and e4tech facilitated by imperial consultants and commissioned by drax group figure 1 ranking of country progress in the energy revolution responding to the findings will gardiner drax group ceo said our global economy is changing and the transition to zero carbon lower cost energy is vital if countries are to be able to compete at drax weve converted two thirds of our power station to use biomass instead of coal transforming the business to become europes biggest decarbonisation project and helping to make the phase out of coal in the uk the fastest in the world but we want to do more were piloting the first bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs project of its kind in europe  which could make drax the worlds first carbon negative power station removal of carbon from the atmosphere is vital if we are to meet our climate targets commenting on his teams findings imperials dr iain staffell said we researched how the world is progressing on uptake of the five key technologies and measures needed to limit climate change to 2 degrees celsius this reveals denmark uk and canada to be world leading progress across these five areas is very mixed great strides are being made in cleaning up global electricity generation and renewable capacity is increasing rapidly all around the world electric vehicles are also rapidly taking off but still have only reached a 5 share of new cars sold in two countries improving the efficiency of our homes and industries needs urgent effort significant investment in carbon capture and storage will also be needed if it is to contribute to limiting climate change as only 6 countries are currently demonstrating this technology at scale energy and clean growth minister claire perry said  this confirms the uks position as a world leader in decarbonising the economy  phasing out coal as we move to a greener cleaner energy system with record levels of energy from renewables we have also led the way in transitioning to low emission vehicles and today one in five electric vehicles sold in europe is manufactured here in the uk but were determined to do more to reduce our emissions thats why last week we published plans for the uks first carbon capture usage and storage project to be operational in the mid2020s with the ambition of potentially rolling out this cuttingedge technology at scale in 2030s  commenting on the findings alyssa gilbert director of policy and translation from imperials grantham institute said ahead of cop24 this research provides a useful barometer of the progress countries are making in their uptake of technologies such as renewable power carbon capture and storage electric vehicles and energy efficiency measures the findings also highlight the benefit of supportive government policies in limiting climate change to 2 degrees celsius calls for carbon capture and storage the uk lags behind on rollout of carbon capture and storage ccs technologies only norway canada australia usa brazil and china currently have facilities to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at scale and worldwide only 25 kg of co 2 per person per year is captured versus an average annual carbon footprint per person of 5 tonnes of co 2  storage resources are not the barrier to deployment the international energy agency estimates that 100 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide must be stored underground by 2060 to limit temperature rise to 2c for least cost usa alone has estimated storage capacity for over 100 trillion tonnes of carbon and the uk has capacity for 70 billion tonnes instead the barriers are political usa benefits from tax credits that have been in place since 2008 for geological storage of carbon and chinas last two five year plans have included specific goals to develop ccs with most estimates outlining that significant ccs deployment is needed to limit the impact of climate change the uk needs large scale deployment of the technology to remain a world leader in environmental progress wider report findings the uk and denmark lead global efforts to move away from coal for power generation but many asian countries including indonesia india and japan are increasing their reliance on fossil fuels the countries with the cleanest power systems  norway france and new zealand rely heavily on hydro or nuclear power the uk is home to the worlds 5th largest electric vehicle fleet and 1 in every 40 new cars sold in the uk is electric but norway leads by far in terms of uptake of electric vehicles with half of all its cars now electric norway also leads in installation of car charging points with one charger for every 500 people in the uk there is one charger for every 5000 people europe remains the global leader in energy efficient housing residential homes in portugal germany netherlands and the uk are among the most energy efficient by comparison rising incomes mean china and south africa are increasing their energy intensity the study shows that rising incomes across the bric economies are displacing public transport as populations with rising disposable incomes move towards private vehicles as a result china india and indonesia have increased their energy consumption per person in transport by over 50 over the last decade figure 2 current largescale carbon capture capacity in kgco 2 per person per year ends media contacts rachel adeyinka e email protected t 44 07940 177 999
