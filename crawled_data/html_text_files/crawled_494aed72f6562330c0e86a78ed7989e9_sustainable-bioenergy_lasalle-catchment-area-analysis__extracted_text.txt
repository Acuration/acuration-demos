reviewing evidence from forisk consulting 16 july 2020 sustainable bioenergy the wood supply catchment area for draxs lasalle bioenergy biomass pellet plant in midlouisiana is dominated by larger scale private forest owners that actively manage and invest in their forest for sawtimber production eightythree per cent 83 of the forest is in private ownership and 60 of this area is in corporate ownership the drax biomass pellet mill uses just 32 of the roundwood in the market and therefore has limited impact or influence on the overall trends by contrast the pulp and paper industry consumes 74 of the total pulpwood demand as the most dominant market for low grade fibre forest in lasalle catchment area the catchment area has seen an increase in total timberland area of 71 thousand hectares ha since 2008 this is primarily due to planting of previously nonstocked land hardwood areas have remained stable but planted pine has increased replacing some of the naturally regenerated mixed species areas the data below shows that deforestation or conversion from pure hardwood to pine is not occurring timberland area by management type the overall quantity of stored carbon or the inventory of the standing wood in the forest has increased by 7 or 326 million metric tonnes since 2008 this total is made up of a 49 million tonne increase in the quantity of pine and a 16 million tonne decline in the quantity of hardwood since the area of pure hardwood forest has remained stable this decline is likely to be due to the conversion of mixed stands to pure pine in order to increase sawtimber production and to provide a better return on investment for corporate owners historic area and timberland inventory forest in lasalle catchment area the growthtodrain ratio and the surplus of unharvested pine growth has been increasing yearonyear from two million tonnes in 2008 to over five million tonnes in 2016 this suggests that the lasalle bioenergy plant which almost exclusively utilises pine feedstocks has not had a negative impact on the growthtodrain ratio and the surplus of available biomass the latest data 2016 indicates that the ratio for pine pulpwood is 154 and for pine sawtimber 124 and that this has been increasing each year for both categories historic growth and removals by species stumpage prices for all product categories declined between 2010 and 2011 this was followed by a peak around 201516 with the recovery in demand postrecession and prices then stabilised from 2016 to 2019 the data indicates that there has been no adverse impact to pine pulpwood prices as a result of biomass demand in fact pine pulpwood prices are now nearly 20 lower than in 2014 as shown on the chart below lasalle bioenergy market historic stumpage prices usdtonne the character of the pine timberland is one of a maturing resource increasing in the average size of each tree the chart below chart shows a significant increase in the quantity of timber in the midrange size classes indicating a buildup of future resources for harvesting for both thinning and final felling for sawtimber production with balanced market demand the supply of fibre in this catchment area should remain plentiful and sustainable in the medium term historic pine inventory by dbh diameter at breast height class forisk summary of the impact of lasalle bioenergy on key trends and metrics in this catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused  deforestation no change in forest management practices no diversion from other markets possibly bioenergy plants compete with pulppaper and oriented strand board osb mills for pulpwood and residual feedstocks there is no evidence that these facilities reduced production as a result of bioenergy markets however increase in wood prices no there is no evidence that bioenergy demand increased stumpage prices in the market reduction in growing stock of timber no reduction in sequestration of carbon  growth rate no increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield no the impact of bioenergy on forest markets in the lasalle catchment is  growing stock neutral growth rates neutral forest area neutral wood prices neutral markets for solid wood neutral to positive access to viable residual markets benefits users of solid wood ie lumber producers forest in lasalle catchment area read the full
