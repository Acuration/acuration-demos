electric vehicles evs how electric planes could help clean up the skies 7 august 2019 electrification you probably havent heard the phrase flygskam before but you might have felt it the recently coined swedish term refers to the a shame or embarrassment caused by flying and its effect of the environment its not an uncommon feeling either with 23 of people in the country now claiming to have abstained from air travel in the past year to lessen their climate impact from electric cars to cleaner shipping  transport is undergoing dramatic change however aviation is proving more difficult to decarbonise than most forms of transportation as airports cargo and the number of passengers flying every day continues to expand the need to decarbonise air travel is more pressing than ever if aviation is to avoid becoming a barrier to climate action for other transport sectors facing a similar dilemma electrification has proved a key route forward could the electrification of aeroplanes be next the problem with planes aeroplanes still rely on fossil fuels to provide the huge amount of power needed for takeoff globally flights produced 859 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  in 2017  the aviation industry as a whole accounts for 2 of all emissions derived from human activity and 12 of all transport emissions despite growing awareness of the contribution co 2 emissions make to causing the climate change emergency estimates show global air traffic could quadruple by 2050  electrification of air travel presents the potential to drastically cut plane emissions while also offering other benefits electric planes could be 50 quieter with reduced aircraft noise pollution potentially enabling airports to operate around the clock and closer to cities electric planes could also be as much as 10 cheaper for airlines to operate by eliminating the massive expense of jet fuel and fewer moving parts making electric motors easier to maintain compared to traditional jets these cost savings for airlines could be passed on to passengers and businesses needing to move goods in the form of cheaper flights but while the benefits are obvious the pressing question is how feasible is it the race to electric planes start ups are now racing to develop electric planes that will reduce emissions  such ampaire and wright electric the latter has even partnered with easyjet to develop electric planes for shorthaul routes of around 335mile distances which make up a fifth of the budget carriers routes easyjet going electric source easyjetcom  easyjet has highlighted london to amsterdam as a key route they hope wright electrics planes will operate with potential for other zeroemission flights between london and belfast dublin paris and brussels the partners aim to have an electric passenger jets on the tarmac by 2027  ahead on the runway however is israeli firm eviation which recently debuted a prototype for the worlds first commercial allelectric passenger aircraft  named alice the craft is expected to carry nine passengers for 650 miles and could be up and running as early as 2022 the challenge these companies face however is developing the batteries needed to power electric motors capable of delivering the propulsion needed for a plane full of passengers and luggage to take off currently batteries dont have anywhere near the energy density of traditional kerosene jet fuel  60 less  alices battery is colossal weighing 38 metric tons and accounting for 60 of the planes overall weight by contrast traditional planes allocate around 30 of total weight to fuel as conventional jets burn fuel they get lighter whereas electric planes would have to carry the same battery weight for the full duration of a flight closer to home on scotlands orkney islands electric planes could be perfectly suited to replace expensive jet fuel on the regions supershort island hopping service  theres little need for rangeanxiety with the longest flight from kirkwall to north ronaldsay lasting just 20 minutes and the shortest taking less than two minutes between the tiny islands of papa westray and neighbouring westray orkney is already known for its renewable credentials exporting more windgenerated power to the grid than it is able to consume the local council plans to investigate retrofitting its eightseater aircraft which carried more than 21000 passengers last year with electric motors as early as 2022 taking electric long haul the planes currently under development by ampaire wright electric and eviation are small aircraft only capable of short distance flights this is a long way behind the lengths capable of traditional fossil fuelpowered jets built by airline industry stalwarts airbus and boeing which are making their own move into electrification ampaire electric but only for short distances source ampairecom  even with drastic developments in battery technology however airbus estimates its longhaul a320 airliner which seats between 100 and 240 passengers would only be able to fly for a fifth of its range as an electric plane and only manage to carry half its regular cargo load elsewhere french jet enginemaker safran predicts that fullsize batterypowered commercial aircraft wont become a reality until 2050 at the earliest however if going fully electric may not yet be possible for large longhaul planes hybrid aircraft which use both conventional and electric power offer a potential middle ground a team comprising rollsroyce airbus and siemens are working on a project set to launch in 2021 called efan x which would combine an electric motor with a bae 146 aircrafts jet engine airbus say they may have to reduce their cargo to go electric source wwwairbuscom  hybrid models aim to use electric engines as the power source for the energyintensive takeoff and landing processes saving jet fuel and reducing noise around airports then while the plane is in the air it would switch to conventional kerosene engines which are most efficient when the plane reaches cruising altitude airbus aims to introduce a hybrid version of their bestselling singleaisle a320 passenger jet by 2035 while start ups and established jet makers jostle to get electric and hybrid planes off the ground there are other ideas around reducing aviation emissions technology of the future for decarbonising planes the university of illinois is working with nasa to develop hydrogen fuel cells capable of powering allelectric air travel hydrogen fuel cells work by combining hydrogen and oxygen to cause a chemical reaction that generates an electric current while the ingredients are very light the problem is they are bulky to store and on planes making effective use of space is key researchers are combatting this by experimenting with cryogenically freezing the gases into liquids which makes them more spaceefficient to store but makes refuelling trickier as airports would need the infrastructure to work with the freezing liquids there have also been experiments into solarpowered planes in 2016 a team of swiss adventurers succeeded in flying around the world in an aircraft that uses solar panels on its wings to power its propellers with a wingspan wider than a boeing 747 but weighing just a fraction of a traditional jet the solar impulse 2 is capable of staying airborne for as long as six days though only able to carry a lone pilot solar impulse 2 has great staying power while the feat is impressive the solar impulse team says the aim was to showcase the advancement of solar technology rather than develop solar planes for mainstream usage elsewhere mit engineers have been working on the first ever plane with no moving parts in its propulsion system instead the model uses ionic wind  a silent but hugely powerful flow of ions produced aboard the plane ionic wind is created when a current is passed between a thick and thin electrode with enough voltage applied the air between the electrodes produces thrust capable of propelling a small aircraft steadily during flight mit hope that ionic wind systems could be paired with conventional jets to make hybrid planes for a range of uses a general blueprint for an mit plane propelled by ionic wind source mit electric aircraft initiative newsmitedu  like any emerging technology it will take time to develop these alternative power sources to reach the point where they can safely and securely serve the global aviation industry however its clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is underway flying as we know it has been slow to adapt but with a growing awareness and levels of flygskam among consumers there is greater pressure on the industry to decarbonise and lay out positive solutions to cleaner air travel tags electric vehicles evs  fossil fuels  decarbonisation  transport  sustainability electricity and magnetism the relationship that makes the modern world work 30 january 2019 power generation locked in a parisian vault and stored in a double set of bell jars is a small cylinder of metal made of platinumiridium the carefully guarded lump weighs exactly one kilogram but more than just weighing one kilogram it is the kilogram from which all other official kilograms are weighed international prototype kilogram with protective double glass bell known as the international prototype kilogram or colloquially as le grand k the weight was created in 1889 and has been carefully replicated to offer nations around the world a standardised kilogram but over time le grand k and its clones have slightly deteriorated through wear and tear despite extremely careful use in an age of micro and nanotechnology bits of metal arent quite accurate enough to dictate global weighs and so as of may this year it will no longer be the global measurement for a kilogram  an electromagnet is part of its replacement an electromagnet is effectively a magnet that is turned on by running an electric current through it cutting the current turns it off while increasing or decreasing the strength of the current increases and decreases the power of the magnet it can be used to measure a kilogram very precisely thanks to something called a kibble balance which is essentially a set of scales however instead of using weights it uses an electromagnet to pull down one side because the electric current flowing through the electromagnet can be increased decreased and measured very very accurately it means scientists can define any weight  in this case a kilogram  by the amount of electrical current needed to balance the scale  this radical overhaul of how weights are defined means scientists wont have to fly off to paris every time they need precise kilograms beyond just replacing wornout weights however it highlights the versatility and potential of electromagnets from their use in electricity generation to creating hard drives and powering speakers the simple way to make a magnet magnets and electricity might at first not seem closely connected one powers your fridge the other attaches holiday souvenirs to it the former certainly feels more useful however the relationship between magnetic and electric fields is as close as two sides of the same coin they are both aspects of the same force electromagnetism electromagnetism is very complicated and therere still aspects of it that are unknown today  it was thinking about electromagnetism that led einstein to come up with his theory of special relativity  however actually creating an electromagnet is relatively straightforward all matter is made up of atoms every neutral atoms core is made up of static neutrons and protons with electrons spinning around them these electrons have a charge and a mass giving the electrons a tiny magnetic field  in most matter all atoms are aligned in random ways and effectively all cancel each other out to render the matter nonmagnetic but if the atoms and their electrons can all be aligned in the same direction then the object becomes magnetic a magnet can stick to an object like a paperclip because its permanent magnetic field realigns the atoms in the paperclip to make it temporarily magnetic too  allowing the magnetic forces to line up and the materials to attract however once the paper clip is taken away from the magnet its atoms fall out of sync and point in random directions cancelling out each others magnetic fields once again whether a material can become magnetic or not relies on a similar principal as to whether it can conduct electricity materials like wood and glass are poor conductors because their atoms have a strong hold over their electrons by contrast materials like metals have a loose hold on their electrons and so are good conductors and easily magnetised nickle cobalt and iron are described as ferromagnetic because their atoms can stay in sync making them a permanent magnet but when magnets really become useful is when electricity gets involved putting magnets to work running an electric current through a material with a weak hold on its electrons causes them to align creating an electromagnetic field because of the relationships between electric and magnetic fields the strength of the electromagnet can also be altered by increasing or decreasing the current while switching the flow of the current will flip its north and south poles having this much control over a magnetic field makes it very useful in everyday life including how we generate electricity find out how we rewind a generator core in a clean room at the heart of drax power station inside each of the six generator cores at drax power station is a 120tonne rotor  when a voltage is applied this piece of equipment becomes a massive electromagnet when steam powers the turbines to rotate it at 3000 rpm the rotors very powerful magnetic field knocks electrons in the copper bars of the surrounding stator out of place sending them zooming through the metal in turn generating an electrical current that is sent out to the grid the 660 megawatts mw of active power draxs unit 1 can export into the national transmission system is enough to power 13 million homes for an hour beyond just producing electricity however electromagnets are also used to make it useful to everyday life almost anything electric that depends on moving parts from pumping loud speakers to circuit breakers to the motors of electric cars depend on electromagnets as more decarbonisation efforts lead to greater electrification of areas like transport  electromagnets will remain vital to daily life into the future tags electric vehicles evs  electricity generation  electricity  decarbonisation  transport  technology how to get more evs on the roads 25 january 2019 electrification from school runs to goods deliveries getting from a to b is crucial to life in modern britain however a progress report by the committee on climate change ccc found that in 2017 transport was the largest greenhouse gas ghgemitting sector in the uk accounting for 28 of total emissions within domestic transport cars  vans and hgvs are the three most significant sources of emissions accounting for 87 of the sectors emissions a zero carbon future relies on a major shift away from petrol and diesel engines to electric transport a recent report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax examines the decarbonisation efforts of 25 major countries the report found the uk ranked sixth in sales of new electric vehicles evs in the 12 months to september 2018 and seventh for the number of charging points available the governments road to zero strategy outlines the countrys target for as many as 70 of new car sales to be ultralow emission by 2030 alongside up to 40 of new vans it has however been criticised by the committee on climate change as not being ambitious enough  a committee of mps has suggested 2032 becomes the official target date for banning new petrol and diesel cars  rather than 2040 called for in the strategy even as the range of evs on the market grows getting more lowemission vehicles on roads will require incentives and infrastructure improvements heres how some of the countries leading the shift to electrified transport are driving adoption expanding charging infrastructure one of major barriers to ev adoption is a lack of public charging facilitates coupled with reliability issues across a network that includes both old hardware and a plethora of apps and different connections  no one wants to set off on a long journey unsure of whether theyll be able to find a recharging point before their battery goes flat according to the energy revolution report there is one charger for every 5000 people in the uk compared to one for every 500 people in norway the leading country for charging points the scandinavian countrys government has invested heavily in its policy of placing two fast charging stations for every 50 km of main road covering 100 of the cost of installation government support has also been crucial in second and third ranked countries the netherlands and sweden respectively the dutch living lab smart charging is a collaboration between government and private organisations to use wind and solar to change vehicles while sweden has combined its klimatklivet investment scheme for both public and private charge points with experiments such as charging roads  china where half of the worlds 300000 charge points are located has issued a directive calling for the construction of 48 million electric charging points around the country by 2020  its also assisting private investments to make charging stations more financially viable the uks road to zero strategy is to expand charging infrastructure through a 400 million joint investment fund with private investors draxs energising britain report found the uk is on track to meet its 2030 target of 28000 installed chargers ahead of time however deployment still clusters around london the south east and scotland more direct government incentives or policies may be needed to balance this disparity and in the uk the scottish government is leading the pack with a 2032 ban on new petrol and diesel cars plus a range of initiatives including public charging networks and the switched on towns and city fund  charging points are necessary for electrified roads however its a chickenandegg situation more chargers dont mean more evs getting more evs on roads also requires financial incentive money makes the wheels go around putting infrastructure in place is one thing but the reality is evs are expensive especially new ones and cold hard cash is an important driver of adoption financial incentives have been a part of norways policies since the 1980s with the countrys high fuel prices  compared to the us for example further helping to make evs attractive current benefits for ev owners include no import or purchase taxes no vat no road tax no road tolls half price on ferries and free municipal parking there are also nonfinancial incentives such as buslane usage sweden the second ranked country for new ev sales in 2018 is a similar case where high fuel prices are combined with a carrotandstick approach of subsidies for evs and rising road taxes for fossil fuelpowered vehicles including hybrids the uk has had a grant scheme in place since 2011 but last year removed hybrid vehicles from eligibility and dropped the maximum grant for new ev buyers from 4500 to 3500  evs are also exempt from road taxes in april 2019 transport for london is implementing a low emissions zone ulez which exempts evs from a daily charge subsidies for both buyers and vehicle manufacturers have been a cornerstone of chinas policies with support coming up to around 15000 per vehicle  chinese ev buyers can also skip the lottery system for new license plates the country has in place to reduce congestion heavy subsidies have allowed the country to claim as much as 50 of the entire ev passenger market however it makes change expensive and the government is now preparing to find a more sustainable way of driving adoption preparing for transport beyond subsidies china isnt afraid to strongarm manufacturers into building more evs companies with annual sales of more than 30000 vehicles are required to meet a quota of at least 10 evs or hybrids  however the government has begun to scale back subsidies in the hope it will drive innovation in areas such as batteries robotics and automation which will in turn reduce the price for end consumers norway which owes so much of its decarbonisation leadership in lowcarbon transport to subsidies is also grappling with how to move away from this model as evs creep increasingly towards the norm the taxes lost through evs exclusions become more economically noticeable while the government says the subsidies will remain in place until at least 2020 different political parties are calling to make the market commercially viable  there is also concern the schemes only pass on savings to those who can afford new ev models  rather than the wider population who face higher taxes for being unable to upgrade its not just governments responsibility to make new markets for evs sustainable but for business to innovate within the area too drax group ceo will gardiner recently said his company must help to  ensure noone is left behind through the energy revolution  thats a view welcomed by politicians from all sides of the political spectrum concerned not just about mitigating manmade climate change but also to ensure a just transition during the economys decarbonisation energy and clean growth minister claire perry spoke at an aldersgate group event in london in january its been very easy in the past for concerns about the climate to be dismissed as the worries of the few not the many luckily weve been able to strip out a lot of the myths surrounding decarbonisation and costs but we have to be mindful that this is a problem which will have to be solved by the many not just the middle class many countries have set ambitious targets for when the ban of new petrol and diesel vehicles will come into effect government involvement and subsidies will be crucial but may prove economically challenging in the

generation since the paris agreement came into effect in november 2016 its fair to say many countries have taken up the vital challenge of decarbonisation in earnest however not all are making progress at the same rate many are not implementing the agreement at the pace needed to mitigate climate change and keep the average global temperature increase well below 2 o c of preindustrial levels certainly not enough to limit the increase to 15 o c by 2050 which the majority of climate scientists believe is necessary for the planet is to avoid dire consequences last year even saw renewable energy investment fall 7  while the money going into fossil fuels grew for the first time since 2014 and data released by the international energy agency iea at the beginning of this months un climate change conference cop24 in katowice poland found that 2017 was also the first for five years seeing an increase in advanced economies carbon emissions  despite this there is much positive work towards decarbonisation a new report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax looks into the core areas and activities required to decarbonise the global energy system  and which countries are performing them to good effect in doing this the report also looks at how the uk stands in comparison and what steps countries need to take to truly decarbonise here are the key indicators of decarbonisation and how countries around the world are performing towards them dam in hardangervidda norway clean power at the forefront of reducing emissions and curbing climate change is the need to decarbonise electricity generation and move towards renewable sources last year the global average carbon intensity was 440 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatthour gkwh out of the 25 major countries the report tracks 16 came in below average with seven of these falling under the longterm 50 gkwh goal leading the rankings are norway france and new zealand which have a nearzero carbon intensity for electricity generation thanks to extensive hydro and nuclear power capacity at the other end of the table china india poland and south africa remain wedded to coal producing up to twice the global average co 2 for electricity generation this comes despite china having installed two and a half times more renewables than any other country  it now boasts 600 gigawatts gw of renewable capacity per person germany is leading the renewablesdrive with almost 1 kw of wind and solar capacity installed per person over the last decade despite this as much as 40 of its electricity still comes from coal part of the challenge in moving away from coal to renewables is economic as many countries continue to subsidise their coal industries to keep electricity affordable phasing out these subsidies is therefore key to switching to a lowcarbon generation system doing this works as demonstrated by the example of denmark which cut its fossil fuel subsidies by 90 over the past decade in turn successfully cutting its coal generation by 25 the uks carbon pricing strategy  which adds 16 per tonne of co 2 emitted on top of the price set by the european emissions trading system eu ets has led the carbon intensity of great britains electricity to more than halve in a decade it highlights how quickly and effectively these kinds of fees can make fossil fuels uneconomical since 2008 the uk has removed more than 250 gkwh from its electricity production carbon capture and storage in many future looking climate scenarios keeping the earths temperature below a 2 o c increase depends on extensive deployment of carbon capture technology  capturing as much as 100 billion tonnes of co 2 per year storing and using carbon is clearly forecast to be a major part of any attempt to meet the paris agreement but at present there are few facilities carrying it out at scale around the world today there are 18 largescale carbon capture and storage ccs units running across six countries with a total capacity to capture 32 million tonnes of co 2 per year mtco 2 pa another five facilities are under construction in three countries to add another 7 mtco 2 pa of global capacity in the uk drax power station is piloting a bioenergy carbon capture and storage programme that could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station  the usa has the greatest total installed capacity at 20 mtco 2 pa but per person it ranks behind norway canada and australia their smaller populations give them more than 200 kg of carbon capture capacity per person per year oil platform off the coast of australia these figures are well below the 100 billion tonnes the iea estimates need to be stored by 2060 to prevent temperatures reaching 2 o c more however considering the us alone has a potential storage capacity of more than 10 trillion tonnes of co 2  the potential of storage is not expected to be a problem using depleted oil or natural gas fields as storage for captured carbon is being explored in a number of regions with the us establishing several projects with more than 1 million tonnes in capacity in 2019 australia will open the worlds largest co 2 store with the capacity to capture between 34 million and 4 million tonnes a year from chevrons gorgon gas facility  considering the storage capacity available globally its a matter of deploying the necessary technology for ccs to have a significant impact on emissions and global warming the uk is perhaps a typical example of where ccs is at present with estimated storage capacity of 70 billion tonnes as much as half of the entire eu combined by repurposing north sea oil and gas fields in partnership with norway the uk could pool its carbon storage capacity electrification electricity generation is one of the main targets for emissions reductions globally as a result of the progress thats been made in this field many futurelooking scenarios highlight the important of electrification in other sectors such as transport in turn making them less carbon intensive transport is leading the charge globally  there are now 10 different countries where one of every 50 new vehicles sold is electric in norway this ratio is almost one in two thanks in part to generous tax exemptions as well as nonfinancial incentives like access to bus lanes and halfprice ferries perhaps surprisingly china is the worlds largest electric vehicle ev market it may still use significant amounts of coal but its commitment to reducing urban air pollution has seen it push evs heavily and it now accounts for 50 of the global battery ev market on its own chinese electric car charging stations of course adoption of evs requires the supporting infrastructure to be truly successful in conjunction with its high sales norway leads the way in charging points per capita with one for every 500 people this compares to one charger for every 5000 people in the uk and one for every 10000 people in china electrification also affects the energy intensity of countrys transport systems and while it may be the largest ev market chinas rise in private vehicles has been largely driven by petrol and diesel models the result is the largest increases in transport energy intensity and emissions has taken place in china indonesia and india respectively domestic energy intensity is also rising in china indonesia and south africa as greater numbers of people gain access to appliances and home comforts conversely in europe portugal germany and the netherlands have all seen their domestic energy intensity drop in the last decade however this may be the lingering effect of the 2008 recession rather than longterm efficiency improvements the efficiency of industrial processes is also an important barometer in decarbonisation activities like mining and manufacturing require heavyduty dieselpowered machinery and often coalpowered generators especially in bric nations the exception is china where plans to get the 1000 most energyintensive companies to reduce their energy consumption per unit of gdp produced by 20 over the last five years has proved fruitful norways heavilyelectrified industries however are still energy intensive and its level of carbon intensity is vulnerable to fluctuations in power generation prices electrification and reduced emissions require government policies to put in motion behavioural changes that can lead to lasting decarbonisation  robust carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future  drax group ceo will gardiner commented recently  welcoming a november report by the energy transitions commission gardiner said

while others increase consumption as their population become wealthier residential and transport changes over the last decade are mostly linked to the global recession and technological improvements rather than behavioural shift brics countries consume the most energy per  of output from industry this is linked to the composition of their industry sectors ie greater manufacturing and mining

electric car 20 september 2018 electrification when youre travelling to another continent there are few things more irritating to forget than a plug adapter thankfully theyre relatively easy to buy even if it means putting holiday plans on hold for half an hour but what if rather than having the wrong plug to charge a phone abroad you found yourself unable to plug in your electric vehicle ev on your own street its a situation that could soon become a reality as different vehicle manufacturers release new models and different energy and charging companies expand their recharging networks not all of which can connect with each other fragmentation among charging networks confusing cables and meeting increased electricity demand are all challenges the uk needs to solve to enable allelectric vehicles and cut transport emissions ev charging at drax power station north yorkshire around the country there are more than 17600 public charge points for evs to power up at  offered by 35 different charging networks while some offer connectors that plug straight into cars others require motorists to use their own cables and connect the ports but similarly to how different models of smartphone often require a different type of charging cable not all evs can plug into to the same chargers or use the same protocol to link their batteries to the charging system its something that without standardisation could lead to fragmentation and become a major pain point for electric vehicle owners as well a barrier to more widespread adoption currently car makers in germany are united in backing a whats known as combined charging system ccs but japanese manufactures support making chademo standing for charge de move the standard protocol which requires a different type of connecting cable to ccs tesla uses its own network supercharger points and although its cars can recharge at other charge points if the driver has their adapter with them other manufacturers vehicles cant yet recharge at tesla superchargers tesla model s and supercharger then theres china the worlds largest market where 200 million evs are expected to be on the roads by 2040  uses an entirely different gbt system keen to avoid missing out on such a lucrative market tesla has added a bgt charging port to its model x vehicles  currently europe uses the same charging infrastructure as the uk and the larger charging networks operate the same service across the continent as is the case when setting out on a long drive anywhere though its worth checking where charge points are before setting off it may be confusing but its still relatively early days for the ev charging industry and like vhs vs betamax there could yet be consolidation across the global market slow fast rapid expanding where drivers can recharge is key to bringing more evs onto roads and in efforts to help grow this the government has put forward a proposal that all new homes business and street lights should offer charging points  however all points do not charge equally and are divided into slow fast and rapid home charging will be an important part of ev infrastructure with overnight charging seen as key to managing the increased electricity demand created by substantial ev adoption it is however the slowest and can take six to 12 hours to fully recharge a vehicle fast chargers are those normally found on streets or public destinations like car parks for people unable to run a cable from their home to their ev these will be crucially important however they typically require drivers to bring their own connection cable to hook up and can take between two and five hours to fully recharge depending on the vehicles by far the fastest method of ev charging is through rapid charging which is mostcommonly found at motorway service stations these charge points provide connectors for drivers to plug in and can recharge an ev to 80 in just 30 minutes connector fragmentation however could cause some issues at these sites the likely solution  for the time being  is offering multiple different options such as at shells recharge points  which house both rapid ccs and chademo connections similarly to how traditional pumps might offer both petrol and diesel a london fire brigade bmw i3 charging more and smarter charging as the uk heads towards the 2040 deadline for the end of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales having the necessary infrastructure to support ev adoption is a key issue to address according to pwc major companies are making inroads towards addressing this need with oil giant bp acquiring chargemaster the countrys largest charging network in june the government is also encouraging further growth through a 400 million fund to be allocated to companies building charging infrastructure  in addition to allowing more evs to recharge smartgrid technology will play an important role in managing how so many are charged without causing surges in demand or tripping out home or business premises circuits this can also offer opportunities such as vehicletogrid storage  that enable the national grid to treat connected evs like batteries at times of stress electric vehicles are still beginning to appear en mass in the uk however their potential to reduce transport emissions makes them an important investment for the government vehicle manufacturers and energy companies building charging networks spreading an understanding of how to charge evs will help drive returns on those investments tags transport  electric vehicles evs the race to allelectric vehicles 7 august 2018 electrification the practice laps are over the lights have signalled and the race is well under way in the electric vehicle ev market some companies got off to a great start but teams from all the worlds biggest car makers have plans to catch up and take the lead automanufacturers know fossil fuelpowered cars will eventually be a thing of the past but which companies and countries are actually putting plans into action to shape the future of road transport money follows ambitions today the ev market is relatively small of the 90 million vehicles sold each year evs account for just 1  with sales in 2017 of 100000 across its three models tesla was the dominant player in the field thanks in part to ample press coverage and its outspoken ceo but also its sporty design and performance setting it apart in a class typically concerned with economy and efficiency to put that into perspective nissans leaf the bestselling ev of all time has only ever sold around 300000 cars having launched in 2010 compare these figures to the 1 millionplus ford fseries pickup trucks bought last year  almost entirely in the us alone  and it highlights just how far the ev market has to grow before it begins to push out internal combustion engines ices tesla gigafactory 1 in nevada click to view but a massive surge in ev adoption has long been expected  the international energy agency forecasts a 24 increase by 2030 to 13 million ev sales  the fuel behind this growth includes improved performance a greater range of choice lowering prices and increased marketing spending for much of this the onus falls on manufacturers however they will need the support of governments electricity grids and energy suppliers to ensure the charging infrastructure required is in place to support the forecast growth making evs massmarket will require significant spending from all parties automakers globally now plan to invest as much a 90 billion into evs and battery technology according to

a timeline to eliminate fossil fuelpowered vehicles having banned 553 car models in january as part of its efforts to curb air pollution  the country is also subsidising ev purchases and offers a potentially huge market for electric car makers thats if they can muscle past domestic manufacturers  which accounted for more than half of all evs produced globally last year ev charging in china urban environments are the most affected by exhaust pollution and as a result individual cities are setting their own more ambitious standards for vehicles paris mexico city madrid and athens have set 2025 as the date for a ban on all diesel vehicles from their city centres in the interest of public health visible air pollution over mexico city automanufacturers know they need to change regardless of what some politicians may say  and this will mean tough competition to bring the latest and best electric and hybrid cars onto the market but ultimately it wont just be rivalry that advances evs further into the mainstream governments the energy industry and car companies will need to work together to ensure infrastructure and policies are in place to move completely away from the petrol and diesel models that have driven the roads for so long this means rolling out ev charging infrastructure to facilitate millions of passengers getting from a to b as efficiently as they can with ices albeit with lifestyles changes and commuting habits to allow for longer fuelling times  electricians housebuilders employers retailers and local authorities will need to get busy retrofitting domestic public and commercial properties so people can charge up when their vehicles are idle and it requires smart regulation smarter power grids new services from energy companies automation  investment in storage and behind the meter technology to ensure the necessary power is available when and where its needed the race may be on and there will be winners and losers along the way but its one many people would like to see end in a draw tags electric vehicles evs dude wheres my autonomous car how selfdriving vehicles will impact electricity 25 april 2018 electrification the selfdriving car is a scifi stalwart the blend of familiar vehicle combined with advancedartificial intelligence makes it a perfect symbol of a nottoodistant future which is fast approaching but what a scifi movie is unlikely to show is a selfdriving car pulling over for half an hour to fill its tank or recharge its batteries as autonomous vehicles gradually inch into our everyday life the question of how they will be powered arises as does whether they will be capable of refuelling or recharging without a helping human hand with governments around the world setting ambitious targets for the phasing out of diesel and petrol car sales its safe to assume the driverless vehicles of the future will be electric but will they be able to charge themselves more than that how would a large influx of these cars coming onto our roads affect our national electricity demand and emissions  how will driverless cars charge themselves development is already well underway to bring humanfree charging to the auto world with a variety of approaches being trialled robotic charging points the most straightforward way to enable selfdriving electric vehicles evs to charge themselves is through updating existing infrastructure adding on robotic limbs to standard charge points would be one way of removing the need for human hands tesla previously demonstrated a porotype of a snakelike arm that plugs into its vehicles charge points that does exactly this undercar charging easier than flailing robotic arms is the idea of charging cars from underneath a parked car unsurprisingly tesla has patented a version of the technology too while building the technology into the ground adds complications it could potentially allow cars to be charged while moving  which is exactly what one road in sweden is doing  the two kilometre stretch outside stockholm features a metal track that an arm under evs can connect to  much like a scalextric track the route is divided into 50metre sections which are electrified separately as vehicles travel over them sweden is now planning to roll the concept out nationally wireless charging a step up from undercar charging wireless technology uses inductive charging rather than physically connecting with the car  and can be installed into parking spaces or be set into the tarmac the problem with this is its not as fast as directly connecting with the car however implemented at scale entire roads could constantly charge vehicles when they need a top up it would mean that rather than taking evs home and plugging them in the city and roads themselves would charge it but even the idea of keeping a car at home might fade as cars become increasingly autonomous rethinking vehicle ownership as more of the worlds population move to cities and they grow increasingly congested car ownership is declining  a trend being further fueled by ridesharing services like uber lyft and didi chuxing in china and as services such as these continue to grow in popularity it could point to a future where rather than owning selfdriving cars they will be shared among urban populations lyft strategist raj kapoor suggested the reduced cost of maintenance of shared evs would make rides cheap enough for the average person to ride in every day  this could result in fewer cars on the roads as intelligent systems allow them to coordinate sharing across the population which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for charging however the more intense computing power needed in selfdriving vehicles means they will each use more electricity than a standard ev  powering these sufficiently will depend on technology and coordination rather than producing significantly more electricity smarter cars smarter cities smarter electricity changes in car ownership could mean the total reshaping of cities if cars dont need to park for long periods of times on central roadsides and in garages vehicles could instead be stored on the outskirts of cities when demand for transport is low and make their way into towns as people begin commuting this vision of cars seemingly independently rolling around cities to exactly where theyre needed depends not on a single car reacting to a single command but to a network of data points connected to almost every aspect of a city more than this theres even potential these cars could provide power as well as use it vehicletogird v2g technology means they can essentially act as batteries and return electricity to the grid when needed a fully connected network of autonomous cars linked to buildings cities and entire electricity networks could be used to help meet demand on a local or national scale helping avoid fossil fuel usage at times of stress while increasing ev usage will likely contribute to an increase in electricity demand selfdriving smarter vehicles will ensure power is used at efficiently as possible and reduce the number of cars drawing electricity from the grid it ultimately means global investment in the charging infrastructure that will create a more connected and economical transport system which will make widespread ev and autonomous cars a reality tags electricity  energy storage  battery energy storage  electric vehicles evs the electric transport revolution 16 april 2018 electrification with rapid technological improvements and falls in battery prices improving performance and reducing the cost experts predict that by 2050 90 of newbuild cars will be powered by electricity  however its not only roads where transport is decarbonising electricity may soon power more of the worlds trains plus its planes and boats taking trains forward the electrification of the rail industry has arguably been in the making for a lot longer than evs but theres still progress to be made trains are already one of the mostefficient modes of longdistance transport and network rail claims electric models carbon emissions are 20 to 35 lower than diesel trains electric trains also accelerate and brake faster than dieselpowered models and cause less wear to tracks electrified trains are already commonplace in many parts of the world  japans famously fast and reliable shinkansen railways are electric meanwhile in the uk less than 50 of the rail network is electrified  with transport secretary chris graylings recent pause on development casting doubts on previous ambitious plans to electrify 850miles of track nevertheless advancements are still being made to enable the sector to utilise solar energy as an alternative to the national power grid the concept would prove cost effective and reduce the carbon footprint of trains even further according to a report by climate change charity 1010 and researchers at imperial colleges energy futures lab rail companies could cut their annual running costs by millions of pounds through installing their own trackside solar panels to power electric trains directly with companies spending around 500 million a year on power  the savings on selfgeneration would enable them to cut fares for passengers as well as emissions take off for electric planes of all transport modes air travel has made the least progress in electrification but theres hope yet airbus rollsroyce and siemens recently teamed up to develop the technology needed to create electricallypowered aircraft the companies plan to fly a demonstrator aircraft with one of its existing jet engines replaced by an electric unit in 2020 paul stein chief technology officer at rollsroyce said aviation is the last frontier of the electrification of transport it could lead to a step change in the way we fly with greater efficiency and less noise these proposed hybridelectric aircraft are not powered by onboard batteries like evs but with a gas turbine that generates electricity to drive the propellers  this could reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 predicted mark cousin head of flight demonstration at airbus moving to electric aircraft would also help the aviation industry meet eu targets of a 60 reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  by 2020 as well as 90 less nitrogen oxides and a noise reduction of around 75 ukbased airline easyjet also announced it could be flying electric planes within a decade and is teaming up with us firm wright electric to build batterypowered aircraft according to easyjet the move would enable batterypowered aeroplanes to travel shorthaul routes such as london to paris and amsterdam and edinburgh to bristol wright electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of easyjet passengers the challenge comes in making lithiumion batteries light and safe enough for the air the airline said this was the next step in making air travel less harmful for the environment after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31 between 2000 and 2016  wright electric claims that electric planes will save up to 15 in fuel burn and co 2 emissions  be 50 quieter and 10 cheaper for airlines to buy and operate with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers testing new waters theres a lot of buzz coming out of the maritime industry too every year marine transport emits 1000 million tonnes of co 2  which is why the international maritime organization imo has agreed that a reduction of 50 should come by 2050 compared with 2008 levels although the deal fell short of more ambitious targets preferred by those ranging from the european union to environmental ngos the imo did also commit to pursue efforts toward phasing out co 2 emissions entirely as paris agreement goals to cut carbon dioxide emissions loom businesses around the world are innovating small fleets of batterypowered boats designed for fjords and inland waterways in norway belgium and the netherlands are preparing to set sail  including some able to run autonomously without a crew  dutch company portliner is also gearing up to launch the first fullyelectric emissionfree barges in europe dubbed tesla ships portliner chief executive officer ton van meegen claims these barges would be the first in the world to sail on carbonneutral batteries  the first six barges alone are expected to remove 23000 trucks from the roads annually in the netherlands replacing them with zeroemission methods of transport china also recently launched an electric cargo ship to haul coal which whilst not doing much for its ambitions to cut pollution will at least eliminate shipping emissions from diesel engines electric ships may not yet be the norm globally but progress is underway to cut the 25 of global greenhouse emissions that result from the maritime transport industry once a farflung fantasy in some areas electrified
