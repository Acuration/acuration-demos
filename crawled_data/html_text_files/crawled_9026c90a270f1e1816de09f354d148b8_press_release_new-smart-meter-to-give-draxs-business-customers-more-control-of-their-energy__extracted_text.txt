and software company utiligroup on a groundbreaking polyphase smets 2 smart meter which will give large industrial and commercial businesses greater control of their energy use 17 june 2020 trial of polyphase smets 2 smart meters aimed at giving draxs larger business customers better control of their power use making them more sustainable the trial is the first of its kind to develop technology that will pave the way for more sophisticated smart metering solutions the technology needed to install the newest smart meters in businesses with larger and more complex electricity supplies such as schools or large commercial premises hasnt been available so some of the largest energy users have been unable to benefit from the smartest technologies polyphase smets2 smart meters will allow larger businesses to track their energy usage and use the same software used by the millions of singlephase smart meters installed in homes and small businesses across the uk the new technology could enable draxs energy supply businesses haven power and opus energy to offer large business customers access to smart metering technology giving them greater control over their energy use with the potential to operate more sustainably paul sheffield managing director of draxs customers business said were confident that this new smart meter technology is going to be a game changer for thousands of our larger customers this technology will enable them to enjoy greater flexibility and control over their electricity use making them more sustainable which will be good for both the environment and their bottom line the meters will be field tested with selected drax business customers such as utilities and large nhs trusts in the autumn the work by drax the dcc and edmi has continued despite the covid19 pandemic with all partners working remotely to develop and test the technology the project has included establishing a new polyphase smart meter testing lab where the new technology is being developed within the dccs manchester facility the operational headquarters of britains smart meter network the facility can test 2400 smart meters simultaneously and has a technical operation centre which can monitor the install and operation of every smart meter across the country the new smart meters will operate securely on the network using a specialist software platform from utiligroup a key technologyservices partner of drax dan lambert chief operating officer for the dcc said the dccs network is the digital backbone of the energy industry and our customers like drax are constantly working to help us extend its reach to more homes and businesses polyphase smart meters will make it available to even more businesses from farms to tech startups its been impressive how well the
