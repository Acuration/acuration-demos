where does global electricity go next which countries are leading the charge towards decarbonisation 12 december 2018 power generation since the paris agreement came into effect in november 2016 its fair to say many countries have taken up the vital challenge of decarbonisation in earnest however not all are making progress at the same rate many are not implementing the agreement at the pace needed to mitigate climate change and keep the average global temperature increase well below 2 o c of preindustrial levels certainly not enough to limit the increase to 15 o c by 2050 which the majority of climate scientists believe is necessary for the planet is to avoid dire consequences last year even saw renewable energy investment fall 7  while the money going into fossil fuels grew for the first time since 2014 and data released by the international energy agency iea at the beginning of this months un climate change conference cop24 in katowice poland found that 2017 was also the first for five years seeing an increase in advanced economies carbon emissions  despite this there is much positive work towards decarbonisation a new report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax looks into the core areas and activities required to decarbonise the global energy system  and which countries are performing them to good effect in doing this the report also looks at how the uk stands in comparison and what steps countries need to take to truly decarbonise here are the key indicators of decarbonisation and how countries around the world are performing towards them dam in hardangervidda norway clean power at the forefront of reducing emissions and curbing climate change is the need to decarbonise electricity generation and move towards renewable sources last year the global average carbon intensity was 440 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatthour gkwh out of the 25 major countries the report tracks 16 came in below average with seven of these falling under the longterm 50 gkwh goal leading the rankings are norway france and new zealand which have a nearzero carbon intensity for electricity generation thanks to extensive hydro and nuclear power capacity at the other end of the table china india poland and south africa remain wedded to coal producing up to twice the global average co 2 for electricity generation this comes despite china having installed two and a half times more renewables than any other country  it now boasts 600 gigawatts gw of renewable capacity per person germany is leading the renewablesdrive with almost 1 kw of wind and solar capacity installed per person over the last decade despite this as much as 40 of its electricity still comes from coal part of the challenge in moving away from coal to renewables is economic as many countries continue to subsidise their coal industries to keep electricity affordable phasing out these subsidies is therefore key to switching to a lowcarbon generation system doing this works as demonstrated by the example of denmark which cut its fossil fuel subsidies by 90 over the past decade in turn successfully cutting its coal generation by 25 the uks carbon pricing strategy  which adds 16 per tonne of co 2 emitted on top of the price set by the european emissions trading system eu ets has led the carbon intensity of great britains electricity to more than halve in a decade it highlights how quickly and effectively these kinds of fees can make fossil fuels uneconomical since 2008 the uk has removed more than 250 gkwh from its electricity production carbon capture and storage in many future looking climate scenarios keeping the earths temperature below a 2 o c increase depends on extensive deployment of carbon capture technology  capturing as much as 100 billion tonnes of co 2 per year storing and using carbon is clearly forecast to be a major part of any attempt to meet the paris agreement but at present there are few facilities carrying it out at scale around the world today there are 18 largescale carbon capture and storage ccs units running across six countries with a total capacity to capture 32 million tonnes of co 2 per year mtco 2 pa another five facilities are under construction in three countries to add another 7 mtco 2 pa of global capacity in the uk drax power station is piloting a bioenergy carbon capture and storage programme that could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station  the usa has the greatest total installed capacity at 20 mtco 2 pa but per person it ranks behind norway canada and australia their smaller populations give them more than 200 kg of carbon capture capacity per person per year oil platform off the coast of australia these figures are well below the 100 billion tonnes the iea estimates need to be stored by 2060 to prevent temperatures reaching 2 o c more however considering the us alone has a potential storage capacity of more than 10 trillion tonnes of co 2  the potential of storage is not expected to be a problem using depleted oil or natural gas fields as storage for captured carbon is being explored in a number of regions with the us establishing several projects with more than 1 million tonnes in capacity in 2019 australia will open the worlds largest co 2 store with the capacity to capture between 34 million and 4 million tonnes a year from chevrons gorgon gas facility  considering the storage capacity available globally its a matter of deploying the necessary technology for ccs to have a significant impact on emissions and global warming the uk is perhaps a typical example of where ccs is at present with estimated storage capacity of 70 billion tonnes as much as half of the entire eu combined by repurposing north sea oil and gas fields in partnership with norway the uk could pool its carbon storage capacity electrification electricity generation is one of the main targets for emissions reductions globally as a result of the progress thats been made in this field many futurelooking scenarios highlight the important of electrification in other sectors such as transport in turn making them less carbon intensive transport is leading the charge globally  there are now 10 different countries where one of every 50 new vehicles sold is electric in norway this ratio is almost one in two thanks in part to generous tax exemptions as well as nonfinancial incentives like access to bus lanes and halfprice ferries perhaps surprisingly china is the worlds largest electric vehicle ev market it may still use significant amounts of coal but its commitment to reducing urban air pollution has seen it push evs heavily and it now accounts for 50 of the global battery ev market on its own chinese electric car charging stations of course adoption of evs requires the supporting infrastructure to be truly successful in conjunction with its high sales norway leads the way in charging points per capita with one for every 500 people this compares to one charger for every 5000 people in the uk and one for every 10000 people in china electrification also affects the energy intensity of countrys transport systems and while it may be the largest ev market chinas rise in private vehicles has been largely driven by petrol and diesel models the result is the largest increases in transport energy intensity and emissions has taken place in china indonesia and india respectively domestic energy intensity is also rising in china indonesia and south africa as greater numbers of people gain access to appliances and home comforts conversely in europe portugal germany and the netherlands have all seen their domestic energy intensity drop in the last decade however this may be the lingering effect of the 2008 recession rather than longterm efficiency improvements the efficiency of industrial processes is also an important barometer in decarbonisation activities like mining and manufacturing require heavyduty dieselpowered machinery and often coalpowered generators especially in bric nations the exception is china where plans to get the 1000 most energyintensive companies to reduce their energy consumption per unit of gdp produced by 20 over the last five years has proved fruitful norways heavilyelectrified industries however are still energy intensive and its level of carbon intensity is vulnerable to fluctuations in power generation prices electrification and reduced emissions require government policies to put in motion behavioural changes that can lead to lasting decarbonisation  robust carbon pricing is one of the most effective tools to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future  drax group ceo will gardiner commented
