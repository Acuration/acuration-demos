biomass energy turning waste into watts 3 september 2020 sustainable bioenergy think of carbon emissions and the image that comes to mind is often of industrial sites or power generation  not of what we eat and what we throw away but food waste is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions globally food loss and waste from across the food chain generates the equivalent of 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  a year  or about 8 of total greenhouse gas emissions but what if there was a way to reduce those emissions and generate power by using discarded food and other organic waste like grass cuttings or nut shells a technology known as anaerobic digestion is increasingly making this idea a reality how anaerobic digestion works all organic waste products have energy in them but its tied up in the form of calories when food and vegetation rots microorganisms break down those calories into gases and other products methane or ammonium molecules exactly what these other products are depends on whether there is any oxygen present with oxygen the products are water co 2 and ammonia but remove oxygen from the equation and a very valuable gas is produced methane ch 4  the lack of oxygen is also what gives anaerobic digestion its name  when oxygen is present it becomes aerobic digestion during the anaerobic digestion process bacteria and other microorganisms break down organic matter gradually deteriorating complex polymers like glucose or starch into progressively simpler elements such as alcohol ammonia co 2 and ultimately ch 4  a biogas with huge potential as a fuel for other processes anaerobic power in practice the ch 4 produced in anaerobic digestion is incredibly useful as a fuel  turn on a gas hob or stovetop and its predominantly methane that provides the fuel for the flame the chemical compound is also the main component in the natural gas that makes up much of great britains electricity supply this means using anaerobic digestion to create ch 4 out of waste products turns that waste into a valuable power source but its not as simple as putting a bag over a rubbish tip and hoping for the best instead anaerobic digestion is carried out in large tanks called digesters these are filled with feedstocks from biological substances that can include anything from food scraps to alcohol and distillery waste to manure under the right conditions microorganisms and bacteria begin to digest and breakdown these substances into their basic elements the air quantity and temperature of the digesters is carefully regulated to ensure the microorganisms have the best possible environment to carry out the digestion of the feedstock with different types of feedstock and microorganisms operating best in different conditions the biogas created as a result of this digestion is then captured ready to be turned into something useful making use of biogas three different things can happen to the biogas produced during the course of the digestion locally it can be combusted onsite to provide further heat to regulate the temperature of the anaerobic digestion units or it can be combusted in a combined heat and power chp generator where it can generate electricity to be used on site  for example to power a farm  or sold through energy suppliers such as opus energy onto wider regional or national electricity networks this biogas electricity is an important element of great britains energy supply accounting for 6600 gwh or 73 of all power generated by solid and gaseous fuels in 2017 some of the biogas can even be cleaned to remove co 2  leaving behind pure methane that can be pumped onto natural gas grids and used to provide heat and power to households government research estimates a fully utilised biogas sector could provide up to 30 of the uks household gas demands  after the digestion process has been completed and the biogas has been removed what is left behind in the digester is a mass of solid matter called digestate this is extremely rich in nutrients and mineral such as potassium and nitrogen making it an excellent soil enhancer where anaerobic digestion is being used today today much of anaerobic digestion power is generated on farms  unsurprisingly given the ready access to biological waste material to use as feedstock as well as a potential source of electricity and heat it also gives farmers access to a new revenue stream by selling electricity or biogas as well as reducing utility and fertiliser costs while many of these installations are smaller scale some can get quite big linstock castle farm in north cumbria for example has a biogas facility with a 11 megawattmw operating capacity enough to power as many as 2000 homes at a time it was originally installed by the farmers as a more costeffective way of growing their business than buying more dairy cows there is however potential for anaerobic digestion to operate on an even larger scale in the us the city of philadelphia is developing a system that will link all newly built households together into a network where food waste is automatically collected and transported to a biogas generating facility closer to home northumbrian water uses 100 of its sludge the waste produced from purifying water to produce renewable power via anaerobic digestion  its estimated to have reduced the carbon footprint of the facilitys operations by around 20 and saved millions of pounds in savings on operating costs there have also been experiments with using biogas to power vehicles the biobus was the first bus in the uk to be powered by biomethane made from food sewage and commercial liquid waste and ran between bath and bristol airport but anaerobic digestion power is not a magic bullet it will be right in certain situations but not all if utilised effectively anaerobic digestion and biogas could fill a vital role in national electricity and gas networks while at the same time helping dispose of waste products in an environmentallyfriendly and costeffective way tags gas  biomass energy  customers  electricity generation  opus energy  renewable energy what is biomass 21 august 2020 sustainable bioenergy what is biomass in ecological terms biomass refers to any type of organic matter when it comes to energy biomass is any organic matter that can be used to generate energy for example wood forest residues or plant materials how is biomass used biomass used and combusted for energy can come in a number of different forms ranging from compressed wood pellets  which are used in power stations that have upgraded from coal  to biogas and biofuels a liquid fuel that can be used to replace fossil fuels in transport the term biomass also refers to any type of organic material used for energy in domestic settings for example wood burned in wood stoves and wood pellets used in domestic biomass boilers  biomass is organic matter like wood forest residues or plant material that is used to generate energy where does biomass come from biomass can be produced from different sources including agricultural or forestry residues dedicated energy crops or waste products such as uneaten food drax power station uses compressed wood pellets sourced from sustainably managed working forests in the us canada europe and brazil and are largely made up of lowgrade wood produced as a byproduct of the production and processing of higher value wood products like lumber and furniture biomass producers and users must meet a range of stringent measures for their biomass to be certified as sustainable and responsibly sourced  is biomass renewable biomass grown through sustainable means is classified as a renewable source of energy because of the process of its growth as biomass comes from organic living matter it grows naturally absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere in the process it means when biomass is combusted as a source of energy  for example for heat or electricity production  the co 2 released is offset by the amount of co 2 it absorbed from the atmosphere while it was growing fast facts in 2019 biomass accounted for 6 of great britains electricity generation more than 16 of the total generation of all renewable sources there is about 550 gigatonnes of biomass carbon on earth in total humans make up around 110000 th of that mass modern biomass was first developed as an alternative for oil after its price spiked as a result of the 1973 yom kippur war the international energy agency iea estimates bioenergy accounts for roughly 110 th of the worlds total energy supply biomass is a renewable sustainable form of energy used around the world how long has biomass been used as a source of energy biomass has been used as a source of energy for as long as humans have been creating fire early humans using wood plants or animal dung to make fire were all creating biomass energy today biomass in the form of wood and wood products remains a widely used energy source for many countries around the world  both for domestic consumption and at grid scale through power stations where its often used to replace fossil fuels with much higher lifecycle carbon emissions drax power station has been using compressed wood pellets a form of biomass since 2003 when it began research and development work cofiring it with coal it fully converted its first full generating unit to run only on compressed wood pellets in 2013 lowering the carbon footprint of the electricity it produced by more than 80 across the renewable fuels lifecycle today the power station runs mostly on sustainable biomass go deeper how working forests ensure biomass and wood products are sustainable  looking at the numbers behind the forests drax sources its biomass from  responsible sourcing

reports  biomass energy the science making new discoveries in forests 22 july 2020 sustainable bioenergy scientific research isnt all test tubes and lab coats  sometimes its bark and soil it might be a world away from the image of a sterile laboratory but the world of forestry is one that has seen significant scientific progress since the 18 th century when it first emerged as an area of study the development of environmental sciences and ecology as well as advances in biology and chemistry mean there are still new discoveries being made  from trees ability to talk to each other through underground fungi networks to forests positive impact on mental health  fostering greater awareness and understanding of fragile forest ecosystems such as the cypress swamps of the atchafalaya basin in louisiana forestry has also allowed for the improvement of working forests  landscapes planted to grow wood for products and services that often avoid the use of fossil fuelbased alternatives cypress forests in the atchafalaya basin in louisiana are an example of a forest landscape where the suitable management practice is protection preservation and monitoring by enhancing the genetic stock tree breeding ensures seedlings and plants are better adapted to their environment soil water temperature nutrient level etc science can now help trees to grow more quickly storing more carbon it can also give trees better form  straighter trees can produce more sawtimber which can in turn lock more carbon in buildings made predominantly or partially of the natural renewable product that wood is but more than just uncovering surprising insights into the ins and outs of our natural world forestry science is contributing to a far bigger goal tackling climate change the science of forests when the scientific study of forests first emerged in 18 th century germany it was with the aim of sustainability in mind industries were concerned forests wouldnt be able to provide enough timber to meet demand so research began into how to manage them responsibly forestry today encompasses much more than just providing saw logs and the research going into it remains driven by the same goal to ensure sustainability its breadth however has grown the uk forestry commissions research and innovation strategy highlights the scope it should cover it must be forwardlooking to anticipate longterm challenges strategic to inform emerging policy issues and technical to support new and more efficient forestry practices pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets being able to deliver on this breadth has relied on rapid advances in technology  including taking forestry research into space the technology teaching us about trees as in almost every industry one of the major drivers of change in forestry is data  and the ability to collect data from forests is getting more advanced at ground level techniques like  sonic tomography allow foresters and researchers to see inside trees using sound waves measuring size decay and overall health this in turn offers a bigger picture of forests wellbeing at the other end of the scale satellites and mapping technology are playing a major role in advancing a macro view of the worlds forests  particularly in how they change over time as well as a potent tool in monitoring and helping fight deforestation  satellite images have revealed there is nine per cent more forest on earth than previously thought  space satellite with antenna and solar panels in space against the background of the earth image furnished by nasa the european space agencys earth explorer programme will go a step further and use radar from satellites to penetrate the forest canopy measuring tree trunks and branches rather than just the area covered by forest determining the volume of wood in forests around the planet will effectively enable researchers to weigh the worlds forest biomass the masses of data these advances in tech are providing is playing a major role in how we manage our forests including how we can use them to fight global warming taking on the climate crisis forests are one of the key defences against climate change  so much so theyre included in the paris agreement trees abilities to absorb carbon dioxide co 2  has long been established knowledge thanks to what climate scientists call iams or integrated assessment models  we now know how much they can extract from the atmosphere and how long they can continue to do so as co 2 levels rise one optimistic hypothesis says trees will take in more co 2  as the levels rise to test this researchers in the uk are blasting controlled sections of a forest with co 2 to increase its density by 40 representing expected global levels by 2050  by tracking how trees react they hope to highlight the role they can play as carbon sinks science also suggests they could not only help slow climate change but actively fight it the research considers that as well as absorbing co 2  trees are reported to emit gases that reflect sunlight back into space ultimately contributing to global cooling however planting more trees isnt necessarily the only answer in places experiencing drought such as the western us thinning forests can reduce competition and allow healthier trees capable of absorbing more oxygen to flourish the increasing body of research on forests impact on climate change could prove vital in shaping both the forestry industry and national governments approaches forests however as a science forestry could be considered to be in its infancy at this crucial time for the planets future forestry is becoming one of the most important environmental sciences but a lot more attention investment and research and development are required if we are able to fully understand and manage the worlds forest resources we have barely scratched the surface tags forestry and forest management and arboriculture  climate change  forests  sustainability  biomass energy lasalle catchment area analysis 16 july 2020 sustainable bioenergy the wood supply catchment area for draxs lasalle bioenergy biomass pellet plant in midlouisiana is dominated by larger scale private forest owners that actively manage and invest in their forest for sawtimber production eightythree per cent 83 of the forest is in private ownership and 60 of this area is in corporate ownership the drax biomass pellet mill uses just 32 of the roundwood in the market and therefore has limited impact or influence on the overall trends by contrast the pulp and paper industry consumes 74 of the total pulpwood demand as the most dominant market for low grade fibre forest in lasalle catchment area the catchment area has seen an increase in total timberland area of 71 thousand hectares ha since 2008 this is primarily due to planting of previously nonstocked land hardwood areas have remained stable but planted pine has increased replacing some of the naturally regenerated mixed species areas the data below shows that deforestation or conversion from pure hardwood to pine is not occurring timberland area by management type the overall quantity of stored carbon or the inventory of the standing wood in the forest has increased by 7 or 326 million metric tonnes since 2008 this total is made up of a 49 million tonne increase in the quantity of pine and a 16 million tonne decline in the quantity of hardwood since the area of pure hardwood forest has remained stable this decline is likely to be due to the conversion of mixed stands to pure pine in order to increase sawtimber production and to provide a better return on investment for corporate owners historic area and timberland inventory forest in lasalle catchment area the growthtodrain ratio and the surplus of unharvested pine growth has been increasing yearonyear from two million tonnes in 2008 to over five million tonnes in 2016 this suggests that the lasalle bioenergy plant which almost exclusively utilises pine feedstocks has not had a negative impact on the growthtodrain ratio and the surplus of available biomass the latest data 2016 indicates that the ratio for pine pulpwood is 154 and for pine sawtimber 124 and that this has been increasing each year for both categories historic growth and removals by species stumpage prices for all product categories declined between 2010 and 2011 this was followed by a peak around 201516 with the recovery in demand postrecession and prices then stabilised from 2016 to 2019 the data indicates that there has been no adverse impact to pine pulpwood prices as a result of biomass demand in fact pine pulpwood prices are now nearly 20 lower than in 2014 as shown on the chart below lasalle bioenergy market historic stumpage prices usdtonne the character of the pine timberland is one of a maturing resource increasing in the average size of each tree the chart below chart shows a significant increase in the quantity of timber in the midrange size classes indicating a buildup of future resources for harvesting for both thinning and final felling for sawtimber production with balanced market demand the supply of fibre in this catchment area should remain plentiful and sustainable in the medium term historic pine inventory by dbh diameter at breast height class forisk summary of the impact of lasalle bioenergy on key trends and metrics in this catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused  deforestation no change in forest management practices no diversion from other markets possibly bioenergy plants compete with pulppaper and oriented strand board osb

forests and better manage them 22 june 2020 sustainable bioenergy there is an ongoing debate about forests contribution to fighting the climate crisis forests can act as substantial and effective tools for carbon sequestration during a high growth phase they can also function as significant and extensive carbon storage areas during maturity and throughout multiple stages of the age class cycle if managed effectively at a landscape level or they can be emitters of carbon if overharvested subject to fire storm pest or disease damage different age class forest stands in louisiana in a natural state forests will go through each of these life phases rapid early growth maturity and senescence damage decay and destruction through natural causes then they begin the cycle again absorbing and then emitting carbon dioxide co 2  in a continual succession recently loud voices have argued against forest management per se  against harvesting for wood products in particular suggesting that this reduces both forest carbon stocks and sequestration capacity pine cut in into wood for different wood products markets in louisiana big thick straight higher value sections go to sawmills and smaller and misshapen lowgrade wood not suitable for timber production is sold to pulp paper or wood pellet mills many foresters consider that this is just not correct in fact the opposite is true research and evidence clearly support the foresters view active forest management when carried out appropriately actually increases the amount of carbon sequestered  ensures that carbon is stored in solid wood products and provides substantial savings of fossil fuels by displacing other high carbon materials eg concrete steel brick plastic and coal oliver et al2014 1 compared the impact of forest harvesting and the use of wood products to substitute other highcarbon materials concluding that  more co 2 can be sequestered synergistically in the products or wood energy and landscape together than in the unharvested landscape harvesting sustainably at an optimum stand age will sequester more carbon in the combined products wood energy and forest than harvesting sustainably at other ages this research demonstrated that an increase in the use of structural timber to displace concrete and steel could lead to substantial emissions savings compared to unharvested forest the use of wood for energy is an essential component of this displacement process although it is important to use appropriate feedstocks  burning wood that could be used for structural timber will not lead to a positive climate impact the message here is to manage working forests for optimum sawlog production for longlife solid wood products and utilise the byproducts for energy where this is the most viable market this provides the best allround climate benefit what happens when you close the gate closing the forest gate and stopping all harvesting and management is one option being championed by some climate change campaigners there is certainly a vital role for the preservation and protection of forests globally primary and virgin forests intact landscapes high biodiversity and high conservation value areas all need to be protected that doesnt necessarily mean that there is no forest management it should mean careful and appropriate management to maintain and ensure the future of the resource in these cases management is with an objective to reduce the risk of fire pests and disease rather than for timber production globally we need better governance understanding and implementation of best practice to achieve this forest certification and timber tracing systems are a good start this can equally apply to the many hundreds of millions of hectares of working forest that do not fall into the protection categories forests that have been managed for many hundreds of years for timber production and other purposes harvesting in these forests can be more active but governance controls and the development of best practice are required better management not less management during the 1970s there was a significant change of policy in the us aimed at removing massive areas of publicly owned forest from active management  effectively closing the gate the drivers behind this policy were well meaning it was intended to protect and preserve the habitat of endangered species but the unintended consequences have also had a substantial impact in the 1970s little thought was given to the carbon sequestration and storage potential of forests and climate change was not at the top of the agenda the west coast of the us was most substantially affected by these changes more than in the us south  but the data below looks at the example of mississippi which is primarily  working forest  and 88 in private ownership pine trees in mississippi working forest this is the location of draxs amite pellet mill  the charts below show an interesting comparison of forest ownership in mississippi where limited or no harvesting takes place and where active management for timber production occurs in the short term the total volume of timber stored per hectare is higher where no harvesting occurs this makes sense since the forest will keep growing until it reaches its climax point and succumbs to fire pest or disease average standing volume per unit area in the private sector where active management occurs is the lowest as timber is periodically removed for use in solid wood products remember that the oliver et al analysis which does not include regrowth showed that despite a shortterm reduction in forest carbon the total displacement of highcarbon materials with wood for structural timber and energy leads to a far higher emissions saving it is better to have a lower stock of carbon in a working forest and to be continually sequestering new carbon for storage in solid wood products average standing volume per acre by ownership class mississippi 2 comparing the average annual growth rates across all forest types in mississippi annual growth in the private sector is almost double that in the unharvested public forest this differential is increased even further if only commercial species like pine are considered and a comparison is made between planted well managed forests and those that are left to naturally regenerate average growth rates per acre by ownership class mississippi 3 the managed forest area is continually growing and storing more carbon at a materially higher rate than less actively managed forest as harvesting removes some forest carbon these products displace high carbon materials in construction and energy and new young forests are replacing the old ones we know that forests are not being lost and that the overall storage of carbon is increasing for example the drax catchment area analysis for the amite biomass wood pellet plant showed an increase in forest area of 5200 ha and an increase in volume of 11 million m 3  just in the area around the pellet mill but what happens to protected forest area the forest reserve with limited or no harvesting over the last 20 years the average annual loss of forest to wildfire in the us has been 278 million ha per year the same as the uks total area of productive forest according to the usfs fia database the average standing volume of forests in the us is 145 m 3 per ha although in the national park land this is 365 m 3 per ha therefore wildfires are responsible for the average annual combustion of 403 million m 3 of wood pa equal to the total annual wood harvest of the us or 25 billion m 3 if entirely in national parks one cubic metre equates to a similar quantity of co 2 released into the atmosphere each year therefore wildfires are responsible for between 407 million and 25 billion tonnes of co 2 emissions in the us each year 4  wildfires in the us starrs et al 2018 5 demonstrated that the risk of wildfire was significantly higher in federally owned reserved forest where harvesting and management were restricted compared to privately owned forests with active management in california the risk of wildfire in federal forest 200015 was almost double the risk in private forests where both had state firefighting resources the risk of fires in federal lands had increased by 93 since 195066 compared to only 33 in nonfederal forests due to the change in forest management practice in the 1970s forest fire in california closing the gate means that the carbon stock is maintained and grows in the short term but there is no opportunity for carbon to be stored in solid wood products no highcarbon materials are displaced concrete steel and fossil fuels and the rate of sequestration declines as the forest ages eventually the forest will reach its natural climax and die releasing all of that carbon back into the atmosphere the managed forest by contrast will have a lower standing volume at a certain point in time but will be in a continual cycle of sequestration storage and regrowth  with a much lower risk of fire and disease if managed correctly the rate of growth and standing volume will also increase over time how should we manage the forest forests are extremely variable there are a vast variety of tree species soil  geological features water regimes temperature climate and many other factors that combine to make unique ecosystems and forest landscapes some of these are rare and valuable for the exceptional assemblages they contain some are commonplace and widespread some are natural some manmade or influenced by human activity forests have many important roles to play and careful management is required in some cases that management may be protection preservation and monitoring in other cases it may be active harvesting and planting to optimise growth and carbon storage  cypress forests in the atchafalaya basin in louisiana are an example of a forest landscape where the suitable management practice is protection preservation and monitoring for each forest type and area we need to recognise the highest or best purposes for that land in the objectives set and carefully plan the management to optimise and sustain that value the primary value could be in species and habitat diversity or rarity provision of recreation and aesthetic value production of timber forest products and revenue generation carbon sequestration and storage water management and other ecosystem benefits most likely it will be a combination of several of these benefits therefore best management practice usually involves optimising each piece of forest land to provide the most effective combination of values forests can deliver many benefits if we are sensible about how we manage them in a recent study favero et al 2020 6 concluded that increased bioenergy demand increases forest carbon stocks thanks to afforestation activities and more intensive management relative to a nobioenergy case some natural forests however are converted to more intensive management with potential biodiversity lossesthe expanded use of wood for bioenergy will result in net carbon benefits but an efficient policy also needs to regulate

latvia catchment area analysis 19 june 2020 sustainable bioenergy latvia is a heavily forested small country about half the size of england with 52 forest cover totalling 354 million ha 27 times bigger than the forest area in england and 11 bigger than the entire uk in its catchment area analysis report of the baltic country consultancy indufor found best management practice is driven by the stateowned sector with an increasing proportion of corporate owners improving management standards in the private sector markets are dominated by domestic sawtimber demand and pulpwood exports to neighbouring scandinavia fuelwood pellets and biomass are substantial and critical markets for lowgrade fibre increasing forest area carbon stored and no deforestation there has been an increase of around 400000 hectares ha of forest in latvia since 2000 this is due to natural afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands and also to an improvement in forest inventory analysis in 2009 which provided a more accurate assessment of land use and forestry data since 2010 the forest area has increased by 55000 ha there is no evidence of deforestation primary land use latvia there has also been a substantial increase in forest carbon or growing stock this increased by 106 million cubic metres m 3  since 2000 75 hardwood and by 33 million m 3 since 2010 57 hardwood increase in forest carbon limited hardwood markets a proportion of the increase in hardwood volume in 2009 was due to the improvement of forest inventory calculations but also due to increased natural regeneration on unutilised land the hardwood forest in latvia and the baltic region is quite different to that of the us south  in the baltics there is prolific hardwood regeneration birch alder and aspen which grows quite rapidly there are limited markets for structural timber therefore hardwoods produce a lot of lowgrade wood fibre there are no domestic pulp markets in latvia and only limited markets for panel board therefore much of the lowgrade wood fibre can only be used for firewood and biomass the chart below shows a minor change in species composition from planted pine to naturally regenerated spruce and aspen  the most prolific regenerators in this region varied species mix planting and regeneration state owned forests have a higher proportion of planted forest areas compared to the private sector where natural regeneration is preferred due to lower costs planting allows the owner to control the species mix quality and growth whereas regeneration can be more of a lottery for both quality and species mix as more corporate owners emerge planting with improved stock may increase restocking practice by ownership category how the financial crisis impacted latvian forests harvesting levels have been consistently below net annual increment since 2000 there have been some fluctuations in the annual allowable cut in state forests particularly following the global financial crisis in 2008 harvesting in the private sector declined due to falling prices and sawnwood production dropped by 42 in 2009 compared to 2006 during that period stateowned forest increased harvesting in order to support the industry in the absence of strong markets and private sector supply postrecession the harvesting balance returned and demand for wood products increased the current surplus of growth compared to removals is around 55 million m 3 pa or a growth drain ratio of 16 surplus of growth compared to removals biomass and pulp prices increasing wood pellet exports have had limited impact on wood prices the feedstock for this market fuelwood  forest chip has limited competition and therefore remains fairly stable pulpwood markets are driven by export demand to scandinavia and can be volatile as this market fluctuates 2018 saw a substantial spike in pulpwood prices due to increased export demand as a response to a global increase in pulp and paper prices boosting scandinavian production this had a minor knock on effect on the domestic fuelwood markets variation of lowgrade wood prices with changing demand an important part of this analysis is to look for evidence to evaluate draxs performance against its new forest commitments  some of which relate directly to these trends and data sets pine forest in latvia below the consultant summarises the evidence of biomass impacts against key metrics in the forest industry of latvia is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes in  forest area  forest cover no impact both forest area and forest cover have increased during the last two decades the main driver of the growing forest area has been the natural regeneration of agricultural lands that were left uncultivated during the soviet regime forest growing stock no impact forest growing stock has steadily increased throughout the observation period the main driver for harvesting level is the roundwood demand from sawmills panel mills and export woodbased bioenergy demand may increase thinnings and residue collection but it is not as significant a driver for total harvests as the aforementioned exported pellets have accounted for approximately 1014 of the total volume of annual harvests in recent years depending on the assumed average dry densities of the harvested wood and pellets harvesting levels no impact  slight increasing impact the national felling volume is only about 65 of the national forest increment the total harvesting area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings and increased share of clearcuts a decline in both area and volume of fellings can be seen between 20022008 and 20102016 the main drivers of harvesting levels are sawmill industry panel industry and export demand however wood demand for energy purposes can still improve the overall income for the forest owner and therefore increase the total harvesting levels in private forests harvesting residue collection increasing impact most of the collected residues originate from clearcuts in state forests most produced harvesting residues are left in situ and they are not overexploited collection of wood residues from harvesting operations has been increasing for the last 15 years as a result of increased capacities and demand from heat and chp plants latvia is increasingly relying on woody biomass for energy generation forest growth  carbon sequestration potential no apparent impact the total forest area and growing stock have grown in the last decade according to latvias national forestry accounting plan 20212025 the forests are decreasing their ghg sequestration capacity even a low sequestration rate increases carbon storage which explains the increases in forest growing stock and area the decrease in ghg sequestration capacity is due to forest ageing emissions from soils and the increased share of broadleaved forests which have lower carbon accumulation capacity than conifers removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are an input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes to forest management practices  rotation lengths no impact the law on forests regulates minimum forest age and diameter for clearcuts the lvm and largescale forest owners often conduct clearcuts at minimum diameter whereas smallholders tend to wait until roundwood prices are high due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations thinnings increasing impact in naturally afforested former agricultural lands no impacts on thinnings overall the total harvested area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings due to existing forest age structure and increased share of clearcuts most of the harvesting residues are collected from clearcuts there is an increased demand for small diameter wood and harvestingprocessing residues overall the increased demand for smalldiameter hardwood has increased harvesting in previously unmanaged afforested agricultural lands which usually overgrow with broadleaved trees these kinds of lands are usually otherwise not significant for forest management conversion from hardwood to softwood no impact no indication of hardwood conversion to softwood was found instead pine forests are decreasing due to the favouring of natural regeneration which usually results in spruce or broadleaved forests in nutrientrich andor wet soils is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has impacted solid wood products markets  diversion from other wood product markets no apparent impact production of sawnwood and woodbased panels have increased or remained steady ie no evidence of diversion several interviews confirmed that sawlogs are not processed for other products besides sawnwood and woodbased panels wood prices no apparent impact prices of all wood assortments increased in 20172018 most notably the prices of pulpwood this was due to difficult harvesting conditions and increased demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden because of high market pulp prices pulpwood prices returned to presurge levels in 2019 fuelwood prices also increased temporarily but at a much more moderate rate the main driver for fuelwood price increases was the

arboriculture  forests  wood pellets  latvia  biomass energy changing forest structure in virginia and north carolina 21 may 2020 sustainable bioenergy forest owners have responded to the recovery in pine sawtimber markets since the global financial crisis of 2008 by planting more forest and investing more in the management of their land the same period has witnessed increased demand from the biomass sector which has replaced declining need for wood from pulp and paper markets the area of timberland  actively managed productive forest  has increase by around 89000 hectares ha since 2010 this change is due to three important factors new planting on agricultural land the planting of lowgrade selfseeded areas with more productive improved pine and the reclassification by the us forest service usfs of some areas of naturally regenerated pine from woodland to timberland the 2018 data shows that pine forest makes up 46 of the timberland area of which 61 is planted and the remainder naturally regenerated hardwoods cover 43 of the timberland area with 93 of this naturally regenerated the remaining area is mixed stands composition of timberland area since 2000 there have been some significant changes in the composition of the timberland area with a transition from hardwood to softwood pine has increased from 39 of the total area in 2000 to 46 in 2018 and hardwood has decreased from 50 to 43 over the same period all pine areas have increased since 2000 with naturally regenerated pine increasing by 13000 ha and planted pine by 340000 ha since 2000 mixed stands have declined by 6500 ha as some of these sites have been replanted with improved pine to increase growth and sawtimber production the biggest change has been in the hardwood areas where there has been a decline of around 314000 ha despite the total area of timberland increasing by 31000 ha change in forest type this change has been driven by private forest owners representing 91 of the total timberland area seeking to gain a better return on investment from their forest land hardwood markets have declined since the 2008 recession and demand for hardwood sawtimber has not recovered demand for pine sawtimber has rebounded and is now as strong as precrisis pine also offers much faster growth rates and higher total volumes in a much shorter time frame typically 2535 years compared to 7580 years for hardwoods the decision to change species is similar to a farmer changing their agricultural crops based on market demand and prices for each product where forests are managed for revenue generation then it is reasonable to optimise the land and crop for this objective this can be a significant positive from a carbon perspective more carbon is sequestered in a shorter time frame and more carbon is stored in long term wood products if the quantity if sawtimber is increased increased revenue generation also helps to maintain the forest area rather than conversion to urban development agriculture or other uses a potential negative is the change in habitat from a pure hardwood stand to a pure pine stand each providing a different ecosystem and supporting a different range of flora and fauna there is no conclusive evidence that one forest type is better or worse than the other there is a great deal of variety of each type some hardwood forests are rich in species and biodiversity others can be unremarkable the key is not to endanger or risk losing any species or sensitive habitat and to ensure that any conversion only occurs where there is no loss of biodiversity and no negative impact to the ecosystem it is not clear whether all of the lost hardwood stands have been directly converted to pine forests some hardwood stands may have been lost to other land uses urban and other land has increased by 400000 ha some may have been directly converted to pine by forest owners encouraged by the increase in pine sawtimber demand and prices whatever the primary driver of this change it is clearly not being driven by the biomass sector change in forest type  timing the chart above demonstrates that the biggest change loss of hardwood and increase in planted pine occurred between 2000 and 2012 prior to the operation of the pellet mills since 2012 there has been no significant loss of natural hardwood and only a small decline in planted hardwood

there have been some significant changes in forest type  the overall area of forest has increased and there is no evidence of deforestation occurring land use by area since 2000 the total volume of standing timber in the catchment area has increased by 170 million cubic metres m 3  sixty five percent of this increase has occurred since 2012 indicating a growingmaturing forest resource and an expanding forest area most of the increase in volume has been in the sawtimber categories for both pine and hardwood although the hardwood pulpwood size class has also increased by nearly 10 million m 3 since 2012 following a small decline between 2000 and 2012 timber inventory by product category the increased demand from the three enviva pellet mills beginning operation in 2012 in the chesapeake region appears to have had no negative impact of the accumulation of forest carbon in the growing stock of the region since this time all categories of timber product have increased timber inventory by product category  pre and postenviva this increase in inventory is also reflected in the comparison of average annual growth to removals the surplus of uncut growth has increased substantially since 2010 from 47 million m 3 per year to 159 million m 3 pa over this period annual growth has increased by 355 whereas removals have decreased by 86 annual growth vs removals and surplus volume demand for timber products has fluctuated since 2000 the global financial crisis in 200809 impacted all product categories but particularly pine and hardwood sawtimber where there was a combined drop of over five million tonnes in 2010 compared to 2000 this was a loss of over 20 of total annual demand in the catchment area pine sawtimber has now recovered to precrisis levels but hardwood demand has remained low hardwood pulpwood demand also declined around this time with the closure and decline of existing pulp mills in the catchment area demand had fallen by one million tonnes pa by 2011 prior to the enviva pellet mills opening from 2012 the new biomass demand enabled the hardwood pulpwood market to recover to precrisis levels with demand in 2018 at almost exactly the same level as in 2000 annual demand by product category this fluctuation in demand is reflected in the average annual stumpage price data shown on the chart below this is the value that the forest owner gets for each product the trends are generally as expected with the exception of the hardwood sawtimber price which has increased substantially despite a decrease in demand this is due to supply chain issues reduced capacity of loggers and access to land average annual stumpage prices detailed below is an edited version of the consultants review and analysis of key issues in the catchment area the full version can be found in the main report is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows the opposite the total area of timberland in the enviva chesapeake catchment area has increased an estimated 82818 hectares 18 since enviva pellets ahoskie commenced full production in 2012 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no  inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area since 2012 but there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand has caused these changes conversion of hardwood and mixed pinehardwood timberland to planted pine timberland has occurred in the catchment area diversion from other markets no  inconclusive since 2012 pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has decreased 19 however this decrease is largely attributed to decreased demand from the pulppaper sector also demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs have increased an estimated 14 and 7 respectively since 2012 an unexpected increase in wood prices no  inconclusive the increase in hardwood biomass demand coincided with price increases of 1024 for delivered hardwood pulpwood these price increases were likely linked to a combination of both supply chain issues shortage of local loggers following pulppaper mill closures in the region and elevated prices offered by enviva to ensure guaranteed wood supply for the first several years of operation as prices for delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chips proceeded to decline 16 and 9 respectively from 2014 to2017 once the market stabilised since 2014 prices for pine products have held flat even though softwood raw material purchases demand by enviva have more than doubled in this catchment area changes in pine pulpwood and pine chip prices are largely driven by demand attributed to the pulppaper sector a reduction in growing stock timber no total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 19 from 2012 through 2018 over this period inventories increased as follows for each of the five major timber products 33 for pine sawtimber 23 for pine chipnsaw 14 for pine pulpwood 12 for hardwood sawtimber and 14 for hardwood pulpwood the increase in timber inventory can be linked to a combination of increased forest area additional hectares  additional inventory and annual harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment area forest ie annual growth has continued to exceed annual removals resulting in increased inventory levels a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock timber has increased slightly since 2012 increased timber growth ratescarbon sequestration rates can be linked to a combination of changes in species composition and silvicultural practices softwood pine grows at a much quicker rate compared to hardwood species and in the enviva chesapeake catchment area pine timberland area increased from 436 of total timberland area in 2011 to 460 in 2018 also improvements in silviculture have continued to enhance growth and overall productivity together these factors help explain how average per hectare volume growth increased from 59 m3 in 2011 to 77 m3 in 2018 an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no in 2018 the latest available growthtoremovals ratio for pine and hardwood pulpwood the timber products utilised by bioenergy equalled 249 and 276 respectively a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area what has been the impact of bioenergy demand on timber growing stock inventory neutral total wood demand increased an estimated 14 from 20122018 and much of that increase can be attributed to increased demand from bioenergy in this catchment area inventories are so substantial that increases in demand from bioenergy as well as from other sources have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth total growing stock inventory has continued to increase  an average of 29 per year since enviva first entered this market in 2012 timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have increased for pine sawtimber pine chipnsaw pine pulpwood and hardwood pulpwood since 2012 hardwood sawtimber growth rates have declined slightly evidence suggests these overall increases in growth rates are linked to changes in age class distribution ie a younger forest not due to changes in bioenergy demand forest area positive  neutral total forest timberland area in the catchment area increased nearly 83000 hectares 18 from 2012 through 2018 the latest available our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found a strong positive correlation between these two variables but also a moderately strong correlation between softwood sawlog demand and forest area wood prices neutral  negative the additional wood demand placed on this market by enviva from 20122014 coincided with a 19 increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 24 increase in delivered hardwood pulpwood price pine and hardwood chip prices also increased 1011 over this period analysis found evidence that increases in hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices can be linked to increases in total hardwood pulpwood demand however given that hardwood bioenergy demand has accounted for over 75 of total hardwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2014 it is reasonable to conclude that hardwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy has had some level of impact on delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices markets for solid wood products positive in the enviva chesapeake catchment area demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased 15 and 9 respectively from 20122018 a byproduct of the sawmilling process are sawmill residuals  a material utilied by envivas three mills to produce wood pellets with the increased production of both softwood and hardwood lumber so too has come an increase in sawmill residuals some of which has been purchasedconsumed by enviva not only has enviva benefited from the greater availability of this byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as envivas three mills have provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts forest landowners positive increased demand attributed to bioenergy has been a positive for forest landowners in the chesapeake catchment area not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood particularly hardwood pulpwood but the increase in pulpwood prices as a result of an overall increase in both softwood and hardwood pulpwood demand has transferred through to landowners improved compensation specifically since 2013 the first year all three enviva pellet mills were operating hardwood pulpwood stumpage price  the price paid to landowners  has averaged roughly 560 per
