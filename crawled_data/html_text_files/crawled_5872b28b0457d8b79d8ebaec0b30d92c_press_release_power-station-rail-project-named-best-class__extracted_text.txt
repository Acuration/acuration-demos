power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station power station rail project named as best in class a project which built speciallydesigned freight wagons to carry millions of tonnes of biomass a year to the uks biggest power station and breathed new life into a disused rail yard has been hailed as the best in the industry 19 september 2018 the partnership between drax power station near selby in north yorkshire and davis wagon services saw a new fleet of freight wagons designed and built to deliver the biomass needed to produce renewable electricity for millions of homes it also enabled davis wagon services a north lincolnshirebased rail firm to invest 850000 in revamping a mothballed ferrybridge rail yard as a dedicated site to rebrand and maintain the power stations fleet of 225 unique freight wagons securing local jobs in the process now the programme has been named as the project of the year by industry body the rail freight group in recognition of the innovation involved in the work by drax and davis wagon services the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer the wagons which transport biomass from ports on the east and west coasts of the uk to drax are maintained at the newly reopened ferrybridge yard just over 20 miles away from the power station john hall md of davis wagon services said this is a monumental achievement for us and to be recognised in this way for the work weve done is incredible we couldnt have done it without the support of drax there are so many outstanding projects in our industry and so to be singled out like this is a huge compliment to everyone who worked on the project drax power ceo andy koss said this was an important project for us and im delighted that the innovation and hard work of everyone involved has been recognised in this way these trains deliver up to 20000 tonnes of biomass every day to the power station playing a vital part in supplying renewable power to millions of homes and businesses furthermore the project has helped support a local business and revitalise a disused facility within the northern powerhouse region which were very proud to be a part of the rail project  described as a  northern powerhouse success story in july by government minister jake berry  began in 2011 when drax appointed davis along with lloyds register rail ricardo to design and develop bespoke rail wagons to ferry biomass to the power station the largest decarbonisation project in europe it also saw davis take on the work to maintain the 225 wagons and the firm will also now rebrand each one over the next two years in new livery featuring both drax and the northern powerhouse logos ends media contacts ali lewis drax group interim head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 mark duffell mcd communications ltd e email protected t 01484968238 m 07969080272 editors notes the majority of the biomass drax uses comes from north america and europe on ships to ports on the east and west coasts of the uk immingham hull port of tyne and liverpool it is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day over a sixday working week in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 15 per cent of the uks renewable electricity each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the uk with enough electricity for a year the fuel is transported to drax via rail rather than road to further reduce carbon emissions as it is more efficient than road transportation using rail saves approximately 270000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 3262250 tonnes of c02 per year independent research by oxford economics using 2016 data showed that drax supported over 18500 jobs across the country  more than 6000 of which were across the north of england yorkshire and humber north west and north east in addition drax generated 577m for the northern powerhouse regional economy and 17 billion for the whole of the uk about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax power ltd which operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe haven power  based in ipswich supplies electricity to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses drax biomass  is based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests supplying fuel used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks
