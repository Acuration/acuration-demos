catchment area analyses for drax looks at the fibre sourcing area surrounding a number of compressed wood pellet plants operated by georgia biomass now owned by enviva and fram renewable fuels the evidence found in the report by hood consulting shows a substantial increase in forest inventory stored carbon and a relatively stable forest area however with continued pressure from urban development future losses of timberland area are possible despite this increasing growth rates can maintain and improve wood supply and carbon stock for the foreseeable future increasing forest growing stock and carbon sequestration the overall inventory of growing stock in the catchment area has increased by 63 million cubic metres m 3  between 2000 and 2018 a growth of 193 all of this increase has been in the pine area which increased by nearly 68 million m 3  whereas the hardwood species decreased in volume by 45 million m 3  overall the inventory volume split by species in 2018 was 72 to 28 softwood to hardwood the breakdown by product category is shown in figure 3 below figure 1 change in growing stock by major product category and species usfs the pine sawtimber and chipnsaw product categories larger dimension and higher value material showed the largest increase in inventory whereas pine pulpwood decreased in total volume the most substantial change occurred from 2010 to 2018 where pulpwood went from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend and sawtimber increased in volume much more rapidly  this is shown in table 1 and figure 2 below change cubic metres m3 pine sawtimber pine chipnsaw pine pulpwood hardwood sawtimber hardwood pulpwood total 20002018 51301628 22277139 5835230 1211110 5657114 63297533 20002010 14722995 12707674 5262192 3740507

class in the catchment area with younger stands of pine previously classed as pulpwood growing into a larger size class and being reclassified as sawtimber this means that the volume of sawtimber availability in future will be significantly higher but pulpwood availability will be diminished for pellet mill markets any loss in pulpwood availability can be compensated by an increase in sawmill residue production if market demand is maintained or increased figure 2 change in growing stock by major product category and species usfs growth rates for both softwood and hardwood species have been increasing since 2000 as shown in figure 3 below softwood growth has increased by 185 since 2000 and hardwood by 14 the improved softwood growth rate probably resulted from increased investment in the management of pine forests the superior quality of seedlings and better management practice ground preparation weed control fertilisation etc this is a very positive trend for the sequestration rate of carbon and also for providing landowners with the potential to increase revenue per hectare and encourage the retention and improved management of forests rather than converting to other land uses the georgia catchment area is likely split between passive owners that do not actively manage where growth rates are slower or decline and the incentive to convert land is greater and owners that actively manage to improve growth and quality increasing revenue and maintaining productive forest there is likely to be a much greater differential in growth rate between these two management approaches than reflected by the trend in figure 3 highlighting the importance of active management for carbon abatement figure 3 average annual growth rate per hectare usfs stable forest area at a macro scale the distribution of land use categories has remained relatively stable since 2000 with no apparent major shifts in land use the timberland area around the seven mills has decreased by around 135 thousand hectares ha between 2000 and 2018 23 of the total land area whilst the area of arable and urban land increased by 98 thousand 17 of total area and 158 thousand 27 of total area ha respectively in 2018 timberland represented 67 of total land area and all forest and woodland 80 of total area down from 69 and 82 respectively in 2000 figure 1 figure 4 change in land use category usda looking at this change in land use more closely the timberland area shows the most pronounced decline between 2010 and 2018 a drop of 117 thousand ha the largest change in other land use categories over this period was an increase of 97 thousand ha in urban and other land suggesting that a large proportion of the timberland area has been converted to urban areas the most significant change in agricultural land occurred prior to 2010 when the timberland area remained relatively stable this change appears to have involved the transition of pastureland to arable crops there may also have been some reclassification of forest and woodland types with a decrease in the area of woodland and an increase in forestland during the period between 2000 and 2010 table 2 change hectares ha

albeit small in absolute area relative to the total catchment area size and the steady increase in urban land georgia ranks 8 th in the list of us states and territories by total population with 106 million and 17 th by population density at 184 per square mile mi 2  compared to just 63 per mi 2 in mississippi where draxs amite bioenergy abe pellet plant is located and 108 per mi 2 in louisiana where the morehouse bioenergy mbe and lasalle bioenergy lbe mills are located us census bureau this population pressure and increased development can lead to more forest loss and land use change figure 5 trends in major land use categories usda draxs suppliers in the georgia catchment area have made a commitment not to source wood from areas where land use change is taking place this commitment is monitored and verified through the sustainable biomass program sbp certification process that is maintained by each mill any land use change in the catchment area is likely to be a result of prevailing economic drivers in the region rather than due to actions being taken by the pellet producers increasing demand and surplus forest growth strong markets are essential for ensuring that forests are managed and restocked to optimum benefit sawlog markets are particularly important as this is highest revenue stream for forest owners figure 6 shows the trend in market demand for each major product category since 2000 and demonstrates the recent increase in softwood sawlog demand as the us economy particularly housing starts recovered from the global recession at the end of the last decade softwood pulpwood demand increased through the 2000s but has remained relatively stable since 2011 with the exception of a peak during 2018 which resulted from an increase in volume generated by salvage operations after hurricane michael figure 6 demand for wood products usfs tms the comparison of average annual growth and removals in the georgia catchment area is much more tightly balance than in draxs other supply regions as shown in figure 7 since 2000 the average annual surplus of growth has been around 36 million m 3 with both demand and growth increasing in recent years figure 7 average annual growth removals and surplus usfs as shown in figures 2  3 growth rates are strong and inventory is increasing this is not a problem in the georgia area the relatively small surplus as compared to other catchment areas in the us south is due to the higher concentration of wood fibre markets and the more intense forest industry activity in this region as of july 2020 there were over 50 major woodconsuming mills operating within the georgia catchment area and an additional 80 mills operating within close proximity overlapping the catchment area total pulpwood demand in 2019 was 129 million tons of which approximately 87 was attributed to nonbioenergyrelated sources predominantly pulppaper and 13 was attributed to the bioenergy sector given the bioenergy sectors low ranking position in the market with the lowest ability to pay for fibre combined with the relatively small scale in demand compared to the pulp and paper industry the influence of biomass markets can be considered to be minimal in this region particular when it comes to impacts on wood prices and forest management practice wood price trends pine sawtimber prices suffered a significant decline between 2000 and 2010 dropping almost 21 per ton as a result of the global financial crisis and the decline in demand due to the collapse in housing markets and construction table 3 since 2010 pine sawtimber has remained relatively stable with some minor fluctuations shown in figure 8 below change ton pine sawtimber pine chipnsaw pine pulpwood hardwood sawtimber hardwood pulpwood 20002019

more significant increase since 2011 this increase does not reflect an increase in demand or total volume which has remained relatively stable over this period but a shifting of the geographic distribution of the market with some new mills opening and old mills closing resulting in increased competition in some localised fibre baskets and leading to an overall increase in stumpage price figure 8 stumpage price trends tms figure 9 below shows that with the exception of the hurricane salvage volume in 2018 pulpwood removals have declined or remained relatively stable since 2010 whereas pulpwood stumpage prices increased by 41 from 2010 to 2018 figure 9 pulpwood demand and stumpage price usfs tms comparing this stumpage price trend with other catchment areas of the us south figure 10 where drax sources wood pellets the georgia area is on average 35 higher than the next highest area chesapeake and 87 higher than the lowest cost area amite bioenergy in mississippi this price differential is predominantly due to the scale of demand and availability of surplus lowgrade fibre figure 10 comparison of pine pulpwood stumpage prices in drax supply areas us south tms hood consulting summary of the impact of the seven pellet plants on key trends and metrics in this catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows a 108130hectare 26 decrease in total timberland in the georgia catchment area since georgia biomass first full year of production in 2012 specifically this loss in total area of timberland coincided with a more than 21000hectare increase in croplandpastureland and a more than 73000hectare increase in urban land and land classified as having other uses however there is little evidence to suggest that increased wood demand from the bioenergy sector has caused this decrease in total timberland furthermore pine timberland  the primary source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry  has increased more than 17000 hectares in the catchment area since 2016 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last two decades however there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand which accounts for roughly 1014 of total pulpwood demand and only 57 of total wood demand in the catchment area has caused or is responsible for these changes clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region both of which are longstanding widely used methods of harvesting timber timbermartsouth tms data shows that thinnings accounted for 67 of total reported harvest area in the southeast georgia market from 20002010 but only 43 of total harvest area reported from 20122019 specifically this downward shift was initiated by the bursting of the us housing bubble in the mid2000s and had been completed by the early 2010s wed like to note that this shift coincided with a nearly 50 decrease in pine sawtimber stumpage price from 20062012 this is important because the strength of pine sawtimber markets had been a driving force behind timber management decisions in this region in the early and mid2000s also contributing to the decreased prevalence of thinnings was the strengthening of pine pulpwood markets in the mid2000s as pine pulpwood stumpage prices increased more than 40 in the georgia catchment area from 20032008 so with sawtimber markets continuing to weaken and pulpwood markets doing just the opposite the data suggests that many landowners decided to alter their management approach to take advantage of strong pulpwood markets and focus on short pulpwood rotations that typically do not utilize thinnings ultimately the shift in management approach that occurred in this market can be linked to the weakening of one type of timber market and the strengthening of another in the early and mid2000s timber management was focused on sawtimber production  a type of management that utilizes thinnings however for more than a decade now this market has been driven to a large degree by the pulppaper industry with a significant portion of the timber management in this area focused on short pulpwood rotations diversion from other markets no demand for softwood pine sawlogs increased an estimated 39 in the georgia catchment area from 20112019 also increased bioenergy demand has caused no diversion from other pulpwood markets ie pulppaper as pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy held steady and remained nearly unchanged from 20122017 before increasing in 2018 and 2019 due to the influx of salvage wood brought about by hurricane michael wed like to make special note that increased demand for softwood sawlogs since 2011 has not resulted in a full pine sawtimber pst stumpage price recovery in this market reduced demand for softwood sawlogs in the late 2000s and early 2010s resulted in oversupply and this oversupply has remained despite increased demand the last 68 years as a result pst stumpage prices have held steady and averaged roughly 30 per ton in the catchment area since 2013  down approximately 35 from the 20002006 average of more than 46 per ton but up roughly 15 from the 20112012 average of approximately 26 per ton an unexpected or abnormal increase in wood prices no  inconclusive the delivered price of pine pulpwood ppw  the primary roundwood product consumed by both georgia biomass and fram  increased 26 in the georgia catchment area over the six years directly following the startup of georgia biomass increasing from 2916 per ton in 2011 to 3663 per ton in 2017 and while this 26 increase in delivered ppw price coincided with a roughly 11 million metric ton increase in annual pine pulpwood demand from georgia biomass and fram total demand for pine pulpwood from both bioenergy and other sources actually decreased 7 over this period moreover evidence suggest that this increase in ppw price is more closely linked to changes in wood supply specifically the 9 decrease in ppw inventory from 20112017 however there is evidence that links increased demand from the bioenergy sector to an increase in secondary residual ie sawmill chips sawdust and shavings prices specifically the price of pine sawmill chips  a residual feedstock utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production  held steady and averaged approximately 26 per ton in the georgia catchment area from 20082012 however from 20122016 pine sawmill chip prices increased more than 15 to 2955 per ton in 2016 this increase in price coincided with annual pine residual feedstock purchases by georgia biomass and fram increasing from roughly 325000 metric tons to nearly 10 million metric tons over this period however note that pine sawmill chip prices have held steady and averaged roughly 2950 per ton in the catchment area since 2016 despite further increases in pine secondary residual purchases by georgia biomass and fram to more than 12 million metric tons in 2019 ultimately the data suggests that any excess supply of pine secondary residuals in the catchment area was absorbed by the bioenergy sector in the early and mid2010s and the additional demandcompetition placed on this market led to increased residual prices however the plateauing of residual prices since 2015 along with the continued increase in secondary residual purchases by georgia biomass and fram further suggest that an increasing percentage of secondary residual purchases by the bioenergy sector is sourced from outside the catchment area specifically fram confirmed this notion noting that 3540 of its secondary residual purchases come from outside the georgia catchment area from six different states in the us south a reduction in growing stock timber no total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 11 from 2011 through 2018 the latest available specifically over this period inventories of pine sawtimber and chipnsaw increased 35 and 13 respectively however pine pulpwood inventory decreased 11 from 20112018 note that the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory was not due to increased demand from bioenergy or other sources or increased harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area  as annual growth of pine pulpwood has exceeded annual removals every year since 2011 rather this decrease can be linked to the 24 decline in pine sawtimber removals that occurred from 20052014 due to the bursting of the us housing bubble and great recession that followed in this region timber is typically harvested via clearcut once it reaches maturity ie sawtimber grade after which the stand is reestablished and the cycle repeated however with the reduced harvest levels during this period also came a reduction in newly reestablished timber stands  the source of pine pulpwood so with less replantings occurring during this period inventories of pine pulpwood were not replenished to the same degree they had been previously and therefore this catchment area saw a reduction in pine pulpwood inventory levels however according to the us forest service annual removals of pine sawtimber have increased 50 in the georgia catchment area since 2014 which would suggest higher clearcut levels and increased stand reestablishment timbermartsouth data also supports this assertion as clearcut harvests have constituted approximately 60 of the total harvest area reported to timbermartsouth in this region since 2014 compared to 40 from 20052014 ultimately these increases in clearcut and stand reestablishment levels may not be reflected in increased pine pulpwood inventory levels in the short term  as it can take more than 10 years for a pine seedling to become merchantable and reach the minimum diameter requirements to be classified as pulpwood however adequate supply levels are expected to remain in the meantime furthermore pine pulpwood inventory levels are expected to increase in the midtolong terms as a result of the increased harvest levels and stand reestablishment levels that have occurred in the catchment area since 2014 a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no  inconclusive us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber has remained nearly unchanged holding between 60 and 61 in the catchment area since 2011 which would suggest that the sequestration rate of carbon has also changed very little in the catchment area the last 810 years however the 11 increase in total growing stock inventory since 2011 does indicate that total carbon storage levels have increased in the georgia catchment area since georgia biomass commenced operations in this market an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals gr ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual harvests provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2018 the latest available the gr ratio for pine pulpwood the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector equaled 106 a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels note however that the pine pulpwood gr ratio averaged 144 from 20122017 the significant drop in 2018 was due to a 31 increase in removals due to hurricane michael and is not reflective of the new norm specifically pine pulpwood removals are projected to be more in line with pre2018 levels in 2019 and 2020 and so too is the pine pulpwood gr ratio timber growing stock inventory neutral according to usfs data inventories of pine pulpwood decreased 11 in the catchment area from 20112018 however that decrease was not due to increased demand from bioenergy typically a reduction in inventory is linked to harvest levels above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area but in this case annual growth of pine pulpwood exceeded annual removals every year during this period ultimately the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory from 20112018 can be linked to decreased pine sawtimber production beginning in the mid2000s specifically annual removals of pine sawtimber decreased 24 from 20052014 and the reduction in harvest levels during this period meant fewer new pine stands were reestablished and that has led to the current reduction in pine pulpwood inventory note that the decrease in pine sawtimber removals from 20052014 was mirrored by a 27 increase in pine sawtimber inventory over this same period however usfs data shows that annual removals of pine sawtimber have increased 50 in the georgia catchment area since 2014 which suggests that pine pulpwood inventory levels will start to increase in the catchment area due to increased harvest levels and the subsequent increase in stand reestablishment levels timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have increased for both pine sawtimber and pine chipnsaw but decreased slightly for pine pulpwood in the catchment area since 2011 evidence suggests that this decrease in pine pulpwood growth rate is not due to increases in bioenergy demand but rather linked to changes in diameter class distribution and indicative of a forest in a state of transition where timber is moving up in product class ie pine pulpwood is moving up in classification to pine chipnsaw forest area neutral in the georgia catchment area total forest area timberland decreased more than 115000 hectares 28 from 2011 through 2018 note that this decrease coincided with a roughly 19000hectare increase in cropland and 93000hectare increase in urban land and land classified as having other uses specifically pine timberland the primary source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry decreased over 34000 hectares from 20112016 however from 20162018 pine timberland stabilized and rather increased more than 17000 hectares in the catchment area or a net decrease of roughly 17000 hectares from 20112018 ultimately there is little evidence that the decrease in pine timberland from 20112016 or increase since 2016 is linked to increased bioenergy demand rather the overall decrease in pine timberland since 2011 appears to be more closely linked to the relative weakness of pine sawtimber markets in the georgia catchment area and the lack of return from sawtimber wood prices positive  negative intuitively an increase in demand should result in an increase in price and this is what the data shows in the georgia catchment area as it relates to increased biomass demand from georgia biomass and fram and the prices of the various raw materials consumed by these mills specifically the 14million metric ton increase in softwood pulpwood demand attributed to georgia biomass and fram coincided with a 20 increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 1015 increase in pine chip prices from 20112015 since 2015 biomass demand has held relatively steady and overall so too have delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices the apparent link between increased bioenergy demand and increased pine raw material prices is supported further by statistical analysis as strong positive correlations were found between softwood biomass demand and both delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices however note that biomass demand alone is not responsible for these changes in prices as softwood biomass demand accounts for only 1015 of total softwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area rather the prices of these raw materials are impacted to a larger degree by demand from other sources ie pulppaper which accounts for 8590 of total softwood pulpwood demand in the georgia catchment area on the other hand its also important to note that the increase in bioenergyrelated wood demand has been a positive for forest landowners in the georgia catchment area not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood in this market but the increase in pulpwood prices as a result of increased pulpwood demand has transferred through to landowners improved compensation specifically since 2015 pine pulpwood ppw stumpage price  the price paid to landowners  has averaged more than 17 per ton in the georgia catchment area this represents a 70 increase over the approximately 10 per ton averaged by ppw stumpage in the catchment area over the last five years prior to georgia biomass startup in 2q 2011 note pine pulpwood stumpage prices are notably higher in the georgia catchment area due to a much tighter balance in supply and demand in comparison to most other markets across the us south for instance in all other areas across the us south2 ppw stumpage prices have averaged less than 9 per ton since 2015 or roughly half that of prices in the georgia catchment area markets for solid wood products positive in the georgia catchment area demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased an estimated 39 from 20112019 and byproducts of the sawmilling process are sawmill residuals  materials utilized by georgia biomass and the fram mills to produce wood pellets with the increased production of softwood lumber so too has come an increase in sawmill residuals some of which have been purchasedconsumed by georgia biomass and fram not only have these pellet producers benefited from the greater availability of this byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as the georgia biomass and fram

what is biomass 21 august 2020 sustainable bioenergy what is biomass in ecological terms biomass refers to any type of organic matter when it comes to energy biomass is any organic matter that can be used to generate energy for example wood forest residues or plant materials how is biomass used biomass used and combusted for energy can come in a number of different forms ranging from compressed wood pellets  which are used in power stations that have upgraded from coal  to biogas and biofuels a liquid fuel that can be used to replace fossil fuels in transport the term biomass also refers to any type of organic material used for energy in domestic settings for example wood burned in wood stoves and wood pellets used in domestic biomass boilers  biomass is organic matter like wood forest residues or plant material that is used to generate energy where does biomass come from biomass can be produced from different sources including agricultural or forestry residues dedicated energy crops or waste products such as uneaten food drax power station uses compressed wood pellets sourced from sustainably managed working forests in the us canada europe and brazil and are largely made up of lowgrade wood produced as a byproduct of the production and processing of higher value wood products like lumber and furniture biomass producers and users must meet a range of stringent measures for their biomass to be certified as sustainable and responsibly sourced  is biomass renewable biomass grown through sustainable means is classified as a renewable source of energy because of the process of its growth as biomass comes from organic living matter it grows naturally absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere in the process it means when biomass is combusted as a source of energy  for example for heat or electricity production  the co 2 released is offset by the amount of co 2 it absorbed from the atmosphere while it was growing fast facts in 2019 biomass accounted for 6 of great britains electricity generation more than 16 of the total generation of all renewable sources there is about 550 gigatonnes of biomass carbon on earth in total humans make up around 110000 th of that mass modern biomass was first developed as an alternative for oil after its price spiked as a result of the 1973 yom kippur war the international energy agency iea estimates bioenergy accounts for roughly 110 th of the worlds total energy supply biomass is a renewable sustainable form of energy used around the world how long has biomass been used as a source of energy biomass has

wood and wood products remains a widely used energy source for many countries around the world  both for domestic consumption and at grid scale through power stations where its often used to replace fossil fuels with much higher lifecycle carbon emissions drax power station has been using compressed wood pellets a form of biomass since 2003 when it began research and development work cofiring it

arboriculture  forests  forestscope  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets what is reforestation and afforestation sustainable bioenergy what is reforestation and afforestation reforestation is the process of planting trees in a forest where the number of trees has been decreasing afforestation is when new trees are planted or seeds are sown in an area where there were no trees before creating a new forest why carry out reforestation and afforestation reforestation and afforestation are two of the leading naturebased solutions for tackling the effects of climate change for commercial foresters and landowners these two practices are essential to ensuring they can grow wood for wood products and continuously meet demand in a sustainable way reforestation is crucial in combating or preventing deforestation or forest degradation where forests shrink in size or are completely removed as well as reducing a forests ability to absorb carbon dioxide co 2  deforestation can destroy wildlife habitats and contribute to the likelihood of flooding in certain areas afforestation can also help avoid desertification where fertile land turns into a desert as a result of drought or intensive agriculture reforestation is the process of planting native trees in a forest where the number of trees has been decreasing how does reforestation and afforestation limit the effects of climate change forests are a natural way of keeping the earths co 2 levels in check the more trees there are the more co 2 is captured and converted into oxygen through photosynthesis by absorbing co 2  forests help to lower the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and reduce the effects of climate change reforestation and afforestation help maximize these abilities of forests by increasing the overall amount of forested land on the planet did you know different types of forests such as tropical swamps or mangroves  all absorb co 2 at different rates the age of a forest also impacts absorption young rapidly growing trees absorb co 2 at a faster rate than more mature ones which have large amounts of carbon locked in already afforestation is when new trees are planted or seeds are sown in an area where there were no trees before what roles does reforestation play in commercial forestry the global wood products industry depends on sustainable forests to supply the wood needed to make furniture create construction materials and provide fuel for energy the supply chain will often start with whats called a  working forest   a commerciallyrun forest which is often privately owned the landowner will grow a working forest to a certain stage of maturity and then harvest some or all of the trees to sell the wood once the wood has been sold for use as lumber wood products or fuel the landowner will reforest the areas to regrow the trees foresters will typically do this in stages across their land to ensure there are multiple stands of forest at different stages of growth across their land which ensures there is consistent sustainable growth at all times fast facts in july 2019 ethiopia planted more than 353 million trees in 12 hours  which is believed to be an afforestation world record there are 7 billion hectares of treeless land on earth  where 12 trillion native tree saplings could naturally grow through afforestation increasing the earths forest cover by 25 could absorb 200 gigatonnes more co 2 from the atmosphere without infringing on existing cities or agricultural land go deeper theres a long history of sustainable thinking behind healthy productive working forests forests have long been a source of mystery and new discoveries are still being made today  reforestation and afforestation are both helping countries around

world away from the image of a sterile laboratory but the world of forestry is one that has seen significant scientific progress since the 18 th century when it first emerged as an area of study the development of environmental sciences and ecology as well as advances in biology and chemistry mean there are still new discoveries being made  from trees ability to talk to each other through underground fungi networks to forests positive impact on mental health  fostering greater awareness and understanding of fragile forest ecosystems such as the cypress swamps of the atchafalaya basin

cypress forests in the atchafalaya basin in louisiana are an example of a forest landscape where the suitable management practice is protection preservation and monitoring by enhancing the genetic stock tree breeding ensures seedlings and plants are better adapted to their environment soil water temperature nutrient level etc science can now help trees to grow more quickly storing more carbon it can also give trees better form  straighter trees can produce more sawtimber which can in turn lock more carbon in buildings made predominantly or partially of the natural renewable product that wood is but more than just uncovering surprising insights into the ins and outs of our natural world forestry science is contributing to a far bigger goal tackling climate change the science of forests when the scientific study of forests first emerged in 18 th century germany it was with the aim of sustainability in mind industries were concerned forests wouldnt be able to provide enough timber to meet demand so research began into how to manage them responsibly forestry today encompasses much more than just providing saw logs and the research going into it remains driven by the same goal to ensure sustainability its breadth however has grown the uk forestry commissions research and innovation strategy highlights the scope it should cover it must be forwardlooking to anticipate longterm challenges strategic to inform emerging policy issues and technical to support new and more efficient forestry practices pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets being able to deliver on this breadth has relied on rapid advances in technology  including taking forestry research into space the technology teaching us about trees as in almost every industry one of the major drivers of change in forestry is data  and the ability to collect data from forests is getting more advanced at ground level techniques like  sonic tomography allow foresters and researchers to see inside trees using sound waves measuring size decay and overall health this in turn offers a bigger picture of forests wellbeing at the other end of the scale satellites and mapping technology are playing a major role in advancing a macro view of the worlds forests  particularly in how they change over time as well as a potent tool in monitoring and helping fight deforestation  satellite images have revealed there is nine per cent more forest on earth than previously thought  space satellite with antenna and solar panels in space against the background of the earth image furnished by nasa the european space agencys earth explorer programme will go a step further and use radar from satellites to penetrate the forest canopy measuring tree trunks and branches rather than just the area covered by forest determining the volume of wood in forests around the planet will effectively enable researchers to weigh the worlds forest biomass the masses of data these advances in tech are providing is playing a major role in how we manage our forests including how we can use them to fight global warming taking on the climate crisis forests are one of the key defences against climate change  so much so theyre included in the paris agreement trees abilities to absorb carbon dioxide co 2  has long been established knowledge thanks to what climate scientists call iams or integrated assessment models  we now know how much they can extract from the atmosphere and how long they can continue to do so as co 2 levels rise one optimistic hypothesis says trees will take in more co 2  as the levels rise to test this researchers in the uk are blasting controlled sections of a forest with co 2 to increase its density by 40 representing expected global levels by 2050  by tracking how trees react they hope to highlight the role they can play as carbon sinks science also suggests they could not only help slow climate change but actively fight it the research considers that as well as absorbing co 2  trees are reported to emit gases that reflect sunlight back into space ultimately contributing to global cooling however planting more trees isnt necessarily the only answer in places experiencing drought such as the western us thinning forests can reduce competition and allow healthier trees capable of absorbing more oxygen to flourish the increasing body of research on forests impact on climate change could prove vital in shaping both the forestry industry and national governments approaches forests however as a science forestry could be considered to be in its infancy at this crucial time for the planets future forestry is becoming one of the most important environmental sciences but a lot more attention investment and research and development are required if we are able to fully understand and manage the worlds forest

invest in their forest for sawtimber production eightythree per cent 83 of the forest is in private ownership and 60 of this area is in corporate ownership the drax biomass pellet mill uses just 32 of the roundwood in the market and therefore has limited impact or influence on the overall trends by contrast the pulp and paper industry consumes 74 of the total pulpwood demand as the most dominant market for low grade fibre forest in lasalle catchment area the catchment area has seen an increase in total timberland area of 71 thousand hectares ha since 2008 this is primarily due to planting of previously nonstocked land hardwood areas have remained stable but planted pine has increased replacing some of the naturally regenerated mixed species areas the data below shows that deforestation or conversion from pure hardwood to pine is not occurring timberland area by management type the overall quantity of stored carbon or the inventory of the standing wood in the forest has increased by 7 or 326 million metric tonnes since 2008 this total is made up of a 49 million tonne increase in the quantity of pine and a 16 million tonne decline in the quantity of hardwood since the area of pure hardwood forest has remained stable this decline is likely to be due to the conversion of mixed stands to pure pine in order to increase sawtimber production and to provide a better return on investment for corporate owners historic area and timberland inventory forest in lasalle catchment area the growthtodrain ratio and the surplus of unharvested pine growth has been increasing

tools for carbon sequestration during a high growth phase they can also function as significant and extensive carbon storage areas during maturity and throughout multiple stages of the age class cycle if managed effectively at a landscape level or they can be emitters of carbon if overharvested subject to fire storm pest or disease damage different age class forest stands in louisiana in a natural state forests will go through each of these life phases rapid early growth maturity and senescence damage decay and destruction through natural causes then they begin the cycle again absorbing and then emitting carbon dioxide co 2  in a continual succession recently loud voices have argued against forest management per se  against harvesting for wood products in particular suggesting that this reduces both forest carbon stocks and sequestration capacity pine cut in into wood for different wood products markets in louisiana big thick straight higher value sections go to sawmills and smaller and misshapen lowgrade wood not suitable for timber production is sold to pulp paper or wood pellet mills many foresters consider that this is just not correct in fact the opposite is true research and evidence clearly support the foresters view active forest management when carried out appropriately actually increases the amount of carbon sequestered  ensures that carbon is stored in solid wood products and provides substantial savings of fossil fuels by displacing other high carbon materials eg concrete steel brick plastic and coal oliver et al2014 1 compared the impact of forest harvesting and the use of wood products to substitute other highcarbon materials concluding that  more co 2 can be sequestered synergistically in the products or wood energy and landscape together than in the unharvested landscape harvesting sustainably at an optimum stand age will sequester more carbon in the combined products wood energy and forest than harvesting sustainably at other ages this research demonstrated that an increase in the use of structural timber to displace concrete and steel could lead to substantial emissions savings compared to unharvested forest the use of wood for energy is an essential component of this displacement process although it is important to use appropriate feedstocks  burning wood that could be used for structural timber will not lead to a positive climate impact the message here is to manage working forests for optimum sawlog production for longlife solid wood products and utilise the byproducts for energy where this is the most viable market this provides the best allround climate benefit what happens when you close the gate closing the forest gate and stopping all harvesting and management is one option being championed by some climate change campaigners there is certainly a vital role for the preservation and protection of forests globally primary and virgin forests intact landscapes high biodiversity and high conservation value areas all need to be protected that doesnt necessarily mean that there is no forest management it should mean careful and appropriate management to maintain and ensure the future of the resource in these cases management is with an objective to reduce the risk of fire pests and disease rather than for timber production globally we need better governance understanding and implementation of best practice to achieve this forest certification and timber tracing systems are a good start this can equally apply to the many hundreds of millions of hectares of working forest that do not fall into the protection categories forests that have been managed for many hundreds of years for timber production and other purposes harvesting in these forests can be more active but governance controls and the development of best practice are required better management not less management during the 1970s there was a significant change of policy in the us aimed at removing massive areas of publicly owned forest from active management  effectively closing the gate the drivers behind this policy were well meaning it was intended to protect and preserve the habitat of endangered species but the unintended consequences have also had a substantial impact in the 1970s little thought was given to the carbon sequestration and storage potential of forests and climate change was not at the top of the agenda the west coast of the us was most substantially affected by these changes more than in the us south  but the data below looks at the example of mississippi which is primarily  working forest  and 88 in private ownership pine trees in mississippi working forest this is the location of draxs amite pellet mill  the charts below show an interesting comparison of forest ownership in mississippi where limited or no harvesting takes place and where active management for timber production occurs in the short term the total volume of timber stored per hectare is higher where no harvesting occurs this makes sense since the forest will keep growing until it reaches its climax point and succumbs to fire pest or disease average standing volume per unit area in the private sector where active management occurs is the lowest as timber is periodically removed for use in solid wood products remember that the oliver et al analysis which does not include regrowth showed that despite a shortterm reduction in forest carbon the total displacement of highcarbon materials with wood for structural timber and energy leads to a far higher emissions saving it is better to have a lower stock of carbon in a working forest and to be continually sequestering new carbon for storage in solid wood products average standing volume per acre by ownership class mississippi 2 comparing the average annual growth rates across all forest types in mississippi annual growth in the private sector is almost double that in the unharvested public forest this differential is increased even further if only commercial species like pine are considered and a comparison is made between planted well managed forests and those that are left to naturally regenerate average growth rates per acre by ownership class mississippi 3 the managed forest area is continually growing and storing more carbon at a materially higher rate than less actively managed forest as harvesting removes some forest carbon these products displace high carbon materials in construction and energy and new young forests are replacing the old ones we know that forests are not being lost and that the overall storage of carbon is increasing for example the drax catchment area analysis for the amite biomass wood pellet plant showed an increase in forest area of 5200 ha and an increase in volume of 11 million m 3  just in the area around the pellet mill but what happens to protected forest area the forest reserve with limited or no harvesting over the last 20 years the average annual loss of forest to wildfire in the us has been 278 million ha per year the same as the uks total area of productive forest according to the usfs fia database the average standing volume of forests in the us is 145 m 3 per ha although in the national park land this is 365 m 3 per ha therefore wildfires are responsible for the average annual combustion of 403 million m 3 of wood pa equal to the total annual wood harvest of the us or 25 billion m 3 if entirely in national parks one cubic metre equates to a similar quantity of co 2 released into the atmosphere each year therefore wildfires are responsible for between 407 million and 25 billion tonnes of co 2 emissions in the us each year 4  wildfires in the us starrs et al 2018 5 demonstrated that the risk of wildfire was significantly higher in federally owned reserved forest where harvesting and management were restricted compared to privately owned forests with active management in california the risk of wildfire in federal forest 200015 was almost double the risk in private forests where both had state firefighting resources the risk of fires in federal lands had increased by 93 since 195066 compared to only 33 in nonfederal forests due to the change in forest management practice in the 1970s forest fire in california closing the gate means that the carbon stock is maintained and grows in the short term but there is no opportunity for carbon to be stored in solid wood products no highcarbon materials are displaced concrete steel and fossil fuels and the rate of sequestration declines as the forest ages eventually the forest will reach its natural climax and die releasing all of that carbon back into the atmosphere the managed forest by contrast will have a lower standing volume at a certain point in time but will be in a continual cycle of sequestration storage and regrowth  with a much lower risk of fire and disease if managed correctly the rate of growth and standing volume will also increase over time how should we manage the forest forests are extremely variable there are a vast variety of tree species soil  geological features water regimes temperature climate and many other factors that combine to make unique ecosystems and forest landscapes some of these are rare and valuable for the exceptional assemblages they contain some are commonplace and widespread some are natural some manmade or influenced by human activity forests have many important roles to play and careful management is required in some cases that management may be protection preservation and monitoring in other cases it may be active harvesting and planting to optimise growth and carbon storage  cypress forests in the atchafalaya basin in louisiana are an example of a forest landscape where the suitable management practice is protection preservation and monitoring for each forest type and area we need to recognise the highest or best purposes for that land in the objectives set and carefully plan the management to optimise and sustain that value the primary value could be in species and habitat diversity or rarity provision of recreation and aesthetic value production of timber forest products and revenue generation carbon sequestration and storage water management and other ecosystem benefits most likely it will be a combination of several of these benefits therefore best management practice usually involves optimising each piece of forest land to provide the most effective combination of values forests can deliver many benefits if we are sensible about how we manage them in a recent study favero et al 2020 6 concluded that increased bioenergy demand increases forest carbon stocks thanks to afforestation activities and more intensive management relative to a nobioenergy case some natural forests however are converted to more intensive management with potential biodiversity lossesthe expanded use of wood for bioenergy will result in net carbon benefits but an efficient policy also needs to regulate

latvia catchment area analysis 19 june 2020 sustainable bioenergy latvia is a heavily forested small country about half the size of england with 52 forest cover totalling 354 million ha 27 times bigger than the forest area in england and 11 bigger than the entire uk in its catchment area analysis report of the baltic country consultancy indufor found best management practice is driven by the stateowned sector with an increasing proportion of corporate owners improving management standards in the private sector markets are dominated by domestic sawtimber demand and pulpwood exports to neighbouring scandinavia fuelwood pellets and biomass are substantial and critical markets for lowgrade fibre increasing forest area carbon stored and no deforestation there has been an increase of around 400000 hectares ha of forest in latvia since 2000 this is due to natural afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands and also to an improvement in forest inventory analysis in 2009 which provided a more accurate assessment of land use and forestry data since 2010 the forest area has increased by 55000 ha there is no evidence of deforestation primary land use latvia there has also been a substantial increase in forest carbon or growing stock this increased by 106 million cubic metres m 3  since 2000 75 hardwood and by 33 million m 3 since 2010 57 hardwood increase in forest carbon limited hardwood markets a proportion of the increase in hardwood volume in 2009 was due to the improvement of forest inventory calculations but also due to increased natural regeneration on unutilised land the hardwood forest in latvia and the baltic region is quite different to that of the us south  in the baltics there is prolific hardwood regeneration birch alder and aspen which grows quite rapidly there are limited markets for structural timber therefore hardwoods produce a lot of lowgrade wood fibre there are no domestic pulp markets in latvia and only limited markets for panel board therefore much of the lowgrade wood fibre can only be used for firewood and biomass the chart below shows a minor change in species composition from planted pine to naturally regenerated spruce and aspen  the most prolific regenerators in this region varied species mix planting and regeneration state owned forests have a higher proportion of planted forest areas compared to the private sector where natural regeneration is preferred due to lower costs planting allows the owner to control the species mix quality and growth whereas regeneration can be more of a lottery for both quality and species mix as more corporate owners emerge planting with improved stock may increase restocking practice by ownership category how the financial crisis impacted latvian forests harvesting levels have been consistently below net annual increment since 2000 there have been some fluctuations in the annual allowable cut in state forests particularly following the global financial crisis in 2008 harvesting in the private sector declined due to falling prices and sawnwood production dropped by 42 in 2009 compared to 2006 during that period stateowned forest increased harvesting in order to support the industry in the absence of strong markets and private sector supply postrecession the harvesting balance returned and demand for wood products increased the current surplus of growth compared to removals is around 55 million m 3 pa or a growth drain ratio of 16 surplus of growth compared to removals biomass and pulp prices increasing wood pellet exports have had limited impact on wood prices the feedstock for this market fuelwood  forest chip has limited competition and therefore remains fairly stable pulpwood markets are driven by export demand to scandinavia and can be volatile as this market fluctuates 2018 saw a substantial spike in pulpwood prices due to increased export demand as a response to a global increase in pulp and paper prices boosting scandinavian production this had a minor knock on effect on the domestic fuelwood markets variation of lowgrade wood prices with changing demand an important part of this analysis is to look for evidence to evaluate draxs performance against its new forest commitments  some of which relate directly to these trends and data sets pine forest in latvia below the consultant summarises the evidence of biomass impacts against key metrics in the forest industry of latvia is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes in  forest area  forest cover no impact both forest area and forest cover have increased during the last two decades the main driver of the growing forest area has been the natural regeneration of agricultural lands that were left uncultivated during the soviet regime forest growing stock no impact forest growing stock has steadily increased throughout the observation period the main driver for harvesting level is the roundwood demand from sawmills panel mills and export woodbased bioenergy demand may increase thinnings and residue collection but it is not as significant a driver for total harvests as the aforementioned exported pellets have accounted for approximately 1014 of the total volume of annual harvests in recent years depending on the assumed average dry densities of the harvested wood and pellets harvesting levels no impact  slight increasing impact the national felling volume is only about 65 of the national forest increment the total harvesting area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings and increased share of clearcuts a decline in both area and volume of fellings can be seen between 20022008 and 20102016 the main drivers of harvesting levels are sawmill industry panel industry and export demand however wood demand for energy purposes can still improve the overall income for the forest owner and therefore increase the total harvesting levels in private forests harvesting residue collection increasing impact most of the collected residues originate from clearcuts in state forests most produced harvesting residues are left in situ and they are not overexploited collection of wood residues from harvesting operations has been increasing for the last 15 years as a result of increased capacities and demand from heat and chp plants latvia is increasingly relying on woody biomass for energy generation forest growth  carbon sequestration potential no apparent impact the total forest area and growing stock have grown in the last decade according to latvias national forestry accounting plan 20212025 the forests are decreasing their ghg sequestration capacity even a low sequestration rate increases carbon storage which explains the increases in forest growing stock and area the decrease in ghg sequestration capacity is due to forest ageing emissions from soils and the increased share of broadleaved forests which have lower carbon accumulation capacity than conifers removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are an input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes to forest management practices  rotation lengths no impact the law on forests regulates minimum forest age and diameter for clearcuts the lvm and largescale forest owners often conduct clearcuts at minimum diameter whereas smallholders tend to wait until roundwood prices are high due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations thinnings increasing impact in naturally afforested former agricultural lands no impacts on thinnings overall the total harvested area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings due to existing forest age structure and increased share of clearcuts most of the harvesting residues are collected from clearcuts there is an increased demand for small diameter wood and harvestingprocessing residues overall the increased demand for smalldiameter hardwood has increased harvesting in previously unmanaged afforested agricultural lands which usually overgrow with broadleaved trees these kinds of lands are usually otherwise not significant for forest management conversion from hardwood to softwood no impact no indication of hardwood conversion to softwood was found instead pine forests are decreasing due to the favouring of natural regeneration which usually results in spruce or broadleaved forests in nutrientrich andor wet soils is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has impacted solid wood products markets  diversion from other wood product markets no apparent impact production of sawnwood and woodbased panels have increased or remained steady ie no evidence of diversion several interviews confirmed that sawlogs are not processed for other products besides sawnwood and woodbased panels wood prices no apparent impact prices of all wood assortments increased in 20172018 most notably the prices of pulpwood this was due to difficult harvesting conditions and increased demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden because of high market pulp prices pulpwood prices returned to presurge levels in 2019 fuelwood prices also increased temporarily but at a much more moderate rate the main driver for fuelwood price increases was the

pine sawtimber markets since the global financial crisis of 2008 by planting more forest and investing more in the management of their land the same period has witnessed increased demand from the biomass sector which has replaced declining need for wood from pulp and paper markets the area of timberland  actively managed productive forest  has increase by around 89000 hectares ha since 2010 this change is due to three important factors new planting on agricultural land the planting of lowgrade selfseeded areas with more productive improved pine and the reclassification by the us forest service usfs of some areas of naturally regenerated pine from woodland to timberland the 2018 data shows that pine forest makes up 46 of the timberland area of which 61 is planted and the remainder naturally regenerated hardwoods cover 43 of the timberland area with 93 of this naturally regenerated the remaining area is mixed stands composition of timberland area since 2000 there have been some significant changes in the composition of the timberland area with a transition from hardwood to softwood pine has increased from 39 of the total area in 2000 to 46 in 2018 and hardwood has decreased from 50 to 43 over the same period all pine areas have increased since 2000 with naturally regenerated pine increasing by 13000 ha and planted pine by 340000 ha since 2000 mixed stands have declined by 6500 ha as some of these sites have been replanted with improved pine to increase growth and sawtimber production the biggest change has been in the hardwood areas where there has been a decline of around 314000 ha despite the total area of timberland increasing by 31000 ha change in forest type this change has been driven by private forest owners representing 91 of the total timberland area seeking to gain a better return on investment from their forest land hardwood markets have declined since the 2008 recession and demand for hardwood sawtimber has not recovered demand for pine sawtimber has rebounded and is now as strong as precrisis pine also offers much faster growth rates and higher total volumes in a much shorter time frame typically 2535 years compared to 7580 years for hardwoods the decision to change species is similar to a farmer changing their agricultural crops based on market demand and prices for each product where forests are managed for revenue generation then it is reasonable to optimise the land and crop for this objective this can be a significant positive from a carbon perspective more carbon is sequestered in a shorter time frame and more carbon is stored in long term wood products if the quantity if sawtimber is increased increased revenue generation also helps to maintain the forest area rather than conversion to urban development agriculture or other uses a potential negative is the change in habitat from a pure hardwood stand to a pure pine stand each providing a different ecosystem and supporting a different range of flora and fauna there is no conclusive evidence that one forest type is better or worse than the other there is a great deal of variety of each type some hardwood forests are rich in species and biodiversity others can be unremarkable the key is not to endanger or risk losing any species or sensitive habitat and to ensure that any conversion only occurs where there is no loss of biodiversity and no negative impact to the ecosystem it is not clear whether all of the lost hardwood stands have been directly converted to pine forests some hardwood stands may have been lost to other land uses urban and other land has increased by 400000 ha some may have been directly converted to pine by forest owners encouraged by the increase in pine sawtimber demand and prices whatever the primary driver of this change it is clearly not being driven by the biomass sector change in forest type  timing the chart above demonstrates that the biggest change loss of hardwood and increase in planted pine occurred between 2000 and 2012 prior to the operation of the pellet mills since 2012 there has been no significant loss of natural hardwood and only a small decline in planted hardwood

mature forest resource that has been neglected over many years due to political and ownership changes management of state and corporate owned forests is now good but some small privatelyowned areas of forest are still poorly managed despite this both the forest area and the growing stock have been increasing largely due to new planting and the maturing age class of existing forest forest area has increased from 49 to 52 of the total land increasing by more than 118 thousand hectares since 2010 land use in estonia click to viewdownload over the same period the growing stock increased by 52 million m 3  with 60 of this growth in softwood and 40 in hardwood species the data shows a slight decline in 2018 but this is due to a sampling error and the growing stock is thought to have been maintained at 2017 levels this should be rectified in the 2019 data when available change in forest growing stock  estonia click to viewdownload the forests of estonia have been going through a period of restitution since the 1990s land that had been taken into state ownership during soviet rule has been given back to private owners this process was complex and lengthy and limited active management in the forest during this time since 2008 harvesting and management has increased private and corporate forest owners have been harvesting forest that had been mature and ready for clear felling the longerterm harvesting trend has been considerably lower than annual growth increment and the maximum sustainable harvesting level as shown on the chart below annual increment and harvesting levels click to viewdownload in 2018 harvesting reached an all time high at just over 14 million m 3 and just under the maximum threshold it is expected to remain at this level as more forest matures and enters the cycle of harvest and regeneration harvesting type by volume click to viewdownload harvesting type by area click to viewdownload clear cutting regeneration felling is the largest operation by volume but thinning maintenance felling is the largest by area this indicates a forest landscape in balance with widespread thinning to produce more sawlog trees and a large volume of clear cuts in the mature stands to make way for the next generation of forests reforestation in estonia  note since 2014 it has not been compulsory for private and other forest owners to submit reforestation data click to viewdownload planting of seedlings is the most common form of regeneration however some native hardwood species are strong pioneers and naturally regenerate among the spruce and pine stands this has led to a change in the species composition of some forests with an increase in hardwoods although this is relatively small scale and only prevalent among some small private owners that do not invest in clearing unwanted regeneration species mix in estonian forests click to viewdownload markets and prices for forest products sunrise and fog over forest landscape in estonia pulpwood markets are limited in estonia and this material has been historically exported to neighbouring finland and sweden export demand has had a significant impact on prices as can be seen in a spike in 2018 when demand was at its strongest the forest industry has been dominated by sawmills and panel board mills demand and production in this sector has been increasing and this has kept prices high there is a substantial differential between sawlog and pulpwood pricing comparison of sawlog and pulpwood prices click to viewdownload the pellet industry developed due to the abundance of lowgrade fibre available domestically  this included sawmill and forest residues as well as low grade roundwood from thinnings and clear cuts draxs suppliers use a combination of these feedstock sources as shown below drax feedstocks from estonia 2018 click to view download sunrise through forest in estonia summary of key questions addressed in the analysis  impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to forest resources forest area  forest cover no negative impact regardless of increasing domestic biomass utilisation for energy and exports forest area has increased due to afforestation programmes forest cover is not as high as forest area due to temporarily unstocked area after clearcut despite this forest cover has continuously increased from 20102018 growing stock no negative impact the total forest growing stock has been increasing for the last two decades in 2018 the growth slowed or halted official statistics show a decrease but this is due to sampling error in 2018 there was recordhigh wood demand from finland which was driven by high global pulp prices motivating maximal pulp production this increased harvests to a previously unseen level harvesting levels slight increasing impact during 20042011 harvesting levels in estonia were less than half of the estimated maximum sustainable level this resulted in an increase in the maximum sustainable harvesting level for the 20112020 period in 2018 the harvesting volumes were at the maximum sustainable level the main drivers increasing the harvesting volumes have been increased sawmill capacity and production high demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden and improved demand for energy wood this was a temporary peak and demand has already slowed softwood lumber prices have decreased significantly in europe due to an abundance of wood supply from central europe which has been created by widespread bark beetle and other forest damages global pulp prices have also decreased to below 2017 prices forest growth  carbon sequestration potential ambivalent impact the annual increment has grown throughout the 20002018 period increased fuelwood price has enabled forest management in some of the alder forests that were completely unutilised in the past thinnings both commercial and precommercial accelerate longterm volume growth in forests leading to increased carbon sequestration removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels utilisation of sawmill byproducts does not directly impact forests carbon sequestration potential but it can increase harvesting through improved sawmill overall profitability impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to forest management practices rotation lengths neutral forest law regulates minimum forest age for clearcuts according to interviews riigimetsa majandamise keskus rmk  the estonian state forest company often conducts the final felling at the minimum age due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations at least in statemanaged forests in forests that are older than the minimum final felling age sawlog price is a more important driver for finalfelling decisions than woodbased bioenergy demand thinning increasing impact the increase of bioenergy demand has increased the demand for smalldiameter hardwood which in turn has increased thinnings in previously unmanaged forest stands this will increase the availability of good quality sawlogs and will also accelerate the carbon sequestration tonneshayear of the forests however the total forest carbon stock tonnesha will be reduced in unmanaged eg no thinnings mature stands the carbon stock is larger than in managed stands of similar age the carbon stock of a thinned stand will remain below that of an unthinned stand regardless of postthinning accelerated growth conversion from hardwood to softwood neutral no indication of hardwood conversion to softwood was found impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to solid wood product swp markets diversion from other wood product markets neutral production of sawnwood woodbased panels pulp and paper products have increased or remained steady ie no evidence of diversion wood prices slight increasing impact during 20172018 the price of all roundwood assortments increased notably the increase was strongest in pulpwood assortments especially those that are not further processed domestically but are exported to mainly finland and sweden finnish demand for pulpwood was at a very high level in 2018 this was a temporary trend however and prices and demand have since decreased the price increase for fuelwood was less dramatic no sharp increases are
