2017 power generation more of britains electricity is coming from renewables than ever before new offshore wind farms solar capacity hitting double figures and the reliability of biomass are having a marked effect on the countrys power our electricity make up is more diverse than ever more than this it is cleaner during the first three months of 2017 emissions from power generation were 10 lower than the same period last year and 33 lower than the first quarter of 2015 and while this is a huge and necessary step in the uks efforts towards slowing global warming it would mean little if renewables werent also keeping our lights on thats exactly what they are doing  powering businesses industries and homes across the country but how many exactly the scale of renewables in 2015 the total electricity consumption of the uk was 303 twh  to put that into perspective thats roughly enough power to boil 1211 billion kettles a quarter of the 360 twh of electricity generated that year came from renewables  84 twh  a massive 29 increase over 2014 of that figure draxs biomass units contributed 115 twh  approximately 3 of that years total power generation so renewables are big but how big according to the 2011 census there are 264 million households in the uk ofgem the energy regulator says the average uk household uses roughly 31 mwh of electricity a year the average us household uses approximately 108 mwh  if we were to hypothesise that all the renewable power generated in 2015 had been consumed by uk households there would be enough to power every single one and thered be enough left over to power 600000 more using just the power generated thanks to sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets at drax power station would be enough to satisfy the equivalent of 41 million homes  nearly twice the number of households in scotland or 800000 more homes than in the whole of london 15 of all uk homes could have been powered by just half that one station in selby north yorkshire finding the right mix for the future electricity is used to power more than just homes it powers businesses transport and infrastructure  almost all parts of our lives are fuelled by electricity while there may be the hypothetical equivalent to power every single household in the uk with renewables with room to spare the reality is there is a far larger nationwide demand that needs to be fulfilled and this means we cant rely on renewables alone instead whats required is an energy mix that also includes other low carbon sources of electricity  backed up by a new fleet of gas power stations and storage that can respond rapidly to changes in demand while were not yet in a position where we can power all homes all the time using renewables that day could well be coming a new report from the international renewable energy agency irea suggests a mix of renewable technologies including biomass and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could meet the majority of global energy demand across all sectors of the world economy by 2050  while helping to keep the rise in global temperatures to under two degrees celsius above 1990 levels share related stories
