worldleading chemical processes for carbon dioxide removal has raised 35m in new equity funding in a round led by bp ventures drax and ip group 4 february 2019 the funding strongly underlines the credibility of ccaptures technology as the company positions itself to help mitigate climate change by providing systems that remove carbon dioxide emissions from power stations and cement steel and aluminium facilities ccapture is currently conducting a demonstration project at drax power station in north yorkshire which will remove carbon dioxide from emissions produced by generating electricity from sustainable biomass the project which is the first of its kind in europe is highly significant because it has the capacity to produce negative emissions whereby carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and stored ccapture will use the new funding to further develop the technology support larger pilot projects in other industries and increase marketing globally carbon capture and storage ccs is widelyregarded as an essential component of strategies to combat climate change  both by removing carbon dioxide from processes that use fossil fuels and producing negative carbon dioxide emissions from power generation that uses biomass the uk government is committed to developing and deploying ccs technology to cut emissions tristan fischer chairman of ccapture said were delighted that drax ip group and now bp have all seen that our unique technology has the potential to be applied at scale around the world as part of the global drive to tackle climate change were all very excited about the pilot project with drax and also that this new funding will help to develop our technology for use across a range of industries we are looking carefully at the broader market for our carbon capture technology which includes not just power generation but also the production of cement steel and aluminium as well as biogas across a range of territories including india and china ccaptures technology uses new proprietary solvents to remove carbon dioxide offering a safer and less expensive alternative to current technologies based on the use of amines it provides a means to make the removal of carbon dioxide significantly more economic from a range of large scale processes such as power generation from coal gas and biomass and the production of cement steel and aluminium ccapture based in leeds was formed in 2009 as a spinout from leeds university with funding from ip group and has raised over 22m from the uk government and 17m from ip group so far to develop its technology will gardiner ceo of drax group said at drax we are focused on enabling a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and want to take advantage of the environmental and business opportunities created by a growing net zero carbon economy the innovative technology ccapture has developed and is piloting at drax power station is putting the uk on the map when it comes to carbon capture and global efforts to tackle climate change this investment gives us a longterm commercial agreement to work together with them were confident that our bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project will be successful and if we scale it up it could enable drax to become the worlds first negative emissions power station this significant milestone means the power we produce would help to reduce the carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere david eyton bps group head of technology said bp believes carbon capture use and storage has a key role to play in reducing emissions in line with global climate ambitions ccaptures technology could reduce the cost of capturing carbon dioxide our investment in ccapture supports our ambition to advance the energy transition and we look forward to working with them to explore opportunities to trial their technology ben murphy cleantech investment manager at ip group plc said ccapture provides new world leading technology for capturing carbon dioxide from largescale emissions it has great potential to address climate change by facilitating negative emissions this funding round further shows ip groups ability to build worldchanging companies on the back of cuttingedge science bp and drax are excellent partners to work with as ccapture looks to take its technology to global markets notes to editors the uks first carbon capture usage and storage project could be operational from the mid 2020s under a government action plan  press release via link httpswwwgovukgovernmentnewsplantoenablefirstukcarboncaptureprojectfromthemid 2020sannouncedatworldfirstsummit about ccapture ccapture designs worldleading chemical processes for carbon dioxide removal it has patented a unique solventbased technology which offers a safe lowcost way to remove carbon dioxide from emissions sources such as power stations industrial plants and anaerobic digestion for positive environmental benefit in may 2018 ccapture announced a partnership with drax group to run a pilot of its technology at the north yorkshire power station which will see carbon dioxide captured from biomass used in power generation and show how ccaptures technology can be used as part of a process to remove existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere beccs ccapture is proud of the potential its technology offers to mitigate climate change as part of the growing market for environmentallyconscious power generation and industrial processes the company was formed in 2009 as a spinout from leeds university and is backed by ip group drax and bp ventures ip group was set up with a mission to evolve great ideas mainly from partner universities into world changing businesses wwwccapturecouk
