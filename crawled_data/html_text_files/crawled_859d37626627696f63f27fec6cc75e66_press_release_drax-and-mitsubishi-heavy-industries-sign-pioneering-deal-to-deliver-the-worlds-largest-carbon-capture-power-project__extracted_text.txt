the advanced km cdr process 10 june 2021 agreement combines pioneering uk innovation and japanese technology with the potential to deliver the largest deployment of negative emissions in power generation anywhere in the world supporting the uk governments ambitious target to reduce carbon emissions and enabling clean growth and green jobs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax can enable the renewable energy company to become carbon negative by 2030  permanently removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted across its operations mitsubishi heavy industries to develop new centre of excellence for carbon capture and use and storage ccus in london as well as looking at ways to strengthen its supply chain including the potential production of its proprietary solvent in the uk londontokyo drax group and mitsubishi heavy industries engineering ltd part of mitsubishi heavy industries mhi group have agreed a longterm contract for drax to use its carbon capture technology the advanced km cdr process   in what would be the largest deployment of negative emissions in power generation anywhere in the world the contract which combines uk innovation and worldleading japanese technology will see drax license mhis unique carbon capture solvent ks21   to capture co 2 at its power station near selby north yorkshire pictured lr kentaro hosomi chief regional officer emea mitsubishi heavy industries mhi carl clayton head of beccs drax group jenny blyth project analyst drax group at drax power station north yorkshire  click to viewdownload  drax is already the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted its power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal reducing its emissions by more than 85 by deploying beccs technology drax aims to go further  becoming carbon negative by 2030 the first beccs unit at drax could be operational as soon as 2027 supporting thousands of jobs across the north of england as soon as 2024 and capturing and storing at least 8 million tonnes of co 2 a year by 2030 drax is the first company to sign a contract to deploy carbon capture technology at scale in the uk the project combines mhis proven and worldleading technology with offshore geological storage under the north sea helping the uk achieve its target to cut carbon emissions by 78 by 2035 and demonstrates global climate leadership ahead this weekends g7 in cornwall and of cop26 in glasgow in november as part of the agreement mhi plans to locate its core ccs team at the companys european headquarters in london and explore additional employment opportunities in the uk in future mhi is also looking at ways to strengthen its supply chain including the potential production of its proprietary solvent in the uk mhi

world urgently needs to move from making climate pledges to taking climate action this gamechanging contract between drax and mhi could contribute to a decade of global environmental leadership from the uk and provide further stimulus to a postcovid economic recovery carbon capture technologies like beccs are going to be absolutely vital in the fight against the climate crisis subject to the right regulatory framework being in place drax stands ready to invest further in this essential negative emissions technology which not only permanently removes co 2 from the atmosphere but also delivers the reliable renewable electricity needed for clean green economic growth kenji terasawa president  ceo mitsubishi heavy industries engineering said we are very proud to have been selected as draxs technology partner and we firmly believe that our carbon capture technology will make a significant contribution to the uk and wider global community achieving their net zero targets we look forward to expanding our presence in the uk and developing a centre of excellence for the deployment of carbon capture technology across europe the middle east and africa region beccs technology at drax power station north yorkshire  click to viewdownload  mhi aims to continue reducing greenhouse gases globally by providing reliable and economically feasible carbon capture technology supported by research and development activity over 30 years and commercial records around the world with an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework from the government beccs could be deployed at drax as soon as 2027  delivering the uks largest carbon capture project and permanently removing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year drax has already kickstarted the planning process to deploy beccs at its power station in north yorkshire  if successful work could get underway to build beccs at drax as soon as 2024 with the creation of thousands of

storing up to eight million tonnes of co 2 a year  a significant proportion of the negative emissions the climate change committee says are needed in order for the uk to reach its climate targets no investment decision has yet been taken and development remains subject to the uk government introducing the right regulatory framework drax announced it was working on a pilot project with mhi last year to testmhis carbon capture technologys suitability for use with biomass flue gases at drax graphic showing mitsubishi heavy industries mhi carbon capture technology process  click to viewdownload  mhi together with kansai electric power co inc kepco started the development of km cdr process kansaimitsubishi carbon dioxide removal process a postcombustion carbon capture technology in 1990 as of may 2021 mhi has delivered a total of 13 commercial plants with the km cdr process with two commercial plants currently under construction making it a global leader in carbon capture technology deployment two more plants are currently under construction the advanced km cdr process tm  developed by mhieng in collaboration with kepco will use a new proprietary solvent called ks21 tm  compared to the earlier ks1 tm solvent which has been adopted at 13 commercial plants delivered by mhieng ks21 tm has a number of advantageous properties such as lower volatility and greater stability against degradation the newer solvent is also expected to enable reduced running costs and other economic benefits a recent report by leading energy consultancy baringa commissioned by drax found that that without beccs at drax power station the energy system would incur additional costs of around 45bn to achieve the uk governments fifth carbon budget in 2028 to 2032  making decarbonisation more difficult and significantly more expensive drax is a founding member of the zero carbon humber initiative which aims to deploy green technologies including beccs hydrogen and industrial ccs to decarbonise the uks most carbon intensive industrial cluster the northern endurance partnership is leading on the deployment of the transport and storage infrastructure needed to permanently lock away
