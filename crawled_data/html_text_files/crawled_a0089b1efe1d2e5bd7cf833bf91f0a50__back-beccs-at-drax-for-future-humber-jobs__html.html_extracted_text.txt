What is BECCS at Drax?
BECCS
(Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) is a new technology that, if supported by Government, will remove carbon from the atmosphere to help Britain tackle climate change, and help to grow thousands of jobs across the Humber.
Why back BECCS at Drax?
BECCS at Drax will protect energy security, create jobs and help the UK hit net zero.
​
Energy security
As the country’s largest power station, Drax is crucial for UK energy security. With the right support from
government, it will continue to protect our energy security for decades to come thanks to cutting edge carbon capture and
removal technology: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
​​
Green jobs, skills and economic opportunity
Drax will be one of the first power stations in the world to be fitted with BECCS.
BECCS at Drax will support 10,000 jobs during construction, creating new skills and helping to position the UK and the
Humber as a world leader in carbon removal technology.
​​
An achievable and affordable net zero
BECCS will play an essential role in helping the UK reach both its 2035 emissions and
net zero targets. The carbon removals from BECCS at Drax will reduce the cost of cutting emissions for industries that are
struggling to
decarbonise
, such as aviation and agriculture, whilst also generating reliable, renewable energy for millions of
homes and businesses across the country.
