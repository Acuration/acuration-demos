engineering 6 disused power stations renovated and reimagined 23 january 2020 power generation the tate modern and battersea power station along the banks of the thames are architectural icons of the london skyline but before they were landmarks they were oil and coalburning power stations right in the heart of the city they powered as the city developed the technology used to generate power advanced and the need for cleaner fuel sources grew  the requirement for large citybased fossil fuel power stations like these fell the closure of battersea and the bankside power stations became inevitable rather than knocking them down however it was clear their scale heritage and location could be repurposed to meet an entirely new set of needs for the city now as an art gallery and modern

technology how scotlands sewage becomes renewable energy 17 december 2019 sustainable bioenergy from traffic pollution to household recycling and access to green spaces cities and governments around the world are facing increasing pressure to find solutions to a growing number of urban problems one of these which doesnt come up often is sewage but every day 11 billion litres of wastewater from drains homes businesses and farms is collected across the uk and treated to be made safe to reenter the water system although for the most part sewage treatment occurs beyond the view of the general population it is something that needs constant work if not dealt with properly it can have a significant effect on the surrounding environment of the many ways that sewage is dealt with perhaps one of the most innovative is to use it for energy daldowie fuel plant near glasgow is one such place which processes sewage sludge taken from the surrounding area into a renewable low carbon form of biomass fuel the solution in the sludge in operation since 2002 daldowie was acquired by drax at the end of 2018 and today processes 35 of all of scotlands wastewater sludge into dry lowodour fuel pellets we receive as much as 25 million tonnes of sludge from scottish water a year says plant manager dylan hughes who leads a team of 71 employees and produce up to 50000 tonnes of pellets making it one of the largest plants of this kind in the world we have to provide a 247 365day service that is built into the infrastructure of glasgow he explains this sludge processed at daldowie is not raw wastewater which is treated in scottish waters sewage facilities instead the sludge is a semisolid byproduct of the treatment process made of the organic material and bacteria that ends up in wastewater from homes and industry from drains sinks and yes toilets until the late 1990s one of great britains main methods of disposing of sludge was by dumping it in the ocean  after this practice was banned cities where left to figure out ways of dealing with the sludge using sludge as a form of fertiliser or burying it in landfills was an already established practice however scottishpower instead decided to investigate the potential of turning sludge into a dry fuel pellet that could offer a renewable low carbon substitute to coal at its power plants cement manufacturing fuel kilns daldowie was originally designed to supply fuel to methil power station near fife which ran on coal slurry however it was decommissioned in 2000 before daldowie could begin delivering fuel to it this led the plant to instead provide fuel to longannet power station where it was used to reduce its dependency on coal before it too was decommissioned in 2016 today daldowies pellets are used in england and scotland to fuel kilns in cement manufacturing  an industry attempting to navigate the same decarbonisation challenges as power generation which daldowie was established to tackle though the end use of the fuel has changed the process through which the facility transforms the waste remains the same the process of turning waste to energy the process starts after wastewater from glasgow and the surrounding area is treated by scottish water daldowie receives 90 of the sludge it processes directly via a pressurised sludge pipeline the rest is delivered via sealed tanker lorries when it arrives at daldowie the sludge is 98 water and 2 solid organic waste it is first screened for debris before entering the plants 12 centrifuges which act as massive spinning driers these separate water from what is known as sludge cake the semisolid part of the sludge feedstock this separated water is then cleaned so it can either be used elsewhere in the process or released into the nearby river clyde membrane tank at daldowie fuel plant the remaining sludge cake is dried using air heated to 450 degrees celsius using natural gas this also reduces germs through pasteurisation while the rotating drums give the fuel granules their pellet shape once dried the pellets are cooled and inspected for quality any material not up to necessary standards is fed back into the system for reprocessing fuel that does meet the right standards is cooled further and then stored in silos where possible throughout the process hot air and water are reused helping keep costs down and ensuring the process is efficient nearly two decades into its life very little has had to change in the way the plant operates thanks to these efficiencies but while the process of turning the waste sludge into energy remains largely unchanged there is as always room for new innovation  improving for the future of the site daldowie is contracted to recycle wastewater for scottish water until 2026 to ensure the plant is still as efficient and effective as possible the daldowie team is undertaking a technical investigation of what if anything would be needed to extend the life of the plant for at least an additional five years the plant operates under the highest environmental and health and safety standards but further improvements are being planned in 2020 hughes explains we are upgrading the odour control equipment to ensure we have a best in class level of performance the control room and plant operators at daldowie draxs scotland office in glasgow is working with other industrial facilities in the area as well as the scottish environmental protection agency sepa to work with the local community we are putting in place a series of engagement events including plant tours from early 2020 offering local residents an opportunity to meet the local team and discuss the planned improvements there are also other potential uses for the fuel including use at drax power station as the pellets are categorised as waste and biomass it would require a new license for the power station however at a time when there is a greater need to reduce the impact of human waste and diversify the countrys energy it would add another source of renewable fuel to great britains electricity mix that could help to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future tags biomass energy  technology  power station  engineering  decarbonisation  daldowie the men who built a power station inside a mountain 12 november 2019 power generation travelling through the highlands towards the west coast of scotland you pass the mighty ben cruachan  its 1126 metre peak towers over the winding loch awe beneath it is the natural world on a huge scale but within its granite core sits a manmade engineering wonder cruachan power station  opened by the queen in 1965 it is one of only four pumpedhydro stations in the uk and today remains just as impressive an engineering feat as when it was first opened cruachan is operated safely and hasnt had a lost time injury in 15 years the robust health and safety policies and practices employed at the power station were not in place all those decades ago it took six years to construct enlisting a 4000strong workforce who drilled blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of the mountain eventually removing some 220000 cubic metres of rubble the work was physically exhausting  the environment dark and dangerous nicknamed the tunnel tigers the men that carried the work out came from far and wide attracted to its ambition as well as a generous pay packet reflective of the danger and difficulty of the work but few of them were fully prepared for the extent of the challenge one labourer who started at cruachan just after his 18 th birthday recalls i was in for a shock when i went down there the heat the smoke  you couldnt see your hands in front of you inside the mountain the work of hollowing out ben cruachan was realised by handdrilling twotothree metre deep holes into the granite rockface an explosive known as gelignite which can be moulded by hand was packed into the drilled holes and detonated the blasted rocks were removed by bulldozers trucks and shovels before drilling began on the fresh section of exposed granite in total 20km of tunnels and chambers were excavated this way including the kilometrelong entrance tunnel and the 91metrelong 36metrehigh machine hall wilson scott was just 18 when he got a job working as a labourer at cruachan while the machine hall was being cleared out the gelignite it had a smell right away i was told not to put it near your face he says itll give you a splitting headache and your eyes will close with the fumes that come off it it was scary stuff this process allowed for rapid expansion through the mountain with three or four blasts each 12hour shift some 20 metres of rock could be cleared in the course of a day activity was constant and to save the men having to make the journey back up to the surface refreshments came to them there was a bus that went down the tunnel at 11 oclock with a huge urn of terrible tea says scott most of the windows were out of the bus because the pressure of the blasting had blown them in the tea did little to make the environment hospitable however from the water dripping through the porous rocks making floors slippery and exposed electrics vulnerable to the massive machinery rushing through the dense dust and smoke danger was everpresent loose rocks as large as cars would often fall from exposed walls and ceilings while the regular blasting gave the impression the entire mountain was shaking ill tell you something going into that tunnel the first time scott says it was a fascinating place but quite a scary place too above them on top of the mountain a similarly intrepid team tackled a different challenge building the 316metrelong dam they may have escaped the hot and humid conditions at the centre of cruachan but their task was no less daunting cruachan dam construction early 1960s on top of the dam out in the open 400 metres above loch awe the team were exposed to the harsh scottish elements john william ross came to cruachan at the age of 35 to work as a driver and spent time working in the open air of the dam youd get oil skins and welly boots and that was it we didnt have gloves if your hands froze  well thats tough luck isnt it mr ross sadly passed away recently charlie campbell a 19yearold shutter joiner who worked on the dam found an innovative way around the cold youd put on your socks and then youd get womens tights and youd put them over the top of the socks and then youd put your wellies on and thatd keep your feet a wee bit warmer we thought it did anyway maybe it was just the thought of the womens stockings pouring the concrete of the dam  almost 50 metres high at its tallest point  was precarious work especially given the challenges of working with materials like concrete and bentonite a slurrylike liquid used in construction it was horrible stuff it was like diarrhoea thats the only way of explaining it says campbell there was a boy  toastie  i cant remember his real name he fell into it they had quite a job getting him out they thought he was drowned but he was alright many others were not alright the danger of the work and conditions both inside and on top of the mountain meant there was a significant human cost for the project during construction 15 people tragically lost their lives today a carved wooden mural hangs on the wall of the machine hall to capture and commemorate the myth of the mountain and the men who sadly died  a constant reminder of the bravery and sacrifice they made the men that made the mountain the cruachan tunnel tigers the tunnel tigers were united in their efforts but came from a range of backgrounds and cultures polish and irish labourers worked alongside scots as well as displaced europeans prisoners of the second world war and even workers from as far as asia the men would work 12 sometimes 18hour shifts seven days a week campbell adds that some men opted to continue earning rather than rest by doing a ghoster which saw them working a solid 36 hours many men would make treble the salary of their previous jobs with some receiving as much as 100 a week at a time when the average pay in scotland was 12 some teams payslips were stamped with the words danger money  illustrative of the mens motivation to endure such lifethreatening work while it was a dangerous and demanding job many of the tigers look back with fond memories of their time on the site and many stayed in the area for years after it was an experience im glad i had says scott it puts you in good stead for the rest of your days as for cruachan power station its four turbines are still relied on today by great britain to balance everyday energy supply as the electricity system continues to change the pumped hydro stations dual ability to deliver 440 megawatts mw of electricity in just 30 seconds or absorb excess power from the grid by pumping water from loch awe to its upper reservoir is even more important than when it opened cruachan machine hall roof excavation 1962 cruachan machine hall construction 1964 cruachan machine hall 2019 standing at the foot of a mountain more than 50 years ago the men about to build a power station inside a lump of granite may have found it unlikely their work would endure into the next millennium they may have found it unlikely it was possible to build it at all but they did and today it remains an engineering marvel a testament to the effort and expertise of all those who made it visit cruachan  the hollow mountain tags technology  engineering  energy storage  hydroelectric power  cruachan power station from coal to pumped hydro storage in 83 mountainous miles 7 october 2019 power generation nestled in in the western highlands in scotland cruachan power station is surrounded by a breathtaking landscape of plunging mountainsides and curving lochs between which weave narrow roads it makes for scenic driving what might be trickier however is transporting 230 tonnes of electrical equipment up and down said mountains navigating narrow bends but thats exactly what a team from drax was tasked with when it came to moving two 115 tonne transformers the equipment used to boost electricitys voltage they were in storage 83 miles away at longannet currently being demolished near fife youre moving a piece of equipment that is designed to stay in one place its not designed to go on the roads explains jamie beardsall an electrical engineer from the eci engineering team who worked on the project youre very aware of your environment and the risks everything is checked and doubled checked transformers being driven to draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station the complicated task required colleagues from both cruachan and drax power stations to collaborate from the very beginning gary brown mark rowbottom and jamie from the eci engineering team based in yorkshire teamed up with gordon pirie and roddy davies from scotland who met frequently and planned the project alongside specialist transport contractor ale which advised on heavy lifting and movement planning and execution of the works also required constant liaison and coordination with the police and highway authorities in both scotland and england but more than that the transformers onebyone journey from the demolition site of what was once europes biggest coalfired power station  to a hydropowered energy storage site on the other side of scotland represents the continual shift of great britains electricity away from fossil fuels stepping up voltage transformers are an essential part of the electricity system by increasing or decreasing the voltage of an electrical current they can enable it to traverse the national grid or make electricity safe to enter our homes when we generate electricity it is at a lower voltage than we need to send it out to the national grid says beardsall we use transformers to increase the voltage so it can go out to the national grid and be transmitted over long distances more efficiently we then reduce the voltage again so it can be brought safely into our homes while all transformers apply the same principles for stepping voltage up and down  the two transformers that were transported through the highlands to cruachan were designed specifically for the pumped storage hydro power station but stored at longannet where there was more space at the time both stations where owned by scottish power cruachan was purchased by drax on the last day of 2018 engineers at cruachan power station in front of one of the original transformers when transported each transformer weighs 115 tonnes and is almost four metres high transporting them isnt as simple as loading them into the back of a van you cant transport them in a fully built state they would be too heavy and wouldnt go under bridges says beardsall we had to strip them back to the core and now were working to reassemble them on site cutting down to the core each transformer consists of two main components a core made of iron and two windings made of copper the transformer itself has no moving parts when a voltage is applied to one of the transformer windings the primary winding a magnetic field is created in the iron core this field then induces a voltage into the other winding the secondary winding depending on the number of coils on each set of windings the output voltage will increase or decrease more coils on the secondary winding steps the voltage up fewer coils on the secondary steps the voltage down this entire apparatus is submerged in an oil to provide insulation and keep the transformer cool meaning the first step was to drain 50000 litres of oil from each transformer this was then sent to a refinery to be processed cleaned and stored until the transformers are reassembled at cruachan oil removed the drax engineers oversaw and managed the dismantling of the transformers at longannet once the transformers were stripped down to a state suitable for movement they were loaded up onebyone for transportation meanwhile at cruachan engineers worked on construction of a purpose built bunded area for storage of the transformers the transformers were destined to be stored on land outside the main admin buildings adjacent to loch awe loch awe at cruachan power station the loch itself is a beautiful place with abundant animal and birdlife  and a fish farm is located almost directly opposite the power station in the event of a transformer leaking the natural environment must be protected an oiltight storage area was therefore built to ensure that no oil would end up in the loch the road to cruachan rather than heaving each of the transformers onto a trailer each one was raised using hydraulic jacking equipment a trailer was then driven underneath and the transformer lowered onto it the trailer is specifically designed to take the transformers and fit certain dimensions explains beardsall it has 96 wheels over 12 sets of axles each of which can be turned individually to assist in navigating around tight spots the trailers are towed by large tractor units each weighing over 40 tonnes these provided the motive power to move the transformers each was moved in two stages over the space of two weeks the first transformer over the course of a weekend the second in the middle of the night some 10 days later when we could go was governed by the police and highways agencies as they need to close the roads says beardsall we set off from longannet at 7pm on the friday evening and moved them 60 miles along the route to a layby where we stored them that leg took approximately five hours then the second leg was the last 25 miles to cruachan carried out on the sunday morning of the same weekend navigating the highlands with 115 tonnes of hugely valuable equipment is where the real challenge came in hills dips and tight turns made for slow progress the original generator transformer at cruachan power station the average speed was about 10mph but were going through the highlands so it was quite a bit slower than that in some places we occasionally hit 20 mph at points but that was definitely for the minority of the time says beardsall some of the roads were so narrow it was difficult to get two cars past each other the contractors also had to put metal plating over bridges because they werent strong enough to take the load having safely arrived at cruachan the transformers are being stored at surface level until they are needed at which time they will be taken down the halfamilelong tunnel into the energy storage station typically a transformer has a design life of 25 years although they can last longer explains beardsall there are four units at cruachan and the transformers for two of these units have already been replaced so these transformers would be used to replace the existing transformer for the two remaining units should it ever be needed the existing transformer having been in operation since 1965  moving heavy objects is part and parcel of running draxs multiple power stations around the country however navigating the highlands the very terrain which makes cruachan possible  added a unique challenge for draxs engineers visit cruachan power station  the hollow mountain read the press release tags engineering  transport  cruachan power station  technology a brief history of scottish hydropower 1 october 2019 power generation over the last century scottish hydro power has played a major part in the countrys energy make up while today it might trail behind wind solar and biomass as a source of renewable electricity in great britain it played a vital role in connecting vast swathes of rural scotland to the power grid  some of which had no electricity as late as the 1960s and all by making use of two plentiful scottish resources water and mountains but the road to hydro adoption has been varied and difficult travelled on by brave deathdefying construction workers ingenious engineers and the inspirational leadership of a scottish politician to trace where the history of scottish hydropower began we need to go back to the end of the 19 th century and to the banks of loch ness loch ness scottish highlands from abbeys to aluminium it was on the shores of loch ness that one of the first known hydroelectric schemes was built at the fort augustus benedictine abbey the scheme provided power to the monks living there as well as 800 village residents  though legend has it that their lights went dim every time the monks played their organ however it was the british aluminium company formed in 1894 that first realised the huge potential of scotlands steep mountains lochs and reliably heavy rainfall to generate substantial amounts of hydro power in need of a reliable source of electricity to help turn raw bauxite into aluminium the firm established a hydroelectric plant and smelting works at foyers and loch ness several similar schemes to support the aluminium industry soon appeared around the country but it took another 20 years for the first major hydropower project to supply electricity to the public to emerge in 1926 the clyde valley electrical power co opened the lanark hydro electric scheme  which used energy from the river clydes flow to create power now owned by drax it still has a generation capacity of 17 mw  enough to supply more than 15000 homes  river clyde lanark it was quickly followed by power stations at rannoch and tummel in the grampian mountains and in 1935 by what became a highly influential scheme in the history of scottish hydro power at galloway drawing enough energy from local rivers to support five generating power stations the project was the largest runoftheriver scheme ever created architecturally it also set the tone for later projects with stylised dams and modernist turbine halls a fairer share of power for the highlands the galloway scheme supplied energy to a wide area too including parts of the central highlands scottish labour mp tom johnston a staunch socialist and scottish patriot saw how this new power source could provide massive benefits to northern communities in the early 1940s only an estimated one in six scottish farms and one in a hundred small land crofts had electricity in 1941 johnston became scotlands minister for state with a vision as he put it to create largescale reforms that might mean scotia resurgent expanding hydro power was a priority tom johnston mp two years later he formed the north of scotland hydroelectric board nsheb its aim was to create several new schemes including at tummel and loch sloy that would supply the national grid and bring electricity to more rural scottish areas the projects were met with fierce opposition from landowners and local pressure groups who feared new dams and power stations would ruin the countryside and bring unwelcome industrialisation public enquiries followed but the boards promises that the developments would be sensitive to the environment and bring cheap electricity in areas such as the isle of skye and loch ewe eventually won the day thousands of local men as well as german and italian former prisoners of war  were drafted in to work on the projects among the most courageous were workers known as tunnel tigers who blasted away rock using handheld drills and gelignite to create water channels and underground chambers including at draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro station  deaths caused by everything from blast injuries to fires were common the men also had to cope with incessant rain and cold and were housed in bleak militarystyle camps with little to do in their spare time besides drink fights would break out regularly but the financial rewards were enormous with wages up to ten times higher than labourers employed on highland estates could expect glenlee penstocks the future takes shape the boards first small projects were completed in 1948 at morar and nostie bridge supplying electricity to areas including parts of wester ross catherine mackenzie a local widow performed the morar opening ceremony reportedly declaring let light and power come to the crofts bigger schemes were plagued by problems conveyor belts had to be built to transport stone across 175 miles of moor during construction at sloy for instance and there were frequent stone and timber shortages but sloy eventually opened in 1950 the largest conventional hydro electrical power station in great britain with an installed capacity of 128 mw it would be followed by major schemes at glen affric and loch shin by the mid sixties the board had built 54 main power stations and 78 dams northern scotland was now 90 connected to the national grid hydro board shops began popping up on high streets selling appliances and collecting bill payments tom johnston died in 1965 aged 83 the provost of inverness declared no words can say how grateful we are loch awe beside cruachan power station that same year the worlds then largest reversible pumped storage power station opened at cruachan during times of low electricity demand its turbines pump water from loch awe to the reservoir above when demand rises the turbines reverse and water flows down to generate power a similar scheme opened at foyes in 1974 glendoe near loch ness was the mostrecent major hydro scheme to be built opening in 2009 it has a generation capacity of 100 mw there are plans for a pumped storage scheme at coire glas  with a storage capacity of 30 gwh  more than doubling great britains current total pumped storage capacity draxs cruachan power station could also be expanded in recent years however the real growth has been in smaller hydroelectric schemes that may power just one or a handful of properties  with more than 100 mw of such generation capacity installed in the highlands since 2006 boosting the environment and economy scotland now provides 85 of great britains hydroelectric resource with a total generation capacity of 1500 mw improved power supplies have attracted more industry to the highlands without seriously altering its character and access roads

it cutting global shipping emissions 5 july 2019 sustainable business shipping is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways tags decarbonisation  transport  supply chain  engineering  technology  sustainability what is a fuel cell and how will they help power the future 27 june 2019 carbon capture nasa museum houston texas how do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into

often tied to a countrys geography climate and geology  as an island great britains long coastline makes offshore wind a key part of its renewable electricity while iceland can rely on its geothermal activity as a source of power and heat one of the most geographicallyinfluenced sources of electricity is hydropower a site needs a great enough volume of water flowing through it and the right kind of terrain to construct a dam to harness it even more dependent on the landscape is pumped hydro storage pumped storage works by pumping water from one source up a mountain to a higher reservoir and storing it when the water is released it rushes down the same shafts it was pumped up spinning a turbine to generate electricity the advantage of this is being able to store the potential energy of the water and rapidly deliver electricity to plug any gaps in generation  for example when the wind suddenly dropsor when great britain instantly requires a lot more power  this specific type of electricity generation can only function in a specific type of landscape and the scottish highlands offers a location that ticks all the boxes the perfect spot for pumped storage cruachan power station  a pumped hydro facility capable of providing 440 megawatts mw of electricity sits on the banks of loch awe in the highlands ready to deliver power in just 30 seconds here there is a minimum distance between the two water sources with a maximum drop says gordon pirie civil engineer at cruachan power station it is an ideal site for pumped storage the challenge in constructing pumped storage is finding a location where two bodies of water are in close proximity but at severely different altitudes from the lochside the landscape rises at a dramatic angle to reach 1126 metres 3694 feet above sea level at the summit of ben cruachan the highest peak in the argyll the crest of cruachan dam sits 4008 metres 1315 feet up the slopes creating a reservoir in a rocky corrie between ridges the four 100 mw turbines which also act as pumps lie a kilometre inside the mountains rock the horizontal distance and the vertical distance between water sources is whats called the pipetolength ratio explains pirie its what determines whether or not the site is economically viable for pumped storage the higher water is stored the more potential energy it holds that can be converted into electricity however if the distance between the water sources is too great the amount of electricity consumed pumping water up the mountain becomes too great and too expensive the distance between the reservoir and the turbines is also reduced by cruachan power stations defining feature the turbine hall cavern one kilometre inside the mountain carving a power station out of rock the access tunnel cavern and the networks of passageways and chambers that make up the power station were all blasted and drilled by a workforce of 1300 men in the late 1950s to early 1960s  affectionately known as the tunnel tigers this was dangerous work however the rock type of the mountainside was another geographic advantage of the region its the diorite and phyllite rock essentially granite so its a hard rock but its actually a softer type of granite and thats also why cruachan was chosen as the location says pirie the right landscape and geology was essential for establishing a pumped storage station at cruachan however the west highlands also offer another essential factor for hydropower an abundance of water turning water to power the west highlands are one of the wettest parts of europe with some areas seeing average annual rain fall of 3500 millimetres compared to 500 millimetres in some of the driest parts of the uk this abundance of water from rainfall as well as lochs and rivers also contributes to making cruachan so wellsuited to pumped storage the cruachan reservoir can contain more than 10 million cubic metres of water most of this is pumped up from loch awe which at 385 square kilometres is the third largest freshwater loch in scotland loch awe is so big that if cruachan reservoir was fully released into the loch it would only increase the water level by 20 centimetres however the reservoir also makes use of the aqueduct system made up of 19 kilometres of tunnels and pipes that covers 23 square kilometres of the surrounding landscape diverting rainwater and streams into the reservoir calculating quite how much of the reservoirs water comes from the surrounding area is difficult but estimates put it at around a quarter there are 75 concrete intakes dotted around the hills to gather water and carry it through the aqueducts to the reservoir says pirie the smallest intake is about the size of a street drain in the corner of a field and the largest one is about the size of a threebedroom house pumped storage stations offer the electricity system a source of extra power quickly but it takes the right combination of geographical features to make it work ben cruachan just so happens to be one of the spots where the landscape makes it possible tags cruachan power station  hydroelectric power  energy storage  electricity generation  engineering  power station  technology  sustainability is there such a thing as energy terroir 16 april 2019 power generation terroir comes from the french word terre meaning land earth or soil in the french wine industry it refers to the land from which grapes are grown it is believed the terroir gives the grapes a unique quality specific to that particular growing site terroir dictates the type of wine that comes from a region  its the reason we call one bottle a bordeaux and another a côtes du rhone but could the idea of terroir hold relevance beyond just wine what if we looked at electricity in the same way certain environments are better placed to produce certain types of electricity these are some of the regions making the most of their unique location and landscape to produce electricity that makes sense for them la rance tidal barrage brittany france brittany boasts one third of mainland frances coasts and has long been a top destination for surfers with waves as high as 76 metres in some places with such tempestuous waters its the perfect location for la rance tidal power station  the worlds first station of its kind opened in 1966 the site was chosen because it has the highest tidal range in france tidal barrages like la rance harness the potential energy in the difference in height between low and high tides the barrage creates an artificial reservoir to enable different water levels which then drives turbines and generators to produce electricity while the station has been operating for close to 50 years old tidal mills are still dotted around the rance river some dating back to the 15 th century  proof that tidal power has deep roots in this region xinjiang china whilst china may have some of the worlds most polluted cities it is also the worlds biggest producer of renewable energy  including wind power with one of the largest land masses on the planet one in every three of the worlds wind turbines is in china with the government installing one per hour in 2016 in places like xinjiang  chinas most westerly province the windy weather used to be a nuisance with overturned lorries and derailed trains being a regular sight this is caused by mountain ranges between dabancheng and ürümqi which form a natural wind tunnel increasing the wind speed as air passes through these days the region is harnessing this same wind to produce incredible amounts of electricity  with 278 terwatt hours twh of electricity coming from the region in the first nine months of 2018 onshore wind farm in xinjiang xinjiang local wu gang founded goldwind to build chinas first windfarm here in the 1980s today its the worlds second largest turbine maker the turbines work on a simple premise wind turns the turbine blades which are connected to a rotor causing it to spin this in turn is connected to a generator which takes the winds kinetic energy to produce electricity hengill iceland iceland sits where the north american and eurasian tectonic plates meet meaning that magma rises close to the surface bringing with it a lot of energy potential one example of how the icelandic people are harnessing this power is the hellisheiði  the second largest geothermal power station in the world here highpressure geothermal steam is extracted from 30 wells ranging from 2000 to 3000 metres deep and is used to turn turbines and generate electricity this renewable plant has a capacity of 303 megawatts mw of electricity which is used to power the capital city of reykjavik the site was chosen due to its location in the hengill volcanic area in the south of iceland one of the most active geothermal areas on the planet here a giant magma chamber sits underground with thousands of hot springs above according to icelands national energy authority geothermal power from sites like this accounts for 25 of the countrys electricity production and 66 of primary energy usage but icelanders arent only using the geothermal landscape for energy production  chefs here can cook food simply by burying it in the ground producing delicacies like rúgbrauð  which translates as hot spring bread ouarzazate morocco from icelands belowzero temperatures to morocco a popular holiday destination for sunseekers with 330 days of sunshine a year morocco lays claim to a chunk of the sahara desert famously known as one of the hottest climates in the world where better then to situate the worlds largest solar thermal power plant noor solar thermal plant the moroccan city of ouarzazate nicknamed the  door of the desert plays host to the huge noor complex  which is still under construction and is being implemented in four parts the latest piece of the puzzle is noor iii which was hooked up to moroccos electricity grid last year  here 7400 mirrors reflect sun rays onto noor iiis tower the highest solarthermal tower in the world concentrating at the top of the building to create around 500ºc of heat this heats up the molten salts inside the tower which travel through a series of pipes creating high pressure steam this steam then moves a turbine to generate electricity molten salts are used at noor iii because they can operate at high temperatures and store heat effectively so that the site can continue to produce energy for up to 75 hours when theres no sun once up and running the plant will generate enough energy to power 120000 homes with no atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  along with the other projects at the noor complex noor iii is helping morocco to achieve its goal of obtaining 42 of its power from renewable sources by 2020 ben cruachan scotland the sun rays that shine on the noor complex are few and far between in the highlands but there are mountains aplenty  ben cruachan being one of them ben cruachan is the highest point in the argyll and bute area of scotland and is right next to the picturesque loch awe this provides the backdrop for the worlds first high head reversible pumpedstorage hydro scheme built by british engineer edward mccoll over 50 years ago cruachan power stations reservoir and loch awe viewed from the top of ben cruachan with the help of a 4000strong army of workers nicknamed the tunnel tigers  mccoll turned the slopes of ben cruachan into a geological battery which great britain still relies on today it works by using excess electricity on the national grid to pump water from loch awe at the foot of the mountain up to the cruachan reservoir 300 metres above during times of heightened demand  like when everyone puts the kettle on during a coronation street ad break or when the wind speed suddenly drops around breakfast time  this water is released back down the mountain to turn the turbines that live inside the hollowed mountain in this way cruachan power station can meet the nations energy needs within seconds whereas gas or nuclear stations would take many tens of minutes or hours to reach such capacity while ben cruachan lends itself perfectly to this pumpedstorage hydro facility it is only one of four such sites in the uk the challenge in installing more is that there are only a few sites which are mountainous with suitably large bodies of water nearby  things that are inherently necessary for pumpedstorage hydroelectricity  the growing importance of terroir all of these places embrace the land around them to produce energy in inventive ways and as levels of decarbonisation grow around the world there are an increasing number of places using whats available close to home for energy solutions take barbados
