the specialist electricity supplier to uk businesses and part of drax group plc has signed a deal with thames water to supply their electricity requirements in a deal worth more than 500m over five years there is an option for two further fiveyear renewals which could increase the overall value of the contract to more than 15bn over 15 years haven power is the uks largest independent electricity supplier to businesses and sources its power from the drax power plant in selby yorkshire which as a result of its world leading biomass transformation is now the uks single largest supplier of renewable energy the deal will enable thames water which already sources about 20 of its electricity through selfgenerated renewables such as solar wind hydro and biogas to meet all of its electricity needs from renewables drax group chief executive dorothy thompson said im delighted that drax and haven will play such an important part in helping to deliver thames renewable objectives as the uk looks to decarbonise in an affordable and pragmatic way it is pioneering companies like thames that are leading the way thames water energy manager angus berry said our energy and carbon strategy centres around reducing costs for customers and minimising our impact on the environment this deal with haven puts downward pressure on bills and means we will now be using 100 renewable electricity we look forward to growing our relationship with haven to exploit further opportunities to minimise energy costs and emissions as well as continuing to work towards our ambitious target of selfgenerating 30 of our own electricity by 2020 drax is undergoing a major transformation programme to convert its 4gw power station  which supplies around 8 of the uks power  from coal to sustainable biomass two out of six units have now been converted and plans are advanced to modify a third unit to highbiomass later this year the estimated 12 million tonnes of carbon saved once three units are fully converted is equivalent to taking 10 of the uks total vehicle fleet off the roads and makes drax the single largest decarbonisation project currently underway in europe ends notes to
