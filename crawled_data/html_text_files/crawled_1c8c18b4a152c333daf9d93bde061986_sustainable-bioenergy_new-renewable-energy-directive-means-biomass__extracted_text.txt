new renewable energy directive and what it means for biomass an update to the eus directive on renewables could mean a change in the role of biomass 29 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy this story was published the day before the announcement by the european commission please scroll to the bottom of this page for the drax view  when the european union set out its policy for the promotion of renewable energy in the 2009 renewable energy directive red it set a very ambitious target by 2020 renewables should make up 20 of the eus energy consumption each member state was given a specific goal and made to detail exactly how it would hit this the directive was comprehensive in many ways but it didnt include a clear sustainability policy for solid biomass including compressed wood pellets  as one of the largest sources of renewable energy in europe  this left a policy gap that many voices  including drax  have called to be filled its a wish that will now be granted a revised red is set to be published by the eu that will specify clear criteria for all biomass sustainability has always been absolutely central to our biomass strategy but drax has always argued that there is a right way to source biomass and a wrong way dorothy thompson drax group ceo july 2014 importance of sustainable biomass biomass is a wellestablished and essential part of the renewable energy mix it offers a unique mix of reliability flexibility and affordability all while helping to deliver carbon reductions this makes it particularly important as countries like the uk seek to phase out coal generation and hit the targets set out in the paris agreement however in order to secure these carbon benefits biomass needs to be produced sustainably this means that it comes from responsiblymanaged growing forests and that the emissions from the supply chain are measured and minimised in the uk there are already binding sustainability criteria but this isnt the case across the eu biomass use in the uk is regulated under the eu timber regulations and uks own renewable obligation ro biomass sustainability criteria the ro is a form of government support designed to incentivise large scale renewable electricity generation in the uk and to qualify for this energy companies must adhere to sustainability standards such as properly accounting for their greenhouse gas ghg emissions and only sourcing from responsibly managed land and forests  an euwide approach to biomass that follows the uks could see the implementation of a riskbased scheme that asks large energy companies to prove how they mitigate against a set of identified risks  like those in the ro criteria however its important that compliance with these is independently verified  something that could be done by using independent schemes such as the sustainable biomass program sbp the sbp carries out supplybase evaluation of pellet producers to ensure the wood theyre using is qualified as sustainable and theyre meeting the ro criteria programmes like the sbp are already being used by most major biomass power generators in the eu and could act as a blueprint for the future efficiency where effective only a few of the power stations across the eu are suitable for conversion from coal to biomass but those that are like drax can deliver fast significant carbon savings the thermal efficiency of such stations may not be as high as a newly built plant but they do allow governments to quickly move away from coal more than that these plants can continue to provide the critical services  such as voltage control and black start  the grid needs to remain stable and that other renewables cant drax is one of these stations and in the first half of 2016 it was able to deliver around 20 of the uks renewable power thanks to its conversion to biomass it now does this with over 80 carbon reductions relative to coal with the abundance of suitable and sustainablygrown fibre that can be used for biomass electricity generation there is a strong case for the eu to encourage the coal phase out by encouraging others to undergo conversion from coal to biomass but whats also needed is a clear set of sustainability criteria for biomass  the move to define this is a step in the right direction but the final eu proposal needs to be a practical one if the updated red achieves this it will mean a bright future for renewable energy in europe and a clearer path for meeting the continents paris agreement targets  30 november 2016 update  drax welcomes renewable energy directive proposal drax welcomes the publication of the renewable energy directive and bioenergy policy proposal  drax has been at the forefront of calling for standards based on a riskassessment to demonstrate the sustainability of biomass used for energy production matt willey public affairs director of drax power had said that drax has campaigned for a robust pragmatic biomass sustainability policy for the whole eu for many years and today is a step in the right direction it is important that large users of biomass can demonstrate forest regeneration is taking place that areas of high conservation value are protected that soil and water quality is maintained and that harvesting does not exceed the longterm production capacity of the forest we welcome the fact the commission proposes that voluntary national or international schemes including those which use a risk based approach can be used to provide evidence of sustainability the uk already has the toughest sustainability rules in the world so drax can be sure our compressed wood pellets are sustainable but it makes sense to have a common policy across the eu drax power has made huge efforts to demonstrate the sustainability of its biomass  sourcing from regions with large surpluses combined with low wood paying capability drax is able to track and trace every shipment back to low risk areas which assures that biodiversity is protected
