power station phoenix biopower explores next generation beccs technology for drax group swedish and uk companies exploring ways to drive down costs of 2ndgeneration bioenergy with carbon capture and storage technology 18 june 2021 phoenix biopowers study will investigate how the latest energy efficient turbine technology could reduce the costs of new build bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs plants swedishbased phoenix biopower and renewable energy company drax group a global leader in sustainable biomass power generation are exploring ways to drive down the costs of secondgeneration bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology the feasibility study by phoenix biopower will look at how energyefficient gas turbines could make newbuild beccs projects more cost effective by generating 50 more power with the same amount of fuel when powering a 300mwe biomass plant with integrated carbon capture and storage the innovative top cycle turbines are up to 15 percentage points more efficient with beccs than existing technologies used in power stations and could also be used with other renewable technologies to support decarbonising energy systems globally henrik b√•ge ceo of phoenix biopower said working alongside drax a global leader in sustainable biomass power generation and beccs gives us an exciting opportunity to explore the next generation of negative emissions technologies together with our highefficiency biopower technology we look forward to working with the worldclass engineers at drax on this study to further develop these essential technologies by integrating pressurised biomass gas into the turbine instead of highpressure steam biomassfired top cycle turbines can almost double of the electrical efficiency from biomass compared to the traditional steam cycle the study will also investigate how the biomassfired top cycle gas turbines can be utilised for other renewable technologies such as hydrogen combustion and production the study will be based on results from phoenixs test facilities in sweden and germany drax is already the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted its power station near selby in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal by using the vital negative emissions technology beccs at the site drax aims to go further by becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 jason shipstone drax group chief innovation officer said negative emissions technologies such as beccs will play a crucial role in the global fight against climate change and at drax were planning to install this technology at our existing power station in the uk this partnership with phoenix biopower is one of a number of options were investigating as part of our longterm innovation programme which will enable drax to understand the potential of future technological advances so we can continue to innovate develop and grow as a business ends media contacts phoenix biopower henrik b√•ge 46 0734 23 22 55 email protected drax ben wicks media manager 44 7761 525 662 email protected editors notes the work by phoenix biopower with drax will develop a feasibility study to identify how biomassfired top cycle turbines can be integrated into new build beccs power stations the study will be based on results from two of phoenix biopowers test sites in sweden biomass gasification and germany ultrawet gas turbine combustion and will create a model based on data provided by both companies the study will also investigate how gas turbines can also be utilised for other renewable technologies such as hydrogen combustion and production about beccs at drax drax aims to deploy beccs on two of its biomass generating units by 2030 capturing and permanently storing up to eight million tonnes of co 2 a year  a significant proportion of the negative emissions the climate change committee says are needed in order for the uk to reach its climate targets the ipcc uk climate change committee and national grids future energy scenarios report all recognise the vital role biomass and beccs will play in the uk meeting its legally binding net zero by 2050 target the governments legally binding commitment to cut emissions by 78 by 2035 in line with the climate change committees 6th carbon budget advice also reinforces the vital role of beccs to delivery net zero in the uk beccs is the only negative emissions technology that generates power whilst also permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere about phoenix biopower phoenix biopower founded in 2016 develops a new technology for high efficiency biopower and a novel gas turbine cycle for ultrawet combustion enabling the energy transition to plannable renewables and utility scale negative emissions the btc technology the biopower technology btc  biomassfired top cycle is based on the integration of pressurised biomass gasification and gas turbine combustion enabling a near doubling of the electrical efficiency from biomass compared to the traditional steam cycle the company targets to commission a first fullscale plant by end of 2028 the top cycle gas turbine the novel gas turbine technology top cycle is based on the principle of replacing excess air with steam enabling higher power generation capabilities at lower capex and high value waste heat to be used for other purposes like ccs or district heating without affecting the power cycle the ultrawet conditions in combustion enable very low nox emissions especially with hydrogen combustion and very stable flame conditions phoenix biopower combined heat and power chp plan without carbon capture technology  click to viewdownload  for more information visit wwwphoenixbiopowercom customers phoenix biopower

parties power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan pellet production and supply drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the us south and western canada which have the capacity to manufacture 49 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses
