and sounds that make up daily life retreat creating a strange yet familiar world theres less activity but that doesnt mean there is no activity while great britain sleeps phones charge and fridges hum electricity is a 24hour need and so the stations generating it must be 24hour operations but the life of a power station by night is very different to that by day walking around the power station at night can almost feel like the mary celeste says simon acaster drax power stations generation manager there may be as few as 50 to 60 people on site which isnt a lot when you consider the size of the plant and compare it to the day when there are some 650 people around drax power station by day is a hive of activity alongside generation there are maintenance engineering  trading and contract support at night this is all stripped back work is focused on the core production issues looking after the asset and maintaining power generation output to meet our contract position keeping the teams safe and making sure we stay environmentally compliant  says mark rhodes shift manager at drax its a quieter place he adds keeping power flowing typically teams at drax swap over at 8pm and 8am on a cycle of day and night shifts during the summer months when one or more of the stations six 600 megawatt mw units can be on outage and maintenance is carried out across the station work often continues around the clock right through the night but during a period of normal operation the night workforce is reduced to basic operations and maintenance teams material handling teams receiving biomass deliveries  which continue through the night  and security staff  demand for electricity typically falls overnight so drax shuts down unneeded generation units around 10pm as morning approaches teams prep them to restart in time for when people wake up and turn on kettles  even when we shut the units down the turbine is still turning throughout the night says acaster all the hydraulic pumps and lube oil systems are still functioning a lot of plant is in service even when the units are shut down this means theres still the potential as during the day for something to need maintenance or attention at any moment requiring the teams to jump into action we aim to sort any shortterm issues through the night says rhodes but for any technical issues that can wait we tackle them when the day team returns and were fully staffed at night its more about safely managing the asset the hardest part of a running the power station overnight however is not a technical one its a human one theres no doubt about it working nights is tiring says acaster the biggest challenge is keeping everybody focused and aware of whats happening he continues unit controllers regularly talk to their plant operators checking in every hour so we know theyre safe supervisors need to be out on plant engaging and talking to employees checking on what theyre doing and keeping them active and alert the shifting of the night shift the decarbonisation of great britains electricity system has changed the way drax operates during the day and the same is true of the night historically we had six units and they would be baseload generating 645 mw each says rhodes they would operate continuously day and night but with the demand profile changing  lower power prices and other methods of generation coming onto the system  that model is changing overnight is normally the time of least demand and when the price of power becomes most depressed rhodes continues so we take units off and prepare them for the morning returning when there is value regularly shutting down and starting the units takes a tougher toll on the equipment than running them continuously which increases the need for maintenance teams on night shifts theres also a need for teams to be on standby to ramp up or down generation  the increased volatility of the countrys power network brought on in part by increasing levels of intermittent renewables means national grid can often ask drax to increase or decrease generation at short notice to provide balancing services like inertia frequency response or reserve power  our units can come down to 300 mw and stay at that level says acaster across three units that gives national grid 900 mw of spare capacity that can be turned up its like a sleeping giant awaiting start up at any time but unlike other sleeping giants this one is never truly at rest the demands of the network keep it and the men and women operating it humming through the night

animal than most and when something does need fixing or improving its his job to make sure it happens its a task that keeps him busy read gareths story the toolmaster what do you do when a piece of equipment in the uks largest power station breaks down more often than not the answer is send it to andrew storrs workshop before drax power station was a part of andrew storrs career it was a part of

story tags drax power station  electricity generation  engineering  power station  turbines a positive negative 18 january 2017 carbon capture this story was updated in june 2018 following the announcement of draxs pilot beccs project is there a way to generate electricity not only with no emissions but with negative emissions its an idea that after decades of being reliant on coal had seemed almost impossible but as drax has shown by announcing a pilot of the first bioenergy carbon capture storage beccs project of its kind in europe  it might not be impossible for much longer a few years on from the historic paris agreement  which sets a target of keeping global temperature rise below two degrees celsius  innovative solutions for reducing emissions are critical among these few are more promising than beccs it sounds like a straightforward solution  capture carbon emissions and lock them up hundreds of metres underground or turn the carbon into useful products  but the result could be gamechanging generating electricity with negative emissions capturing carbon carbon capture and storage ccs technology works by trapping the carbon dioxide co 2  emitted after a fuel source has been used and moving it to safe storage  often in depleted oil and gas reservoirs underground there are a number of ccs technologies available but one of the simplest is oxyfuel combustion fuel such as coal gas or biomass is burnt in a high oxygen environment and co 2  rather than carbon c or carbon monoxide co  is produced other impurities are removed and the resulting pure co 2 is compressed to form a liquid this co 2 can then be transported via pipeline to its designated storage space normally hundreds of metres underground the uk is wellplaced to benefit from the technology thanks to the north sea  which has enough space to store the eus carbon emissions for the next 100 years its a technology that can drastically reduce the emissions from fossil fuel use but how can it be used to produce negative emissions two technologies working as one biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured as part of its life in the forest is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases a report published by the energy technology institute eti looking at the uk has suggested that by the 2050s beccs could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year  approximately half the nations emissions target its not the only body heralding it as a necessary step for the future the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc stated in a 2014 report that keeping global warming below two degrees celsius would be difficult if beccs had limited deployment support is widespread but for it to lead to a practical future beccs needs suitable support and investment mills such as morehouse bioenergy manufacture compressed wood pellets  a sustainablysourced fuel for beccs power plants of the future positive support for negative emissions there are only a handful of ccs projects in operation or under construction across the world and many simply reuse rather than capture the co 2  part of the reason is cost its estimated that optimal ccs technology can cost about as much as the power station itself to install and running it can consume up to 20 of a stations power output this means more fuel is needed to produce the same amount of power compared to a conventional power plant of similar efficiency without government support it remains a prohibitively expensive solution for many power generators with government support in the form of multidecade contracts large ccs or beccs plants could leverage economies of scale they could deliver energy companies and their shareholders a return on the investments in the longterm drax research and development past plans by drax could have put the company on a timeline towards becoming the worlds first large scale negative emitter of co 2  it would have achieved it firstly with the construction of a ccs power station at its selby north yorkshire site the 428 mw white rose power station was to be fuelled by a mixture of coal and biomass and once in operation could have paved the way for similar facilities elsewhere as carbon capture technology improved and costs came down but unfortunately the project never went ahead  there are some positive signs that carbon capture technologies are developing around the world the first clean coal power station became operational in the us earlier this month  and a second ccs plant is on the way a ukbacked carbon capture and use ccu project in india recently opened at a chemicals factory involving the capture of emissions for use in the manufacturing process  back in the uk where the government outlined plans to end coalfired power generation by 2025  carbon capture power stations must become financially competitive if they are to become a major part of the countrys low carbon future but if the world is to achieve the targets agreed in paris and pursue a cleaner future negative emissions are a must and beccs remains a leading technology to help achieve it tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage

hall at drax power station  theyre easily missed but these few inches of copper play an instrumental role in powering your home surging through each one is enough electricity to power a city but the process of getting electricity from power station to plug isnt as simple as connecting one wire to a live turbine and another to your iphone charger we need an entire network of power stations cables and transformers linking the network when the country first became electrified it did so in stages each region of the uk was powered by its own selfcontained power supply that changed in 1926 when the uk set up the central electricity board and began what was at the time the biggest construction project britain had ever seen the national grid the project took 100000 men and five years to complete and when it was finished it connected 122 of the countrys most efficient power stations via 4000 miles of overhead cabling it had a sizeable effect in 1920 there were roughly 750000 electricity consumers by 1938 that had risen to 9 million the grid has changed in the 80 years thats passed but it remains the network that transfers power across the country to where its needed whenever its needed the strange thing about electricity is that you could live 10 miles from a power station and you cant be sure the electricity youre using is coming from that station says callan masters an engineer with national grid whose job it is to maintain and upgrade the network the whole system works together  the whole system has a demand and the whole system has to deliver it and to do this the network has to be able to deliver electricity quickly and efficiently masters explains it acts like a motorway for power riding the motorway for power the process of transporting electricity involves a series of stages the first of which is stepping up the voltage when electricity is transported via cables or wires it loses some of its energy as heat think of a lightbulb  as it illuminates it heats up because its losing energy the lower the current of that electricity however the less energy is lost so to reduce these losses when transporting power national grid transmits electricity at low currents which it can do by increasing its voltage at the power station electricity is generated at 23500 volts and is then stepped up to 400000 volts by a transformer the first of these is located on a substation on site at the power station once stepped up the electricity is transported through high transmission cables  before being stepped down via a transformer on the other end this stepped down electricity is passed onto a regional distribution system such as the overhead cables you might find on top of wooden poles before being stepped down a final time thats the role of a little transformer at the end of your street masters explains finally the electricity is transported via a final cable into your home  this time at 230 volts all this needs to happen incredibly quickly as thousands of kettles are switched on to herald the end of eastenders  the demand of electricity surges delivering that electricity at the touch of a button relies on a complex network but it starts with those inconspicuous few inches of copper at the power station tags drax power station  energy policy  national grid  power station  technology vikings airships and ash the history of barlow mound 10 january 2017 sustainable business barlow mound is a haven for wildlife more than 100 different species call it home including kingfishers roe deer and falcons its an area that looks like its never been touched by the industrialisation that surrounds it the truth is very different barlow mound is manmade it was built in the 1970s using residue material from its neighbour drax power station its a success story of using what was then considered a waste material to create something natural and beautiful but it has a long history before becoming what it is today and to explore that history is to track the outlook of the uk over the last millennium the military moves in the area around barlow and drax was an important location for the very first viking explorers who arrived here from the north sea via the regions ouse and aire rivers but it wasnt until 1086 that it received its first recorded mention when it was listed as berlaileag in the domesday book translating to a clearing where barley grew it was named by anglo saxon settlers who established the region as a mix of farmland fields and woodlands and it remained agricultural until the early twentieth century when the country was plunged into war when the first world war began in 1914 and the need for new war machines arose sir w g armstrong whitworth  co ltd a manufacturing company which had obtained the land in 1913 from the estate of lord londesborough set up an airship factory on the site during its lifetime the factory constructed three airships the 25r r29 and r33 but when wwi ended and demand for airships sank the factory shut down and the land passed to the ministry of defence mod during the second world war the area became an important location in the countrys war efforts once again the mod set up an army ordnance and command supply depot manufacturing and storing items like mess tins and kerosene lamps at one point the site also included a prisoner of war camp by the 60s the uks needs for defence manufacturing had subsided instead what it needed was more power with the rich coal seams of the area and the existing rail network the hullbarnsley line ran through building a power station in the barlow area was an obvious solution  firstofakind solution in 1967 the land was bought by the central electric generating board cegb which began the construction of drax power station one of the early challenges it faced was how to minimise the environmental impact to the surrounding countryside in particular it needed a solution for the tonnes of ash that came from the burning of coal fuel which included both pulverised fuel ash pfa and furnace bottom ash fba the answer was a firstofakind build a mound using the materials construction on barlow mound began in 1974 first the existing top soil was removed and preserved for later use drains were added and then a layer of fba was laid next conditioned pfa was added and moulded to suit the original design never reaching higher than 36 metres at this height the mound would visually obscure the power station from the neighbouring houses the final step was to seal the mound with a polymer and then reintroduce the top soil before grass trees and hedgerow were planted the trees and plants had been carefully tested to ensure that their roots wouldnt interfere with the ash and compromise the integrity of the structure an ecologically important area as time has passed and drax power station has produced more ash the mound has developed and grown more than 301 million m 3 is stored in the current site  more than the capacity of three million double decker buses in addition to the 100 species living on the site a tenant farmer works 20 fields and a swan rescue and wildlife hospital rehabilitates up to 2000 birds a year more recently the skylark centre and nature reserve has now opened up the area to the public to explore walking trails and see the nature firsthand barlow is an area that has changed consistently since 1086 from the norths early beginnings as an agricultural hub and anglosaxon settlement to the necessity for largescale power solutions and to the importance of preserving local ecology barlow is an area that has been characterised by the outlook of the country like drax power station to which it is intrinsically linked barlow mound is a part of the northern yorkshire landscape  literally and

that on a normal day spins 3000 times every minute the first port of call is to call in someone like alice gill an instrument craftsperson at drax power station what does an instrument craftperson do what i do is maintain and repair the equipment that links the outside power plant and the control room  equipment that tracks temperature levels or positioning that then informs our operators in the control room whats happening on the plant things like an oxygen analyser its a probe that sits in the boiler and monitors the oxygen level so the operator can ensure the correct ratio of fuel to air is going into the boiler to reach optimum combustion i might be called on to do calibration checks on that sensor to ensure that its working properly or i might be asked to completely remove it and then to repair it how did you come to be doing this job im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person my dad was always working and fixing things in the garage at home and i liked being in there with him when i was at school i decided i didnt want to go to university so started applying for apprenticeships and looking into engineering opportunities drax was one of those schemes and was the one i most wanted to be selected for  luckily enough i was offered a place the apprenticeship was four years and there are loads of training courses and so much to learn including hands on experience and working in the plant i remember first arriving to the power station and not really believing the scale of the place you think how am i ever going to find my way around but you soon get used to it and it becomes the norm in september i became a full instrument craftsperson so now i can really get stuck in im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person what sort of challenges do you face over the summer ive been doing a lot of work on the turbines its a big job as theyre one of the most important elements driving the plant and generating the power during outages the whole thing gets overhauled and given a full health check the turbine team needs to get into machinery which is densely constructed and put together so its my job to go in and carefully remove instrumentation so they can access it when theyre done i have to go back in refit everything and check its all working again how do you do that when youre removing the instruments its a bit more of a just get it off approach  you just make sure you get it off safely without damaging it then when were refitting it were out there with our multimeters making sure were setting different probes at the right voltages and that everything is calibrated correctly theres a screen in our workshop we use to watch the activity of the turbine so we can see the speed of the turbine creeping up as they switch it back on its always a big moment you know things are going to be alright because youve done everything but there are still some nervous people in the room the turbines are spinning at 3000rpm so you really need it all to be working properly is there anything that could wrong on an average day one of the biggest things that could go wrong in my area is the potential to trip an entire generating unit it might be that you overpressurise something or you accidentally trigger a switch that then sets off a daisy chain of events that ends up in a unit tripping tripping is where the unit turns off which basically leads to a total shutdown in electricity generation from one sixth of drax power station theres something called the 660 club  at full load the units are operating at 660 mw so if you trip one you enter into this infamous club there are a few guys in the 660 club but thankfully i havent joined when operating at full load of 660 mw our units supply the national grid with around 645 mw enough to power an entire city what do you do outside of work ive got a horse called red  ive had him for seven years but ive been riding since i was eight its quite different to working with things that do exactly what you tell them when you get on the horse he just does what he wants  hes got a mind

story to mark the new gb record of continuous coalfree hours since 1882 3490 bc households in china work out how to use coal for heat the coal was bulky to transport so settlements near forests probably burned it less often than wood  4 th century bc greek scientist theophrastus makes a reference to coal as a fuel in his treatise  on stones  2 nd century ad by the 2 nd century ad the romans were using coal from most of the main coalfields in britain archaeologists have found flint axes from before the roman era still embedded in coal there is evidence that at this time people dug up coal on beaches then followed the seam of coal inland encouraging them to investigate more sophisticated ways to mine it first millennium although its hard to date them precisely early mines called bell pits  deep holes which tapered outward at the bottom like a bell to provide a bigger surface area for mining  began to appear in the early part of the first millennium these were lit by large candles burning animal fat and were dangerous rocks could fall onto the miners and sometimes the pit would collapse entirely 13 th and 14 th centuries room and pillar mines emerged as larger more sophisticated versions of bell pits in these pillars of coal were left standing to support the roof 16 th century from the 1500s mining expanded significantly at this time coal was mostly used for heat by less welloff people one observer wrote in 1587 that old men told him about the multitude of chimneys lately erected whereas in their young days there were not above two or three if so many in most uplandish towns of the realm 1700 great britain was producing 27 million tonnes of coal per year mostly for use in metal production 1750 in just half a century britain ramps up coal production it was producing 47 million tonnes of coal per year 1763 to 1775 james watt develops his steam engine which was used to drain mines despite this flooding remained a problem 1800 by the turn of the nineteenth century great britain was producing 10 million tonnes of coal driven by the rising demand of the industrial revolution from about 1800 miners began to leave timber supports in place to hold up the roof of their pits allowing them to follow coal seams deep into the earth this was known as longwall mining 1815 sir humphrey davy invents his safety lamp it had a wire gauze around it so the flame would not encounter any gas and cause explosions it became known as the miners friend 1850 great britain was producing 50 million tonnes of coal 1882 the worlds first steam driven power station was built on coal at holborn viaduct in london it had a 27 tonne generator enough to light 1000 lamps later it was expanded to power 3000 a second coalfired power station opened later that year in the united states at pearl street station in new york city it initially served a load of 400 lamps and 82 customers but by 1884 it was powering more than 10000 lamps 1900 great britain was producing 250 million tonnes of coal 1947 all great british coal mines were nationalised bought by the government and placed under the control of the national coal board  1974 after the selby coalfield was discovered in 1967 drax power station was opened  1988 drax became the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions 1994 from the eighties onwards many coal mines closed and in 1994 british coal the successor to the national coal board was privatised 2004 as a result of uk mine closures and proposed emissions regulations coming into force from 2008 power stations started to increase the amount of coal they imported drax power stations supply was initially split between 50 indigenous coal and 50 imported there was a steadily increasing emphasis on imports for the decade thereafter 2008 the large combustion plant directive lcpd came into force across the eu limiting emissions of so 2  nox and particulates 2009 the drax team successfully adapted the boilers of the plant to combust wood pellets  this was proof that a coalfired power plant could be converted to biomass march 2013 the white rose carbon capture and storage ccs project was announced as one of two preferred bidders in the uks 1bn ccs competition this project looked to build a new 448 mwe coalfired power station with ccs capabilities on the existing drax power station site in yorkshire with ccs technology installed the power station would be able to capture and safely store carbon emissions underground rather than releasing them into the atmosphere 1st april 2013 the carbon price floor was launched in the uk a tax on carbon dioxide co 2  emissions it is designed to provide an incentive to invest in lowcarbon power generation september 2015 due to reduced renewable subsidies drax withdrew from the white rose ccs project 18 th november 2015 the uk government announced its intention to close all unabated coalfired power stations by 2025 and restrict their usage from 2023 to meet the challenge of climate change drax aims to end its reliance on coal even quicker drax ceo dorothy thompson has talked about the possibility given the right support to have all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before  25 th november 2015 the uk government cancelled its 1bn competition for ccs

coal units could be turned off by 2023 tags coal  energy policy  history  power station how do you build a dome bigger than the albert hall 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the most iconic sight at drax power station has been its large grey cooling towers but thats changing today the most striking image on the selby skyline is four white domes each larger in volume than the royal albert hall these are draxs biomass storage domes standing 50 metres high and holding 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets between them  enough to power leeds manchester sheffield and liverpool for more than 12 days theyre an integral part of draxs ongoing transition from coal to renewable biomass electricity generation but while biomass is a far cleaner source of energy than coal  reducing carbon emissions by more than 80  it comes with its own challenges a key one is storage thats where the domes come in the need for a new storage space storing coal is a relatively simple task with some management by heavy vehicles to reduce the occurrence of air pockets coal can quite happily sit outside in the rain and still work efficiently as fuel compressed wood pellets are different if a wood pellet gets wet it can degrade and become unusable the main reason to compress wood into high density pellets in the first place is to take its moisture content down saving weight for transportation and increasing its efficiency as a fuel for power station boilers more than that because the biomass pellets are made from wood  a living and breathing organic material  they have to be stored in sensitively calibrated environments to keep them in a safe and usable state each storage dome had to be carefully designed engineered and constructed to ensure it was fit to maintain this environment construction began back in 2013 and required a drax engineering team working closely with idahobased dome technology and yorks shepherd construction at more than 50 metres tall theyre the largest of their kind in the world  a new approach to construction had to be considered there were three key steps involved in the build blowing up a giant balloon the first stage is to prepare the foundation which takes the form of a massive concrete circular ring beam a giant pvc airform dome is laid out over the ring beam and inflated using fans that are about the size of a doctor who telephone box to form the outside of the dome insulating the inside with the dome still airinflated a thin 15mm layer of polyurethane foam is sprayed to the inside serving to both insulate the structure and provide purchase for the first layers of steel reinforcements completing the shell once the first steel reinforcing grid is attached to the polyurethane the concrete spraying process begins the dome wall is built up to a thickness of up to 350mm by adding further layers of steel reinforcement grid and reinforced concrete under pressure the challenge the team now face following construction is maintaining a safe atmosphere inside the domes the pellets are stored inside the domes in vast quantities and weight which collectively create high amounts of pressure as the pressure builds up the pellets release oxygen which can cause a buildup of heat and potentially an explosion but by addressing the cause of the increase in heat  the oxygen  the team found they could limit the danger potential the solution was a speciallydesigned system that releases nitrogen into the dome the gas forms nonflammable compounds with the oxygen which keeps the inside of the dome stable the drax cooling towers are still visible in and around selby and while theyre still an essential part of the power station emitting steam not smoke used in the generating process theyre no longer its most iconic image the four storage domes sitting beside them more closely represent the future of drax a renewable one built on biomass technology now that the domes have been built find out how their atmosphere is controlled  tags careers  power station  technology  visit us protecting the uks power from cyberattacks power generation at the heart of all aspects of modern life is a common resource electricity we need it to power our homes and our devices to do our jobs and increasingly with electric trains trams and cars to get from a to b for that electricity to be generated we need power stations theyre a critical part of the uks infrastructure and so for terrorists and foreign states that have much to gain from disrupting the country electricity generators are an obvious target drax power station is the uks largest with the capability to generate enough electricity to power every home in the north of england with this mantle comes a higher risk of security threats  notably cyberattacks protecting the plant from these attacks is not only essential for draxs business but for the safety of the country the threat of cyberattacks cyberattacks exist in the digital space but can have a very real and tangible effect on the physical world between 200710 a computer virus later called stuxnet attacked the iranian nuclear programme damaging a number of the centrifuges  a key part of the nuclear manufacturing process as a result iran was forced to decommission roughly 1000 centrifuges  in a separate attack 35000 computers belonging to the saudi energy company saudi aramco were partially wiped and destroyed disrupting saudi arabias ability to supply 10 of the worlds oil over the past few years the threat of malicious entities has only increased  an alleged nation state attack on ukraines power grid in late december 2015 left thousands of homes without electricity drax is not immune to similar attempts  every month the security team investigates about 1000 issues on an average month two of the 1000 are judged to be serious enough to warrant further investigation this is where darktrace comes in identifying the threats darktrace is an incredibly powerful system that identifies and deals with threats to drax it starts by getting to know you it learns every single device on the network its speed of traffic and the patterns of each users daily work behaviour for example if a user logs in to the work systems at 8pm but has never done so before darktrace will identify this behaviour and flag it as different from the norm flagging each of these events depending on its assessed severity it maps the devices into a graphic that looks like a galaxy of stars of different colours draxs security team use this to see at a glance which devices need attention and action the result is a view across the whole power station  both the corporate environment and our industrial control systems  those security experts can then see where there have been issues with password protection software updates with errors and where any breaches come from more importantly they can see viruses infecting devices in real time when the system thinks it might see one there are three possible outcomes ignore throttle kill once darktrace identifies any abnormal activity that could be a threat the system offers three options ignore throttle or kill ignore means allowing the system to continue as normal this option would be used if the system flagged something as a threat which human investigation found was harmless the throttle option is designed for a situation when a virus is affecting one part of the operation of one device but shutting down the device entirely would disable a critical function the throttle option slows the affected part of the device down to a virtual standstill but allows the device to continue the rest of its operations while the system investigates kill means removing the unit from the network immediately if a machine behaves in a way that suggests it could be infected it can be shut down almost immediately every day a live dashboard of variables is available to identify problems investigate breaches fix any infected devices and then rebuild those systems its a daily schedule that not only ensures the power station can continue uninterrupted but that the entire country can too tags power station
