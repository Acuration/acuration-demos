transport contact us 5 projects proving carbon capture is a reality from capture methods to storage and use across three continents these companies are showing promising results for ccus 4 march 2020 carbon capture the concept of capturing carbon dioxide co 2  from power station refinery and factory exhausts has long been hailed as crucial in mitigating the climate crisis and getting the uk and the rest of the world to net zero  after a number of false starts and policy hurdles the technology is now growing with more momentum than ever carbon capture use and storage ccus is finally coming of age increasing innovation and investment in the space is enabling the development of ccus schemes at scale today there are over 19 largescale ccus facilities in operation worldwide while a further 32 in development as confidence in government policies and investment frameworks improves once co 2 is captured it can be stored underground in empty oil and gas reservoirs and naturally occurring saline aquifers in a process known as sequestration it has also long been used in enhanced oil recovery eor a process where captured co 2 is injected into oil reservoirs to increase oil production  drax power station is already trialling europes first bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs project this combination of sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year and put drax power station at the centre of wider decarbonisation efforts across the region as part of zero carbon humber  here are five other projects making carbon capture a reality today snøhvit  sleipner vest who sleipner  equinor energy var energi lotos kufpec snøhvit  equinor energy petoro total neptune energy wintershall dean where norway sleipner vest offshore carbon capture and storage ccs plant norway click to viewdownload sleipner vest was the worlds first ever offshore carbon capture and storage ccs plant and has been active since 1996 the facility separates co 2 from natural gas extracted from the sleipner field as well as from at the utgard field about 20km away this method of carbon capture means co 2 is removed before the natural gas is combusted allowing it to be used as an energy source with lower carbon emissions snøhvit  located offshore in norways northern barents sea operates similarly but here natural gas is pumped to an onshore facility for carbon removal the separated and compressed co 2 from both facilities is then stored or sequestered in empty reservoirs under the sea the two projects demonstrate the safety and reality of longterm co 2 sequestration  as of 2019 sleipner has captured and stored over 23 million tonnes of co 2 while snøhvit stores 700000 tonnes of co 2 per year petra nova who nrg mitsubishi heavy industries america inc mhia and jx nippon a joint venture with hilcorp energy where texas usa in 2016 the largest carbon capture facility in the world began operation at the petra nova coalfired power plant using a solvent developed by mitsubishi and kansai electric power called ks1  the co 2 is absorbed and compressed from the exhausts of the plant after the coal has been combusted the captured co 2 is then transported and used for eor 80 miles away on the west ranch oil field carbon capture facility at the petra nova coalfired power plant texas usa as of january 2020 over 35 million tonnes of co 2 had been captured reducing the plants carbon emissions by 90 oil production on the other hand increased by 1300 to 4000 barrels a day as well as preventing co 2 from being released into the atmosphere ccus has also aided the sites sustainability by eliminating the need for hydraulic drilling gorgon lng barrow island australia click to viewdownload gorgon lng who operated by chevron in a joint venture with shell exxon mobil osaka gas tokyo gas jera where barrow island australia in 2019 ccs operations began at one of australias largest liquified natural gas production facilities located off the western coast here co 2 is removed from natural gas before the gas is cooled to 162 o c turning it into a liquid the removed co 2 is then injected via wells into the dupuy formation a saline aquifer 2km underneath barrow island once fully operational estimated to be in 2020 the project aims to reduce the facilitys emissions by about 40 and plans to store between 34 and 4 million tonnes of co 2 each year quest shells quest carbon capture facility alberta canada who operated by shell owned by chevron and canadian natural resources where alberta canada the scotford upgrader facility in canadas oil sands uses hydrogen to upgrade bitumen a substance similar to asphalt to make a synthetic crude oil in 2015 the quest carbon capture facility was added to scotford upgrader to capture the co 2 created as a result of making the sites hydrogen once captured the co 2 is pressurised and turned into a liquid which is piped and stored 60km away in the basal cambrian sandstone saline aquifer over its four years of crude oil production four million tonnes of co 2 have been captured it is estimated that over its 25year life span this ccs technology could capture and store over 27 million tonnes of co 2  chevron estimates that if the facility were to be built today it would cost 2030 less a sign of the falling cost of the technology boundary dam who saskpower where saskatchewan canada boundary dam  a coalfired power station became the worlds first postcombustion ccs facility in 2014 the technology uses shells cansolv solvent to remove co 2 from the exhaust of one of the power stations 115 mw units part of the captured co 2 is used for eor while any unused co 2 is stored in the deadwood formation a brine and sandstone reservoir deep underground as of december 2019 more than three million tonnes of co 2 had been captured at boundary dam the continuous improvement and optimisations made at the facility are proving ccs technology at scale and informing ccs projects around the world including a possible retrofit project at saskpowers 305 mw shand power station  top image carbon capture facility at the petra nova coalfired power
