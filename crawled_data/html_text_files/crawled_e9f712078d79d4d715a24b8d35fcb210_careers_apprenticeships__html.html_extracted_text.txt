As a Drax apprentice you will receive a considerable amount of support from your manager, mentor/buddy, and the Early Careers Team.  They will work closely with your training provider to ensure that your apprenticeship equips you for your future career.  In addition to specific experience and development relating to your apprenticeship, you will receive core skills development to prepare you for the world of work and your future career.
Drax works hard to recognise the achievements of its apprentices and holds annual apprenticeship awards to celebrate their success.
