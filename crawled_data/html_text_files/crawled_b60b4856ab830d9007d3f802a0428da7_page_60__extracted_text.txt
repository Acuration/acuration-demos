and a series of meetings with local council representatives the planning inspectorate progress power as well as representatives of mid suffolk district council and suffolk county council answered questions at the meeting progress power will shortly be publishing further information on the project with particular regard to the proposed electrical connection compound including the substation and the trafficaccess arrangements relating to its construction these access changes are a direct result of the concerns raised by the local people during the statutory consultation process in october and november last year this information will be made available for comment at local libraries at mid suffolk district councils office in needham market and via the progress power website wwwprogresspowercouk  although the statutory period of consultation ended last november progress power is happy to continue to receive feedback on the overall project via email at email protected or

200m power plant proposal for hirwaun 10 october 2013 press releases public exhibitions in five locations leaflet to all households businesses and civic groups statutory consultation on a proposed gasfired power plant on the hirwaun industrial estate in rhondda cynon taf begins this month october 2013 hirwaun power ltd hpl a uk power plant development company will hold its consultation on the 200m proposal between 17th october and 28th november 2013 hpl has produced a statement of community consultation detailing the preapplication consultation programme it includes a number of exhibition events which will be an opportunity for local people and interested organisations to see the plans and give their views on the proposals rhondda cynon taf county borough council rct has been consulted on the programme an informal and nonstatutory round of consultation was held in june this year when the outline proposal was presented to communities during several public exhibition events that were attended by 98 people the statutory consultation will show how the project has developed since then in the light of community feedback engagement with rct and authorities such as natural resource wales and the companys own technical and environmental studies the proposed hirwaun power project would produce up to 299 megawatts mw of electricity  the equivalent of supplying 400000 homes  would represent a significant multi million pound investment into the local economy the project would support up to 250 jobs during the 23 year construction and commissioning period and up to 15 fulltime jobs when operational hirwaun powers project director norman campbell said consultation with local communities and organisations is vitally important to us it provides us with an opportunity to explain our project in detail and get feedback to help with the development of our proposals our initial phase of consultation in june gave us the chance to communicate directly with local people and we were pleased with the interest shown we will now explain how the project has moved forward in recent months and provide more detailed information for example we have further developed our proposals relating to the siting and design of the power plant in doing so we have also taken steps to minimise the environmental and visual impact of the project if the proposals are realised the power plant would be ultramodern and a very significant investment in the local economy the project would directly create new jobs and provide opportunities for a variety of other local companies to supply and support the operation and maintenance of the power station in the future we hope that as many people as possible will attend our public exhibition days or see the information we have made available on the project website and at certain local libraries we will advertise the formal consultation in local media and also distribute more than 4000 leaflets in the area surrounding the site at the end of the consultation period hpl plans to submit an application for a development consent order to the uks planning inspectorate with a final decision taken by the secretary of state for energy and climate change subject to the consultation and planning process and financing the power station could enter commercial operation in 2018 public exhibition events will be held as follows public exhibitions

early stage there will be no drawings artists impressions or models on display hirwaun power proposes to take gas from the nearby national gas transmission system and use it to generate electricity this energy will feed into the national grid which also runs very close to the site norman campbell is the managing director of watt power the parent company of hirwaun power and has principal responsibility for the project he said this power station will be an ultra modern and clean facility and a very significant investment in the local economy we will seek to maximise local economic benefit both during construction and operations this will be achieved through direct job opportunities and also indirectly through the various companies that will supply and support the power station in the future this power station will cost approximately 200 million and tens of millions of that investment would be spent with local companies we are strongly committed to benefiting the local area and engaging companies and job seekers he continued before seeking permission to build the plant there will be an extensive consultation process with rhondda cynon taf county borough council and with local people and interest groups this is extremely important to us as we want to explain our plan in detail and listen to what people have to say information material will be distributed to households businesses and other organisations there will also be a series of information days where people can meet the project team ask questions and voice their opinion we will advertise public consultations in local media and on the project website wwwhirwaunpowercouk mr campbell added that the proposed hirwaun power plant would help to meet electricity demand for homes and workplaces there is a need to replace a significant number of coal and oilfired power stations in the uk that will close in the near future he said it is accepted that without new electricity generating capacity there could be difficulty meeting energy demand in the uk within several years in addition gas fired power stations will provide backup to the intermittency of onshore and offshore wind power and support wales move towards a low carbon economy the proposed hirwaun power plant would be efficient and produce energy much more cleanly than the coal and oilfired power stations it would replace we will do our utmost to ensure that the power plant will cause the minimum disturbance locally during construction and subsequent operation mr campbell said that rhondda cynon taf county borough council and the welsh government had been briefed on the proposal following consultation and feedback from communities and interest groups hirwaun power intends to submit an application for a development consent order to the uks planning inspectorate later this year with a final decision taken by the secretary of state for energy and climate change additional consents including planning permissions may also be
