Drax donates over £14k to support STEM education and local community initiatives in Scotland
Press releases

Shona King, Drax Group Head of Community, said:
“Drax has a long tradition of giving back to the communities we operate in, and this year we have stepped up our community funding to allow us to support even more good causes and ensure our business has a positive impact on people, nature and the climate. We are pleased to announce that in the first round of community funding this year we will be awarding close to £60,000 of grants to 40 different organisations in the UK which support STEM education and skills or work to improve the local community.”
Of the total, £14,350 has been awarded to 11 different community-led projects local to Drax’s operations in Scotland. This includes Embers Aquatics who run water safety workshops for primary schools in the Cruachan area, Oban Junior Community Football Club to help them purchase sports equipment and run a training camp trip, Wildcat Explorer Scouts Argyll to purchase climbing equipment and Rockfield Primary School to develop an outdoor area for children with complex needs.
Anna Roscoe, Founding Director of Embers Aquatics, said:
“Swimming is a lifesaving skill as well as a great form of exercise, yet the number of children unable to swim in the UK is rising at a drastic rate. This is particularly worrying as we have seen a number of tragic incidents in Scottish waters in recent years. Last summer, we ran vital water safety workshops for local children in schools across Lochaber and now with the help of this funding we plan to expand the workshops to more rural areas across Scotland including the three primary schools close to Cruachan, ensuring that as many children as possible benefit from water safety education.”

Drax response to Ofgem statement
31 May 2023
Sustainable bioenergy

Ofgem’s announcement states that the opening of an investigation does not imply any finding of non-compliance. It has separately confirmed that it has not established any non-compliance that would affect the issuance of Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) to Drax, and therefore the associated financial benefit.
Like all energy generators, Drax receives regular requests from Ofgem and continues to cooperate fully throughout this process.
Last year Drax appointed a third party to independently verify the accuracy of its biomass sustainability and profiling data as part of an ongoing process. Drax

is confident in the compliance of its biomass with the Renewables Obligation criteria.

Primary school children rise to Drax’s recycled robots challenge
11 May 2023
Press releases

In March, students aged between seven and eleven at Camblesforth Community Primary Academy (part of Ebor Academy Trust), were provided with individual activity boxes containing a range of learning materials, games and resources they will need to build their robots, the focus of which is on recycling and forms part of their school curriculum.
The robots are made from recyclable materials that can be found around the house such as bottles, tin cans and cardboard and have been designed to carry out recycling tasks such as having magnetic hands to pick up metal, or built-in compartments to store paper.
To launch the project, students received a presentation from the Drax Community and Education team on recycling and the role everyone plays ensuring the correct waste items enter recycling schemes. The Drax team then returned at the end of April to see the results and judge the best robots.
Drax Community and Education Manager, Jane Breach, said:
“By providing schools with these resources we hope to help develop students’ understanding of the importance of recycling and fire up their imaginations, inspiring them to study STEM subjects by showing them the wide range of career options that are available.”
Camblesforth Community Primary Academy teacher, Georgia Wynn said:
“Creating their amazing robots really sparked the children’s enthusiasm for STEM and drew their focus to the importance of recycling. Activities like these are so important as it brings the subject to life and encourages students to start thinking about careers they might enjoy in the future.”
Drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the next generation of engineers by encouraging interest in STEM subjects. The renewable energy company offers a number of other initiatives to support STEM education and skills including offering
power station tours
,
interactive workshops
and
work experience
opportunities.

Wind powers Britain more than gas for first time
10 May 2023
Press releases

Almost a third (32.4%) of Britain’s electricity was supplied from wind power during the first quarter of 2023, outpacing gas which delivered 31.7%. It is the first-time wind has provided the largest share of power in any quarter in the history of the country’s electricity grid.
The findings have been released ahead of the next instalment of the quarterly Drax Electric Insights report. The publication is an independent report by academics from Imperial College London commissioned through Imperial Consultants.
Across the three months, Britain’s turbines generated 24 TWh of electricity – enough to charge more than 300 million Tesla Model Ys. Output from wind was 3% higher than during the same quarter last year, while gas was down by 5%.
Almost 42% of Britain’s electricity came from renewable sources (wind, solar, biomass, and hydro) in the first three months of 2023. Fossil fuels supplied 33%, with the rest coming from imports from abroad and the country’s shrinking nuclear fleet.
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and lead author of the quarterly Drax Electric Insights report series, said:
“The renewable power revolution has transformed how Britain gets its electricity, making our power grid cleaner and greener.
“In the space of a decade the UK has almost completely cut out coal, after relying on the most polluting fossil fuel for over a century to power our country. There are still many hurdles to reaching a completely fossil fuel-free grid, but wind out supplying gas for the first time is a genuine milestone event, and shows what can be achieved when governments create a good environment for investors in clean technology.”
Britain has just one coal-fired power station left following Drax ending the use of the fuel at its plant in North Yorkshire last month. Once the largest coal-fired power station in Western Europe, the plant is now the single largest generator of renewable power in the UK. Over the last decade four of the power station’s six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass, providing the UK with clean, green, and secure renewable electricity.
Bruce Heppenstall, Drax Power Station Plant Director, said:
“This is a remarkable achievement for the UK, and it comes at a vital time when cutting the use of foreign gas is critical to our national energy security. Throughout the energy crisis, biomass has also played a crucial role in providing the country with a reliable source of renewable power to displace fossil fuels from abroad.
“At Drax, we believe the UK must now focus on unlocking investment in carbon negative technologies, such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), which permanently remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit. Only BECCS can simultaneously remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere whilst also generating reliable, renewable power when the wind isn’t blowing, or the sun is not shining.
“Countries across the world, and particularly the United States, are stepping up to address climate change, we believe the UK Government should accelerate its policy support for BECCS to give this country the best chance of establishing itself as a world leader in carbon removals, attracting further clean energy investment, creating jobs and delivering its net zero targets.”

Britain’s biggest power station lights up for King’s coronation
4 May 2023
Press releases

Electricity has been generated by Drax since 1974 after it was built by the Central Electricity Generating Board, in an area of Yorkshire known as Megawatt Valley due to a fleet of coal-fired power stations which were built there in the 1960s-1980s.
Drax was not only the biggest, but it was also one of the most advanced and efficient coal-fired power stations ever built in the UK.
Nearly five decades on, Drax has announced the official
end of coal-fired generation
at its North Yorkshire power station, after having transformed itself to become the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe by using sustainable biomass, generating enough renewable electricity for four million households.
The announcement marks a historic milestone in both the company and the UK’s transformation to a zero-carbon energy future.
Bruce Heppenstall, Plant Director, said:
“His Majesty King Charles III has shown great commitment to environmental and climate causes and Drax was delighted to be asked to be a member of his Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) in 2020. SMI enables industry executives to work together on delivering meaningful and actionable plans to help accelerate the world’s transition to a sustainable future.
“We wanted to do something special to celebrate this major event in UK history and as our cooling towers are a major landmark that can be seen for miles around – we thought lighting up in honour of our King was a fitting tribute.”
The 114m tall cooling towers near Selby in North Yorkshire, will be lit up between 8:00pm until 1:00am every night from Friday 5
th
May to Monday 8
th
May.
Last year the cooling towers were lit up in
red and blue
to celebrate the late Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee and in September a
tribute
to the Queen was projected during the period of mourning.

Drax ends half a century of coal-fired power generation
25 April 2023
Press releases

Drax has announced that almost 50 years of power generation from coal at its North Yorkshire power station has come to an end.
Drax Power Station was once Western Europe’s largest coal-fired power station but has been transformed into the UK’s single-largest generator of renewable electricity.
Drax Power Station’s four biomass units generated 12.7TWh of electricity in 2022.
Global renewable energy company Drax has today announced the official end of coal-fired generation at Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire, marking a historic milestone in both the company and the UK’s transformation to a zero-carbon energy future.
Following the discovery of the Selby coalfield, construction of the coal-fired Drax Power Station began nearby in 1967. The power station started generating power out of its first unit in 1974 and in 1975, following the completion of two additional generators, the site officially opened. At the time, this provided enough power for around two million homes and in 1986, power generation capacity was doubled to just under 4GW.
Once the largest coal-fired power station in Western Europe, the plant is now the single largest generator of renewable power in the UK. Over the last decade four of the power station’s six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass, providing the UK with clean, green, and secure renewable electricity.
Following the end of the winter contingency agreement, Drax will now embark on a decommissioning process to remove coal-related infrastructure from the site which will start with the flue gas desulphurisation plant that was built in the 1990s to remove 90% of the sulphur from the plant’s air emissions.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Ending the use of coal at Drax is a landmark moment in our efforts to become a world-leading carbon negative company.
“I’d like to thank the many hundreds of people, including our staff, suppliers, and local communities, for all the hard work it has taken to transform Drax Power Station into the UK’s biggest renewable power source by output.
“By converting the plant to use sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, but we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK’s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.
“We’re now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, and we are engaged in discussions with the UK Government to move this £2bn project forward.
“The global momentum for converting coal-fired power stations to biomass is growing as more countries work to reduce their emissions by moving away from fossil fuels to renewables while maintaining their energy security. In recent months, new projects have been announced in countries from Japan to Hungary. If BECCS were eventually added to each of these sites they would be able to remove carbon from the atmosphere while generating power.”
The UK Government aims to deploy 5Mt of engineered CO2 removals per annum from BECCS and other engineered GGR technologies by 2030, rising to 23Mt in 2035 and up to 81Mt in 2050 to keep the UK on a pathway to meet its legislated climate targets.
Through transforming the plant to use sustainable biomass instead of coal, Drax has reduced its Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by approximately 99% since 2012.

Family of ‘Tunnel Tiger’ visit Cruachan Power Station
14 April 2023
Press releases

Eddie Gallagher was one of the 4,000 ‘Tunnel Tigers’ who drilled, blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of mighty Ben Cruachan over a period of six years from 1959 to 1965 to make way for the UK’s first pumped storage hydro power station.

Conditions for the men who worked at Cruachan during were highly dangerous and Eddie was among 15 men who tragically died during construction. These men are commemorated by the mural on the wall of the machine hall as well as in a specially commissioned tartan
Drax created
, which includes 15 strands of a special dark blue thread.
His family didn’t know much about where he had worked and believed him to have been killed in a mine until a
chance meeting
with Eddie’s long-lost fiancée in 2019, which inspired the family to plan a visit to Cruachan in May 2020.
The trip was unfortunately postponed due to Covid restrictions but on Friday 17
th
March this year, Eddie Gallagher’s family was finally able to make the trip to Cruachan for a tour from the visitor centre team, with some of the family travelling from as far as Sydney.
Director of Drax’s Scottish Assets, Ian Kinnaird
, met the family during their tour. He said: “Visits from families of those who were tragically killed during the construction at Cruachan are a chance for us to learn more about these incredible men. Everyone involved has  left a lasting legacy as part of the talented team who constructed this wonder of Scottish engineering.
“The team at Cruachan Visitor Centre take great pride in telling these men’s stories to our visitors. Everyone who visits has have complete admiration for their human endeavour that has led to Cruachan still being operational nearly 60 years after opening.”
After the visit, Eddie’s sisters each received a scarf made from the special tartan Drax commissioned to commemorate the men who built Cruachan.

Ann Buckley, Eddie’s niece
, who organised the visit, said: “I want to thank the team at Cruachan so much for their help in organising this trip, which was really emotional for our family. We never knew where Eddie worked, and this has given us a whole new understanding. The team showed so much patience and generosity towards us and great respect for my uncle and the other men who lost their lives. We also appreciate that Ian took the time to meet us and we’re grateful for the commemorative tartan we were presented with, we will treasure it. It means a lot that the company will not let our uncle be forgotten.”
