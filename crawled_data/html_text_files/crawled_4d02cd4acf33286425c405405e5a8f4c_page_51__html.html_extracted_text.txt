Press Release
Great Britain’s lowest carbon Christmas
27 December 2017


Uncategorized


Great Britain’s fairy lights and roasted turkeys were powered by the cleanest electricity mix ever on Christmas day 2017 – rounding off a record breaking year for power generation in Britain.
According to analysis of
Electric Insights
data by researchers at Imperial College London, in collaboration with Drax, 2017 is on course to be the cleanest year for electricity generation.
Carbon emissions from power generation were just 142g/kWh on Christmas Day – more than 10% lower than on
December 25 2016
.
Gas generators provided over 30% of the required capacity and coal provided just 1.4% on Christmas Day – compared to 17.9% for gas and 7.1% for coal in 2016.
Roasted turkeys were powered by the greenest electricity mix ever in 2017
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London said:

“This was achieved in spite of generation from renewables being lower than on Christmas Day last year; mainly due to the continued reduction in coal over this year, being swapped for gas power stations.”
The low carbon Christmas comes after a whole host of renewables records were broken throughout the year and with much less coal on the system, helping to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions by around half of what they were five years ago.
Dr Staffell explained:

“The carbon intensity of Britain’s electricity halved between 2012 and 2016 and we think that by New Year the 2017 figure will be at least another 10% lower than last year’s record. This means the average British household produced 100 kg less CO
2
this year than they did last year without having to lift a finger, all the changes are being made ‘behind the scenes’.”
Electric Insights data also shows that January 17 2017 was the ‘dirtiest’ day of the year, with carbon intensity reaching 398g CO
2
/kWh. Despite this, Britain’s carbon emissions have fallen sharply as renewables records were broken throughout the year.
Dr Staffell said:

“Several real milestones were reached by renewable electricity throughout 2017 – we set a new record in March for renewable generation, which was then broken again in June.
“It helped that wind speeds were relatively high during the year, so wind farm output was up by around one third compared to last year. Also, electricity demand was a little lower, meaning that renewable output formed a bigger part of the mix.”
The records broken throughout the year include:
February was a record breaking month for biomass with 2.1GW produced from biomass generation
A new record for wind, solar, hydro and biomass power was made in the first three months of 2017, with 23.2% of Britain’s power coming from these technologies over the first quarter.
However, this record was then broken again in the next three months, with almost a quarter of the UK’s electricity between April and June being generated sustainably – wind, solar, hydro and biomass accounted for 24.9% of the UK’s energy mix.
No coal was used in power stations for the first time in more than 130 years on April 22
nd
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London added: “This was a huge milestone: the first day in which no electricity came from coal since the first steam-driven power station opened in the 1880s.”
On 26
th
May, a new solar record was made, with 3.1GW of energy produced throughout the day from solar – almost triple the yearly average of 1.2GW per day. Dr Staffell said: “A great deal of new solar has been installed on the system which meant that the previous record was smashed.”
June was the cleanest month of the year, with 188g per kwh of carbon emitted, compared to 339g per kwh in January – the dirtiest month. Dr Staffell, said: “This is due to demand being lower, so we could make do with very little coal generation, and gas was much lower too.”
8
th

December saw a new record for wind energy, with 11.6GW of electricity from wind power produced over the day. Dr Staffell explained: “As with solar electricity, new capacity made it easy for the previous wind power record to be broken. 2017 was also a very windy year compared to 2016.”
Interconnectors also had a record-breaking year, with the link to France reaching new highs for both imports and exports. 26
th
March saw 1,994MW imported into Britain from France, while conversely 16
th
November saw 2,020MW exported from Britain to France.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:

“Britain’s energy system is rapidly changing, as the Carbon Price Floor continues to force coal off the system and gas and renewables play an increasingly important role in helping to reduce carbon emissions – all year round.
“At Drax we have upgraded half of the power station to run on flexible, reliable, sustainable biomass. Around 70% of the power we produce is now renewable – enough for four million households.
“We are also looking at repowering two of our remaining coal generating units with gas to provide up to 3.6GW of power and developing up to 200MW of battery storage.
“With the four rapid response gas power stations we are developing, which will help to support the system and enable more renewables onto the grid, here at Drax we are playing an important part in helping to change the way energy is generated, supplied and used for a better future.”

Previous analysis of data from Electric Insights revealed that four years ago, Britain sat in the middle of the
‘Low Carbon Electricity League’
. Britain now ranks 7
th
in the world, following a 47% drop in emissions last year.
Electricity generation in the UK is playing a vital role in the reduction of carbon emissions, enabling other sectors like transport to become greener. Fewer fossil fuels on the system means
electric vehicles are greener than ever before
.
The electricity sector has many accounting conventions to be aware of. Power flow is measured in gigawatts (GW), volumes of energy are measured in megawatt-hours (MWh). Producing 1 GW constantly for an hour would give 1 GWh = 1000 MWh. Producing 1 GW constantly for a year would give 8760 GWh, which is enough to power 2.65 million homes.
About Electric Insights
Electric Insights Quarterly
was commissioned by Drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from Imperial College London, facilitated by the College’s consultancy company – Imperial Consultants. The reports analyse raw data that is made publicly available by National Grid and Elexon, which run the electricity and balancing market respectively. Released four times a year, the reports focus on supply and demand, prices, emissions, the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them.
Along with Dr Iain Staffell, the team from Imperial included Professors Richard Green and Tim Green, experts in energy economics and electrical engineering, and Dr Rob Gross who contributed expertise in energy policy. The work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area, to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry.
The quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website
electricinsights.co.uk
which provides live data from 2009 until the present. It was designed by The Economist Group’s independent data design agency, Signal Noise.
Total emissions are calculated from British electricity consumption in tonnes per hour (including emissions from imported power), and the ‘carbon intensity’ of electricity – total emissions divided by total demand in grams per kilowatt hour (g/kWh).

Drax Group CEO Dorothy Thompson responds to Industrial Strategy White Paper
27 November 2017


Uncategorized


Dorothy Thompson, Drax Group CEO said:
“Cleaner economic growth is one of the greatest industrial opportunities of our time – with the UK’s clean economy predicted to grow at four times the rate of GDP.
“Reducing carbon in electricity generation is the fastest way to reduce emissions and ensure our economy is clean and strong. Electric cars, AI and automation all depend on a flexible, secure electricity system, which sustainable biomass and rapid response gas power stations can support.
“At Drax we are already helping growing businesses be more sustainable – the proportion of businesses choosing to use renewable electricity supplied by Haven Power, part of Drax Group, has more than tripled this year, reducing their carbon emissions by 76% compared to five years ago and saving the UK almost 1.5 million tonnes of carbon.”



Drax Power CEO Andy Koss comments on Industrial Strategy White Paper


Uncategorized


Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“The Industrial Strategy highlights that there is a technological revolution underway which will be powered by electricity.
“The Northern Powerhouse region is well placed to lead the clean energy revolution, because it has the expertise, knowledge, skills and infrastructure to deliver clean growth based on decades of powering the rest of the country.
“Creating bespoke regional industrial strategies which can draw on skills and strengths available in areas like the north, will help us to maximise the opportunities and deliver real growth.
“The Northern Powerhouse region has been leading the way in new technologies such as bioenergy, offshore wind and nuclear power, and Drax alone generated £577 million for the Northern Powerhouse regional economy, supporting more than 6,000 jobs in the region in 2016.”



Drax Group CEO Dorothy Thompson responds to Chancellor Philip Hammond’s Budget
22 November 2017


Uncategorized


Dorothy Thompson Drax Group CEO said:
“Having this clarity from the Chancellor on the Carbon Price Floor will help to unlock further investment in low-carbon and renewable technologies ensuring that, together, we can continue creating a cleaner economy for future generations.
“Reducing carbon in our energy system is the fastest way to deliver a low-carbon economy. The carbon price floor has enabled the UK to half the amount of carbon emitted through electricity generation since 2012. The support for Electric Vehicles in the Budget demonstrates how vital low carbon electricity generation is for growth in other sectors of the economy.
“At Drax, we will now continue to explore new ways of converting our remaining coal generating units to biomass and gas, and build new rapid response gas plants. These moves will help take coal off the system quickly and cost effectively, while maintaining security of supply and increasing our ability to provide flexible services to the grid.”



Britain enters top ten low carbon power league
15 November 2017


Uncategorized


Britain’s electricity is now the 7
th
cleanest, climbing 13 places in the global rankings
Carbon price floor has driven unparalleled CO
2
reductions: Britain’s emissions from electricity almost halved (47%) between 2012-16
Based on the findings, Drax calls on Chancellor to maintain carbon price in Budget
Britain’s electricity is now amongst the cleanest in the world – having moved 13 places up the global rankings to be placed 7
th
in terms of the carbon content of its electricity among large and industrialised countries.
According to the latest Electric Insights report, produced by researchers at Imperial College London in collaboration with Drax, Britain’s shift was the biggest for any country in the league table. The most any other country moved was eight places, and this was by the Netherlands, in the opposite direction – down the leaders’ table.
The analysis shows that the UK’s carbon price has helped deliver unparalleled carbon reductions – its charge on greenhouse gas emissions has driven uptake in renewables and a shift away from coal to gas-fired power generation.
Dr Iain Staffell, from Imperial College London explained: “Since we started Electric Insights a year ago we have seen a number of ‘firsts’ across the power sector and this quarter is no different – Britain has entered the world’s top ten low carbon power league for the first time.
“Britain is reducing its carbon emissions from electricity faster than any other major country, and this has happened because the carbon price and lower gas prices have forced coal off the system – the amount of coal-fired power generation in Britain has fallen 80% between 2012 and 2016.  In the Netherlands, coal-fired electricity output has risen 40% over the same period as generators only have to pay the much lower European carbon price.”
The carbon price floor is set by the UK Government. Power generators in the UK are charged £23 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) produced, compared to £5 per tonne in Europe. The six countries with lower carbon electricity than Britain benefit from substantial hydropower resources or, in the case of France, a heavy reliance on nuclear.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said: “The analysis by Dr Staffell and the team at Imperial College London shows quite clearly the impact Britain’s carbon price has had in terms of helping to ensure we produce cleaner power for the UK’s homes and businesses.
“It’s therefore vital that we maintain a meaningful carbon price when the Chancellor announces the Autumn Budget, if we are to meet our commitments on climate change. Without it we could see a reversal of the impressive results achieved so far – look at what’s happened elsewhere.”
Britain’s carbon emissions from electricity almost halved (47%) between 2012-16, and the carbon impact of Britain’s electricity has fallen more than twice as fast as any other major economy.
New coal power stations were built in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2016, leading to a dramatic increase in their coal consumption and carbon emissions.
Drax has upgraded half of its power station in North Yorkshire to use sustainable biomass, transforming it to become the biggest single site renewable generator in the UK and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
The report has been shared with HM Treasury as further evidence to support carbon pricing ahead of the Autumn Budget on 22 November 2017.
Country comparisons

Norway, Sweden and France have the cleanest power systems among large and industrialised countries due to their mountainous terrain allowing for substantial hydropower resources and a heavy reliance on nuclear in France, with 58 reactors.
India and South Africa have the dirtiest power sectors on the list, with 75-90% of their power generated by coal.

Drax Repower: Chance to give views on gas and battery project
26 October 2017
Press releases

Drax gave notice to the Planning Inspectorate in September about its intention to consult on the proposals, which are part of its strategy to play a vital role in changing the way energy is generated as the UK moves to a low carbon future.
The ongoing research and development project is exploring options including up to 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of new gas generation capacity and 200MW of battery storage in line with government plans to phase out coal by 2025.
The power station near Selby is already the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator having converted three coal generating units to use sustainable wood pellets. More than two thirds of the power produced is now renewable, providing 17% of the UK’s renewable electricity – enough for four million homes.
The upgrades would enhance Drax Power Station’s flexible and responsive capability, and make Yorkshire the home of large scale battery technology.
Andy Koss, CEO of Drax Power, said:
“We have always supported and worked with our local communities and want to ensure they have a role in shaping our thinking for the future.

Drax Power Station is a national asset and a significant driver of economic growth in the North of England.
“These options could repurpose up to two of our coal assets and extend their operation into the 2030s, securing the future of the plant beyond 2025 when the government says coal must come off the system.
“We are undertaking a comprehensive programme of consultation over the coming months to share our ideas with the public and listen to their views.”
Public consultation events will give people the opportunity to find out more about the plans. Events will take place at:
Wednesday 8 November, 4pm to 8pm
Selby Town Hall, York St, Selby YO8 4AJ
Thursday 9 November, 11am to 4.30pm
Drax Sports and Social Club, The Blue Room, Main Rd, Drax, Selby YO8 8PJ
Saturday 11 November, 10.30am to 1.30pm
Junction, Paradise Place, Goole DN14 5DL
The options for repowering to gas and building battery storage complement Drax’s ongoing work to explore options for further generation from sustainable biomass.
Mr Koss added:
“This is the start of the planning process but if developed these options for gas and battery storage show how we could upgrade our existing infrastructure to provide capacity, stability and essential grid services, as we do with biomass.
“This would continue to keep costs low for consumers and help to deliver the government’s commitment to remove coal from the UK grid.”
The project includes the following elements:
Up to 3.6 GW of new gas generation capacity and up to 200MW of battery storage. The capacity of the coal units being replaced is 1.3GW.
The gas generation plant will include up to four new combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs).
A new gas pipeline connection to the National Gas Transmission System and an electrical connection into Drax’s existing substation to allow electricity to be exported to the National Grid.
A temporary crane positioned next to the existing jetty on the River Ouse and at a point close to the power station during construction.
Environmental assessments will consider issues such as local planning, air and water quality, flood risk, traffic and transport, noise, ecology, heritage and the effects on landscape and visual amenity.
Subject to development consent being granted and construction going ahead, the Drax Repower project (gas generating plants, battery storage and gas pipeline) could be operational in 2023/24.
Further information about the project, the consultation and planning application will be published

Andy Koss, CEO of Drax Power, said:
“We have always supported and worked with our local communities and want to ensure they have a role in shaping our thinking for the future.

Drax Power Station is a national asset and a significant driver of economic growth in the North of England.
“These options could repurpose up to two of our coal assets and extend their operation into the 2030s, securing the future of the plant beyond 2025 when the government says coal must come off the system.
“We are undertaking a comprehensive programme of consultation over the coming months to share our ideas with the public and listen to their views.”
Public consultation events will give people the opportunity to find out more about the plans. Events will take place at:
Wednesday 8 November, 4pm to 8pm
Selby Town Hall, York St, Selby YO8 4AJ
Thursday 9 November, 11am to 4.30pm
Drax Sports and Social Club, The Blue Room, Main Rd, Drax, Selby YO8 8PJ
Saturday 11 November, 10.30am to 1.30pm
Junction, Paradise Place, Goole DN14 5DL
The options for repowering to gas and building battery storage complement Drax’s ongoing work to explore options for further generation from sustainable biomass.
Mr Koss added:
“This is the start of the planning process but if developed these options for gas and battery storage show how we could upgrade our existing infrastructure to provide capacity, stability and essential grid services, as we do with biomass.
“This would continue to keep costs low for consumers and help to deliver the government’s commitment to remove coal from the UK grid.”
The project includes the following elements:
Up to 3.6 GW of new gas generation capacity and up to 200MW of battery storage. The capacity of the coal units being replaced is 1.3GW.
The gas generation plant will include up to four new combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs).
A new gas pipeline connection to the National Gas Transmission System and an electrical connection into Drax’s existing substation to allow electricity to be exported to the National Grid.
A temporary crane positioned next to the existing jetty on the River Ouse and at a point close to the power station during construction.
Environmental assessments will consider issues such as local planning, air and water quality, flood risk, traffic and transport, noise, ecology, heritage and the effects on landscape and visual amenity.
Subject to development consent being granted and construction going ahead, the Drax Repower project (gas generating plants, battery storage and gas pipeline) could be operational in 2023/24.
Further information about the project, the consultation and planning application will be published

New report shows Drax contributes £419 million to Yorkshire and the Humber economy and supports over 3,650 jobs
18 October 2017


Uncategorized


British energy business Drax Group contributed almost £1.7 billion towards UK GDP in 2016 and supported thousands of jobs across the country, including £419 million in the Yorkshire and Humber region.
The findings were revealed in a new report looking at the economic impact of Drax’s UK operations, which includes Selby-based Drax Power Station. The Power Station, which employs around 900 people and has seen three of its six generating units converted in recent years to use compressed wood pellets, generated 16% of the country’s renewable electricity in 2016 – enough for four million households, the equivalent of Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool.
Researchers at Oxford Economics used three measures to calculate Drax’s GDP contribution: the economic activity associated with the day-to-day running of the business; the activity created by the purchase of goods and services from its suppliers; and the wages the company’s employees and suppliers’ employees spend in their local area.
In the past year, Drax Power Station’s activities have supported employment in a wide range of sectors including high-skilled manufacturing of industrial components, engineering and technical machinery, construction, IT, professional business services and transport.
Drax Power CEO, Andy Koss said:
“This new report demonstrates that as well as playing a vital role as the country’s biggest power generator, Drax Power Station continues to play a crucial role in supporting the Yorkshire economy.
“Thanks to a sophisticated supply chain that spans both the east and west coasts of the country, Drax supported over 6,000 jobs across the North of England last year and generated more than £1/2 billion in economic activity. Drax works with hundreds of businesses across the Northern Powerhouse region to ensure millions of homes across the country have the power they need each day.
“The North of England has a rich heritage in providing energy to the rest of the UK. Companies like Drax have an important role to play in delivering a low carbon economy as part of the Government’s wider industrial strategy for the country”.
Alan Waddington, Managing Director of TEi Ltd, a leading engineering company based in Wakefield, said:
“Our specialist team of engineers have been working at Drax Power Station for a number of years, using their technical knowledge to support its transition to become the largest source of renewable power in the country.
“As a British business we are proud to support this nationally significant asset that generates enough clean electricity to power Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool.”
Osman Ismail, Senior Economist at Oxford Economics, said:
“Drax Group makes an important economic contribution to Yorkshire and the Humber, and the UK more widely. Its activities generated almost £1.7 billion in GDP last year, and sustained thousands of jobs across the nation.”
