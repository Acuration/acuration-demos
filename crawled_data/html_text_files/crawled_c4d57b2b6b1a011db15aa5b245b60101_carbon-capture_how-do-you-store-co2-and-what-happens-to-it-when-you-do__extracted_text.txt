capture the north sea has long shaped british trade its also been instrumental in how the country is powered historically providing an abundant source of oil and natural gas however this cold fringe off the north atlantic could also play a vital role in decarbonising the uks economy  not because of its full oil and gas reservoirs but thanks to its empty ones in an effort to limit or reduce the amount of carbon dioxide co 2  in the atmosphere countries around the world are rushing towards large scale carbon capture usage and storage projects ccus in this process co 2 is captured from sources such as energy production and manufacturing or directly removed from the air and reused or stored permanently  for example underground in disused oil and gas reservoirs or other suitable geological formations source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload the international energy agency estimates that 100 billion tonnes of co 2 must be stored by 2060 to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius yet the global ccs institute reports that as of 2019 the projects currently in operation or under construction had the capacity to capture and store only 40 million tonnes of co 2 per year its clear the global capacity for ccus must accelerate rapidly in the coming decade but it raises the questions where can these millions of tonnes of co 2 be stored and what happens to it once it is where can you store co 2  the most welldeveloped approach to storing co 2 is injecting it underground into naturally occurring porous rock formations such as former natural gas or oil reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers these are deep geological formations with deposits of very salty water present in the rocks pores and most commonly found under the ocean the north sea and the area off the us gulf coast contain several saline aquifers once co 2 has been captured using ccus technology  its pressurised and turned into a liquidlike form known as supercritical co 2  from there its transported via pipeline and injected into the rocks found in the formations deep below the earths surface this is a process called geological sequestration source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload but while pumping co 2 into the ground is one thing ensuring it stays there and isnt released into the atmosphere is another fortunately there are several ways to ensure co 2 is stored safely and securely keeping the lid on co 2 stored underground put simply the most straightforward way underground reservoirs store co 2 is through the solid impermeable rock that typically surrounds them once co 2 is injected into a reservoir it slowly moves upwards through the reservoir until it meets this layer of impermeable rock which acts like a lid the co 2 cannot pass through this is whats referred to as structural storage and is the same mechanism that has kept oil and gas locked underground for millions of years white chalk stone over time the co 2 trapped in reservoirs will often begin to chemically react with the minerals of the surrounding rock the elements bind to create solid chalky minerals essentially locking the co 2 into the rock in a process called mineral storage in the case of saline aquifers as well as structural and mineral storage the co 2 can dissolve into the salty water in a process called dissolution storage here the dissolved co 2 slowly descends to the bottom of the aquifer in any given reservoir each or all of these processes work to store co 2 indefinitely and while there remains some possibility of co 2 leakage from a site research suggests it will be minimal one study published in the journal nature suggests more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years storage for the net zero future in the united states industrial scale storage is in action in texas wyoming oklahoma and illinois and there are projects in progress across the united arab emirates australia algeria and canada however there is still a long way to go for ccus to reach the scale it needed to limit the effects of climate change research has shown that globally there is an abundance of co 2 storage sites which could support widespread ccus adoption a report compiled by researchers at imperial college london and e4tech and published by drax details an estimated 70 billion tonnes of storage capacity in the uk alone the us on the other hand has an estimated storage capacity of 10 trillion tonnes its clear the capacity for storage is present it now remains the task of governments and companies to ramp up ccus projects to begin to reach the scale necessary in the uk drax power station is piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage projects beccs which could see it becoming the worlds first negative emissions power station as part of the zero carbon humber partnership it could also form a part of the worlds first zero carbon industrial hub in the north of the uk such projects are indicative of the big ambitions ccus technology could realise  not just decarbonising single sites but capturing and storing co 2 from entire industries and regions there is still a way to go to meet that ambition but it is clear the resources and knowledge necessary to get there are ready to be utilised source zero carbon humber click to viewdownload learn more about carbon capture
