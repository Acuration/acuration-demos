Press Release
Harry harks back to his head for heights – 50 years on from building giant power station chimney
23 May 2019
Press releases

Harry Shann, now 83, was part of the team who worked at Drax Power Station 50 years ago constructing the 850ft high chimney, which has three flues linked to the site’s six generating units, four of which now run on sustainable biomass instead of coal.
The chimney took just four months to build after work started in early 1969 and was completed four months ahead of schedule by a team of around 30 workers, with the topping out ceremony held in May to celebrate its completion.
Now, Harry, who was just 33 when he joined the project and still lives locally in Selby, has spent time back at the Drax site to reflect on his involvement in the record-breaking construction project.
He said:
“I still see it pretty much every day. It was definitely the highest build I ever worked on.
“I’m very proud of it, even after all these years, and I can still remember the time I spent on site. Considering the size of it though, we weren’t there long. We really got a move on.”
Due to the height of the structure, reaching the top can only be achieved by an eight-minute journey in an industrial lift or by scaling the 1,460 steps spiralling up the central void of the chimney.
Views from the top can stretch as far as the Humber Bridge more than 30 miles away on a clear day – and Harry admits it was only a job for those who were comfortable working high above the ground.
“I just never had a fear of heights. I was in the Parachute Regiment before I became a scaffolder, so that might have had something to do with it,”
the octogenarian said on his return visit to view the huge structure he helped to create.
“Being back at Drax Power Station, I realise just how much it’s changed. When I worked here, looking down from the chimney the area was bare, with hardly any buildings. Now it’s just amazing, it’s a wonderful site and I feel proud that the chimney is still standing 50 years later.”
The North Yorkshire power station, which first began generating electricity in 1974 when the first of its six generating units was commissioned, now produces enough electricity to supply five per cent of the UK’s power and is the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Drax Power CEO Andy Koss said:
“Harry’s efforts, along with his colleagues’, in building such an important and iconic part of the power station are an integral part of Drax’s history and ongoing success.
“50 years on it is still the tallest industrial chimney in the UK – in many ways its completion marked the start of a rich heritage for engineering excellence and innovation at Drax, which has continued to the present day.”
Earlier this year, Drax confirmed that its groundbreaking trial of bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS), using technology developed by Leeds-based C-Capture, had become the first project of its kind in the world to capture CO
2
from a 100% biomass feedstock.
Drax has converted two-thirds of its generating units at the site near Selby to use sustainable biomass instead of coal transforming the business to become the largest renewable power generator in the UK.
ENDS
Chimney facts:
Drax chimney’s foundations are 70ft-deep.
The 44,000 tonne chimney cost around £1 million to build.
It’s almost twice the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The record for the highest chimney in the world belongs to the Gres-2 Power Station in Kazakhstan. Built in 1987, it stands 1,377ft (420m) tall.

EV excellence street race students in pole position at awards evening
Press releases

The four teams were among seven schools from Selby who built the electric race car provided by Drax Group as part of its £35,000 initiative to boost STEM (science technology engineering and Maths) skills.
Staff from Drax worked with the youngsters to help them build their car, with the power firm also providing each school and college with the tools they needed for the project, which culminated in the special street race event at the end of April, organised by Greenpower.
Representatives from four of the schools received their awards at an event at Hull’s Guildhall.
The pupils from Selby Abbey Primary School went home with a trio of awards, including the overall award in the category for younger entrants and the Spirit of Greenpower award, presented on the night by Drax Power CEO Andy Koss.

Judges praised the Selby Abbey team for
‘representing the saying that it’s about the taking part, not the winning’
, highlighting how they had worked together to solve issues on the day and even brought along cheerleaders to urge the team on.
Among the other winning teams were Selby College, which came home six minutes ahead of  their nearest rivals in a one-hour endurance race, and Camblesforth Community Primary School, which picked up three awards on the night having finished first in one race and second in in two other challenges.
Barwic Parade Community Primary School picked up two awards, including one for having the best bodywork on the day – after the team designed their car to look like the school’s mascot, Herbie the Bear.
Jo Jennings, Head Teacher at Selby Abbey Primary School, said:
“It was a fantastic evening for the pupils and everyone who has contributed to this project at our school. They all thoroughly deserve this recognition.
“I’m incredibly proud of the time and effort everyone has put into this and it’s been a brilliant way to get our children engaged with STEM subjects. They have learnt new things and had a great time working as a team to build and then drive the car. It’s been a real centrepiece of our lessons and other pupils will benefit from it in the future too.”
Drax Power CEO Andy Koss, who was one of the judges at the event on April 28, said:
“It’s great to see so many of our schools coming away with awards – my congratulations go to everyone who took part in this project.
“The commitment from all of the schools has been exceptional – it’s really sparked the students’ imaginations, which is what it is all about.
“It’s really important that we find fun and exciting projects like this to engage young people and encourage them to study STEM subjects. It’s vital if we are to ensure that the next generation has the skills that innovative businesses like ours need.”

Editor’s Notes
Four primary schools – Barwic Parade, Camblesforth, Selby Community and Selby Abbey – received a 15mph Goblin G2 battery-powered car, which students and teachers then assembled.
Older students from Selby High School, Holy Family Catholic High School and Selby College built the more powerful Formula 24 car, which can reach speeds of up to 30mph.
Both cars took around 15 hours to build, with the teams also designing their own bodywork.
The primary school teams took part in a series of drag and slalom races in their Goblin cars. The top drivers from each team then raced against each other in a final 1km circuit through the city centre.
Students from the secondary schools and colleges raced the F24 cars around the same circuit in an endurance test. The teams had to switch between three drivers and maintain their cars during the race and the winner was the team which completed the most laps in 90 minutes.

Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick visits groundbreaking bioenergy carbon capture project
20 May 2019
Press releases

UK Government Minister and Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Robert Jenrick MP, has visited Drax Power Station to find out about its world-first Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot project.
Drax, the UK’s largest power station and Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project, has successfully converted four of its six generating units to run on sustainable biomass instead of coal, delivering carbon savings of more than 80 per cent.
Its innovative BECCS project started capturing carbon dioxide earlier this year and could transform Drax, which supplies 12% of the UK’s renewable energy, into the world’s first negative emissions power station. This would play a vital role in helping the UK to meet its climate change obligations.
If the BECCS pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions, Drax Power Station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced.
The UK Committee on Climate Change’s
Net Zero
report stated that the country needs carbon capture, usage and storage technologies and hydrogen developed in regional industrial clusters if it is going to achieve a ‘net zero’ carbon economy by 2050.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, who met with the Minister and the team from the treasury officials, said: “We are delighted to welcome Robert Jenrick and the team from the Treasury to Drax. Drax is the biggest renewable power generator in the country and has played a vital role in helping the UK to decarbonise faster than anywhere else in the world.
“Our BECCS pilot project could enable Drax to go further to become the anchor for a new zero carbon economy in the Humber region, delivering for the environment and the wider UK economy. We are proud of our contribution to the region’s economy and are committed to supporting future growth across the Northern Powerhouse.”
Drax supports more than 5,700 jobs in the North of England and generates over £600 million for the Northern Powerhouse economy.
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Robert Jenrick MP said: “The UK is a world leader in tackling climate change, and we have reduced our reliance on carbon faster than any other G20 country since 2000.
“But we will need new, innovative technologies to further reduce our emissions. Today I’ve seen first-hand Drax’s innovative Carbon Capture project which has the potential to make an important contribution to tackling climate change in the future.”

Notes to editors:
Drax
announced in February
that is has started to capture carbon dioxide from its BECCS pilot project using technology developed by Leeds University spin-out company C-Capture. This is the first-time carbon dioxide has been captured from the combustion of a 100% biomass feedstock anywhere in the world.
Since starting its innovative BECCS pilot project Drax has been talking to several industries about using its CO
2
in their processes. This could be to produce concrete, within the food and drinks industry or creating synthetic fuels to use in hard-to-decarbonise sectors like aviation. It has set up a dedicated ‘Incubation Area’ at the power station that will give other technology companies the opportunity to test their processes on its carbon dioxide.
If the BECCS pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions, Drax Power Station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced.
The Committee on Climate Change’s
Net Zero
report
states that BECCS could generate up to 173 TWh of electricity by 2050, capturing up to 51 Mt CO2 – around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the UK will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.
The CCC’s
Net Zero
report also identified that at least one of the UK’s CCUS regional clusters should involve substantial production of low-carbon hydrogen by 2030 to stay ‘on track’ for net zero. It also recommends that infrastructure development for CCUS should start as early as possible, in all regional clusters with large industrial emissions.
Today Drax is capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from its pilot – once scaled up it could be capturing 16 million tonnes of carbon a year from its four biomass generating units.

Drax announces £100,000 for Galloway Glens initiative
13 May 2019
Press releases

The funding will be used over four years to promote the region’s heritage, boost the local economy and support sustainability initiatives in local communities.
Drax Group acquired the historic Galloway Hydro Scheme as part of a portfolio of important renewable, low carbon and flexible power generation assets earlier this year.
The Galloway Hydro Scheme was commissioned in the 1930s and was the first large-scale integrated hydro-electric complex to be built in Britain. It consists of six power stations, eight dams and a network of tunnels, aqueducts and pipelines – all working together to produce enough renewable electricity for 90,000 households at times of peak demand.
Tongland Power Station is the largest of the Galloway Hydro Scheme’s electricity generation plants and provides an excellent example of early modernist architecture in an industrial setting.
Its uniqueness and the significance of Loch Ken, which is an important part of the system as well as the local landscape, brought the hydro-electricity scheme to the attention of the Galloway Glens Initiative.
Ted Leeming, Chairman of the Galloway Glens, said:
“Through the Galloway Glens we aim to address the challenges faced by the area, by harnessing the potential of local heritage sites like this one. We are developing education and training initiatives, supporting the tourism economy and encouraging young people to stay and work locally. We are delighted to be working in partnership with Drax; I look forward to welcoming them to the Partnership Board and their donation will ‘turbo-charge’ our activities, putting Galloway on the map.”
Ian Kinnaird, Drax Group’s Head of Hydro said:
“We’re proud of the fact that the Galloway Hydro Scheme is considered a prominent feature of the local landscape. Drax is committed to supporting the local communities within which we operate and doing all we can to ensure they thrive. We look forward to helping to continue the good work of the Galloway Glens Scheme in this area.”
Chair of Dumfries & Galloway Council’s Economy, Environment & Infrastructure Committee, Councillor Archie Dryburgh, added:
“We welcome Drax to Dumfries & Galloway and are delighted they are formal partners of the Galloway Glens Scheme. Our priority is to support the local economy, and this is a great example of our amazing cultural and natural heritage driving genuine economic benefits on the ground.”
The Galloway Glens Initiative is formed of partnerships between the Dumfries & Galloway Council’s Environment Team, as well as organisations like the Galloway & Southern Ayrshire UNESCO Biosphere.
In 2017, it received an award of £2.7 million from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to support its work in the region.

Drax Group CEO responds to ‘Net Zero’ report from the Committee on Climate Change
2 May 2019
Press releases

“We stand ready to implement the Committee on Climate Change’s recommendations and scale up the successful BECCS pilot at Drax to create the world’s first negative emissions power station in the mid-2020s. Bioenergy with carbon capture is the cornerstone around which a low carbon economy can be built: Crucial for tackling climate change, it will also create new jobs and export opportunities for British businesses.”
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner at Drax Power Station. Click photo to view in high res for download.
For background:
The Committee on Climate Change’s Net Zero report due to be published on Thursday May 2, recommends that Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage is deployed at scale by 2030.
If Drax’s BECCS pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions, Drax Power Station would be helping to remove gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced.
Drax is talking to a number of industries about using the CO
2
it is already capturing in their processes. This could be for the production of concrete, putting the fizz in the drinks industry or creating synthetic fuels to use in hard-to-decarbonise sectors like aviation.
Drax is also working with the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership, and other interested parties to explore the role CCUS can play in turning the Humber Estuary – the UK’s most energy intensive industrial cluster – into the world’s first ‘net-zero-carbon cluster’. It is ideally located for accessing offshore stores in the North Sea such as the Endurance field, which is roughly 60 miles off the coast.
If Drax can scale up its BECCS pilot it could create more opportunities for capturing and storing carbon dioxide from other industrial emitters in the Humber region, unlocking the potential to create a new hydrogen economy, creating jobs and delivering major environmental benefits globally.
Today Drax is capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from its pilot – once scaled up it would be capturing 40,000 tonnes of carbon a day from its four biomass generating units. That’s at a 90% capture rate.

Dan’s double celebration: EV race champion and power station apprentice
29 April 2019
Press releases

Dan Callon, along with his Selby College team-mates, built the electric car provided by Drax Group as part of its £35,000 initiative to boost STEM (science technology engineering and Maths) skills at seven schools in the town.
The Selby College team, which gave up precious time during the Easter holidays to fine tune their car and test it, left other competitors from across the country trailing in their dust to take pole position in the Greenpower street race event in Hull yesterday (Sunday).
It rounded off a period of positive news for Dan, who also recently found out that he would be one of the next intake of engineering apprentices at Drax Power Station, based near Selby, later this year after successfully applying for the training role.
The six other schools from the Selby area, provided with kit cars and the tools to build them by Drax, also competed in the races in the centre of Hull, watched by hundreds of locals who lined the specially-coned off race track.

Car designs included a bear, a cannon and a tribute to the Humber while another recycled the packaging the car was delivered in to make its bodywork.
The pupils and students took part in a range of colourful events from drag races to a 60-minute endurance event on a special street circuit in the centre of Hull.
But top marks went to the Selby College team, which came home first in an hour-long race against 13 other teams – crossing the finish line six minutes ahead of their nearest rival to the delight of Dan and team-mates Sam Bygrave, Liam Dunn and Lauren Askin.

Dan, 17, from Selby, said:
“It’s been a great experience building the car with the rest of the team and then driving it was amazing. I can’t believe we won – it was the perfect ending.
“I’ve learnt so much while we’ve been building the car and now, I can’t wait to move on to the next stage of my career with my apprenticeship at Drax. I’m really looking forward to it.”
Drax Power CEO Andy Koss said:
“We are thrilled one of our teams won in Hull at the weekend. Our congratulations go to Dan, Sam, Liam and Lauren – they have done a marvellous job – and I look forward to hopefully seeing Dan at the power station later this year.
“The commitment from all of the schools has been exceptional – it’s really sparked the students’ imaginations, which is what this project is all about.
“Finding fun and exciting projects like this to engage young people and encourage them to study STEM subjects is the key to ensuring the next generation of potential employees has the skills that innovative businesses like ours need.”
He added:
“Too many children in the North are falling behind their counterparts in other areas of the UK when it comes to education and skills, leading to a serious skills shortage for employers. We want to change that with initiatives like this one.”
Liz Ridley, Deputy Principal at Selby College, said:
“We are absolutely delighted – winning the race is a fantastic reward for all of the hard work that the students and dedicated tutors have put into this project.
“The best part about it is that it doesn’t stop here – more of our students will benefit from this initiative, because we can dismantle the car and get new students to re-build it each year. We are extremely grateful to Drax for all of their support.
“Our whole aim as a college is to give students the experience and skills they need for their future careers and it’s brilliant that Dan has this opportunity with Drax. We wish him all the best, as we do all our students.”

Stacey Cannon, a teacher at Selby Abbey Primary, whose pupils named their car The Cannon in her honour, said:
“I’m really proud of them all and the effort they have put in to this and I’m proud to see the car out there with my name on it.
“I think they have grown so much throughout this project especially in relation to the STEM subjects. It will hopefully open their minds to the world of engineering.”

Editor’s Notes
Four primary schools – Barwic Parade, Camblesforth, Selby Community and Selby Abbey – received a 15mph Goblin G2 battery-powered car, which students and teachers then assembled.
Older students from Selby High School, Holy Family Catholic High School and Selby College built the more powerful Formula 24 car, which can reach speeds of up to 30mph.
Both cars took around 15 hours to build, with the teams also designing their own bodywork.
The primary school teams took part in a series of drag and slalom races in their Goblin cars. The top drivers from each team then raced against each other in a final 1km circuit through the city centre.
Students from the secondary schools and colleges raced the F24 cars around the same circuit in an endurance test. The teams had to switch between three drivers and maintain their cars during the race and the winner was the team which completed the most laps in 90 minutes.

Drax revs up businesses with bespoke EV services
Press releases

Drax’s first EV customer, SES Water, has invested in 16 new charging points and is initially replacing 10 of its 120 strong fleet of diesel vans with electric vehicles. The switch will result in a carbon saving of 43 tonnes of CO
2
per year and is another significant step forward in SES Water’s environmental commitments which last year saw the company switch to 100 per cent renewable electricity.
The comprehensive service provided to SES Water by Haven Power, part of Drax Group, includes charging infrastructure and operating software, the leasing of EVs, supporting devices such as vehicle telematics, and the renewable electricity needed to power the vehicles.
Drax, which is the biggest supplier of renewable electricity to businesses in the UK, will also supply SES Water with telematic systems to allow usage data from the trial to be monitored, paving the way for a broader roll out plan and potential ‘vehicle to grid’ trials at SES Water.
Henrietta Stock, Energy and Carbon Manager at SES Water said:
“Every day we use enough energy to power 13,000 homes so we are always looking at ways to balance the environmental impact of our essential activities and support the investment in renewable generation in the UK. We have already significantly reduced our carbon emissions over the last year and working with Drax has enabled us to create a bespoke EV solution so we can understand exactly how to save the most energy, further lowering both our carbon emissions and our costs”.
The service Drax is providing includes expert advice to determine what kind of vehicles and systems will work best for customers, analysis of different charging methods to minimise fleet downtime as well as data to help companies use their fleet efficiently.
Jonathan Kini, Drax Retail CEO, said:
“We know from supplying energy to our customers that no two businesses are alike, so a ‘one size fits all’ approach won’t deliver what they all need.
“Instead, we are working with customers like SES Water as an energy partner, to offer each of them a solution tailored to their specific needs. Giving them the optimal EV package will result in lower carbon emissions and costs, helping them to grow better businesses.”
Jonathan Kini, Drax Retail CEO

According to research from Arval so far in the UK just 14% of businesses have switched at least one vehicle to electric. However, this is set to increase to 42% within 3 years.
Jonathan Kini added:
“EVs are still a relatively new technology and making the switch can be daunting. We can take the stress out of the process, so customers have confidence that the decisions they’re making will be good for the environment, as well as their business.”
As the UK power system continues to decarbonise, EVs are better than ever for reducing carbon emissions, making a greater contribution to global efforts to tackle climate change.

Racers give up Easter holidays to gear up for city centre EV race
25 April 2019
Press releases

The team from Selby College have been putting the finishing touches to an EV kit car provided to them by Drax Group, as part of its initiative to boost STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) education and skills.
The dedicated students went into college today (Thursday) during their Easter holiday to ensure they’re fully prepared to take on other teams from across the country at the race, in Hull (on Sunday April 28), organised by the Greenpower Education Trust and sponsored by Drax.
The college is amongst seven schools in Selby which have been provided with the electric cars as well as all the tools and equipment needed to build them by Drax Group, which owns and operates the UK’s biggest power station just outside the town.
The £35,000 initiative is part of Drax’s efforts to inspire more children to study STEM subjects and create the skilled workforce of the future that the Northern Powerhouse needs.
Engineers and staff from the power station have also been spending time with each of the teams to help assemble the cars ahead of the race.
Student Sam Bygrave, who will be one of three drivers at the wheel of the college’s car on Sunday, said:
“It’s been really enjoyable with everyone working together to get the car built and ready for the race. We’ve learnt a lot from this project.
“I’ve never driven a car like this before but I can’t wait for Sunday. We’re feeling confident, we’re in it to win it!”
Fellow student Lauren Askin, who has helped to build the car and will be there on Sunday to help the drivers and keep everything working, also said she was feeling confident for race day.
“It’s been a good experience and fun to build. I’m excited about watching the car race now and hope everything will be ok. I think we’ve got a great chance,”

she said.
Drax Power CEO Andy Koss, one of the judges on race day, said:
“The students have shown real commitment to the project by coming into college during their holidays to make sure they’re in the best possible shape to do their best at the race on Sunday.
“Seeing that level of commitment means this project has hopefully gone someway to achieving what we set out to do, which is to inspire people – we want to give young people in our local communities exciting experiences to help ensure the next generation of potential employees has the skills businesses like ours need.
“A skilled workforce will enable Drax and other businesses in the North to grow, building a strong regional economy with thriving communities.”
Engineering Subject Area Manager Graeme Woodhall, from Selby College, said:
“This project has given our students an outstanding opportunity. It’s so exciting to have such a hands-on experience, with the support and encouragement from staff at Drax, all of which will culminate in the race this weekend.
“The students are taking the race very seriously – they’ve worked really hard on the car, and understand how to get the most out of it to hopefully put them in pole position on Sunday.”
Four primary schools – Barwic Parade, Camblesforth, Selby Community and Selby Abbey – receive a 15mph Goblin G2 battery-powered car, which students and teachers have assembled ready for the race.
Older students from Selby High School, Holy Family Catholic High School and Selby College have built the more powerful Formula 24 car, which can reach speeds of up to 30mph.
Both cars have taken around 15 hours to build, with the teams also being required to design their own bodywork.
The project is part of Drax’s education programme, which aims to encourage more people, including female students, to study STEM subjects and increase the opportunities they have to secure skilled jobs.
