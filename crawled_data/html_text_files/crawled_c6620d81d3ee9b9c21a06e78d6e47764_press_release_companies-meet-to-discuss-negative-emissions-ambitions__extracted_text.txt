transport contact us companies meet to discuss negative emissions ambitions sustainable fuels technology company velocys has met with the team at drax power station which is behind plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology to enable the business to become carbon negative by 2030 10 january 2020 in august 2019 velocys subsidiary altalto immingham limited a collaboration with british airways and shell submitted plans for europes first commercial wastetojetfuel plant near immingham on the south bank of the humber the company has since voiced its support for the zero carbon humber campaign which is seeking to develop a largescale carbon dioxide transport and storage network in the humber that would significantly reduce emissions and create new job opportunities for the region dr neville hargreaves vp waste to fuels velocys said subject to planning consent and financing our altalto immingham project could be producing sustainable aviation fuel as soon as 2024 velocys has a robust technological solution for this challenging sector which addresses one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise and can help the uk meet its net zero target furthermore well also produce a captureready stream of carbon dioxide and thus a transport and storage network in the humber would allow us to make negative emission fuels delivering a further environmental benefit steve drayton director of innovation drax dr neville hargreaves vp waste to fuels velocys brian greensmith drax richard gwilliam drax martin hopkins velocys steve drayton director of innovation at drax said there are some interesting synergies between our ambitions at drax to become the worlds first carbon negative company and velocys plans to produce carbon negative fuels in the humber having innovative businesses like velocys in the humber region makes a zero carbon industrial cluster here an exciting possibility which will result in new jobs and clean growth delivering for the environment as well as the economy the zero carbon humber campaign aims to create the uks first net zero industrial cluster in the region which could make a bigger contribution to uks climate goals than any other industrial cluster  capturing 15 of the uks current annual co 2 emissions by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs drax will be able to remove more

announce an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 when ceo will gardiner spoke at cop 25 in madrid in december sustainable biomass is an important part of the uks longterm energy mix combining this renewable fuel with carbon capture and storage technology on draxs biomass generating units at its power station in north yorkshire england means the groups operations could capture 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year or more  a significant proportion of the uks target drax announced it had captured the first carbon dioxide from its pioneering beccs pilot project earlier this year the uk committee on climate changes  net zero  report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 million tonnes of co 2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero drax launched the zero carbon humber campaign in september with partners equinor and national grid ventures aimed at creating the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster in the region about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2900strong employees operate across three principal areas of

electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power
