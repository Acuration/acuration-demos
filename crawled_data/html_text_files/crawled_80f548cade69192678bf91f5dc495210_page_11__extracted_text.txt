archives press release scottish net zero minister visits iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station 10 december 2021 press releases cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built in a hollowedout cavern 1km inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain constructed in 1965 its reversible turbines are still at the cutting edge of energy storage technology enabling the plant to act like a giant water battery its turbines pump water from loch awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid the stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this process helps stop wind farms being paid to turn off when they are generating excess power helping scotland to be greener whilst cutting household energy bills enough wind power to supply a million homes went to waste in the uk in 2020 because there wasnt enough capacity to ensure this excess renewable power was stored and made available when it was needed as part of the visit drax groups head of hydro mike wynd also outlined the companys exciting work on plans to build a new second underground pumped hydro storage power station at the cruachan complex drax groups head of hydro mike wynd said cruachan plays a critical role in stabilising the electricity system balancing supply and demand by storing excess power from the national grid when scotlands wind turbines are generating more power than we need cruachan steps in to store the renewable electricity so it doesnt go to waste drax has exciting plans to more than double cruachans generating capacity a project that will support new green jobs and help our homes and businesses go greener by bringing more renewable power onto the grid cabinet secretary for net zero energy and transport michael matheson msp said it was fascinating to learn more about how important this unique power station is in supporting the scottish energy system and the critical role it plays in keeping the power grid safe and stable this kind of flexibility and resilience helps to support the growth of renewables enabling further decarbonisation of the energy system as we strive for net zero carbon emissions in scotland by 2045 drax acquired cruachan alongside the galloway and lanark hydro schemes in 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible renewable power generation when all four of its generating units are operating at maximum capacity the plant can supply enough flexible power for around 800000 homes ends media contacts aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes pumped hydro storage power stations act like giant water batteries  storing excess energy when there is an oversupply of power and then releasing when the country needs it most this is especially useful in supporting wind and solar generation storing excess renewable power to be used later instead of going to waste a recent report by the renewable energy association rea highlighted the policy barriers to deploying longduration energy storage and suggested ways to address these barriers such as through the introduction of an income floor despite being a key supporting pillar for intermittent generation from wind and solar power no new pumped storage plants have been built in britain since 1984 drax has begun the planning process to build a new underground pumped hydro storage power station at cruachan which will more than double the sites electricity generating capacity the 600megawatt mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 1 gigawatt gw no final investment decision has yet been taken and development remains subject to the

enough wind power to supply a million homes went to waste in the uk because there wasnt enough capacity to ensure this excess renewable power was stored and made available when it was needed by expanding cruachan we will help to stop that from happening by ensuring more renewable power is available to scotlands homes and businesses when they need it reducing costs whilst helping the planet a further exhibition will be held in early 2022 prior to submission of a section 36 application to the scottish government for their consideration the submission is expected to be made in spring with a decision from the government expected to be received in 2023 the project requires a new financial stability support mechanism from the uk government to secure private investment in longduration

decarbonisation of the uk energy system enough wind power to supply a million uk homes went unused in the uk in 2020 because there isnt enough storage available to prevent it going to waste former australian pm malcolm turnbull is an international proponent for pumped storage hydro having been at the forefront of the drive to build the biggest pumped hydro scheme in the southern hemisphere when he was in office cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built inside a hollowedout cavern 1km inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain its reversible turbines enable the plant to act like a giant water battery by pumping water from loch awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid the stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this process helps stop wind farms being paid to turn off when they are generating excess power helping scotland to be greener whilst cutting household energy bills earlier this year drax published exciting plans to build a new underground pumped storage hydro power station at cruachan  more than doubling the electricity generating capacity at the site mr turnbull is a board member of the international hydropower association and cochair of the international forum on pumped storage hydropower during his time in office he announced the construction of snowy hydro 20 the biggest pumped hydro scheme in the southern hemisphere while visiting cruachan mr turnbull said within the climate crisis the world is facing an ignored crisis  how to ensure that we do not fall back on fossil fuels when the wind isnt blowing and the sun isnt shining we need green energy security solutions i commissioned the snowy 20 pumped storage hydro plant to prevent blackouts in australia  the biggest such project in the southern hemisphere it was fascinating to visit draxs cruachan power station in scotland it reminds me that this is a tried and tested technology with draxs expansion plans for the project it can also be modern and with the right market focus on energy security and balance affordable the 5gw of such projects in the pipeline in scotland are central to deliver a net zero energy system in the uk ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said we were very happy to welcome mr turnbull to cruachan so he can see how this iconic power station is playing a critical role in balancing britains power system and enabling more renewables to come online our exciting plans to more than double the generating capacity of cruachan underlines draxs commitment to tackling the climate crisis and supporting the energy system as it continues to decarbonise expanding cruachan will unlock more renewable electricity to power homes and businesses across the country and support hundreds of new jobs in rural scotland eddie rich ceo of the international hydropower association added no national electricity grid has been able to decarbonise without a significant element of hydropower projects like cruachan demonstrate how easy it is to backup our wind energy resources in the uk with other renewables gas is not the only storage option as they say water wind and sun get the job done i hope to see other pumped storage come online in scotland in the next decade the expanded power station could be up and running as soon as 2030 subject to a successful planning application with the project supporting around 900 jobs during construction the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the existing lack of a framework for largescale longduration storage means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849 090 368 editors notes with section 36 consent from the scottish government and an updated revenue stabilisation mechanism from the uk government work to build the new pumped storage hydro power station could get underway in 2024 with it becoming operational supplying flexible power to the grid in 2030 no investment decision has yet been taken and development remains subject to the right regulatory framework with the uk government a recent report by the renewable energy association rea highlighted the policy barriers to deploying longduration energy storage and suggested ways to address these barriers such as through the introduction of an income floor analysis by pumped storage hydro experts stantec for drax shows 876 jobs will be supported directly and indirectly during construction built on the shores of loch awe in argyll in the 1960s cruachan was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system of its scale to be built in the world the upper reservoir on the mountainside can store 111 million cubic metres 24bn gallons  thats enough to fill 4440 olympic swimming pools independent analysis by lane clark and peacock lcp found the uk curtailed 36twh of wind power last year enough renewable electricity to supply around a million homes a separate independent report by academics from imperial college london recently found that just 45 gw of new pumped storage hydro could save up to 690m per year in
