against our ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 says drax ceo will gardiner 1 march 2021 bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is an essential negative emissions technology needed for the uk to meet its legally binding net zero by 2050 target and demonstrate global climate leadership work to build beccs could get underway at drax as soon as 2024 creating tens of thousands of jobs and supporting a postcovid economic recovery by 2027 draxs first beccs unit could be operational delivering the uks largest carbon capture project and permanently removing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year biomass domes and conveyor system at drax power station north yorkshire click to viewdownload drax is to kickstart the planning process for its proposals to build groundbreaking negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs marking a major milestone in the project the energy company has already transformed its power station near selby in north yorkshire to become the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted it to use sustainable biomass instead of coal now it has ambitions to go further by using beccs to permanently remove millions of tonnes of co 2 each year from the atmosphere and create a negative carbon footprint for the company in order to deploy this cutting edge negative emissions technology drax must secure a development consent order dco from the government  a process which takes around two years to complete and which will get underway in march will gardiner drax group ceo said kickstarting the dco process this march is a landmark moment in deploying beccs at drax and delivering against our ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload at drax we are very proud of the great strides already made in transforming the business to become the uks largest single site renewable power generator producing enough renewable electricity for up to four million homes and protecting thousands of jobs in the process with beccs we can go even further  we will be permanently removing millions of tonnes of co 2 from the atmosphere and making a significant contribution to efforts to address the climate emergency whilst creating thousands of new jobs and supporting a postcovid economic recovery drax recently announced the proposed acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc  a canadian wood pellet producer the deal which is subject to shareholder and other approvals would double draxs own biomass production capacity in line with its strategy to increase selfsupply reduce costs and create a long term future for biomass  paving the way for the deployment of beccs if successful in its dco application and subject to the right investment framework from government work to build draxs first two beccs units could get underway in 2024 ready to start capturing and storing up to eight million tonnes of co 2 a year the first phase of the dco application process includes an informal public consultation during march when people can provide comments on draxs proposals for beccs via the project website  train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station click to viewdownload earlier this month drax sold its four gas power stations and last week announced as part of its 2020 financial results that it will not be progressing plans to develop high efficiency gas power at the drax site in north yorkshire the news comes a year after drax said it would end almost 50 years of commercial coalfired electricity generation at drax power station in march 2021 and is aligned with its intention to focus on renewable generation from biomass and hydro ends turbine blades at drax power station click to viewdownload media contacts aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes beccs consultation due to covid restrictions draxs beccs dco consultation events will take place online  members of the public can find out more and provide comments on the proposals via live qa and chat events on tuesday march 9 4pm to 8pm thursday march 11 4pm to 8pm saturday march 13 10am to 2pm individual calls can also be booked with a member of the project team on tuesday march 23 via the

which jointly submitted a publicprivate sector funded bid worth around 75m to the uk government to establish a ccs and hydrogen economy in the humber region as the uks most carbon intensive industrial region the benefits of decarbonising the humber would have the greatest impact on enabling the country to reach its legally binding net zero by 2050 target whilst generating clean growth for the economy deploying hydrogen production at scale for fuelswitching as well as carbon capture to decarbonise gas power and other industries alongside beccs at drax could create and support tens of thousands of jobs in the humber region at its peak in 2027 about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 2900 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible
