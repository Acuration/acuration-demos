increased carbon stored in the forest robust prices and new markets benefiting forest owners and forest workers are among the findings of a report by hood consulting  this fourth in a series of catchment area analyses for drax looks at the area surrounding three pellet plants operated by enviva  ahoskie northampton and southampton enviva catchment area in virginia and north carolina forests and woodlands represent 68 of the total area at just over 54 million hectares ha with 87 of this area classified as timberland the area of timberland actively managed productive forest has increased by around 89000 ha since 2010 and there have been some significant changes in forest type  the overall area of forest has increased and there is no evidence of deforestation occurring land use by area since 2000 the total volume of standing timber in the catchment area has increased by 170 million cubic metres m 3  sixty five percent of this increase has occurred since 2012 indicating a growingmaturing forest resource and an expanding forest area most of the increase in volume has been in the sawtimber categories for both pine and hardwood although the hardwood pulpwood size class has also increased by nearly 10 million m 3 since 2012 following a small decline between 2000 and 2012 timber inventory by product category the increased demand from the three enviva pellet mills beginning operation in 2012 in the chesapeake region appears to have had no negative impact of the accumulation of forest carbon in the growing stock of the region since this time all categories of timber product have increased timber inventory by product category  pre and postenviva this increase in inventory is also reflected in the comparison of average annual growth to removals the surplus of uncut growth has increased substantially since 2010 from 47 million m 3 per year to 159 million m 3 pa over this period annual growth has increased by 355 whereas removals have decreased by 86 annual growth vs removals and surplus volume demand for timber products has fluctuated since 2000 the global financial crisis in 200809 impacted all product categories but particularly pine and hardwood sawtimber where there was a combined drop of over five million tonnes in 2010 compared to 2000 this was a loss of over 20 of total annual demand in the catchment area pine sawtimber has now recovered to precrisis levels but hardwood demand has remained low hardwood pulpwood demand also declined around this time with the closure and decline of existing pulp mills in the catchment area demand had fallen by one million tonnes pa by 2011 prior to the enviva pellet mills opening from 2012 the new biomass demand enabled the hardwood pulpwood market to recover to precrisis levels with demand in 2018 at almost exactly the same level as in 2000 annual demand by product category this fluctuation in demand is reflected in the average annual stumpage price data shown on the chart below this is the value that the forest owner gets for each product the trends are generally as expected with the exception of the hardwood sawtimber price which has increased substantially despite a decrease in demand this is due to supply chain issues reduced capacity of loggers and access to land average annual stumpage prices detailed below is an edited version of the consultants review and analysis of key issues in the catchment area the full version can be found in the main report is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows the opposite the total area of timberland in the enviva chesapeake catchment area has increased an estimated 82818 hectares 18 since enviva pellets ahoskie commenced full production in 2012 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no  inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area since 2012 but there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand has caused these changes conversion of hardwood and mixed pinehardwood timberland to planted pine timberland has occurred in the catchment area diversion from other markets no  inconclusive since 2012 pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has decreased 19 however this decrease is largely attributed to decreased demand from the pulppaper sector also demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs have increased an estimated 14 and 7 respectively since 2012 an unexpected increase in wood prices no  inconclusive the increase in hardwood biomass demand coincided with price increases of 1024 for delivered hardwood pulpwood these price increases were likely linked to a combination of both supply chain issues shortage of local loggers following pulppaper mill closures in the region and elevated prices offered by enviva to ensure guaranteed wood supply for the first several years of operation as prices for delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chips proceeded to decline 16 and 9 respectively from 2014 to2017 once the market stabilised since 2014 prices for pine products have held flat even though softwood raw material purchases demand by enviva have more than doubled in this catchment area changes in pine pulpwood and pine chip prices are largely driven by demand attributed to the pulppaper sector a reduction in growing stock timber no total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 19 from 2012 through 2018 over this period inventories increased as follows for each of the five major timber products 33 for pine sawtimber 23 for pine chipnsaw 14 for pine pulpwood 12 for hardwood sawtimber and 14 for hardwood pulpwood the increase in timber inventory can be linked to a combination of increased forest area additional hectares  additional inventory and annual harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment area forest ie annual growth has continued to exceed annual removals resulting in increased inventory levels a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock timber has increased slightly since 2012 increased timber growth ratescarbon sequestration rates can be linked to a combination of changes in species composition and silvicultural practices softwood pine grows at a much quicker rate compared to hardwood species and in the enviva chesapeake catchment area pine timberland area increased from 436 of total timberland area in 2011 to 460 in 2018 also improvements in silviculture have continued to enhance growth and overall productivity together these factors help explain how average per hectare volume growth increased from 59 m3 in 2011 to 77 m3 in 2018 an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no in 2018 the latest available growthtoremovals ratio for pine and hardwood pulpwood the timber products utilised by bioenergy equalled 249 and 276 respectively a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area what has been the impact of bioenergy demand on timber growing stock inventory neutral total wood demand increased an estimated 14 from 20122018 and much of that increase can be attributed to increased demand from bioenergy in this catchment area inventories are so substantial that increases in demand from bioenergy as well as from other sources have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth total growing stock inventory has continued to increase  an average of 29 per year since enviva first entered this market in 2012 timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have increased for pine sawtimber pine chipnsaw pine pulpwood and hardwood pulpwood since 2012 hardwood sawtimber growth rates have declined slightly evidence suggests these overall increases in growth rates are linked to changes in age class distribution ie a younger forest not due to changes in bioenergy demand forest area positive  neutral total forest timberland area in the catchment area increased nearly 83000 hectares 18 from 2012 through 2018 the latest available our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found a strong positive correlation between these two variables but also a moderately strong correlation between softwood sawlog demand and forest area wood prices neutral  negative the additional wood demand placed on this market by enviva from 20122014 coincided with a 19 increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 24 increase in delivered hardwood pulpwood price pine and hardwood chip prices also increased 1011 over this period analysis found evidence that increases in hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices can be linked to increases in total hardwood pulpwood demand however given that hardwood bioenergy demand has accounted for over 75 of total hardwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2014 it is reasonable to conclude that hardwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy has had some level of impact on delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices markets for solid wood products positive in the enviva chesapeake catchment area demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased 15 and 9 respectively from 20122018 a byproduct of the sawmilling process are sawmill residuals  a material utilied by envivas three mills to produce wood pellets with the increased production of both softwood and hardwood lumber so too has come an increase in sawmill residuals some of which has been purchasedconsumed by enviva not only has enviva benefited from the greater availability of this byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as envivas three mills have provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts forest landowners positive increased demand attributed to bioenergy has been a positive for forest landowners in the chesapeake catchment area not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood particularly hardwood pulpwood but the increase in pulpwood prices as a result of an overall increase in both softwood and hardwood pulpwood demand has transferred through to landowners improved compensation specifically since 2013 the first year all three enviva pellet mills were operating hardwood pulpwood stumpage price  the price paid to landowners  has averaged roughly 560 per ton in the chesapeake catchment area this represents a 47 increase over the approximately 380 per ton averaged by hardwood pulpwood stumpage in the catchment area over the 10 years prior 20032012 similarly pine pulpwood stumpage price has averaged 1295 per ton in the catchment area since 2013 up 67 from the 20032012 average of 775 per ton read

sustainable bioenergy international papers pulp and paper mill located in the morehouse parish of louisiana had been in operation since 1927 and was once the largest employer in the area however as a result of the global recession of 2008 the company was forced to lay off over 550 employees and shut the facility other mills in the area have also reduced production including georgia pacific which let go around 530 people at its crossett arkansas plant 18 miles to the north of morehouse in 2019 for an area dominated by forests such as northern louisiana and southern arkansas this decline in traditional markets came as a serious blow its a region where a healthy market for wood products is vital for the local economy and in turn the health of the regions forests luckily other wood product manufacturers and industries have since began to fill the gap engineers in front of wood pellet storage silos at draxs morehouse bioenergy biomass manufacturing facility in northern louisiana drax biomass has opened a mill in morehouse parish that uses some of the the lowgrade wood previously used to supply the paper industry to produce compressed wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity in the uk commissioned in 2015 the plant employs 74 people and can produce as much as 525000 metric tonnes of biomass pellets a year this makes it an important facility for local employment and the wood market in the region however to ensure it is positively contributing to the area and its environment the demand for wood must be sustainably managed morehouse bioenergy sources lowgrade wood from a catchment area that covers a 60mile radius and includes 18 counties in arkansas and four in louisiana as drax biomass doesnt own any of the forests it sources wood products from it regularly examines the environmental impact of its pellet mills on the forests and markets in which it operates the aim is to ensure the biomass used by drax to generate 12 of great britains renewable electricity is sustainably sourced and does not contribute to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts a new report by forestry research and consulting firm forisk evaluates the impact of biomass pellet demand from morehouse bioenergy on the forests and wood markets within the mills catchment area map of pulpwoodusing mills near morehouse timber market it found that biomass demand in the region does not contribute to deforestation  nor increase forest harvesting above a sustainable level overall growth of the regions pine timberland which supplies morehouse bioenergy continues to exceed removals pointing to expanding forest carbon and wood inventory annual growth compared to harvesting removals growing forests and increasing timber stocks the study focuses on timberland  working forests  in the plants sourcing area which the us forestry service categorises as productive land capable of providing timber on an industrial scale the timberland here is made up of 63 softwood trees which includes pines and 37 hardwoods such as oak pellet manufacturing as a whole including other pellet producers in the area accounts for only 6 of the demand for wood products in the region of that morehouse bioenergy contributes to 4 of total pellet demand total area of timberland lumber  such as sawtimber  makes up the bulk of demand for wood products accounting for 46 of total demand largely as a result of its high market value and landowners aims to extract maximum revenue from their pine stands however the less valuable wood  parts of trees that are misshapen too short or thin to be used for lumber  can be sold at a lower price to biomass pellet mills this wood might previously have been sold to paper and pulp mills exclusively but with international papers departure morehouse bioenergy now fills a part of that role total volume of growing stock on timberland maintaining healthy markets for both high and lowvalue wood is key to enabling landowners to reforest areas once they have been harvested in the knowledge it will provide a valuable return in the future ultimately however the way forests are maintained depends on the individual landowners and how they want to use their land the advantages of corporate ownership morehouse bioenergys catchment area covers 28000 square kilometres of timberland within which 96 of the timber is privately owned while some of that is owned by families with small patches of productive land 54 is held by corporate owners this includes businesses such as real estate investment trusts reits and timber investment management organisations timos which advise institutional investors on how to manage their forest assets this high percentage of corporate ownership influences forest management and replanting as owners look to maximise the value of forests and seek to continue to generate returns from their land in general corporate owners are spending more money on silviculture and actively managing their timber stands explains forisk consulting partner amanda lang they are investing more in fertiliser their seedlings and harvest control on pine stands because that leads to larger trees of a higher quality and more profit in the long run this is reflected in the higher growth rates found in the private sector leading to faster rates of carbon sequestration annual growth per hectare by owner type smaller private landowners meanwhile may have other objectives for their land like recreation and hunting in addition to timber income as a result some owners may be less inclined to intensively manage their timber stands forgoing fertilisation and competition control due to cost and might harvest on a less regular basis although these landowners may not be maximising the productivity of their timber resource to the same degree corporate owners do their unique management often contribute to greater diversity on the landscape demand and forest health in 2018 the annual average price for a metric tonne of pine sawtimber in morehouse bioenergys catchment area was 2571 down from a 10year high of 3160 in 2010 similarly pine pulpwood from which biomass pellets are made was valued at 775 per metric tonne in 2018 down from a 10year high of 13 in 2010 these low wood prices have caused many landowners to delay harvesting forests in hopes for a more lucrative wood price as a result pine timber inventories have grown across morehouse bioenergys catchment area in 2010 the us forest service counted more than 167 million metric tonnes of pine inventory by 2018 this had increased by more than 35 to reach 226 million morehouse bioenergy market historic stumpage prices metric tonne the report suggests this price slump is an ongoing result of the 2008 recession which greatly affected us house construction  one of the primary uses of sawtimber and many other types of wood products in the us some areas have already seen sawtimber prices increase as they recover from the recession  however the report suggests this is not spread evenly on a national level the inventory overhang in morehouse bioenergys catchment area is expected to begin reversing in 2024 or 2025 as lang explains we expect inventories to increase for a few more years and then start to decline that said inventories will remain higher than prerecession levels while high inventories suggest an abundant resource lower inventory volumes are not indicative of declining or unhealthy forests rather they can point to younger growing forests that have recently been replanted which will later grow to higher inventory volumes as they mature both suggest a healthy forestry industry in which landowners continue to reinvest in forests overall the analysis of the region points to healthy growing forests and importantly a sustainable industry from which drax can responsibly source biomass pellets ensuring the biomass used at drax power station is sustainably sourced is crucial to its

around the drax morehouse bioenergy plant has a long history of active management for timber production 96 of the forest owners are private and around half of these are corporate investors seeking a financial return from forest management  the pulp and paper pp sector dominates the market for low grade roundwood with over 75 of the total demand the wood pellet markets use only 6 of the roundwood of which 4 is used by morehouse given the small scale of demand in the pellet sector the extent of influence is limited however the new pellet markets have had a positive impact replacing some of the declining demand in the pp sector and providing a market for thinnings for some forest owners and a new offtake for sawmill residues pine forest is dominant in this area with an increasing inventory growing stock despite a stable forest area active management of pine forests has increased the amount of timber stored in the standing trees by 68 million tonnes from 2006 to 2018 over the same period the hardwood inventory remained static historic inventory and timberland area in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload us forest service fia data shows that the pine resource in this catchment area has been maturing the volume of timber has been increasing in each size class year on year this means that the volume available for harvesting is increasing and that more markets will be required to utilise this surplus volume and ensure that the longterm future of the forest area can be maintained historic pine inventory by dbh class in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload this is reflected in the growth drain ratio  the comparison of annual growth versus harvesting a ratio of one shows a forest area in balance less than one shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing phase but it can also occur when insufficient market demand exists and owners are forced to retain stands for longer in the absence of a viable market draxs morehouse bioenergy compressed wood pellet plant in northern louisiana this can have a negative impact on the future growth of the forest limiting the financial return to forest owners and reducing the cumulative sequestration of carbon by enforcing suboptimal rotation lengths the current growth drain ratio of pine around morehouse is 167 with an average annual surplus of around 7 million metric tonnes this surplus of growth is partly due to a decline in sawtimber demand due to the global financial crisis but also due to the maturing age class

john thank you for your letter of the 9 january detailing the findings and recommendations from the first meeting of the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass i want to begin by reiterating how important the work of the iab is to draxs purpose and ambition as you know we recently announced our intention to become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030 by scaling up our pioneering biomass with ccs beccs pilot project this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use makes a positive contribution to our climate the environment and the communities in which we operate to that end both you and the iab will play a vital role by guiding us on our sourcing choices and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be i enjoyed meeting with the iab and hearing your conclusions from the first meeting i am also pleased to hear from my team that the longer discussions were useful and constructive please pass on my thanks to all the members of the iab for their time and consideration in particular i am grateful for their consideration of our new sustainable biomass sourcing policy and the insight and recommendations that were given i am pleased to hear that you agree our policy is an accurate representation of the criteria laid down in the forest research report i agree that a key topic for us to explore is how science can be further developed with regards the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood i also agree that understanding the counter factuals in the usage of wood that has come to us is important this is an area we have and continue to explore and i would refer the iab to a report we have published subsequent to the meeting catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends 2019  which contains an independent analysis of the impact of our sourcing at our amite pellet mill in mississippi the team look forward to discussing this with you at a future meeting and receiving your input to shape the next phases of this work i also agree the need to continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light as well as ensure that the current policy is embedded into our operations for that reason our policy will be kept under regular review to accommodate changes in science and new evidence as it emerges we have also committed to advancing scientific research in the areas applicable to our operations through partnerships with academic institutions and direct support for academic research with regards your suggestion of a restatement of the academic evidence on biomass sustainability we shall give this interesting approach due consideration i do believe that better alignment through a shared understanding of the evidence among the academic community environmental groups policy makers and industry would be a welcome development and would be grateful to the iab for its further consideration of how this might be achieved i will also raise your considerations regarding the sustainable biomass program spb in my position a member of the spb board you are correct that our new policy goes beyond sbp and so an important work programme for us is how we demonstrate we are meeting the new policy lastly i welcome the addition of two interim telephone calls which will help to keep momentum between the half yearly meetings and will support us as we develop our policy research and implementation projects further thank you for this commitment as the work of the iab progresses i look forward to hearing how you believe drax can best build the evidence required to demonstrate that we are sourcing according to the best available science as the worlds largest biomass consumer it is important that we lead by example this means not only having a world leading biomass sustainability policy in place but also the data and evidence available to give all our stakeholders the confidence that we are fulfilling our purpose of

iab the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass provides this statement following its first meeting on friday 15th november 2019 attendees john beddington chair john krebs deputy chair virginia dale sam fankhauser elena schmidt robert matthews exofficio member during the meeting iab members discussed the role of the iab reflected on the public launch of the iab reviewed and accepted the iabs terms of reference developed its understanding of draxs business considered draxs approach to sustainable biomass including its new responsible sourcing policy  explored the climate aspects of draxs new responsible sourcing policy in light of forest researchs work on the carbon impacts of biomass  explored draxs use of the independent sustainable biomass program standard to evidence their performance against drax policies the iab shares this summary of its findings and recommendations the iab agreed that its role is to provide independent advice to drax on its sustainable biomass policy and practice iab members will do this by scrutinising the science and evidence informing draxs approach and by providing independent feedback to drax on how it can adopt best practices in addition to holding two face to face meetings each year the iab agreed to hold two interim telephone meetings the iab recommended drax refer to forest environment not natural environment in its policy the iab noted that the ten criteria drax have outlined to reduce the carbon emissions of its biomass approach have been designed to reflect the findings of forest researchs carbon impacts of biomass consumed in the eu report 2018 the iab found that the drax criteria are an accurate interpretation of the report the iab would like to explore how the science can further be developed with regard to the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood and consider how draxs policy might evolve the iab and drax discussed the possibility of developing some sub criteria for specific forest types the iab suggested drax could consider a restatement of the evidence academic review process to better understand and draw alignment on where there is scientific evidence on the sustainability of biomass the iab suggested drax should consider both a goal to continuously improve and consider the longer term implications of its policy commitments in light of potential climate changes the iab emphasised that the way drax operationalises its commitments will be critical it stressed the importance of robustly exploring the counterfactuals to draxs biomass activities highlighting the potential for tradeoffs between climate and biodiversity outcomes as an area for more detailed review the iab highlighted a number of considerations for drax in its use of the sustainable biomass program sbp it welcomed sbps adoption of a multistakeholder approach and suggested it will be important to scrutinise its evolution it noted that as draxs sustainability commitments go beyond sbps current criteria drax needs a strategy on how to evidence the compliance for these additional commitments the iab expressed interest in learning about draxs long term vision it noted that the ceasing of subsidies in 2027 will be a key milestone and highlighted its interest in exploring draxs strategy for managing this in future meetings with drax the iab will further examine evidence of draxs approach performance and impact against its commitments to identify any changes that drax may need to make the iab noted the following specific topics for further consideration evidence relating to the impact of thinning a forest on carbon pest control and fire risks how drax operationalises its commitments the counterfactuals of draxs biomass activities and potential tradeoffs between biodiversity and carbon outcomes draxs approach to biodiversity draxs long term vision including its plans for developing and scaling bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and its broader roadmap to net zero carbon

advisory board iab how a mississippi wood pellet mill supports healthy forests and rural economies 19 december 2019 sustainable bioenergy the landscape of the amite catchment area in mississippi is dense with forests they cover 84 of the area and play a crucial role in the local economy and the lives of the local population amite bioenergy catchment area  land area distribution by land classification  use 2017 on the states western border with louisiana near the town of gloster draxs amite bioenergy pellet mill is an important part of this local economy providing employment and creating a market for lowgrade wood amite produces halfamillion metric tonnes of wood pellets annually that not only benefit the surrounding area but also make a positive impact in the uk providing a renewable flexible low carbon source of power that could soon enable carbon negative electricity generation  however this is only possible if the pellets are sourced from healthy and responsibly managed forests thats why its essential for drax to regularly examine the environmental impact of the pellet mills and their catchment areas to ultimately ensure the wood is sustainably sourced and never contributes to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts in the first of a series of reports evaluating the areas drax sources wood from hood consulting has looked at the impact of amite on its surrounding region the scope of the analysis had to be objective and impartial using only credible data sources and references the specific aim was to evaluate the trends occurring in the forestry sector and to determine what impact the pellet mill may have had in influencing those trends positively or negatively this included the impact of harvesting levels carbon stock and sequestration rate wood prices and the production of all wood products the report highlights the positive role that the amite plant has had in the region supporting the health of western mississippis forests and its economy woodchip pile at amite bioenergy 2017 the landscape of the amite bioenergy wood pellet plant amite bioenergys catchment area  the working forest land from which it has sourced wood fibre since it began operating  stretches roughly 6600 square kilometres km 2  across 11 counties  nine in mississippi and two in louisiana amite bioenergy catchment area boundary us forest service data shows that since 2014 when amite began production total timberland in this catchment area has in fact increased by more than 5200 hectares 52 million m 2  an increase in market demand for wood products particularly for sawtimber can be one of the key drivers for encouraging forest owners to plant more trees retain their existing forest or more actively manage their forests to increase production  markets for low grade wood like the amite facility are essential for enabling forest owners to thin their crops and generate increased revenue as a byproduct of producing more sawtimber around 30 of the annual timber growth in the region is pine pulpwood a lowervalue wood which is the primary source of raw material used at amite more than 60 of the growth is what is known as sawtimber  highvalue wood used as construction lumber or furniture or chip n saw also used for construction and furniture amite bioenergy catchment area  net growth of growing stock timber by major timber product source usda  us forest service the analysis shows that harvesting levels in each product category are substantially lower than the annual growth as shown in the table below this means that every year a surplus of growth remains in the forest as stored carbon amite bioenergy catchment area  harvest removals by major timber product 2017 source usda  us forest service in 2017 total timber growth was 511 million m 3 while removals totalled 241 million m 3  less than half of annual growth of that figure the pine pulpwood used to make biomass pellets grew by 152 million m 3 while just 850 thousand m 3 was removed the table below shows the ratio of removals to growth in the pine forests around amite a ratio of 1 is commonly considered to be the threshold for sustainable harvesting levels in this catchment area the ratio is more than double that amount meaning that there is still a substantial surplus of annual growth that has not been harvested amite bioenergy catchment area  annual growth removals  growthtoremoval ratios by major timber product 2017 source usda  us forest service between 2010 and 2017 the total stock of wood fibre or carbon growing in the forests around amite increased by more than 11 million m 3  this is despite a substantial increase in harvesting demand for pulpwood timber inventory by major timber product 20102017 projected values 2018 the economic argument for sustainability the timberland of the amite bioenergy catchment area is 85 privately owned among the tens of thousands of smaller private landowners are larger landowners like forestry business weyerhaeuser  companies that manage forest land on behalf of investors like pension funds and private families for these private owners as long as there are healthy markets for forest products forests have an economic value  without these markets some owners may choose to convert their forest to other land uses eg for urban development or agriculture more than a billion tree saplings have been grown at weyerhaeusers pearl river nursery in mississippi the facility supplies these young trees to be planted in the amite catchment area and across the us south strong markets lead to increased investment in better management eg improved seedlings more weeding or fertilisation thinning and selecting the best trees for future sawtimber production thinning pulpwood is part of the forest management process explains dr harrison hood forest economist and principal at hood consulting typically with pine you plant 500 to 700 trees per acre that density helps the trees grow straight up rather than outwards but once the trees begin to grow beyond a certain point they can crowd one another and some trees will be starved of water nutrients and sunlight it is therefore essential to fell some trees to allow the others to grow to full maturity  a process known as thinning at final harvest youve got about 100 trees per acre continues dr hood you remove the pulpwood or the poorquality trees to allow the higherquality trees to continue to grow these thinnings have typically been used as pulpwood to make things like paper but with the slight decline of this industry over the last few decades theres been a need to find new markets for it paper production in the amite catchment area has declined since 2010 as shown on the chart on the right whilst demand for sawtimber lumber has been increasing following the economic recovery after the recession of 2008 southern pine lumber production vs amite bioenergy catchment area delivered pine sawtimber price source southern forest products association american forest  paper association timbermartsouth us paper  particleboard production vs amite bioenergy cartchment area delivered pine pulpwood price source southern forest products association american forest  paper association timbermartsouth producing sawtimber without a market for thinnings and lowgrade wood is a challenge the arrival of a biomass market in the area has created a renewed demand  something that is even more important at the current time when there is an abundance of forest but wood prices are flat or declining slightly sawtimber prices havent moved much over the last six to eight years explains dr hood theyve been flat because theres so much wood out there that theres not enough demand to eat away at the supply pulpwood consumers such as amite bioenergy create demand for pulpwood from thinning allowing landowners to continue managing their forests while waiting for the higher value markets to recover revenue from pulpwood helps to support forest owners particularly when sawtimber prices are weak amite bioenergy catchment area mill map 2019 theres so much pulpwood out there says dr hood you need a buyer for pulpwood to allow forests to grow and mature into a higher product class and to keep growing healthy forests the picture of the overall forest in the catchment area is of healthy growth and crucially

sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp amite bioenergy catchment area analysis sustainable bioenergy the first of our planned catchment area analysis reports is complete looking at amite bioenergy  our compressed wood pellet manufacturing plant in mississippi the aim of this analysis is to evaluate the trends occurring in the forestry sector around the plant and to determine what impact the pellet mill may have had in influencing those trends positively or negatively this includes the impact of increased harvesting levels changes in carbon stock and sequestration rate wood prices and the production of all wood products analysis shows a maturing forest resource with a substantial surplus of annual growth increasing in age and growing stock increasing production of sawtimber and higher value wood products stable wood prices and no market displacement key report data since 2010 the total growing stock the amount of wood stored in the forest around amite bioenergy has increased by 111 million cubic metres m 3  this is partly due to an increase in the area of timberland which increased by more than 5200 hectares ha but predominantly due to the forest ageing and increasing the average size class the average tree gets bigger moving from a small diameter pulpwood tree to a larger sawtimber grade tree the chart below shows that the increase in volume is entirely within the private sector where forests are more actively managed the public sector has declined in growing stock by 15 million m 3 whilst the private sector has increased by 126 million m 3  the continual cycle of thinning harvesting and replanting in the private forests helps to keep the growing stock increasing total growing stock volume on timberland in cubic meters by ownership group source us forest service  fia harvesting in the catchment area has increased due to the increased demand from the pellet mill but this is still substantially lower than average annual growth the

of harvesting to see if the demand from the pellet mill is having a negative impact increasing competition and prices for other markets the chart below shows that prices are now lower than when the pellet mill began operating while this may be good for all markets in the area it is not good for the forest owner when considering if trends are good or bad we must also consider from which perspective we are making the assessment increasing prices can be a positive encouraging owners to plant more trees or to invest more in the management of their forest providing that increasing prices do not result in a loss of production in existing markets amite bioenergy catchment area  average stumpage prices metric tonne source timber martsouth an important part of this analysis is to look for evidence to evaluate draxs performance against its new forest commitments  some of which relate directly to these trends and data sets hood consulting  the authors of catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends amite bioenergy  has looked at the impact of amite bioenergy on its supply basin the scope of the analysis had to be objective and impartial using only credible data sources and references however in order to address some of the key issues and draw some conclusions the consultants used their extensive experience and local knowledge in addition to the data trends a summary of their findings is detailed below summary of key questions addressed in the analysis is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused  deforestation no us forest service data shows that the total timberland area has increased by more than 5200 ha a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no  inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last five to 10 years but there is little evidence to suggest bioenergy demand has caused these changes market research shows thinnings have declined in this catchment area since 2014 when amite bioenergy commenced production however local loggers identify poor market conditions for the decrease in thinnings not increased bioenergy demand the primary focus of timber management in this area is the production of sawtimber rotation lengths of managed forests have remained unchanged between 2535 years of age despite increases in bioenergy demand increased bioenergy demand however has benefited landowners in this catchment area providing additional outlets for pulpwood removed from thinnings  a management activity necessary for sawtimber production diversion from other markets no since 2014 softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has increased 8 while demand for softwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood has increased 53 and 5 respectively an abnormal increase in wood prices no prices for delivered pine pulpwood the primary raw material consumed by amite bioenergy have decreased 12 since the pellet mill commenced production in 2014 a reduction in growing stock timber no  inconclusive total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 5 from 2014 through 2017 the latest available data specifically pine sawtimber inventory increased 13 pine chipnsaw inventory increased 24 and pine pulpwood inventory decreased 12 over this period this is indicative of an aging forest a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock timber has decreased slightly since 2014 and a slower timber growth rate essentially represents a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon however the reduced growth rate and subsequent reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon is due to the aging of the forest changes in timber age class distribution not to increases in bioenergy demand as trees get older the growth rate slows down an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual harvests provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2017 the latest available the growthtoremovals ratio for pine pulpwood equalled 180 a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area evaluate the impact of bioenergy demand positive neutral negative on  timber growing stock inventory neutral total wood demand from biomass and other solid wood products is up more than 35 compared to 2014 levels intuitively increased demand means more timber is harvested which reduces total growing stock inventory however in this catchment area inventories are so substantial that increases in demand from bioenergy as well as from other sources have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth and as such total growing stock inventory has continued to increase  an average of 2 per year since 2014 when amite bioenergy commenced production timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have declined since 2014 however evidence suggests the reduction in growth rates is more a product of an aging forest and not due to changes in bioenergy demand additionally young planted pine stands are actually growing at a faster rate than ever before  due to the continued improvement of seedling genetics and as timber is harvested and these stands are replanted in pine as has historically occurred in the catchment area over the long term the average timber growth rate is likely to increase weyerhaeuser nursery hazlehurst mississippi forest area positive  neutral total forest timberland area in the catchment area increased more than 5200 ha from 2014 through 2017 the latest available and while our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found a moderately strong relationship between the two findings are inconclusive as to whether the increase in timberland acreage can be attributed to increases in biomass demand wood prices neutral despite the additional wood demand placed on this market by amite bioenergy since 2014 prices for delivered pine pulpwood the primary raw material consumed by amite bioenergy have decreased 12 in the catchment area prices for pine sawmill residuals and inwoods chips the other two raw materials consumed by amite bioenergy have also declined over the last several years  down 3 since 2016 for pine sawmill residuals and down 3 since 2015 for inwoods chips markets for solid wood products positive  neutral in the amite bioenergy catchment area demand for softwood sawtimber to produce lumber has increased more than 50 since 2014 a biproduct of the sawmilling process is sawmill residuals  a material utilized by amite bioenergy to produce wood pellets not only has amite bioenergy benefited from the greater availability of

australian scrublands the planet is home to an incredibly diverse range of forested environments and while each region is very different almost all have been impacted by humans the effects of this have not always been positive and despite decades spent raising awareness of the importance of forests for the health of the world some regions forests remain in decline africa and asia in particular have seen a decline in forest cover although each year sees less lost over the past few decades but there are areas where the impact of humans is in fact having a positive effect this is largely thanks to the introduction of modern sustainable forestry practices  which have incentivised growth and helped bringing a variety of environmental and economic benefits to different regions around the world a recent report by pöyry management consulting for drax has looked in depth at these benefits and in particular four regions where different approaches to sustainable forestry have brought a positive impact to people industry and the environment alike more than a testament to the beneficial effects sustainable forest management can have it shows that while the tactics methods and environments may differ their positive effects are universal us south turning around old practices weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama the forests of the us south from virginia and kentucky to texas and florida have a long history of misuse both indigenous people and later european settlers used disruptive techniques such as large scale burning and removed valuable mature hardwood on a mass scale often leaving areas to naturally regenerate that largely changed in the mid20 th century however when forestry became moreintensive and the need for sustaining a supply of quality timber grew more apparent the introduction of processes such as thinning and managed regeneration helped usher in a more responsible approach that has led to growth in both the forestry industry and forest coverage between 2010 and 2015 there was 50 more growth in the volume of forests than was removed from harvesting more than just growing forest area this means an increase in the amount of carbon being absorbed and stored from the atmosphere charts us south historical increment to removal and us south above ground carbon 19571997  in the us south around 86 of forest land is privately owned by either corporations or individuals but the economics of sustainable forestry practices has encouraged the overall growth in forests even with limited regulations on land use in the area in addition to the

where in a state of heavy degradation but starting as far back as 100 years ago sustainable practices such as planned harvesting and regeneration legislation were introduced the results are significant there is now more wood in finnish forests today than at the turn of the century the majority 61 of finlands forests are privately owned with the state owning 25 companies only owning 8 and 5 held by other owners many large companies however offer services such as forestry work wood sales drainage and tax services to private owners this collaboration between sectors allows for best practices to be easily shared and quickly become widespread as a result forest stocks have increased from 1500 million m 3 in 1970 to 2500 million m 3 in 2015 even while overall forest area has

baltics in europe following the first world war the forestry commission was established primarily to try prevent timber shortages during times of war but it went on to drive a boom in new plantations across the country and introduce grant schemes for private plantations chart top 10 net importers of wood products  in 2017 the uk was the worlds second largest net importer of wood products a problem with this afforestation however was that it mostly consisted of monocultures of exotic species that were well suited to the climate rather than regenerating native species the modern uk forestry standard is countering this practice by putting in place requirements for afforestation and replanting that protect biodiversity landscape and climate change as well as soil and water forest in argyll

well as tax duties for timber exports the result was a surge in eucalyptus plantations which grew from 25000 hectares in 1987 to more than 1 million hectares in 2015 largely driven by interest from international companies and investors these plantations are currently managed sustainably with growth still exceeding removals eucalyptus is not a native species to uruguay but by allowing international investors to plant on land deemed of no agricultural or environmental value the country has seen enormous afforestation while 800000 hectares of native forests remain the economic impact
