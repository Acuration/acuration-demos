power stations plans to upgrade up to two of its coalfired electricity generating units to gas at events taking place next month 26 october 2017 drax gave notice to the planning inspectorate in september about its intention to consult on the proposals which are part of its strategy to play a vital role in changing the way energy is generated as the uk moves to a low carbon future the ongoing research and development project is exploring options including up to 36 gigawatts gw of new gas generation capacity and 200mw of battery storage in line with government plans to phase out coal by 2025 the power station near selby is already the uks largest single site renewable power generator having converted three coal generating units to use sustainable wood pellets more than two thirds of the power produced is now renewable providing 17 of the uks renewable electricity  enough for four million homes the upgrades would enhance drax power stations flexible and responsive capability and make yorkshire the home of large scale battery technology andy koss ceo of drax power said we have always supported and worked with our local communities and want to ensure they have a role in shaping our thinking for the future drax power station is a national asset and a significant driver of economic growth in the north of england these options could repurpose up to two of our coal assets and extend their operation into the 2030s securing the future of the plant beyond 2025 when the government says coal must come off the system we are undertaking a comprehensive programme of consultation over the coming months to share our ideas with the public and listen to their views public consultation events will give people the opportunity to find out more about the plans events will take place at wednesday 8 november 4pm to 8pm selby town hall york st selby yo8 4aj thursday 9 november 11am to 430pm drax sports and social club the blue room main rd drax selby yo8 8pj saturday 11 november 1030am to 130pm junction paradise place goole dn14 5dl the options for repowering to gas and building battery storage complement draxs ongoing work to explore options for further generation from sustainable biomass mr koss added this is the start of the planning process but if developed these options for gas and battery storage show how we could upgrade our existing infrastructure to provide capacity stability and essential grid services as we do with biomass this would continue to keep costs low for consumers and help to deliver the governments commitment to remove coal from the uk grid the project includes the following elements up to 36 gw of new gas generation capacity and up to 200mw of battery storage the capacity of the coal units being replaced is 13gw the gas generation plant will include up to four new combined cycle gas turbines ccgts a new gas pipeline connection to the national gas transmission system and an electrical connection into draxs existing substation to allow electricity to be exported to the national grid a temporary crane positioned next to the existing jetty on the river ouse and at a point close to the power station during construction environmental assessments will consider issues such as local planning air and water quality flood risk traffic and transport noise ecology heritage and the effects on landscape and visual amenity subject to development consent being granted and construction going ahead the drax repower project gas generating plants battery storage and gas pipeline could be operational in 202324 further information about the project the consultation and planning application will be published here  ends  media contacts ali lewis head of news drax group 01757 612165 email protected jessica gorton press officer drax
