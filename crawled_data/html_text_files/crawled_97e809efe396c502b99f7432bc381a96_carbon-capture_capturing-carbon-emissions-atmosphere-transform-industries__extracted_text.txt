reserve drax power station visit power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station capturing carbon emissions from the atmosphere could transform these industries how algae paper and cement could all have a role in a future of negative emissions 24 april 2019 carbon capture countries companies and industries around the world are racing to find ways to reduce their emissions but looking slightly further down the line there is in fact a grander aim negative emissions negative emissions technologies nets can actually absorb more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit and theyre vitally important for avoiding catastrophic manmade climate change without nets it could be impossible to achieve the intergovernmental panel on climate changes ambition of keeping temperatures under 15 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels one example already being implemented is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs it is what its name suggests using technologies to capture and store the co 2 generated during the process of energy generation from biomass or organic materials rather than releasing it into the atmosphere beccs holds vast potential in the electricity generation industry drax power station is currently piloting one form of this technology on one of its biomass units to capture as much as a tonne of co 2 a day but if it were deployed across all its biomass units beccs technology could make it the worlds first negative emissions power station beyond the power industry however theres scope for growth across other industries once the biomass is sourced sustainably there are already five sites around the world where beccs is being trialled and implemented at scale laying the road to negative emissions storing co 2 from ethanol production in the illinois basin the ethanol production industry is already seeing significant deployment of beccs including the largest installation of the technology operating in the world the illinois industrial carbon capture and storage project is part of a corntoethanol plant in the us that has the capacity to capture 1 million tonnes of co 2 every year  here corn is used to create ethanol by fermenting it in an oxygendeprived environment this process creates co 2 as a byproduct which is captured and stored permanently in pores within the sandstone of the illinois basin under the facility researchers believe with further development the site could capture as much as 250 million tonnes each year norways cement challenge concrete is one of the worlds most versatile building materials as a result it is the second mostconsumed material in the world behind water  more than 10 billion tonnes of it is produced every year however its key ingredient  cement which acts as concretes binding agent  is made using a hugely carbonintensive manufacturing process and now accounts for as much as 6 of all global carbon emissions the norcem cement plant in brevik southeast norway has been experimenting with using biomass to power the kilns used to create its cement which must heat ingredients to 1500 degrees celsius now its taking this a step further by becoming part of the countrys ambitious full chain ccs project the project will see 400000 tonnes of co 2 captured annually which will then be transported by ship to a storage site on norways western coast from here a pipeline will transport the co 2 50 kilometres away and deposit it deep below the north seas bed the plan has the potential to work at an even bigger scale the pipeline will be capable of receiving as much as 4 million tonnes of co 2 per year  meaning it could even import and store carbon from other countries burning waste and growing algae in a world that seems increasingly unsure how to safely deal with its waste the idea of incinerating it and making use of the heat this produces seems widely beneficial but combusting any solid means releasing carbon emissions in japan however a biomassfired waste incineration plant is changing this by being the first in the world to capture its carbon emissions to get this project up and running toshiba the firm behind the project had to overcome unique challenges for example waste incineration produces a greater mix of chemicals than in ethanol or power production including some that are corrosive to the metal pipes normally used in carbon capture now running at commercial scale the saga city waste incineration plant isnt just capturing co 2  its also utilising it to cultivate crops at a nearby algae farm  the carbon is being absorbed and used to grow algae for use in commercial scale cosmetic products such as body and skin lotions carbon isnt the only thing finding new use at the facility reconstituted scrap metal from the plant is being used to make the medals for the 2020 tokyo olympics the carbon capture system has been operational since 2016 and is capable of capturing 3000 tonnes of co 2 a year but it isnt the regions first deployments of beccs fully integrating beccs into biomass power nearby the mikawa power plant on the fukuoka prefecture is leading the race in asia to fully integrate carbon capture technology into a biomass power station the 50 mw power station successfully piloted carbon capture in 2009 through a partnership with toshiba at the time it was powered by coal however in 2017 the plant upgraded to a 100 biomass boiler fuelled by palm kernel shells  a waste product from palm oil extraction mills now its in the process of ramping up its carbon capture capabilities with a target of being operational in 2020 the system  which after drax will be the second plant in the world to capture carbon using 100 biomass feedstock  will have the capacity to capture more than 50 of the biomass plants co 2 emissions or as much as 180000 tonnes per year  japans government is now supporting efforts to develop co 2 transportation and potential offshore storage solutions for next year pulping wood and growing food beccs technology has yet to be deployed in the paper industry to the same extent as in other organicmatterbased industries but with many pulp and paper mills already using byproducts such as hog fuel  in generating power for their sites its a prime area for beccs growth in saintfelicien quebec commercialscale carbon capture technology is being deployed at a pulp mill run by resolute forest products and as of march 2019 had a capacity of capturing 11000 tonnes of co 2 a year rather than storage however it supplies the carbon to a cucumbergrowing greenhouse next door to the mill  as well as supplying enough warm water to meet 25 of the greenhouses heating needs both long established biomassbased industries like ethanol and paper and new sectors like electricity are now adopting beccs technology and driving innovation the biomass feedstocks involved in beccs must however be sourced sustainably  or else a positive climate impact could be at the expense of environmental degradation elsewhere it should be possible to expand biomass supply in a sustainable way found a recent global biomass markets report from ricardo aea for the uks department for business energy and industrial strategy beis while its still a complex technology to deploy beccs is increasingly operating at larger scales and growing to the level needed to seriously reduce industrial co 2 emissions and help to combat climate change learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere from capture methods to storage and use across three continents these companies are showing promising results for ccus why experts think bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will be an essential part of the energy system the science of safely and permanently putting carbon in the ground the numbers must add up to enable negative emissions in a zero carbon future says drax group ceo
