planning inspectorate in accordance with the statutory dco timetable a decision as to whether or not to grant development consent orders to the project is expected from the secretary of state for energy and climate change in midjuly 2015 assuming the dco is granted to the project it is watt powers intention to enter the progress power project in the uks capacity market auction subject to the outcome of the auction and the projects financing watt power would expect the plants to commence construction within 12 months of the auction with commercial operation approximately 18 months later submission of dco application deferred 30 march 2015 press releases the project is in a position to submit an application for a development consent order to the planning inspectorate and mpl will continue to monitor market conditions to determine the appropriate time for submission millbrook power shares final plans with local councils 9 february 2015 press releases millbrook power mpl has made one significant change to the project since it last met the local authorities in november mpl has chosen to underground the electrical cable connection for its power project thereby avoiding the need to construct new overhead lines and new transmission towers the decision to go underground the gas pipeline connection will also be underground will significantly reduce the visual impact of the project and has been taken after careful consideration of the views held by local councillors and local people and mpls completion of its technical and environmental studies that have been carried out over the past 12 months nick johnson mpls project manager said the local councillors welcomed our decision to go underground with the electrical connection this follows our decision last year to reduce the height of the power station stacks after considering the results of technical studies the councillors also acknowledged the measures that we will take to minimise other impacts of the power project our project is situated on land allocated for development but we have always been mindful of the views of local people and fully appreciate the local environment and the heritage of the area jason longhurst director of regeneration at central bedfordshire council said it has been very useful to have been engaged early in this important development and were pleased that millbrook power has provided changes to reduce the visual impact of the development millbrook power intends to submit its application to the planning inspectorate before the end of march and there should then follow a six month period of examination during which time the local councils and other interested parties can express their views subject to the outcome of the planning inspectorates examination process and the secretary of state for energy  climate change granting a development consent order the millbrook power project could enter commercial operation in 20192020 notes to editors the underground electrical connection will export the electricity that is generated by the power plant via a new substation into the national grid the underground gas pipeline will deliver natural gas the power stations only fuel source from the uk national gas transmission system to the power generation plant the 200m mpl project was first announced in may 2014 since then mpls technical and environmental studies have considered a range of issues such as noise air quality visual impact ecology and transport in addition mpl has publicised its plans via various channels consulted the local councils in the area and a range of other interested parties and held two series of public exhibitions subject to planning and financing construction of the project could start in 20172018 for a 23 year period the plant up to 299mw capacity will only run at times when electricity demand is at its highest mainly during the winter months and on those occasions when there is intermittent output from renewable sources of energy primarily wind and solar the project would be a substantial and longterm investment in the area seeing the creation of around 150 construction jobs up to 15 permanent skilled jobs and potential business opportunities for local companies mpl is consulting central bedfordshire and bedford borough councils on ways to bring wider social and environmental benefits to the surrounding area for further information please visit httpswwwdraxcomaboutusourprojectsmillbrookpower progress powers response to dr dan poulter mp 16 january 2015 press releases we have met dr poulter on a

a flexible peaking power plant which would support security of energy supply in the future were also received from local people following consideration of all responses returned by stakeholders and the local community we are now focused on refining our design and submitting an application for a development consent order to the planning inspectorate in the first quarter of 2015 that application will be accompanied by an environmental statement which will provide detailed information on a range of topics including air quality noise and vibration landscape and visual impact and traffic transport and access the application will also include a consultation report this document will describe how we have had regard to feedback received and indicate how this has been taken into account

with local people gather their views and address their concerns we will now explain how the project has moved forward in recent months and provide more detailed information one of the key changes we have made is to reduce the height of the stacks of the plant following community feedback and our technical and environmental work we can confirm that they will be no taller than 40 metres this decision is just one of the steps we have taken to minimise the environmental and visual impact of the project we are also looking for peoples views on the environmental work we have carried out to date the proposed route options for accessing the project and our proposed layout of the plant within the project site we hope that as many people as possible will attend our public exhibition days or
