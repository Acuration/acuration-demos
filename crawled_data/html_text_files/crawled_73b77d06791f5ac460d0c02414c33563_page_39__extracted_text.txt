climate change objectives will gardiner ceo drax group click to view high resolution photo mr gardiner said climate change is the greatest challenge the world now faces  but it is also creating major new investment and job opportunities which could be transformational after brexit globally by 2030 estimates show that the economic opportunity from creating a zerocarbon economy is upwards of 20 trillion  and the uk is ideally placed to drive the innovation required to take advantage of this were already leading the world when it comes to decarbonising power generation  weve done more than any other country to remove coal from the grid we must continue to drive innovation to deliver further social economic and environmental benefits through new technologies like carbon capture and storage smart meters and electric vehicles drax has converted two thirds of the uks biggest power station at drax in north yorkshire from coal to use sustainable biomass making it the biggest decarbonisation project in europe  delivering carbon savings of more than 80 wood pellet storage dome at drax power station centre and chimney left a beccs pilot is underway to show that 90 of the

carbon capture and storage technology its beccs pilot plant is the worlds first to capture carbon dioxide from a 100 biomass feedstock  if it can be scaled up the power produced could help reduce the harmful gases accumulating in the atmosphere which cause climate change humber bridge mr gardiner explained that drax is working with the humber local enterprise partnership and other interested parties to explore the role carbon capture utilisation and storage ccus can play in turning the humber estuary into the worlds first netzerocarbon cluster by 2040 the humber is strategically important  it is the most carbon intensive industrial cluster in the uk the deployment of a new technology like ccus could be most transformational there  reducing carbon emissions extending the life of carbon intensive businesses protecting jobs and creating growth mr gardiner explained new technologies are already transforming the way we live and work  they are changing businesses and communities and have

commerce annual conference panel event at 1140am on thursday march 28 2019 titled fuelling an economy fit for the future the british chambers of commerce includes 53 accredited chambers which make up its network representing tens of thousands of businesses of all shapes and sizes which employ almost six million people across the uk the new climate economy report by the global commission on the climate and economy states that analysis showed that bold action could yield a direct economic gain of us26 trillion through to 2030 compared with businessasusual and this is likely to be a conservative estimate beccs is a vital technology in the fight against climate change the royal society and royal academy of engineering have estimated that beccs could enable the uk to capture approximately 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that we will need to capture to become net zero power generation with beccs could also provide essential system services to the uk power grid meaning a more secure costeffective electricity system the humber is ideally located for accessing offshore stores for carbon dioxide in the north sea such as the endurance field which is roughly 60 miles off the coast as well as working with the humber lep drax is in discussions with the bbpa about the possibility of its members using the carbon captured to help keep the fizz in the drinks industry and it is looking at how its co 2 could be used in the creation of synthetic fuels drax power station is the largest renewable power generator in the country  producing enough renewable electricity for more than four million households the conversion of two thirds of the power station from coal to use sustainable biomass has played an important role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world whilst maintaining secure supplies for the millions of homes and businesses which rely on it more renewables like wind and solar are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and helping us to meet our climate targets  but flexible lower carbon generation is also vital for controlling the costs of maintaining a stable low carbon power system the ipcc recognised in its special report last year that to meet our climate change targets up to 85 of global power generation needs to come from renewables by 2050 this means the remainder will have to be provided by flexible sources which can support the system and help to keep costs down  such as biomass hydro pumped storage as well as high

barlow next to drax power station near selby it was the last of three giant airships to be built in the village which was at the forefront of the british aviation industry for ten years from the first world war the r33 was one of a small number of socalled gas bags flown by the royal naval air service  it clocked up more than 237 hours of flying time and was in service for 10 years completing military and civilian tasks including being used by the police to monitor traffic leading the way in aviation technology the r33 took innovation to new levels when it was used to trial launching pilotless biplanes from underneath its huge canopy the site of the workshop where the r33 was designed and built is now known as the barlow mound which is on the edge of the 350acre skylark nature reserve created by drax next to the power station on april 24 youngsters will be able to build a replica r33 airship at a special workshop being held at the skylark nature reserve the event is part of

yorkshire via getty images  the r33 earned itself a reputation for being the luckiest airship after it survived two almost disastrous incidents firstly it was ripped open during a flight in 1921 and then was torn free from its moorings in high winds drifted out to sea and had to be guided back to land by its crew its luck ran out when the airships popularity declined it was dismantled in 1928 the

opportunities created by multi awardwinning power station rail project press releases the partnership between drax power station near selby in north yorkshire and davis wagon services saw a new fleet of freight wagons designed and built by wh davis ltd to deliver the biomass needed to produce renewable electricity for millions of homes it also enabled davis wagon services a north lincolnshirebased rail firm to invest 850000 in revamping a mothballed ferrybridge rail yard as a dedicated site to rebrand and maintain the power stations fleet of 225 unique freight wagons securing local jobs in the process the project has now won the asset management and excellence category in the rail business awards  its second accolade in the last six months  and the managing directorof davis wagon services says that due to the backing from drax there are now opportunities to extend the maintenance work at ferrybridge creating more jobs im immensely proud of the team here and at drax for what we have achieved working together said john hall md of davis the success of the project has given huge confidence to our people and the business we can now look at fully utilising the yard and taking on heavier maintenance which could reduce the need to outsource work that would bring immediate benefits both in reducing our carbon footprint as we could do the work onsite so we wouldnt have to send wagons elsewhere and also in securing the employment we currently have and creating more roles in the future lr jake berry andy koss and john hall drax power ceo andy koss said im delighted this project is receiving the industry recognition it deserves not only has it supported a local business and revitalised a disused facility within the northern powerhouse region but these rail wagons also

2011 when drax appointed wh davis along with lloyds register rail ricardo to design and develop bespoke rail wagons to ferry biomass to the power station the largest decarbonisation project in europe it also saw davis wagon services take on the work to maintain the 225 wagons and the firm is now rebranding the fleet over the next 18 months with new livery featuring both drax and the northern powerhouse logos since converting two thirds of its generators to use biomass instead of coal drax power station has become the largest decarbonisation project in europe  it now produces enough renewable electricity for four million homes the majority of the biomass drax uses comes from north america and europe on ships to ports on the east and west coasts of the uk immingham hull port of tyne and liverpool it is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day over a sixday working week in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 15 per cent of the uks renewable electricity each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the uk with enough electricity for a year the fuel is transported to drax via rail rather than road to further reduce carbon emissions as it is more efficient than road transportation using rail saves approximately 270000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 3262250 tonnes of c02 per year independent research by oxford economics using 2017 data showed that drax supported over 17500 jobs across the country  more than 6000 of which
