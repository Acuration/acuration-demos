climate policy forests and biomass transport contact us how sustainable biomass crosses the atlantic to power the nation the story of how the renewable fuel powering the uk makes its way from louisiana to north yorkshire 21 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels manufactured in china  imports that ensure we have readily available access to power on our shores share related stories sustainable
