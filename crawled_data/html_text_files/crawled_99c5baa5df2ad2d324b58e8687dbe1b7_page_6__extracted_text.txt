a recordbreaking green year but the spiralling cost of fossil fuels led power prices to almost double renewable power generated more than twofifths 40 of the countrys electricity for the first time  helping to cut carbon emissions by 27 million tonnes britain exported more power to europe than ever before making it a net exporter of electricity for the first time in over a decade academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights commissioned via imperial consultants analysed the data which highlights the turbulence that britains electricity system has endured amid an unprecedented year for the energy industry renewable power sources  wind solar biomass and hydro  generated 40 of the countrys electricity in 2022  up from 35 in 2021 helping to cut co 2 emissions from the power sector by 27 million tonnes compared to the previous year overall generation from renewables has more than quadrupled over the last decade at one stage during may renewables provided 728 of power to the grid whilst wind farms generated a landmark 20gw of electricity for the first time  the maximum output from wind is now up by a third compared to four years ago  despite the record supply of cheap renewable electricity the unprecedented rise in the cost of gas following russias invasion of ukraine sent power prices to a new alltime high the fossil fuel supplied 42 of the countrys power this year its largest share of the fuel mix since 2016  britain is on course to have annual average wholesale price above 200 per mwh for the first time ever in 2022  up from 113 the year before this is nearly six times higher than the cost of electricity in 2020 34 per mwh the price mwh of fossil fuels over the last three years relative to their averages from 201019 dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report series said this has been a year like no other for the energy industry the public are feeling the pain of high gas prices on their energy bills even though renewables are providing the grid with more cheap green electricity than ever before the lesson from 2022 is that we need to break our addiction to fossil fuels once and for all if we want lower cost and more secure energy supplies if we had not invested in wind solar and biomass over the last decade our energy bills would have been even higher as would the risk of blackouts over winter the energy crisis cannot be solved by increasing our reliance on gas imported from abroad we need to turbocharge our investment in clean energy technologies to become europes renewable electricity powerhouse which will cut fuel bills at home and bring money into the economy by exporting power to our neighbouring countries for the first time in more than a decade britain is a net exporter of electricity to its european neighbours electricity exports quadrupled from last year to 172 twh of electricity  generating around 31bn for the uk economy the country exported a net total of 19twh representing a dramatic swing in power trading from the previous year when britain instead imported a net total of 229twh share of british electricity that was imported and exported each quarter will gardiner drax group ceo said drax plays a critical role in supporting the uk energy system generating more renewable power by output than any other

european countries such as germany are leading the way in slashing their demand for gas according to drax electric insights the uk is showing no signs of changing its gas consumption levels with an exceptionally mild autumn leading to its modest reductions yearonyear households could save up to 200 by turning down their thermostat by just 1c and save the government 3bn in funding the energy price guarantee the independent analysis by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights commissioned via imperial consultants shows that the uks gas reduction yearonyear was outpaced by germany france italy and spain  with demand for gas actually rising in britain in september compared to previous years change in natural gas consumption versus the previous three years in uk and comparable european countries data covers all sectors excluding power generation and are not adjusted for weather differences what reduction there was in gas use in the uk was attributable to unseasonably warm weather rather than people adjusting their behaviour the analysis for drax electric insights showed that from september through to end of november britains gas demand was just 03 lower than would have been expected preenergy crisis when accounting for weather anomalies daily natural gas consumption in uk versus expectations the blue line shows the seasonal average for all end users except power generation over 10 years to 2020 the yellow line adjusts for weather showing what demand would be with precrisis behaviour the black line shows actual consumption dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report said the uk is an outlier on the world stage showing no signs of reducing its appetite for gas during a time of dramatically higher prices if temperatures continue to drop during the festive season managing the energy crisis will be both more difficult and expensive unless people and businesses break their addiction to gas turning the thermostat down by just 1c would save households up to 200 a year on their energy bills and save the uk from importing 50twh of natural gas over the winter  cutting the cost of the governments energy price guarantee by 3bn on the continent national governments have introduced demand reduction measures alongside information campaigns to inspire the public and businesses to act in germany public buildings have turned down their thermostats to 19c and outside illuminated advertising must be turned off between 10pm until 6am the uk government has now launched

underway at its existing cruachan facility in scotland where the company plans to build a new 600 mw underground plant a 70m deep borehole is being drilled to recover rock core which will be analysed in a lab to determine structural and geological stability for elements of the new plant the preliminary works are being carried out whilst the project awaits consent from the scottish government alongside an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government a worker inspects rock core samples scaled increasing the uks pumped storage hydro capacity is critical to enabling more renewable power to come online strengthening the countrys energy security whilst helping britain decarbonise ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said this is a significant moment in the expansion of cruachan the project team has been working extremely hard to move the development forward and the start of ground investigation works is the next phase in delivering this vitally important new plant the scale of the proposed development matches draxs ambitions when it comes to tackling the climate crisis more than 2 million tonnes of rock will be excavated to create a new cavern inside the mountain which will be big enough to house big ben on its side expanding cruachan will strengthen the uks energy security by enabling more homegrown renewable electricity to come online to power homes and businesses across the country this major infrastructure project will support hundreds of jobs and provide a real boost to the scottish economy the new underground 600 mw plant would be one of the largest infrastructure projects carried out in scotland for many years with drax expecting the plant to come online in 2030 following a sixyear period of construction and an investment of around 500m the works are a major step forward for the development pumped storage hydro plants act like giant water batteries using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from wind farms and other low carbon technologies when supply outstrips demand these same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when it is needed in order to deploy this critical technology drax must secure consent from the scottish government alongside an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the existing lack of an appropriate framework for new longduration largescale electricity storage technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation ends picture captions top image caption a 70mdeep
