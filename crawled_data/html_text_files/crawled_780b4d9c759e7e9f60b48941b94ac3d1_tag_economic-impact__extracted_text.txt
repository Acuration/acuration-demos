economic impact the jobs needed to build a net zero energy future 11 november 2021 sustainable business many components are needed to tackle climate change and reach environmental milestones such as meeting the goals of the paris agreement one of those components is the right workforce large enough and with the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the green energy jobs of a lowcarbon future in 2020 the renewable energy sector employed 115 million people around the world but as the industry continues to expand that workforce will only grow last year a national grid report found that in the uk alone 120000 jobs will need to be filled in the lowcarbon energy sector by 2030  to meet the countrys climate objectives that figure is expected to rise to 400000 by 2050 the uk energy sector as a whole currently supports 738000 jobs and much of this workforce already has the skills needed for a low carbon society  others can be reskilled and retrained helping to bolster the future workforce by supporting employees through the green transition at a global level energy sector jobs are expected to increase from 18 million to 26 million by 2050  jobs that will span the full energy spectrum from researching and advising on lowcarbon solutions to installing and implementing them here are some of the roles that will be key to the lowcarbon energy transformation a wind farm under construction off the english coast wind turbine technicians according to the international energy agency iea wind power is this year set for a 17 increase in global energy generation compared to 2020 the biggest increase of any renewable power source the iea also forecasts that wind power will need to grow tenfold by 2050 if the world is to meet the goals of the paris agreement its not surprising therefore that wind turbine technicians  the professionals who install inspect maintain and repair wind turbines  are in high demand in the us wind turbine technician is the fastestgrowing job in the country  with 68 growth projected over the 20202030 period  to give just one example in the uk many wind turbine technicians have a background in engineering or experience from the wider energy sector although there are wind turbine technician and maintenance courses available they are not a prerequisite and many employers offer apprenticeships and onthejob training  smoothing the path for energy professionals to transition into the role solar panel installers today solar photovoltaic solar pv is the biggest global employer in renewable energy accounting for 38 million jobs  the iea also reported a 23 uptick in solar pv installations around the world in 2020 in the uk there are currently 132 gigawatts gw of installed solar power capacity  trade association solar energy uk predicts this will need to rise to at least 40 gw by 2030 if the uk is to succeed in becoming a net zero economy by 2050 the trade association believes this could see the creation of 13000 new solar energy jobs solar panel installers  who carry out the important job of installing and maintaining solar pv  are essential to a lowcarbon future many solar panel installers in the uk come from a background in electrical installation or have transitioned from engineering while there are training courses specifically designed for solar panel installers they are not a necessity particularly if you already have onthejob experience in a relevant sector this makes a move to becoming a solar panel installer relatively easy for someone already working in energy or with a mind for engineering energy consultants businesses of all kinds must play a role in the transition to net zero organisations must be able to manage their energy use and begin switching to renewable sources as professionals who advise companies on this process renewable energy consultants are a key part of the green energy workforce aspects of the job include identifying how organisations use their electric assets and helping businesses optimise those assets to build responsiveness and flexibility into energyintensive operations the core responsibilities of a renewable energy consultant are to reduce a companys environmental impact while helping the business reduce energy costs and identifying opportunities carbon accountants a growing number of businesses are setting targets for reducing their greenhouse gas ghg emissions but thats only possible if you can first determine what your ghg emissions are and where they come from which is where the relatively young field of carbon accounting comes in through what is known as physical carbon accounting companies can assess the emissions their activities generate and where in the supply chain the emissions are occurring this allows businesses to implement more accurate actions and be realistic in their timelines for reducing emissions on a wider scale accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in certifying emissions reductions or abatement as well as in the distribution of carbon credits or penalties as whole economies push towards net zero battery technology researchers energy storage is essential to a lowcarbon energy future  the ability to store and release energy from intermittent sources such as wind and solar will be crucial in meeting demand and balancing a renewablesdriven grid while many forms of energy storage already exist  developing electric batteries that can be deployed at scale is still a comparatively new and expanding area global patenting activities in the field of batteries and other electricity storage increased at an annual rate of 14  four times faster than the average for technology  between 2005 and 2018 however its estimated that to meet climate objectives the world will need nearly 10000 gw hours of battery and other electricity storage by 2040 this is 50 times the current level and research and innovation will be crucial to delivering bigger and more efficient batteries farmers and foresters how we use and manage land will be important in lowering carbon emissions and creating a sustainable future for people and the planet crops like corn sugarcane and soybean can serve as feedstock for biofuel and bioenergy and farming byproducts such as cow manure can be used in the development of biofuel techniques adopted in the agricultural sector will also be important in optimising soil sequestration capabilities while ensuring it is nutrientrich enough to grow food these techniques include the use of biochar  a solid form of charcoal produced by heating biomass without oxygen research indicates that biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for centuries or longer it also helps soil retain water and could contribute to reducing the use of fertilisers by making the soil more nutrientdense forests meanwhile provide material for industries like construction the byproducts from which can serve as feedstock for woody biomass primarily in the shape of lowgrade wood that would otherwise remain unused sustainably managed forests such as those from which drax sources its biomass have twofold importance they both enable woody biomass for bioenergy and ensure co 2 is removed from the atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle biofuel engineers and scientists farmers and foresters provide feedstock for biofuels but its biofuel scientists and engineers who research develop and enhance them opening the door to alternative fuels for vehicles heating and even jet engines according to the iea production of biofuel that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector grew 6 in 2019 however the organisation forecasts that production will need to increase 10 annually until 2030 to be in line with paris agreement climate targets scientific innovations that can help boost the production of biofuel around the world therefore continues to be vital as is the work of biofuel engineers who assess and improve existing biofuel systems and develop new ones that can replace fossil fuels like petrol and diesel the wealth of knowledge around fuels in the oil and gas industries means there is ample opportunity for scientists and engineers who work with fossil fuels to bring their skills to crucial lowcarbon roles geologists the overriding goal of the paris agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2 and preferably to 15 degrees celsius compared to preindustrial levels this is an objective the iea has said will be  virtually impossible to fulfil without carbon capture and storage ccs technologies ccs entails capturing co 2 and transporting it for safe and permanent underground storage in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas fields coal seams and saline aquifers according to the global ccs institute the world will need a 100fold increase on the 27 ccs project currently in operation by 2050 knowledge and research into rock types formations and reactivity will be important in helping identify sites deep underground that can be used for safe permanent carbon storage and sequestration skills and expertise gained in the oil and gas industries will allow professionals in these sectors to make the switch from careers in fossil fuel to roles that help power a net zero economy employees working at drax power station chemists the role of chemists is also vital to decarbonisation knowledge and research around co 2 is a potent force in the effort to reduce and remove it from the atmosphere technologies like ccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage becss  and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs  are based around such research carbon capture processes are chemical reactions between emissions streams and solvents often based on amines and ghgs understanding and controlling these processes makes chemistry a key component of delivering carbon capture at the scale needed to help meet climate targets chemists role in decarbonisation is far from limited to carbon capture methods from battery technology to reforestation chemists understanding of the elements can help drive action against climate change bringing together disciplines tackling climate change on the scale needed to achieve the aims of the paris agreement depends on collaboration between industries countries and disciplines decarbonisation projects such as the uks east coast cluster which encompasses both zero carbon humber and net zero teesside fuse engineering and construction jobs with scientific and academic work zero carbon humber which brings together 12 organisations including drax is expected to create as many as 47800 jobs in the region by 2027  among these are construction sector jobs for welders pipefitters machine installers and technicians in addition indirect jobs are predicted to be created across supply chains from material manufacturing to the logistics of supporting a workforce meeting climate challenges and delivering projects on the scale of zero carbon humber depends on creating an energy workforce that combines the knowledge of the past with the green energy skills of the future draxs apprenticeships have readied workers for the energy sector for decades and will continue to do so as we build a lowcarbon future options include fouryear technical apprenticeships in mechanical electrical and control and instrumentation engineering getting onthejob training and practical experience apprentices receive a nationally recognised qualification such as a btec or an nvq level 3 at the end of the programme apprentices at drax power station 2021 the workforce needed to make low carbon societies a reality will be a diverse one  stretching from apprentices to experienced professionals with a background in traditional or renewable energy it will also span every aspect of the renewable energy field from the chemists and biofuel scientists who develop key technologies to the solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians who fit and maintain the necessary equipment the skills needed to take on these roles are already plentiful in the uk and around the world overcoming challenges on the road to net zero

develop net zero technologies accenture and world economic forum report says humber could decarbonise quicker than any other uk industrial region mitsubishi heavy industries partners with drax supplying its advanced carbon capture technology making millions of tonnes of negative emissions possible at drax power station this decade deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs in the 2020s will have positive spillover for a net zero economy says frontier economics delaying beccs until the 2030s argues baringa research could increase energy system costs by 45bn planning consent process for beccs at drax from 2027 is underway with public consulted drax and bechtel studying global beccs deployments around the world governments industries and societies have begun to set themselves targets for reaching net zero but it is at home in the uk where real progress is starting to be made in answering some of the tougher challenges posed by the global environmental crisis eyebrows were raised when the uk set itself one of the most stretching timeframes in which to decarbonise but like many business leaders i am firmly of the belief that this ambitious target will be the catalyst to deliver the innovative thinking needed to get the planet to where it needs to be i was delighted to learn recently that government has awarded the zero carbon humber partnership 75 million in funding to develop worldleading net zero technologies mhi beccs pilot plant within ccus incubation area drax power station north yorkshire drax was one of the founder members of the partnership and its goal is to build the worlds first net zero industrial cluster and decarbonise the north of england along with the other members we worked hard to secure this government support and it consists of money from the department for business energy  industrial strategys industrial decarbonisation challenge fund with two thirds coming from private backing this financing is a vote of confidence from investors and highlights the governments commitment to developing the worlds first zerocarbon industrial cluster in the region projects of this scale backed with meaningful funding are key to accelerating a range of technologies that will be essential to advancing decarbonisation these include hydrogen production carbon capture usage and storage ccus and negative emissions through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs but more than just having a positive effect on reducing emissions delivering this in the humber will also support clean economic growth and futureproof vital industries biomass storage domes and water cooling towers at drax power station in north yorkshire i believe that in a similar way to how renewables have made huge strides in helping decarbonise power a range of new technologies are now needed to decarbonise industry and industrial regions our work as a partnership in the humber is establishing a landmark project for the uk and the worlds journey to net zero and clean growth reaching net zero depends on a diverse range of technologies there are many factors that will be essential for the world to reach net zero  but perhaps none more important than open collaboration and integration government industry and individual businesses will need to work together and share learnings and infrastructure to be able to make true progress this collaboration will of course take many forms but one that is crucially important is industrial clusters such as zero carbon humber and neighbouring net zero teesside a recent report by accenture highlighted how vital decarbonising industrial regions will be to reaching climate goals industrial carbon dioxide co 2  emissions account for as much as 11 gigatonnes or 30 of global greenhouse gas emissions ghg however the report also highlights the opportunities both environmental and economic in decarbonising clusters the market for global industrial efficiency alone is expected to receive investments worth as much as 40bn while the global hydrogen market was estimated at around 175bn in 2019 the humber is the uks largest cluster by industrial emissions emitting 10 million tonnes of co 2 per year  more than 2 of the uks total ghg emissions pioneering projects around hydrogen production ccus and negative emissions through beccs are all ready to scale in the region beginning the task of reducing and removing emissions the potential benefit to the regional economy could also be significant  its estimated these technologies could create 48000 direct indirect and induced jobs in the humber region by 2027 this new 75 million in funding will allow work to gather pace on these transformational projects the funding will be used to obtain land rights and begin frontend engineering design feed for the hydrogen facility at h2h saltend as well as onshore pipeline infrastructure for co 2 and hydrogen it marks the beginning of the vital work of putting transportation systems in place that will take captured co 2 from drax power stations beccs generating units and permanently store it under the southern north seas bed draxs beccs power generation is one of zero carbon humbers anchor projects our recently confirmed partnership with mitsubishi heavy industries mhi will see its advanced km cdr carbon capture technology deployed at drax power station the negative emissions that this longterm agreement will make possible will enable the region to reduce its emissions faster than any other uk cluster according to accenture  developing negative emissions through beccs will help us achieve our ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 by that time drax power station could remove 8 million tonnes of co 2 from the atmosphere each year playing a major part in helping the uk meet its climate goals from beccs to a net zero uk in march 2021 drax kickstarted the process to gain the necessary planning permissions called a development consent order dco from the government  its a crucial administrative step towards delivering a beccs unit as early as 2027 and a landmark moment in developing negative emissions in the uk a report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary step on the uks path to decarbonisation developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would also have positive spillover effects that can contribute to wider decarbonisation and a net zero economy these include learnings and efficiencies that come from developing and operating the countrys first beccs power station as well as transport and storage infrastructure which will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects however the benefits of acting quickly and pioneering beccs deployment at scale can only be achieved if policy is put in place to enable the right business models for beccs and negative emissions according to the frontier report intervention is needed to instil confidence in investors while also protecting consumer energy prices from spikes inside mhi pilot carbon capture plant drax power station failure to implement negative emissions through beccs could also be costly time is of the essence for the uk to reach net zero by 2050 and research by energy consultancy baringa  commissioned by drax highlights the economic cost of hesitation findings showed that delaying beccs from 2027 to 2030 could increase energy system costs by more than 45bn over the coming decade and over 5bn by the time the uk has to reach net zero i believe what we are developing at drax can become a worldleading and exportable solution for largescale carbon negative power generation the potential in negative emissions is economic as well as environmental protecting thousands of jobs in the uks carbonintensive industries as well as overseas beccs offers great potential for the uk to export skills knowledge and equipment to an international market to help establish this market we are working with engineering and construction project management firm bechtel to explore locations globally where there is the opportunity to deploy beccs and identify how newbuild beccs plants can be optimised to deliver negative emissions for those regions pictured lr kentaro hosomi chief regional officer emea mitsubishi heavy industries mhi jenny blyth project analyst drax group at drax power station north yorkshire carl clayton head of beccs drax group multiple government and independent organisations have highlighted how essential negative emissions are to reaching net zero in the uk as well as global climate goals the recently formed coalition for negative emissions aims to advance this vital industry at a global scale by uniting a range of negative emissions providers and users from across industries we can make it a more powerful force for decarbonisation and sustainable growth it will still be a long journey towards the uks goals but the governments funding for zero carbon humber the

officer drax group 11 december 2020 opinion december 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of the paris agreement it represented a landmark moment in the global effort to combat climate change and build a better future  however global progress is not moving at the speed it needs to in order to meet the treatys target of keeping global warming below 152 degrees celsius explore carbon capture by drax countries have set their own decarbonisation targets and many companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative  as we at drax intend to achieve by 2030  while these leading ambitions are important for the uk and the world to meet the goals of the paris agreement real action polices and investment are needed at scale we have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago we know from the recent 6 th carbon budget that renewable energy as well as carbon capture usage and storage ccus are essential for the uk to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in that detailed 1000page report  the climate change committee ccc was clear that progress must be made immediately  the country as a whole must be 78 of the way there by 2035 by investing where its needed the uk can lead the world in a whole new industry one that may come to define the next century  leading the world in decarbonisation it was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the uk to launch the industrial revolution some 250 years ago today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world as a country  one that i moved to over 20 years ago now  we have decarbonised at a greater pace than any other over the past decade investing in renewable generation such as wind solar and biomass has allowed the uk to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for net zero emissions  to remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future power grids will require vastly increased support from energy storage systems such as pumped hydro  as well as flexible reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation however the urgency of climate change means the uk must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing negative emissions technologies which remove more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit the ccc as well as national grids future energy scenarios report have emphasised the necessity of negative emissions for the uk to reach net zero  by removing co 2 not just from energy but other industries too the uk can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cuttingedge green technology that can take the country to net zero establishing it as a world leader for others to follow creating an industry exporting it to the world when the paris agreement was signed i was just joining drax i had been impressed by the power stations transformation from coal to biomass  europes largest decarbonisation project  supporting

whether powering homes across britain or helping stabilise the national grid  drax power stations impact to our electricity network is far reaching but it doesnt stop at generating and supplying power a new report by oxford economics  commissioned by drax has found that in addition to its important role powering britain drax group also provides an economic boost to areas across the country here are three ways drax group contributed to the uk economy in 2016 167 billion added to uk gdp drax group contributed an estimated 167 billion to uk gross domestic product gdp in 2016 an increase from 124 billion in 2015  of that figure 301 million was added directly  as a result of the groups own activities such as the generating and selling of power and while this is an impressive 61 increase on 2015 the numbers are even more significant when looking at the benefit beyond the groups core activities in 2016 drax groups spending with external suppliers such as rail freight wagon manufacturer wh davis and imserv  which supplies automated meter reading technology to opus energy reached 872 million a further 36m was spent by these suppliers across their own supply chain to help them provide their services to drax there is an even greater impact when considering how this money filters through employees and suppliers into local retail leisure and service economies something which is especially important when the number of jobs drax supports is taken into account 18500 jobs supported across the country drax group directly employed more than 2000 people in 2016 but across the country it supports far more  18500 a significant increase from the 14150 of 2015 these jobs are primarily in highskilled manufacturing engineering construction it professional business services and transport while 3650 of these were in drax power stations native yorkshire and humber area this year saw the groups overall impact extend much further an i mpact beyond the northern powerhouse roughly
