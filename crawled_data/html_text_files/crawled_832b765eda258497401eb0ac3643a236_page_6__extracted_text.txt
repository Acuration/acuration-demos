biomass energy the uk needs negative emissions from beccs to reach net zero  heres why 7 april 2020 carbon capture reaching the uks target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 means every aspect of the economy from shops to super computers must reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate agreement beccs has the potential to play a vital role in power generation creating a hydrogen economy and offsetting other emissions as it continues to progress it is becoming increasingly effective and cost efficient offering a key component of a net zero uk learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting

has been neglected over many years due to political and ownership changes management of state and corporate owned forests is now good but some small privatelyowned areas of forest are still poorly managed despite this both the forest area and the growing stock have been increasing largely due to new planting and the maturing age class of existing forest forest area has increased from 49 to 52 of the total land increasing by more than 118 thousand hectares since 2010 land use in estonia click to viewdownload over the same period the growing stock increased by 52 million m 3  with 60 of this growth in softwood and 40 in hardwood species the data shows a slight decline in 2018 but this is due to a sampling error and the growing stock is thought to have been maintained at 2017 levels this should be rectified in the 2019 data when available change in forest growing stock  estonia click to viewdownload the forests of estonia have been going through a period of restitution since the 1990s land that had been taken into state ownership during soviet rule has been given back to private owners this process was complex and lengthy and limited active management in the forest during this time since 2008 harvesting and management has increased private and corporate forest owners have been harvesting forest that had been mature and ready for clear felling the longerterm harvesting trend has been considerably lower than annual growth increment and the maximum sustainable harvesting level as shown on the chart below annual increment and harvesting levels click to viewdownload in 2018 harvesting reached an all time high at just over 14 million m 3 and just under the maximum threshold it is expected to remain at this level as more forest matures and enters the cycle of harvest and regeneration harvesting type by volume click to viewdownload harvesting type by area click to viewdownload clear cutting regeneration felling is the largest operation by volume but thinning maintenance felling is the largest by area this indicates a forest landscape in balance with widespread thinning to produce more sawlog trees and a large volume of clear cuts in the mature stands to make way for the next generation of forests reforestation in estonia  note since 2014 it has not been compulsory for private and other forest owners to submit reforestation data click to viewdownload planting of seedlings is the most common form of regeneration however some native hardwood species are strong pioneers and naturally regenerate among the spruce and pine stands this has led to a change in the species composition of some forests with an increase in hardwoods although this is relatively small scale and only prevalent among some small private owners that do not invest in clearing unwanted regeneration species mix in estonian forests click to viewdownload markets and prices for forest products sunrise and fog over forest landscape in estonia pulpwood markets are limited in estonia and this material has been historically exported to neighbouring finland and sweden export demand has had a significant impact on prices as can be seen in a spike in 2018 when demand was at its strongest the forest industry has been dominated by sawmills and panel board mills demand and production in this sector has been increasing and this has kept prices high there is a substantial differential between sawlog and pulpwood pricing comparison of sawlog and pulpwood prices click to viewdownload the pellet industry developed due to the abundance of lowgrade fibre

resources forest area  forest cover no negative impact regardless of increasing domestic biomass utilisation for energy and exports forest area has increased due to afforestation programmes forest cover is not as high as forest area due to temporarily unstocked area after clearcut despite this forest cover has continuously increased from 20102018 growing stock no negative impact the total forest growing stock has been increasing for the last two decades in 2018 the growth slowed or halted official statistics show a decrease but this is due to sampling error in 2018 there was recordhigh wood demand from finland which was driven by high global pulp prices motivating maximal pulp production this increased harvests to a previously unseen level harvesting levels slight increasing impact during 20042011 harvesting levels in estonia were less than half of the estimated maximum sustainable level this resulted in an increase in the maximum sustainable harvesting level for the 20112020 period in 2018 the harvesting volumes were at the maximum sustainable level the main drivers increasing the harvesting volumes have been increased sawmill capacity and production high demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden and improved demand for energy wood this was a temporary peak and demand has already slowed softwood lumber prices have decreased significantly in europe due to an abundance of wood supply from central europe which has been created by widespread bark beetle and other forest damages global pulp prices have also decreased to below 2017 prices forest growth  carbon sequestration potential ambivalent impact the annual increment has grown throughout the 20002018 period increased fuelwood price has enabled forest management in some of the alder forests that were completely unutilised in the past thinnings both commercial and precommercial accelerate longterm volume growth in forests leading to increased carbon sequestration removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels utilisation of sawmill byproducts does not directly impact forests carbon sequestration potential but it can increase harvesting through improved sawmill overall profitability impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to forest management practices rotation lengths neutral forest law regulates minimum forest age for clearcuts according to interviews riigimetsa majandamise keskus rmk  the estonian state forest company often conducts the final felling at the minimum age due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations at least in statemanaged forests in forests that are older than the minimum final felling age sawlog price is a more important driver for finalfelling decisions than woodbased bioenergy demand thinning increasing impact the increase of bioenergy demand has increased the demand for smalldiameter hardwood which in turn has increased thinnings in previously unmanaged forest stands this will increase the availability of good quality sawlogs and will also accelerate the carbon sequestration tonneshayear of the forests however the total forest carbon stock tonnesha will be reduced in unmanaged eg no thinnings mature stands the carbon stock is larger than in managed

2025 deadline by using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on we have also played a significant role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world having pioneered groundbreaking biomass technology were now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030 making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis stopping using coal is the right decision for our business our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees which will be difficult for them and their families in making the decision to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy its vital that the impact on people across the north is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that people have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future coal in front of biomass storage domes at drax power station 2016 drax will shortly commence a consultation process with employees and trade unions with a view to ending coal operations under these proposals commercial generation from coal will end in march 2021 but the two coal units will remain available to meet capacity market obligations until september 2022 the closure of the two coal units is expected to involve oneoff closure costs in the region of 2535 million in the period to closure and to result in a reduction in operating costs at drax power station of 2535 million per year once complete drax also expects a reduction in jobs of between 200 and 230 from april 2021 the carrying value of the fixed assets affected by closure was 240 million in addition to 103 million of inventory at 31 december 2019 which drax intends to use in the period up to 31 march 2021 the group expects to treat all closure costs and any asset obsolescence charges as exceptional items in the groups

pellet mills can help landowners grow healthy forests 29 january 2020 sustainable bioenergy international papers pulp and paper mill located in the morehouse parish of louisiana had been in operation since 1927 and was once the largest employer in the area however as a result of the global recession of 2008 the company was forced to lay off over 550 employees and shut the facility other mills in the area have also reduced production including georgia pacific which let go around 530 people at its crossett arkansas plant 18 miles to the north of morehouse in 2019 for an area dominated by forests such as northern louisiana and southern arkansas this decline in traditional markets came as a serious blow its a region where a healthy market for wood products is vital for the local economy and in turn the health of the regions forests luckily other wood product manufacturers and industries have since began to fill the gap engineers in front of wood pellet storage silos at draxs morehouse bioenergy biomass manufacturing facility in northern louisiana drax biomass has opened a mill in morehouse parish that uses some of the the lowgrade wood previously used to supply the paper industry to produce compressed wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity in the uk commissioned in 2015 the plant employs 74 people and can produce as much as 525000 metric tonnes of biomass pellets a year this makes it an important facility for local employment and the wood market in the region however to ensure it is positively contributing to the area and its environment the demand for wood must be sustainably managed morehouse bioenergy sources lowgrade wood from a catchment area that covers a 60mile radius and includes 18 counties in arkansas and four in louisiana as drax biomass doesnt own any of the forests it sources wood products from it regularly examines the environmental impact of its pellet mills on the forests and markets in which it operates the aim is to ensure the biomass used by drax to generate 12 of great britains renewable electricity is sustainably sourced and does not contribute to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts a new report by forestry research and consulting firm forisk evaluates the impact of biomass pellet demand from morehouse bioenergy on the forests and wood markets within the mills catchment area map of pulpwoodusing mills near morehouse timber market it found that biomass demand in the region does not contribute to deforestation  nor increase forest harvesting above a sustainable level overall growth of the regions pine timberland which supplies morehouse bioenergy continues to exceed removals pointing to expanding forest carbon and wood inventory annual growth compared to harvesting removals growing forests and increasing timber stocks the study focuses on timberland  working forests  in the plants sourcing area which the us forestry service categorises as productive land capable of providing timber on an industrial scale the timberland here is made up of 63 softwood trees which includes pines and 37 hardwoods such as oak pellet manufacturing as a whole including other pellet producers in the area accounts for only 6 of the demand for wood products in the region of that morehouse bioenergy contributes to 4 of total pellet demand total area of timberland lumber  such as sawtimber  makes up the bulk of demand for wood products accounting for 46 of total demand largely as a result of its high market value and landowners aims to extract maximum revenue from their pine stands however the less valuable wood  parts of trees that are misshapen too short or thin to be used for lumber  can be sold at a lower price to biomass pellet mills this wood might previously have been sold to paper and pulp mills exclusively but with international papers departure morehouse bioenergy now fills a part of that role total volume of growing stock on timberland maintaining healthy markets for both high and lowvalue wood is key to enabling landowners to reforest areas once they have been harvested in the knowledge it will provide a valuable return in the future ultimately however the way forests are maintained depends on the individual landowners and how they want to use their land the advantages of corporate ownership morehouse bioenergys catchment area covers 28000 square kilometres of timberland within which 96 of the timber is privately owned while some of that is owned by families with small patches of productive land 54 is held by corporate owners this includes businesses such as real estate investment trusts reits and timber investment management organisations timos which advise institutional investors on how to manage their forest assets this high percentage of corporate ownership influences forest management and replanting as owners look to maximise the value of forests and seek to continue to generate returns from their land in general corporate owners are spending more money on silviculture and actively managing their timber stands explains forisk consulting partner amanda lang they are investing more in fertiliser their seedlings and harvest control on pine stands because that leads to larger trees of a higher quality and more profit in the long run this is reflected in the higher growth rates found in the private sector leading to faster rates of carbon sequestration annual growth per hectare by owner type smaller private landowners meanwhile may have other objectives for their land like recreation and hunting in addition to timber income as a result some owners may be less inclined to intensively manage their timber stands forgoing fertilisation and competition control due to cost and might harvest on a less regular basis although these landowners may not be maximising the productivity of their timber resource to the same degree corporate owners do their unique management often contribute to greater diversity on the landscape demand and forest health in 2018 the annual average price for a metric tonne of pine sawtimber in morehouse bioenergys catchment area was 2571 down from a 10year high of 3160 in 2010 similarly pine pulpwood from which biomass pellets are made was valued at 775 per metric tonne in 2018 down from a 10year high of 13 in 2010 these low wood prices have caused many landowners to delay harvesting forests in hopes for a more lucrative wood price as a result pine timber inventories have grown across morehouse bioenergys catchment area in 2010 the us forest service counted more than 167 million metric tonnes of pine inventory by 2018 this had increased by more than 35 to reach 226 million morehouse bioenergy market historic stumpage prices metric tonne the report suggests this price slump is an ongoing result of the 2008 recession which greatly affected us house construction  one of the primary uses of sawtimber and many other types of wood products in

morehouse bioenergys catchment area is expected to begin reversing in 2024 or 2025 as lang explains we expect inventories to increase for a few more years and then start to decline that said inventories will remain higher than prerecession levels while high inventories suggest an abundant resource lower inventory volumes are not indicative of declining or unhealthy forests rather they can point to younger growing forests that have recently been replanted which will later grow to higher inventory volumes as they mature both suggest a healthy forestry industry in which landowners continue to reinvest in forests overall the analysis of the region points to healthy growing forests and importantly a sustainable industry from which drax can responsibly source biomass pellets

one shows a forest area in balance less than one shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing

john krebs deputy chair virginia dale sam fankhauser elena schmidt robert matthews exofficio member during the meeting iab members discussed the role of the iab reflected on the public launch of the iab reviewed and accepted the iabs terms of reference developed its understanding of draxs business considered draxs approach to sustainable biomass including its new responsible sourcing policy  explored the climate aspects of draxs new responsible sourcing policy in light of forest researchs work on the carbon impacts of biomass  explored draxs use of the independent sustainable biomass program standard to evidence their performance against drax policies the iab shares this summary of its findings and recommendations the iab agreed that its role is to provide independent advice to drax on its sustainable biomass policy and practice iab members will do this by scrutinising the science and evidence informing draxs approach and by providing independent feedback to drax on how it can adopt best practices in addition to holding two face to face meetings each year the iab agreed to hold two interim telephone meetings the iab recommended drax refer to forest environment not natural environment in its policy the iab noted that the ten criteria drax have outlined to reduce the carbon emissions of its biomass approach have been designed to reflect the findings of forest researchs carbon impacts of biomass consumed in the eu report 2018 the iab found that the drax criteria are an accurate interpretation of the report the iab would like to explore how the science can further be developed with regard to the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood and consider how draxs policy might evolve the iab and drax discussed the possibility of developing some sub criteria for specific forest types the iab suggested drax could consider a restatement of the evidence academic review process to better understand and draw alignment on where there is scientific evidence on the sustainability of biomass the iab suggested drax should consider both a goal to continuously improve and consider the longer term implications of its policy commitments in light of potential climate changes the iab emphasised that the way drax operationalises its commitments will be critical it stressed the importance of robustly exploring the counterfactuals to draxs biomass activities highlighting the potential for tradeoffs between climate and biodiversity outcomes as an area for more detailed review the iab highlighted a number of considerations for drax in its use of the sustainable biomass program sbp it welcomed sbps adoption of a multistakeholder approach and suggested it will be important to scrutinise its evolution it noted that as draxs sustainability commitments go beyond sbps current criteria drax needs a strategy on how to evidence the compliance for these additional commitments the iab expressed interest in learning about draxs long term vision it noted that the ceasing of subsidies in 2027 will be a key milestone and highlighted its interest in exploring draxs strategy for managing this in future meetings with drax the iab will further examine evidence of draxs approach performance and impact against its commitments to identify any changes that drax may need to make the iab noted the following specific topics for further consideration evidence relating to the impact of thinning a forest on carbon pest control and fire risks how drax operationalises its commitments the counterfactuals of draxs biomass activities and potential tradeoffs between biodiversity and carbon outcomes draxs approach to biodiversity draxs long term vision including its plans for developing and scaling bioenergy with carbon capture and

landscape of the amite catchment area in mississippi is dense with forests they cover 84 of the area and play a crucial role in the local economy and the lives of the local population amite bioenergy catchment area  land area distribution by land classification  use 2017 on the states western border with louisiana near the town of gloster draxs amite bioenergy pellet mill is an important part of this local economy providing employment and creating a market for lowgrade wood amite produces halfamillion metric tonnes of wood pellets annually that not only benefit the surrounding area but also make a positive impact in the uk providing a renewable flexible low carbon source of power that could soon enable carbon negative electricity generation  however this is only possible if the pellets are sourced from healthy and responsibly managed forests thats why its essential for drax to regularly examine the environmental impact of the pellet mills and their catchment areas to ultimately ensure the wood is sustainably sourced and never contributes to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts in the first of a series of reports evaluating the areas drax sources wood from hood consulting has looked at the impact of amite on its surrounding region the scope of the analysis had to be objective and impartial using only credible data sources and references the specific aim was to evaluate the trends occurring in the forestry sector and to determine what impact the pellet mill may have had in influencing those trends positively or negatively this included the impact of harvesting levels carbon stock and sequestration rate wood prices and the production of all wood products the report highlights the positive role that the amite plant has had in the region supporting the health of western mississippis forests and its economy woodchip pile at amite bioenergy 2017 the landscape of the amite bioenergy wood pellet plant amite bioenergys catchment area  the working forest land from which it has sourced wood fibre since it began operating  stretches roughly 6600 square kilometres km 2  across 11 counties  nine in mississippi and two in louisiana amite bioenergy catchment area boundary us forest service data shows that since 2014 when amite began production total timberland in this catchment area has in fact increased by more than 5200 hectares 52 million m 2  an increase in market demand for wood products particularly for sawtimber can be one of the key drivers for encouraging forest owners to plant more trees retain their existing forest or more actively manage their forests to increase production  markets for low grade wood like the amite facility are essential for enabling forest owners to thin their crops and generate increased revenue as a byproduct of producing more sawtimber around 30 of the annual timber growth in the region is pine pulpwood a lowervalue wood which is the primary source of raw material used at amite more than 60 of the growth is what is known as sawtimber  highvalue wood used as construction lumber or furniture or chip n saw also used for construction and furniture amite bioenergy catchment

2017 source usda  us forest service in 2017 total timber growth was 511 million m 3 while removals totalled 241 million m 3  less than half of annual growth of that figure the pine pulpwood used to make biomass pellets grew by 152 million m 3 while just 850 thousand m 3 was removed the table below shows the ratio of removals to growth in the pine forests around amite a ratio of 1 is commonly considered to be the threshold for sustainable harvesting levels in this catchment area the ratio is more than double that amount meaning that there is still a substantial surplus of annual growth

major timber product 20102017 projected values 2018 the economic argument for sustainability the timberland of the amite bioenergy catchment area is 85 privately owned among the tens of thousands of smaller private landowners are larger landowners like forestry business weyerhaeuser  companies that manage forest land on behalf of investors like pension funds and private families for these private owners as long as there are healthy markets for forest products forests have an economic value  without these markets some owners may choose to convert their forest to other land uses eg for urban development or agriculture more than a billion tree saplings have been grown at weyerhaeusers pearl river nursery in mississippi the facility supplies these young trees to be planted in the amite catchment area and across the us south strong markets lead to increased investment in better management eg improved seedlings more weeding or fertilisation thinning and selecting the best trees for future sawtimber production thinning pulpwood is part of the forest management process explains dr harrison hood forest economist and principal at hood consulting typically with pine you plant 500 to 700 trees per acre that density helps the trees grow straight up rather than outwards but once the trees begin to grow beyond a certain point they can crowd one another and some trees will be starved of water nutrients and sunlight it is therefore essential to fell some trees to allow the others to grow to full maturity  a process known as thinning at final harvest youve got about 100 trees per acre continues dr hood you remove the pulpwood or the poorquality trees to allow the higherquality trees to continue to grow these thinnings have typically been used as pulpwood to make things like paper but with the slight decline of this industry over the last few decades theres been a need to find new markets for it paper production in the amite catchment area has declined since 2010 as shown

lowgrade wood is a challenge the arrival of a biomass market in the area has created a renewed demand  something that is even more important at the current time when there is an abundance of forest but wood prices are flat or declining slightly sawtimber prices havent moved much over the last six to eight years explains dr hood theyve been flat because theres so much wood out there that theres not enough demand to eat away at the supply pulpwood consumers such as amite bioenergy create demand for pulpwood from thinning allowing landowners to continue managing their forests while waiting for the higher value markets to recover revenue from pulpwood helps to support forest owners particularly when sawtimber prices are weak amite bioenergy catchment area mill map 2019 theres so much pulpwood out there says dr hood you need a buyer for pulpwood to allow forests to grow and mature into a higher product class and to keep growing healthy forests the picture of the overall forest in

sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  forests  forestry and forest management and arboriculture how scotlands sewage becomes renewable energy 17 december 2019 sustainable bioenergy from traffic pollution to household recycling and access to green spaces cities and governments around the world are facing increasing pressure to find solutions to a growing number of urban problems one of these which doesnt come up often is sewage but every day 11 billion litres of wastewater from drains homes businesses and farms is collected across the uk and treated to be made safe to reenter the water system although for the most part sewage treatment occurs beyond the view of the general population it is something that needs constant work if not dealt with properly it can have a significant effect on the surrounding environment of the many ways that sewage is dealt with perhaps one of the most innovative is to use it for energy daldowie fuel plant near glasgow is one such place which processes sewage sludge taken from the surrounding area into a renewable low carbon form of biomass fuel the solution in the sludge in operation since 2002 daldowie was acquired by drax at the end of 2018 and today processes 35 of all of scotlands wastewater sludge into dry lowodour fuel pellets we receive as much as 25 million tonnes of sludge from scottish water a year says plant manager dylan hughes who leads a team of 71 employees and produce up to 50000 tonnes of pellets making it one of the largest plants of this kind in the world we have to provide a 247 365day service that is built into the infrastructure of glasgow he explains this sludge processed at daldowie is not raw wastewater which is treated in scottish waters sewage facilities instead the sludge is a semisolid byproduct of the treatment process made of the organic material and bacteria that ends up in wastewater from homes and industry from drains sinks and yes toilets until the late 1990s one of great britains main methods of disposing of sludge was by dumping it in the ocean  after this practice was banned cities where left to figure out ways of dealing with the sludge using sludge as a form of fertiliser or burying it in landfills was an already established practice however scottishpower instead decided to investigate the potential of turning sludge into a dry fuel pellet that could offer a renewable low carbon substitute to coal at its power plants cement manufacturing fuel kilns daldowie was originally designed to supply fuel to methil power station near fife which ran on coal slurry however it was decommissioned in 2000 before daldowie could begin delivering fuel to it this led the plant to instead provide fuel to longannet power station where it was used to reduce its dependency on coal before it too was decommissioned in 2016 today daldowies pellets are used in england and scotland to fuel kilns in cement manufacturing  an industry attempting to navigate the same decarbonisation challenges as power generation which daldowie was established to tackle though the end use of the fuel has changed the process through which the facility transforms the waste remains the same the process of turning waste to energy the process starts after wastewater from glasgow and the surrounding area is treated by scottish water daldowie receives 90 of the sludge it processes directly via a pressurised sludge pipeline the rest is delivered via sealed tanker lorries when it arrives at daldowie the sludge is 98 water and 2 solid organic waste it is first screened for debris before entering the plants 12 centrifuges which act as massive spinning driers these separate water from what is known as sludge cake the semisolid part of the sludge feedstock this separated water is then cleaned so it can either be used elsewhere in the process or released into the nearby river clyde membrane tank at daldowie fuel plant the remaining sludge cake is dried using air heated to 450 degrees celsius using natural gas this also reduces germs through pasteurisation while the rotating drums give the fuel granules their pellet shape once dried the pellets are cooled and inspected for quality any material not up to necessary standards is fed back into the system for reprocessing fuel that does meet the right standards is cooled further and then stored in silos where possible throughout the process hot air and water are reused helping keep costs down and ensuring the process is efficient nearly two decades into its life very little has had to change in the way the plant operates thanks to these efficiencies but while the process of turning the waste sludge into energy remains largely unchanged there is as always room for new innovation  improving for the future of the site daldowie is contracted to recycle wastewater for scottish water until 2026 to ensure the plant is still as efficient and effective as possible the daldowie team is undertaking a technical investigation of what if anything would be needed to extend the life of the plant for at least an additional five years the plant operates under the highest environmental and health and safety standards but further improvements are being planned in 2020 hughes explains we are upgrading the odour control equipment to ensure we have a best in class level of performance the control room and plant operators at daldowie draxs scotland office in glasgow is working with other industrial facilities in the area as well as the scottish environmental protection agency sepa to work with the local community we are putting in place a series of engagement events including plant tours from early 2020 offering local residents an opportunity to meet the local team and discuss the planned improvements there are also other potential uses for the fuel including use at drax power station as the pellets are categorised as waste and biomass it would require a new license for the power station however at a time when there is a greater need to reduce the impact of human waste and diversify the countrys energy it would add another source of renewable fuel to great britains electricity mix that could help to enable
