careers the jobs needed to build a net zero energy future 11 november 2021 sustainable business many components are needed to tackle climate change and reach environmental milestones such as meeting the goals of the paris agreement one of those components is the right workforce large enough and with the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the green energy jobs of a lowcarbon future in 2020 the renewable energy sector employed 115 million people around the world but as the industry continues to expand that workforce will only grow last year a national grid report found that in the uk alone 120000 jobs will need to be filled in the lowcarbon energy sector by 2030  to meet the countrys climate objectives that figure is expected to rise to 400000 by 2050 the uk energy sector as a whole currently supports 738000 jobs and much of this workforce already has the skills needed for a low carbon society  others can be reskilled and retrained helping to bolster the future workforce by supporting employees through the green transition at a global level energy sector jobs are expected to increase from 18 million to 26 million by 2050  jobs that will span the full energy spectrum from researching and advising on lowcarbon solutions to installing and implementing them here are some of the roles that will be key to the lowcarbon energy transformation a wind farm under construction off the english coast wind turbine technicians according to the international energy agency iea wind power is this year set for a 17 increase in global energy generation compared to 2020 the biggest increase of any renewable power source the iea also forecasts that wind power will need to grow tenfold by 2050 if the world is to meet the goals of the paris agreement its not surprising therefore that wind turbine technicians  the professionals who install inspect maintain and repair wind turbines  are in high demand in the us wind turbine technician is the fastestgrowing job in the country  with 68 growth projected over the 20202030 period  to give just one example in the uk many wind turbine technicians have a background in engineering or experience from the wider energy sector although there are wind turbine technician and maintenance courses available they are not a prerequisite and many employers offer apprenticeships and onthejob training  smoothing the path for energy professionals to transition into the role solar panel installers today solar photovoltaic solar pv is the biggest global employer in renewable energy accounting for 38 million jobs  the iea also reported a 23 uptick in solar pv installations around the world in 2020 in the uk there are currently 132 gigawatts gw of installed solar power capacity  trade association solar energy uk predicts this will need to rise to at least 40 gw by 2030 if the uk is to succeed in becoming a net zero economy by 2050 the trade association believes this could see the creation of 13000 new solar energy jobs solar panel installers  who carry out the important job of installing and maintaining solar pv  are essential to a lowcarbon future many solar panel installers in the uk come from a background in electrical installation or have transitioned from engineering while there are training courses specifically designed for solar panel installers they are not a necessity particularly if you already have onthejob experience in a relevant sector this makes a move to becoming a solar panel installer relatively easy for someone already working in energy or with a mind for engineering energy consultants businesses of all kinds must play a role in the transition to net zero organisations must be able to manage their energy use and begin switching to renewable sources as professionals who advise companies on this process renewable energy consultants are a key part of the green energy workforce aspects of the job include identifying how organisations use their electric assets and helping businesses optimise those assets to build responsiveness and flexibility into energyintensive operations the core responsibilities of a renewable energy consultant are to reduce a companys environmental impact while helping the business reduce energy costs and identifying opportunities carbon accountants a growing number of businesses are setting targets for reducing their greenhouse gas ghg emissions but thats only possible if you can first determine what your ghg emissions are and where they come from which is where the relatively young field of carbon accounting comes in through what is known as physical carbon accounting companies can assess the emissions their activities generate and where in the supply chain the emissions are occurring this allows businesses to implement more accurate actions and be realistic in their timelines for reducing emissions on a wider scale accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in certifying emissions reductions or abatement as well as in the distribution of carbon credits or penalties as whole economies push towards net zero battery technology researchers energy storage is essential to a lowcarbon energy future  the ability to store and release energy from intermittent sources such as wind and solar will be crucial in meeting demand and balancing a renewablesdriven grid while many forms of energy storage already exist  developing electric batteries that can be deployed at scale is still a comparatively new and expanding area global patenting activities in the field of batteries and other electricity storage increased at an annual rate of 14  four times faster than the average for technology  between 2005 and 2018 however its estimated that to meet climate objectives the world will need nearly 10000 gw hours of battery and other electricity storage by 2040 this is 50 times the current level and research and innovation will be crucial to delivering bigger and more efficient batteries farmers and foresters how we use and manage land will be important in lowering carbon emissions and creating a sustainable future for people and the planet crops like corn sugarcane and soybean can serve as feedstock for biofuel and bioenergy and farming byproducts such as cow manure can be used in the development of biofuel techniques adopted in the agricultural sector will also be important in optimising soil sequestration capabilities while ensuring it is nutrientrich enough to grow food these techniques include the use of biochar  a solid form of charcoal produced by heating biomass without oxygen research indicates that biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for centuries or longer it also helps soil retain water and could contribute to reducing the use of fertilisers by making the soil more nutrientdense forests meanwhile provide material for industries like construction the byproducts from which can serve as feedstock for woody biomass primarily in the shape of lowgrade wood that would otherwise remain unused sustainably managed forests such as those from which drax sources its biomass have twofold importance they both enable woody biomass for bioenergy and ensure co 2 is removed from the atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle biofuel engineers and scientists farmers and foresters provide feedstock for biofuels but its biofuel scientists and engineers who research develop and enhance them opening the door to alternative fuels for vehicles heating and even jet engines according to the iea production of biofuel that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector grew 6 in 2019 however the organisation forecasts that production will need to increase 10 annually until 2030 to be in line with paris agreement climate targets scientific innovations that can help boost the production of biofuel around the world therefore continues to be vital as is the work of biofuel engineers who assess and improve existing biofuel systems and develop new ones that can replace fossil fuels like petrol and diesel the wealth of knowledge around fuels in the oil and gas industries means there is ample opportunity for scientists and engineers who work with fossil fuels to bring their skills to crucial lowcarbon roles geologists the overriding goal of the paris agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2 and preferably to 15 degrees celsius compared to preindustrial levels this is an objective the iea has said will be  virtually impossible to fulfil without carbon capture and storage ccs technologies ccs entails capturing co 2 and transporting it for safe and permanent underground storage in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas fields coal seams and saline aquifers according to the global ccs institute the world will need a 100fold increase on the 27 ccs project currently in operation by 2050 knowledge and research into rock types formations and reactivity will be important in helping identify sites deep underground that can be used for safe permanent carbon storage and sequestration skills and expertise gained in the oil and gas industries will allow professionals in these sectors to make the switch from careers in fossil fuel to roles that help power a net zero economy employees working at drax power station chemists the role of chemists is also vital to decarbonisation knowledge and research around co 2 is a potent force in the effort to reduce and remove it from the atmosphere technologies like ccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage becss  and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs  are based around such research carbon capture processes are chemical reactions between emissions streams and solvents often based on amines and ghgs understanding and controlling these processes makes chemistry a key component of delivering carbon capture at the scale needed to help meet climate targets chemists role in decarbonisation is far from limited to carbon capture methods from battery technology to reforestation chemists understanding of the elements can help drive action against climate change bringing together disciplines tackling climate change on the scale needed to achieve the aims of the paris agreement depends on collaboration between industries countries and disciplines decarbonisation projects such as the uks east coast cluster which encompasses both zero carbon humber and net zero teesside fuse engineering and construction jobs with scientific and academic work zero carbon humber which brings together 12 organisations including drax is expected to create as many as 47800 jobs in the region by 2027  among these are construction sector jobs for welders pipefitters machine installers and technicians in addition indirect jobs are predicted to be created across supply chains from material manufacturing to the logistics of supporting a workforce meeting climate challenges and delivering projects on the scale of zero carbon humber depends on creating an energy workforce that combines the knowledge of the past with the green energy skills of the future draxs apprenticeships have readied workers for the energy sector for decades and will continue to do so as we build a lowcarbon future options include fouryear technical apprenticeships in mechanical electrical and control and instrumentation engineering getting onthejob training and practical experience apprentices receive a nationally recognised qualification such as a btec or an nvq level 3 at the end of the programme apprentices at drax power station 2021 the workforce needed to make low carbon societies a reality will be a diverse one  stretching from apprentices to experienced professionals with a background in traditional or renewable energy it will also span every aspect of the renewable energy field from the chemists and biofuel scientists who develop key technologies to the solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians who fit and maintain the necessary equipment the skills needed to take on these roles are already plentiful in the uk and around the world overcoming challenges on the road to net zero

executive officer drax group 11 december 2020 opinion december 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of the paris agreement it represented a landmark moment in the global effort to combat climate change and build a better future  however global progress is not moving at the speed it needs to in order to meet the treatys target of keeping global warming below 152 degrees celsius explore carbon capture by drax countries have set their own decarbonisation targets and many companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative  as we at drax intend to achieve by 2030  while these leading ambitions are important for the uk and the world to meet the goals of the paris agreement real action polices and investment are needed at scale we have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago we know from the recent 6 th carbon budget that renewable energy as well as carbon capture usage and storage ccus are essential for the uk to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in that detailed 1000page report  the climate change committee ccc was clear that progress must be made immediately  the country as a whole must be 78 of the way there by 2035 by investing where its needed the uk can lead the world in a whole new industry one that may come to define the next century  leading the world in decarbonisation it was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the uk to launch the industrial revolution some 250 years ago today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world as a country  one that i moved to over 20 years ago now  we have decarbonised at a greater pace than any other over the past decade investing in renewable generation such as wind solar and biomass has allowed the uk to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for net zero emissions  to remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future power grids will require vastly increased support from energy storage systems such as pumped hydro  as well as flexible reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation however the urgency of climate change means the uk must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing negative emissions technologies which remove more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than they emit the ccc as well as national grids future energy scenarios report have emphasised the necessity of negative emissions for the uk to reach net zero  by removing co 2 not just from energy but other industries too the uk can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cuttingedge green technology that can take the country to net zero establishing it as a world leader for others to follow creating an industry exporting it to the world when the paris agreement was signed i was just joining drax i had been impressed by the power stations transformation from coal to biomass  europes largest decarbonisation project  supporting

time all sectors of the economy must reduce their emissions and do it quickly i believe the best approach to tackling climate change is through cobenefit solutions solutions that not only have a positive environmental impact but that are economically progressive for society today and in the future through training skills and job creation as an energy company this task is especially important for drax we have a responsibility to future generations to innovate and use our engineering skills to deliver power thats renewable sustainable and that doesnt come at a cost to the environment

storage as well as ccus carbon capture usage and storage in industry and power and ramp up hydrogen production as a low carbon fuel these are all essential technologies in bringing the uk to net zero but they are also innovative projects at scale that can benefit society and the lives of people in the humber and around the uk new jobs in a new sector the humber region has a proud history in heavy industries  what began as a thriving ship building hub has evolved to include chemicals refining and steel manufacturing however these emissionsintensive industries have grown increasingly expensive to operate and many have left for countries where they can be run cheaper leading to a decline in the humber region if they are not decarbonised these industries will face an even greater cost by 2040 emitters could face billions of pounds per year in carbon taxes making them less competitive and less attractive for international investment deploying carbon capture and hydrogen are essential steps towards modernising these businesses and protecting up to 55000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the region capturing carbon at drax delivering jobs clean growth and levelling up the humber click to view executive summary and case studies from vivid economics report for drax a report by vivid economics commissioned by drax found that carbon capture and hydrogen in the humber could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades as well as protecting peoples livelihoods decarbonisation is also a matter of public health in the humber alone higher air quality could save 148 million in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 i believe the uk is well position to rise to the challenge and lead the world in decarbonisation technology there is a clear opportunity to export knowledge and skills to other countries embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys beccs alone could create many more jobs related to exporting the technology and operational knowhow and deliver additional value for the economy as interest in negative emissions grows around the world the uk needs to move quickly to secure a competitive advantage a fairer economy this is in many ways the start of a new sector in our economy  one that can offer new employment earnings and economic growth it comes at just the right time without intervention to spur a green recovery the covid19 crisis risks subjecting longterm economic damage being at the beginning of the industrial decarbonisation journey means we also have the power to shape this new industry in a way that spreads the benefits across the whole of the uk weve previously seen sector deals struck between the government and industry include equality measures for example the nuclear industry aims to count women as 40 of its employees by 2030 while offshore wind is committed to sourcing 60 of its supply chain from the uk  wind turbines at bridlington east yorkshire at present the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk contributing to a pronounced skills gap among the workforce in addition almost 60 of construction workers across the wider yorkshire and humber region were furloughed as of august 2020 a project such as zero carbon humber could address this regional imbalance and offer skilled long term jobs to local communities thats why i welcome the prime ministers announcement of 1bn investment to support the establishment of ccus in the humber and other superplaces around the uk as the governments ten point plan says ccus can help decarbonise our most challenging sectors provide low carbon power and a pathway to negative emissions healthier forests the cobenefits of beccs extend beyond our communities in the uk we aim to become carbon negative by 2030 by removing our co 2 emissions from the atmosphere and abating emissions that might still exist on the uks path to net zero this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use continues to be sourced from sustainable forests that positively benefit the environment and the communities in which we and our suppliers operate engineer working in turbine hall drax power station north yorkshire i believe we must continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light we can help ensure the uks biomass sourcing is led by the latest science  best practice and transparency  supporting

society what we can achieve through largescale projects like zero carbon humber is more than just the vital issue of reduced emissions it is also about creating jobs protecting health and improving livelihoods these are more than just benefits they are the makings of a future filled with opportunity for the humber and for the uks green industrial revolution  by implementing the ten point plan

challenge of our time will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 28 july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing tags

benefits of this service and they were attended by 113 managers as a result of opus energys initiative first launched in 2017 to train mental health first aiders we now have 20 employees qualified to offer a first line of response across the business they are available to all employees should they would want to speak with a peer about any mental health issues a further 16 employees will train as mental health first aiders in 2019 tags sustainability  opus energy  careers meet the apprentices powering our future 4 march 2019 sustainable business different people do things different ways says sam stocks an apprentice engineer at drax power station its a sentiment echoed by corporate administration apprentice chloe carpenter at opus energy asked to describe her role she says its a very different kind of job chloe and sam are just two of a number of apprentices at drax group who are working across the uk and while theyre proud to do things differently they do have something in common  theyre all handson practical people who would rather get stuck in on a project than sit still and hear about it in the classroom i chose an apprenticeship over higher education because im more of a doing person says molly fensome a corporate administration apprentice sam agrees i like to be handson he says i dont like being sat in a classroom they are doing things their way  engineering their own futures while growing personally and professionally and ensuring the future of our energy supply in the process finding a strong sense of identity for sam working at drax wasnt just a sensible career move it was also following in his familys footsteps my grandad worked in the power station industry all his life my family know exactly what im like and they knew what type of place this was to work draxs transformation from a coalpowered plant to a modern sustainable electricity company means sams work is building a power framework for future generations while also paying homage to his grandads career jake dawson an electrical engineer apprentice followed a similar path into the power industry being born and bred in the area drax power station has always been a part of his geography because im such a local lad it was perfect for me he says in his role jake can play a key part in the region where he grew up a recent oxford economics report shows that drax contributes 431 million to yorkshire and the humber economy and supports over 3200 jobs a role in a team drax is a large organisation but for chloe finding role models within her team she can look up to and take guidance from has been easy mentoring sessions are relaxed and you build a special bond with that person she says you can talk to them about work outside of work  anything theyll always be there for you corporate administration apprentice matt donnelly has had a similar experience adding that hes seen his confidence grow and feels he has made lifelong friends in his role ultimately its not just that they are given the right support but that apprentices are integrated as a part of the company from day one my favourite part of my apprenticeship so far is being part of the team says chloe because you feel like youre not just an apprentice but youre also one of them  being part of something bigger sam remembers his first day at drax power station it was overwhelming you dont actually realise how big it is and realise how many people work here its just normal now if i go anywhere else im thinking thats not as big as at work its not just its size that makes the uks biggest single site renewable power station stand out but the potential for career development there its this that jake had on his mind when he first made the decision to become an apprentice he was working in an unskilled job with little opportunity but he knew he had it in him to find something bigger his outlook today as a drax apprentice is very different my aim after the four years is to carry on growing as a person increasing all my skills that i have and maybe eventually becoming a supervisor or an engineer who knows this mindset of striving for better is evident across apprentices its what drove them to join the programme in the first place instead of going somewhere like uni and then possibly coming out without a job youve got a job and youre actually learning as youre doing it says sam the skill set that ive learnt now  ill probably go anywhere in the world with it find out more about apprenticeships at drax tags opus energy  careers  apprenticeships  drax power station people strategy
