a long history of active management for timber production 96 of the forest owners are private and around half of these are corporate investors seeking a financial return from forest management  the pulp and paper pp sector dominates the market for low grade roundwood with over 75 of the total demand the wood pellet markets use only 6 of the roundwood of which 4 is used by morehouse given the small scale of demand in the pellet sector the extent of influence is limited however the new pellet markets have had a positive impact replacing some of the declining demand in the pp sector and providing a market for thinnings for some forest owners and a new offtake for sawmill residues pine forest is dominant in this area with an increasing inventory growing stock despite a stable forest area active management of pine forests has increased the amount of timber stored in the standing trees by 68 million tonnes from 2006 to 2018 over the same period the hardwood inventory remained static historic inventory and timberland area in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload us forest service fia data shows that the pine resource in this catchment area has been maturing the volume of timber has been increasing in each size class year on year this means that the volume available for harvesting is increasing and that more markets will be required to utilise this surplus volume and ensure that the longterm future of the forest area can be maintained historic pine inventory by dbh class in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload this is reflected in the growth drain ratio  the comparison of annual growth versus harvesting a ratio of one shows a forest area in balance less than one shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing phase but it can also occur when insufficient market demand exists and owners are forced to retain stands for longer in the absence of a viable market draxs morehouse bioenergy compressed wood pellet plant in northern louisiana this can have a negative impact on the future growth of the forest limiting the financial return to forest owners and reducing the cumulative sequestration of carbon by enforcing suboptimal rotation lengths the current growth drain ratio of pine around morehouse is 167 with an average annual surplus of around 7 million metric tonnes this surplus of growth is partly due to a decline in sawtimber demand due to the global financial crisis but also due to the maturing age class of the forest resource and the

john thank you for your letter of the 9 january detailing the findings and recommendations from the first meeting of the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass i want to begin by reiterating how important the work of the iab is to draxs purpose and ambition as you know we recently announced our intention to become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030 by scaling up our pioneering biomass with ccs beccs pilot project this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use makes a positive contribution to our climate the environment and the communities in which we operate to that end both you and the iab will play a vital role by guiding us on our sourcing choices and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be i enjoyed meeting with the iab and hearing your conclusions from the first meeting i am also pleased to hear from my team that the longer discussions were useful and constructive please pass on my thanks to all the members of the iab for their time and consideration in particular i am grateful for their consideration of our new sustainable biomass sourcing policy and the insight and recommendations that were given i am pleased to hear that you agree our policy is an accurate representation of the criteria laid down in the forest research report i agree that a key topic for us to explore is how science can be further developed with regards the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood i also agree that understanding the counter factuals in the usage of wood that has come to us is important this is an area we have and continue to explore and i would refer the iab to a report we have published subsequent to the meeting catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends 2019  which contains an independent analysis of the impact of our sourcing at our amite pellet mill in mississippi the team look forward to discussing this with you at a future meeting and receiving your input to shape the next phases of this work i also agree the need to continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light as well as ensure that the current policy is embedded into our operations for that reason our policy will be kept under regular review to accommodate changes in science and new evidence as it emerges we have also committed to advancing scientific research in the areas applicable to our operations through partnerships with academic institutions and direct support for academic research with regards your suggestion of a restatement of the academic evidence on biomass sustainability we shall give this interesting approach due consideration i do believe that better alignment through a shared understanding of the evidence among the academic community environmental groups policy makers and industry would be a welcome development and would be grateful to the iab for its further consideration of how this might be achieved i will also raise your considerations regarding the sustainable biomass program spb in my position a member of the spb board you are correct that our new policy goes beyond sbp and so an important work programme for us is how we demonstrate we are meeting the new policy lastly i welcome the addition of two interim telephone calls which will help to keep momentum between the half yearly meetings and will support us as we develop our policy research and implementation projects further thank you for this commitment as the work of the iab progresses i look forward to hearing how you believe drax can best build the evidence required to demonstrate that we are sourcing according to the best available science as the worlds largest biomass consumer it is important that we lead by example this means not only having a world leading biomass sustainability policy in place but also the data and evidence available to give all our stakeholders the confidence that we are fulfilling our purpose of

sustainable biomass iab the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass provides this statement following its first meeting on friday 15th november 2019 attendees john beddington chair john krebs deputy chair virginia dale sam fankhauser elena schmidt robert matthews exofficio member during the meeting iab members discussed the role of the iab reflected on the public launch of the iab reviewed and accepted the iabs terms of reference developed its understanding of draxs business considered draxs approach to sustainable biomass including its new responsible sourcing policy  explored the climate aspects of draxs new responsible sourcing policy in light of forest researchs work on the carbon impacts of biomass  explored draxs use of the independent sustainable biomass program standard to evidence their performance against drax policies the iab shares this summary of its findings and recommendations the iab agreed that its role is to provide independent advice to drax on its sustainable biomass policy and practice iab members will do this by scrutinising the science and evidence informing draxs approach and by providing independent feedback to drax on how it can adopt best practices in addition to holding two face to face meetings each year the iab agreed to hold two interim telephone meetings the iab recommended drax refer to forest environment not natural environment in its policy the iab noted that the ten criteria drax have outlined to reduce the carbon emissions of its biomass approach have been designed to reflect the findings of forest researchs carbon impacts of biomass consumed in the eu report 2018 the iab found that the drax criteria are an accurate interpretation of the report the iab would like to explore how the science can further be developed with regard to the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood and consider how draxs policy might evolve the iab and drax discussed the possibility of developing some sub criteria for specific forest types the iab suggested drax could consider a restatement of the evidence academic review process to better understand and draw alignment on where there is scientific evidence on the sustainability of biomass the iab suggested drax should consider both a goal to continuously improve and consider the longer term implications of its policy commitments in light of potential climate changes the iab emphasised that the way drax operationalises its commitments will be critical it stressed the importance of robustly exploring the counterfactuals to draxs biomass activities highlighting the potential for tradeoffs between climate and biodiversity outcomes as an area for more detailed review the iab highlighted a number of considerations for drax in its use of the sustainable biomass program sbp it welcomed sbps adoption of a multistakeholder approach and suggested it will be important to scrutinise its evolution it noted that as draxs sustainability commitments go beyond sbps current criteria drax needs a strategy on how to evidence the compliance for these additional commitments the iab expressed interest in learning about draxs long term vision it noted that the ceasing of subsidies in 2027 will be a key milestone and highlighted its interest in exploring draxs strategy for managing this in future meetings with drax the iab will further examine evidence of draxs approach performance and impact against its commitments to identify any changes that drax may need to make the iab noted the following specific topics for further consideration evidence relating to the impact of thinning a forest on carbon pest control and fire risks how drax operationalises its commitments the counterfactuals of draxs biomass activities and potential tradeoffs between biodiversity and carbon outcomes draxs approach to biodiversity draxs long term vision including its plans for developing and scaling bioenergy with carbon capture and

landscape of the amite catchment area in mississippi is dense with forests they cover 84 of the area and play a crucial role in the local economy and the lives of the local population amite bioenergy catchment area  land area distribution by land classification  use 2017 on the states western border with louisiana near the town of gloster draxs amite bioenergy pellet mill is an important part of this local economy providing employment and creating a market for lowgrade wood amite produces halfamillion metric tonnes of wood pellets annually that not only benefit the surrounding area but also make a positive impact in the uk providing a renewable flexible low carbon source of power that could soon enable carbon negative electricity generation  however this is only possible if the pellets are sourced from healthy and responsibly managed forests thats why its essential for drax to regularly examine the environmental impact of the pellet mills and their catchment areas to ultimately ensure the wood is sustainably sourced and never contributes to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts in the first of a series of reports evaluating the areas drax sources wood from hood consulting has looked at the impact of amite on its surrounding region the scope of the analysis had to be objective and impartial using only credible data sources and references the specific aim was to evaluate the trends occurring in the forestry sector and to determine what impact the pellet mill may have had in influencing those trends positively or negatively this included the impact of harvesting levels carbon stock and sequestration rate wood prices and the production of all wood products the report highlights the positive role that the amite plant has had in the region supporting the health of western mississippis forests and its economy woodchip pile at amite bioenergy 2017 the landscape of the amite bioenergy wood pellet plant amite bioenergys catchment area  the working forest land from which it has sourced wood fibre since it began operating  stretches roughly 6600 square kilometres km 2  across 11 counties  nine in mississippi and two in louisiana amite bioenergy catchment area boundary us forest service data shows that since 2014 when amite began production total timberland in this catchment area has in fact increased by more than 5200 hectares 52 million m 2  an increase in market demand for wood products particularly for sawtimber can be one of the key drivers for encouraging forest owners to plant more trees retain their existing forest or more actively manage their forests to increase production  markets for low grade wood like the amite facility are essential for enabling forest owners to thin their crops and generate increased revenue as a byproduct of producing more sawtimber around 30 of the annual timber growth in the region is pine pulpwood a lowervalue wood which is the primary source of raw material used at amite more than 60 of the growth is what is known as sawtimber  highvalue wood used as construction lumber or furniture or chip n saw also used for construction and furniture amite bioenergy catchment area  net growth of growing stock timber by major timber product source usda  us forest service the analysis shows that harvesting levels in each product category are substantially lower than the annual growth as shown in the table below this means that every year a surplus of growth remains in the forest as stored carbon amite bioenergy catchment area  harvest removals by major timber product 2017 source usda  us forest service in 2017 total timber growth was 511 million m 3 while removals totalled 241 million m 3  less than half of annual growth of that figure the pine pulpwood used to make biomass pellets grew by 152 million m 3 while just 850 thousand m 3 was removed the table below shows the ratio of removals to growth in the pine forests around amite a ratio of 1 is commonly considered to be the threshold for sustainable harvesting levels in this catchment area the ratio is more than double that amount meaning that there is still a substantial surplus of annual growth that has not been harvested amite bioenergy catchment area  annual growth removals  growthtoremoval ratios by major timber product 2017 source usda  us forest service between 2010 and 2017 the total stock of wood fibre or carbon growing in the forests around amite increased by more than 11 million m 3  this is despite a substantial increase in harvesting demand for pulpwood timber inventory by major timber product 20102017 projected values 2018 the economic argument for sustainability the timberland of the amite bioenergy catchment area is 85 privately owned among the tens of thousands of smaller private landowners are larger landowners like forestry business weyerhaeuser  companies that manage forest land on behalf of investors like pension funds and private families for these private owners as long as there are healthy markets for forest products forests have an economic value  without these markets some owners may choose to convert their forest to other land uses eg for urban development or agriculture more than a billion tree saplings have been grown at weyerhaeusers pearl river nursery in mississippi the facility supplies these young trees to be planted in the amite catchment area and across the us south strong markets lead to increased investment in better management eg improved seedlings more weeding or fertilisation thinning and selecting the best trees for future sawtimber production thinning pulpwood is part of the forest management process explains dr harrison hood forest economist and principal at hood consulting typically with pine you plant 500 to 700 trees per acre that density helps the trees grow straight up rather than outwards but once the trees begin to grow beyond a certain point they can crowd one another and some trees will be starved of water nutrients and sunlight it is therefore essential to fell some trees to allow the others to grow to full maturity  a process known as thinning at final harvest youve got about 100 trees per acre continues dr hood you remove the pulpwood or the poorquality trees to allow the higherquality trees to continue to grow these thinnings have typically been used as pulpwood to make things like paper but with the slight decline of this industry over the last few decades theres been a need to find new markets for it paper production in the amite catchment area has declined since 2010 as shown on the chart on the right whilst demand for sawtimber lumber has been increasing following the economic recovery after the recession of 2008 southern pine lumber production vs amite bioenergy

cartchment area delivered pine pulpwood price source southern forest products association american forest  paper association timbermartsouth producing sawtimber without a market for thinnings and lowgrade wood is a challenge the arrival of a biomass market in the area has created a renewed demand  something that is even more important at the current time when there is an abundance of forest but wood prices are flat or declining slightly sawtimber prices havent moved much over the last six to eight years explains dr hood theyve been flat because theres so much wood out there that theres not enough demand to eat away at the supply pulpwood consumers such as amite bioenergy create demand for pulpwood from thinning allowing landowners to continue managing their forests while waiting for the higher value markets to recover revenue from pulpwood helps to support forest owners particularly when sawtimber prices are weak amite bioenergy catchment area mill map 2019 theres so much pulpwood out there says dr hood you need a buyer for pulpwood to allow forests to grow and mature into a higher product class and to keep growing healthy forests the picture of the overall forest in the catchment area is of healthy growth and crucially a sustainable environment from which drax can responsibly source biomass pellets for the foreseeable future read the full report catchment area

sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  forests  forestry and forest management and arboriculture amite bioenergy catchment area analysis sustainable bioenergy the first of our planned catchment area analysis reports is complete looking at amite bioenergy  our compressed wood pellet manufacturing plant in mississippi the aim of this analysis is to evaluate the trends occurring in the forestry sector around the plant and to determine what impact the pellet mill may have had in influencing those trends positively or negatively this includes the impact of increased harvesting levels changes in carbon stock and sequestration rate wood prices and the production of all wood products analysis shows a maturing forest resource with a substantial surplus of annual growth increasing in age and growing stock increasing production of sawtimber and higher value wood products stable wood prices and no market displacement key report data since 2010 the total growing stock the amount of wood stored in the forest around amite bioenergy has increased by 111 million cubic metres m 3  this is partly due to an increase in the area of timberland which increased by more than 5200 hectares ha but predominantly due to the forest ageing and increasing the average size class the average tree gets bigger moving from a small diameter pulpwood tree to a larger sawtimber grade tree the chart below shows that the increase in volume is entirely within the private sector where forests are more actively managed the public sector has declined in growing stock by 15 million m 3 whilst the private sector has increased by 126 million m 3  the continual cycle of thinning harvesting and replanting in the private forests helps to keep the growing stock increasing total growing stock volume on timberland in cubic meters by ownership group source us forest service  fia harvesting in the catchment area has increased due to the increased demand from the pellet mill but this is still substantially lower than average annual growth the average annual surplus of growth compared to harvesting between 2010 and 2017 has been 35 million m 3 pa with a surplus of 27 million m 3 in

removals of total growing stock timber in cubic meters on timberland  amite catchment area source us forest service  fia amite bioenergy mississippi 2017 the catchment area analysis also looks at stumpage prices the revenue paid to forest owners at the time of harvesting to see if the demand from the pellet mill is having a negative impact increasing competition and prices for other markets the chart below shows that prices are now lower than when the pellet mill began operating while this may be good for all markets in the area it is not good for the forest owner when considering if trends are good or bad we must also consider from which perspective we are making the assessment increasing prices can be a positive encouraging owners to plant more trees or to invest more in the management of their forest providing that increasing prices do not result in a loss of production in existing markets amite bioenergy catchment area  average stumpage prices metric tonne source timber martsouth an important part of this analysis is to look for evidence to evaluate draxs performance against its new forest commitments  some of which relate directly to these trends and data sets hood consulting  the authors of catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends amite bioenergy  has looked at the impact of amite bioenergy on its supply basin the scope of the analysis had to be objective and impartial using only credible data sources and references however in order to address some of the key issues and draw some conclusions the consultants used their extensive experience and local knowledge in addition to the data trends a summary of their findings is detailed below summary of key questions addressed in the analysis is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused  deforestation no us forest service data shows that the total timberland area has increased by more than 5200 ha a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no  inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last five to 10 years but there is little evidence to suggest bioenergy demand has caused these changes market research shows thinnings have declined in this catchment area since 2014 when amite bioenergy commenced production however local loggers identify poor market conditions for the decrease in thinnings not increased bioenergy demand the primary focus of timber management in this area is the production of sawtimber rotation lengths of managed forests have remained unchanged between 2535 years of age despite increases in bioenergy demand increased bioenergy demand however has benefited landowners in this catchment area providing additional outlets for pulpwood removed from thinnings  a management activity necessary for sawtimber production diversion from other markets no since 2014 softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has increased 8 while demand for softwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood has increased 53 and 5 respectively an abnormal increase in wood prices no prices for delivered pine pulpwood the primary raw material consumed by amite bioenergy have decreased 12 since the pellet mill commenced production in 2014 a reduction in growing stock timber no  inconclusive total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 5 from 2014 through 2017 the latest available data specifically pine sawtimber inventory increased 13 pine chipnsaw inventory increased 24 and pine pulpwood inventory decreased 12 over this period this is indicative of an aging forest a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock timber has decreased slightly since 2014 and a slower timber growth rate essentially represents a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon however the reduced growth rate and subsequent reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon is due to the aging of the forest changes in timber age class distribution not to increases in bioenergy demand as trees get older the growth rate slows down an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual harvests provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2017 the latest available the growthtoremovals ratio for pine pulpwood equalled 180 a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area evaluate the impact of bioenergy demand positive neutral negative on  timber growing stock inventory neutral total wood demand from biomass and other solid wood products is up more than 35 compared to 2014 levels intuitively increased demand means more timber is harvested which reduces total growing stock inventory however in this catchment area inventories are so substantial that increases in demand from bioenergy as well as from other sources have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth and as such total growing stock inventory has continued to increase  an average of 2 per year since 2014 when amite bioenergy commenced production timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have declined since 2014 however evidence suggests the reduction in growth rates is more a product of an aging forest and not due to changes in bioenergy demand additionally young planted pine stands are actually growing at a faster rate than ever before  due to the continued improvement of seedling genetics and as timber is harvested and these stands are replanted in pine as has historically occurred in the catchment area over the long term the average timber growth rate is likely to increase weyerhaeuser nursery hazlehurst mississippi forest area positive  neutral total forest timberland area in the catchment area increased more than 5200 ha from 2014 through 2017 the latest available and while our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found a moderately strong relationship between the two findings are inconclusive as to whether the increase in timberland acreage can be attributed to increases in biomass demand wood prices neutral despite the additional wood demand placed on this market by amite bioenergy since 2014 prices for delivered pine pulpwood the primary raw material consumed by amite bioenergy have decreased 12 in the catchment area prices for pine sawmill residuals and inwoods chips the other two raw materials consumed by amite bioenergy have also declined over the last several

from arcticcircle snowladen pines to damp equatorial rainforests to dry australian scrublands the planet is home to an incredibly diverse range of forested environments and while each region is very different almost all have been impacted by humans the effects of this have not always been positive and despite decades spent raising awareness of the importance of forests for the health of the world some regions forests remain in decline africa and asia in particular have seen a decline in forest cover although each year sees less lost over the past few decades but there are areas where the impact of humans is in fact having a positive effect this is largely thanks to the introduction of modern sustainable forestry practices  which have incentivised growth and helped bringing a variety of environmental and economic benefits to different regions around the world a recent report by pöyry management consulting for drax has looked in depth at these benefits and in particular four regions where different approaches to sustainable forestry have brought a positive impact to people industry and the environment alike more than a testament to the beneficial effects sustainable forest management can have it shows that while the tactics methods and environments may differ their positive effects are universal us south turning around old practices weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama the forests of the us south from virginia and kentucky to texas and florida have a long history of misuse both indigenous people and later european settlers used disruptive techniques such as large scale burning and removed valuable mature hardwood on a mass scale often leaving areas to naturally regenerate that largely changed in the mid20 th century however when forestry became moreintensive and the need for sustaining a supply of quality timber grew more apparent the introduction of processes such as thinning and managed regeneration helped usher in a more responsible approach that has led to growth in both the forestry industry and forest coverage between 2010 and 2015 there was 50 more growth in the volume of forests than was removed from harvesting more than just growing forest area this means an increase in the amount of carbon being absorbed and stored from the atmosphere charts us south historical increment to removal and us south above ground carbon 19571997  in the us south around 86 of forest land is privately owned by either corporations or individuals but the economics of sustainable forestry practices has encouraged the overall growth in forests even with limited regulations on land use in the area in addition to the native birds and mammals that depend on sustainably managed forests in the region more than 200000 people were employed by the industry in 2016 making it a vital part of local rural economies finland a centurylong history of sustainable practices asikkala finland by taneli lahtinen on unsplash wood and wood products play an important role in finnish culture from its famous saunas to the worlds largest wooden church  multinational phone brand nokia even started life in in 1865 as a wood pulp mill a high demand for wood as a commercial product meant that a few centuries ago finlands forests where in a state of heavy degradation but starting as far back as 100 years ago sustainable practices such as planned harvesting and regeneration legislation were introduced the results are significant there is now more wood in finnish forests today than at the turn of the century the majority 61 of finlands forests are privately owned with the state owning 25 companies only owning 8 and 5 held by other owners many large companies however offer services such as forestry work wood sales drainage and tax services to private owners this collaboration between sectors allows for best practices to be easily shared and quickly become widespread as a result forest stocks have increased from 1500 million m 3 in 1970 to 2500 million m 3 in 2015 even while overall forest area has remained largely the same it highlights the effectiveness of legislation guidelines and certification in regenerating forests chart forest growing stock in finland  uk incentivising growth and diversity the uk was once thought to be 30 covered by forestland but by the turn of the last century forests made up less than 5 today however this has grown to as much as 13 owing largely to regulation and incentives chart forest area in uk by country and type over previous 10 years   as far back as the 1700s the uk had become dependent on wood imports from new england in the us and the baltics in europe following the first world war the forestry commission was established primarily to try prevent timber shortages during times of war but it went on to drive a boom in new plantations across the country and introduce grant schemes for private plantations chart top 10 net importers of wood products  in 2017 the uk was the worlds second largest net importer of wood products a problem with this afforestation however was that it mostly consisted of monocultures of exotic species that were well suited to the climate rather than regenerating native species the modern uk forestry standard is countering this practice by putting in place requirements for afforestation and replanting that protect biodiversity landscape and climate change as well as soil and water forest in argyll and bute some 73 of the uks forests are privately owned which includes historic estates and charitable trusts as well as investment funds despite the increasing forest area in the uk over the past century imports of both wood and wood products still make up almost 80 of the uks wood needs the upside for the region is increased recreational and preserved historic forests uruguay sustainably managing rapid expansion uruguays forestry industry is much younger than the likes of the us south or finland but offers an example of a how to rapidly expand the sector while preserving its old growth or primary forests eucalyptus trees in uruguayan working forest in 1975 the country introduced incentives such as tax waivers on forest operations and later subsidies for new plantations as well as tax duties for timber exports the result was a surge in eucalyptus plantations which grew from 25000 hectares in 1987 to more than 1 million hectares in 2015 largely driven by interest from international companies and investors these plantations are currently managed sustainably with growth still exceeding removals eucalyptus is not a native species to uruguay but by allowing international investors to plant on land deemed of no agricultural or environmental value the country has seen enormous afforestation while 800000 hectares of native forests remain the economic impact is similarly impressive today forestry directly employees 15000 people in uruguay  55 in forestry and logging and 45 in wood processing the skills required to work in newly constructed mills has led to several courses in forestry and wood science at uruguayan universities chart total forest area development in uruguay these four countries take different approaches to forestry but what they have in common is forest growth exceeding that removed through harvesting it points to sustainable forest management as a means of

forestry and forest management and arboriculture the everyday and future ways you use forest products 24 august 2018 sustainable bioenergy think of the products that come from forests and you might think of the centuries of shipbuilding construction and cooking made possible by civilisations utilising this plentiful natural resource what you might not think of is the complex construction of chemicals and matter that make up the trees of a forest  nor of the countless ways these can be broken down and used yet this is the reality of forests from essential oils to sturdy packaging to powerful adhesives trees are used to create a range of products that make daily life possible and as awareness of the need to reduce plastic consumption grows research into forest products and how they can replace the lessenvironmentally friendly objects is growing here we look at five of the most common products used today and maybe in the future that owe something to forests adhesives from tall oil anyone who has encountered tree sap can attest trees are made up of some pretty sticky stuff and its because of this that they have long been a source for adhesives production  from glue to cement the substance that makes this possible is known as tall oil named after the swedish word tallolja  meaning pine oil it is a byproduct of pulping coniferous trees tall oil has been produced commercially since the 1930s when the invention of the recovery boiler made it possible to extract it from the kraft pulping process  however the resins and waxes tall oil is made up of have a longer history these are also known as naval products due to their historic use in ship building and can be tapped directly from living trees today tall oil is also used in asphalt roofing as well as medical and cosmetic applications one of tall oils most exciting uses is as bioverno  a renewable alternative to diesel made in the worlds first commercialscale biorefinery in finland disinfectants and detergents from turpentine tapping trees has historically been a means of extracting multiple useful substances and one of the most versatile of these is turpentine this yellowish liquid is produced from distilled tree resin and has a long history of uses turpentine has been used since roman times as torch or lamp fuel but its antiseptic properties also means it was often used as medicine while doctors today would advise against drinking turpentine as was prescribed in the past it is still used today in disinfectants detergents and cleaning products giving off a fresh pinelike odour fuels to replace fossils biomass pellets from working forests are just one of the ways trees are providing renewable energy one other form is cellulosic ethanol a new second generation of liquid biofuel rather than competing with food supply often a concern in the creation of biodiesels cellulosic ethanol is made from nonfood based materials such as forest and agricultural residues left behind after harvest  wheat straw  and timber processing wastes including sawdust it is now being produced at a commercial scale in europe the us and brazil  woody biomass can also be converted into a petroleum substitute known as pyrolysis oil or biooil biomass is transformed into this dark brown liquid by heating it to 500 o c in an oxygendeprived environment and then allowing it to cool biooil has a much higher energy density than biomass in chip or pellet form and after upgrading can be used as jet fuel or as a petroleum alternative in chemical manufacturing  vanilla ice cream and carbon fibre from lignin lignin is what gives trees their tough woody quality  and after cellulose is the worlds second most abundant natural polymer polymers are very long molecules made up of many smaller molecules joined endtoend most often associated with plastic which is a synthetic polymer lignin is generally a waste product from the paper pulping process and is often burnt as fuel however it can also serve as a vanilla flavouring  a property that may make lignin an important resource in the face of an impending vanilla pod shortage  futurelooking research however aims to unlock much more from the 50 million tonnes of lignin produced every year globally  one of the most promising of these is as an alternative source of a family of organic compound known as phenylpropanoids  these are normally extracted from petroleum and are hugely useful in producing plastics and carbon fibre as well as drugs and paint nanocellulose and the future of forest products cellulose is already one of the most important products to come from forests thanks to its role in paper production however this abundant substance  which is also the primary material in the cell walls of all green plants  holds even more potential by shrinking cellulose down to a nano level it can be configured to be very strong while remaining very light  this opens it up as a product with many possibilities including using it as a source of bioplastics  some bioplastics  polylactic acid pha pbs and starch blends  are biodegradable alternatives to fossil fuelbased plastics and could potentially help solve some of the worlds mostpressing waste issues not all biobased plastics are biodegradable however the property of biodegradation doesnt depend on the resource basis of a material  it is linked to its chemical structure in other words 100 biobased plastics may be nonbiodegradable and 100 fossilbased plastics can biodegrade biobased plastics that are not biodegradable include polyethylene terephthalate polyurethanes polyamide polyethylene polyethylenefuranoate or pef is recyclable can be manufactured without fossil fuels and while not biodegradable has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to the oilbased plastic used to make water bottles celluloses combination of strength and light weight has also attracted interest from the auto industry in the ability to help cars become much lighter and therefore more fuel efficient  its flexible strong transparent nature can also make nanocellulose  an important material in helping bring bendable screens  batteries cosmetics paper pharmaceuticals optical sensors and devices to market the idea of using trees as a source of goods and products in everyday life might sound archaic but in reality weve only just tapped the surface of what the chemicals and materials theyre made of can do markus mannström from finnish renewables company stora enso said recently that we believe that everything made from fossilbased materials today can be made from a tree tomorrow as research advances trees and forests will only play a bigger role in a more sustainable future tags technology  forests  forestry and forest management and arboriculture forestry 40 26 july 2018 sustainable bioenergy around the world industries are undergoing profound change the phrase industry 40 describes this emerging era when the combination of data and automation is transforming longestablished practices and business models autonomous cars are perhaps one of most widelyknown examples of smart technology slowly inching towards daily life but they are far from the only example there is almost no sector untouched by this oncoming digital disruption  even industries as old as forestry are being transformed from smart and selfdriving vehicles to datacrunching drones forestry 40 is ushering in a new era for efficient and sustainable forest management drones and data if the first industrial revolution was powered by steam the fourth is being powered by data collecting information on every aspect of a process allows smart devices and machines to cut out inefficiencies and optimise a task in forestry capturing and utilising huge amounts of data can build a better understanding of the land and trees that make up forests one of the best ways to gather this data from wide complex landscapes is through aerial imaging satellites have long been used to monitor the changing nature of the worlds terrain and in 2021 the european space agency plans to use radar in orbit to weigh and monitor the weight of earths forests  but with the rise of drones aerial imagining technology is becoming more widely accessible now even smallscale farmers and foresters can take a birdseye view of their land oxfordbased company biocarbon engineering focuses on replanting areas of forests it utilises drone technology to scan environments and identify features such as obstacles and terrain types which it uses to design and optimise planting patterns a drone then follows this path roughly three to six feet off the ground shooting biodegradable seed pods into the ground every six seconds along the way biocarbon claims this approach can allow it to plant as many as 100000 trees in a single day gathering data on the health of working forests doesnt necessarily require cuttingedge equipment either in the smartphone era any forestry professional now has the computing power in their pocket to capture detailed information about a forests condition mobile app moti was designed by researchers at the school of agricultural forest and food sciences at the bern university of applied sciences in switzerland it allows users to scan an area of forest with a phones camera and receive calculatedestimates on variables such as trees per hectare tree heights and the basal area land occupied by tree trunks automating the harvest capturing data from forests can play a huge part in developing a better understanding of the land terrain and trees of working forests which leads to better decision making for healthier forests including how and when to harvest and thin  but the equipment and technology carrying out these tasks on the ground are also undergoing smarttech transformations selfdriving and electric vehicles are expected to disrupt multiple industries including forestry swedish startup einride recently unveiled a driverless fully electric truck that can haul as much as 16tonnes of lumber and is specially designed for offroad often unmapped terrain there are some pieces of equipment however that will be harder to fully automate  for example harvesters which are used to fell and remove trees their long diggerlike arm normally features a head consisting of a chainsaw clawgrips and rollers all in one which are controlled from the vehicles cab even as image recognition and sensors improve automating these types of machines entirely is hugely challenging an ideal use of artificial intelligence ai would be enabling a harvester to identify trees of a particular age or species to remove as part of thinning for example without disturbing the rest of the forest however trees of the same species and age can differ from each other depending on factors such as regional climates soil and even lighting at the time of analysis this makes programming a machine to harvest a specific species and age of tree is very difficult nevertheless innovation such as intelligent boom control  as john deere is exploring  can help human operators automate movements and make harvesting safer and more efficient forestry has always changed as technology has advanced  from the invention of the axe to the incorporation of ecology  and the digital revolution is no different smart sensors and deeper data will ultimately help optimise the
