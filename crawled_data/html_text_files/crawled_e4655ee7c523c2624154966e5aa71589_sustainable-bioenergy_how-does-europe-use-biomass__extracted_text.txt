different ways across countries and cultures 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy at the heart of norse folklore is a figure called yggdrasil that connects its nine worlds and gods its an immensely important and holy icon but it is not a god itself  it is an ash tree that the central figure of mythical scandinavian cosmology should be something as humble as a tree is no surprise scandinavia is a heavily forested region sweden the largest country in the area is more than 68 forest wood is an inherent part of life there for thousands of years its been used as a resource and a fuel and today is no different throughout much of europe the same is true but while historically wood was used only for cooking heating and light today its use as a form of energy also includes generating electricity and heat when formed into compressed wood pellets europe and wood pellets nearly 22 million tonnes mt of wood pellets were used in the european union in 2015 making the region the leading wood pellet consumer in the world it is also the worlds leading producer creating roughly half of the worlds global output  largely from european trees a report from the standing forestry committee set up to represent the forestry industries in eu countries found that just 4 of the woody biomass used in the eu was imported of the 22mt used across europe 105mt was used for heating while 115mt was used for industrial uses like fueling power plants but in the uk the level of wood used for fuel falls some way behind eu averages thanks in large part to drax and its transition from coal to renewable wood pelletpowered electricity generation thats changing but the uk still has a way to go to catch the continental average where is the uk falling behind and how is wood being used to power the rest of the continent here we look at some of the largest consumers and producers of biomass in europe and how its being used sweden sweden is the third highest consumer of wood as a source of energy in europe trailing only finland and latvia in its use a key use of biomass in sweden is powering district heating systems in a district heating system rather than each building or home having its own boiler whole areas of cities are heated through a single central plant distributing heat to buildings these plants can be powered by a variety of fuels but many run on wood pellets or distribute the waste heat captured at power plants germany in 1713 an accountant and mining administrator hans carl von carlowitz published what is considered the first ever book to look in depth at forestry management effectively kickstarting the modern idea of sustainable forestry in the 300 years that have passed germany has embraced the cultivation of wood and has made wood and biomass a fixed part of its energy makeup more recently the renewable energy heating act and market incentive programme was passed in 2009 which requires new building owners to provide a percentage of their heat from renewable sources including woodfired boilers the aim is to increase the countrys share of renewable heat to 14 by 2020 finland nearly three quarters of finland is forestland making it one of the most forested countries in the world let alone europe as a result wood plays a large part in finnish culture stora enso one of the worlds leading paper and packaging manufacturers is finnish and more than 20 of the countrys exports are from wood and wood products coupled with a strong focus generating much of its energy from renewables energy derived from wood and products made from wood is high united kingdom in 2013 less than 10 of all energy used in the uk was generated from wood and wood products this places it some way behind countries like germany and sweden in part owing to a lack of infrastructure for providing heating derived from wood and wood biomass this could change if the government continues to back technologies equally in initiatives like the renewable heat incentive rhi available to homeowners landlords and commercial customers rhi provides incentives for installing generators of renewable heat such as wood pellet boilers  to reach climate goals the then department of energy and climate change noted that both biomassdriven electricity generation and heating should continue to increase in the uk and with the upgrade of drax and lynemouth power stations from coal to compressed wood pellets there are positive signs the uk can catch up to the european biomass average in doing so renewable biomass electricity generation can also help increase wind and solar power generation in the uk and help create a more sustainable energy future share related stories electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero press releases drax group ceo will
