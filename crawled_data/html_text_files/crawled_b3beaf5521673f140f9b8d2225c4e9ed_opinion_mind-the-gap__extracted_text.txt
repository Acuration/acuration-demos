the gap in the past year alone more than 5 gigawatts of coal power generation has come off grid drax group ceo dorothy thompson looks at which energy technologies might plug the gap dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 28 july 2016 opinion later today the edf board is expected to give the goahead for a new nuclear power station at hinkley this will provide some long overdue clarity for britains energy sector but we now need to quickly move on and make the right decisions to secure the best mix of power generation the drawn out debate around hinkley point c has diverted attention away from the sectors biggest challenge the government has made it clear that coal must come off the system by 2025 but coal still provides up to one fifth of the uks electricity and plugging that gap will be far from easy nor will doing so in a way that allows the country to meet its carbon targets while supporting the technologies that will deliver a modern energy system fit for the 21st century the governments intention is absolutely right but how does it intend to meet its target lets be clear a positive hinkley point c decision will play an important role in the necessary energy mix but will provide no silver bullet by most estimates when finally complete the nuclear plant will provide seven percent of the uks electricity needs however this isnt expected to come on grid much before 2030 and lets remember that in 2030 all but one of the uks current operating nuclear reactors are scheduled to be closed hinkley will therefore be replacing only some of the lost nuclear capacity not providing new energy to replace coal the last few years have seen a huge and welcome expansion in renewable sources of generation like wind and solar in the uk but they are intermittent and cannot fill the gap alone they still need to be supported by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine  a regular scenario on these shores as a form of lowcarbon baseload generation nuclear will undoubtedly be part of the answer however as weve already seen with hinkley point c planning funding and building new power stations can be a long and costly process  it has taken over a decade to reach todays decision in the past year alone more than 5 gigawatts gw of coal power generation hinkley point c is set to provide 32 gw  has come off grid well before the governments target of 2025  we dont have the luxury of time every day lost adds to the cost of addressing this challenge gas will play a role but many including the institution of mechanical engineers imeche have pointed out the huge number of gasfired power stations well need to plug the gap that ending coal creates  imeche estimates 30 will be required which is clearly unrealistic since the uk has built just four in the last 10 years at drax we have developed a solution to these challenges  we have used state of the art technology to upgrade some of our coal facilities to generate electricity from biomass in place of coal these facilities are already providing a reliable and flexible flow of electricity that also helps the uk meet its carbon targets the biomass we use is compressed wood pellets which perform in much the same way as coal and deliver an 80 co 2 saving our biomass facilities are already powering three million homes and with the right support we can double this helping to plug the energy gap that old plant coming off and delays to new build will leave us with using biomass is more costeffective than other renewables this was illustrated by a recent study from imperial college and economic consultancy nera when they analysed the hidden costs of the backup needed to meet demand created by intermittent renewables  our biomass facilities can provide all of the electricity services required to keep the uk electricity system stable providing these services is set to become increasingly important in the years ahead as a greater need to backup and balance the system will be required finding the right mix of power generation will not be easy but it is important we make every effort to get it right like hinkley point c biomass is not a silver bullet but it can and must play its part in helping the country transform to a lowcarbon future  share most read
