widespread sources of electricity generation in the world  it is also one of the biggest nine of the worlds ten largest power stations are hydro powered  facilities such as the three gorges dam on chinas yangtze river and the itaipu dam pictured below on the brazilparaguay border are capable of generating massive amounts of electricity  itaipu dam hydroelectric power station on the brazilparaguay border but hydropower can also be very effective at a smaller more local level using relatively small rivers these smaller hydro facilities can bring renewable electricity to remote areas and serve local needs all they need is an abundance of flowing water to spin their turbines in scotland two schemes are making use of the countrys plentiful water sources to help the local community the economy and the surrounding environment turning river waterflow into power the lanark and galloway hydropower schemes are both located in rural scotland and have been generating power for nearly a century despite being more than 95 kilometres apart they operate in very similar ways lanark which includes two power stations  bonnington with a capacity of 11 mw and stonebyres with a capacity of 6 mw sits on the river clyde and began generating power in 1926 making it one of the oldest hydroelectric plants in great britain galloway soon followed coming online in the mid1930s it includes a total of six power stations  glenlee tongland kendoon drumjohn earlstoun and carsfad  eight dams and a network of tunnels and pipelines giving it a capacity of 109 mw kendoon power station turbine hall there was always potential for hydro in the galloway hills but there wasnt demand for 100 mw of power explains stuart ferns operations and maintenance manager on the lanark and galloway hydro schemes however when the national grid was established in the 1920s it enabled surplus power to be transmitted beyond the local area to glasgow and further afield unlike lanark which is situated about halfway down the river clyde the galloway scheme spans the entirety of its river system from loch doon in the north to tongland in the south both however cover a similarly sized catchment area of roughly 1000 square kilometres where they do differ is in the type of hydropower they generate and the needs they serve for their regions and the wider electricity grid tongland dam lanarks power stations generate electricity through whats called runoftheriver hydropower which describes a scheme where there is no dam to stop and store water along the river instead water from a flowing river is diverted into a power station situated alongside the river here the water is used to spin a turbine connected to a generator before being returned back to the river lanarks two power stations are both positioned alongside naturally occurring waterfalls which allow them to take advantage of the natural gravitational pressure the lanark stations run constantly says om manager stuart ferns they will run as long as there is water in the river and generally there is always some water available the galloway system is different it only generates power when there are peaks in electricity demand to do this it operates a conventional storage hydro scheme where dams situated along the river are used to create small reservoirs when demand for electricity peaks  typically between 5pm and 7pm  water is released from these reservoirs and used to spin turbines and generate electricity during the day both schemes are monitored and controlled from glenlee power station halfway down the galloway route as night falls responsibility instead falls to the control room at cruachan power station  more than 200 kilometres away aroundtheclock monitoring in this way is important as the uncertainty of scotlands weather can have effects on the schemes and on their surrounding environment penstocks leading to glenlee power station working with the landscape dumfries  galloway and lanarkshire are regions defined and dominated by their river systems as such extreme weather can lead to occasional natural flooding the lanark and galloway schemes not only have to be diligent in working with extreme weather but they can actually play a role in monitoring and managing it the galloway reservoirs help to alleviate flooding because they can store water and help to alleviate flooding downstream says ferns staff at the scheme work closely with local authorities landowners and the scottish environment protection agency sepa sharing their weather forecasting and reservoir level data to help them predict which areas will be affected and when roads might need to be closed or even villages evacuated the team takes a similar approach to monitoring and protecting the local wildlife fish such as north atlantic salmon and trout migrate upstream from the ocean through the galloway rivers using manmade fish passes also known as fish ladders which allow fish to bypass dams along the scheme waterfalls on the clyde at lanark lanarks natural waterfalls mean it is not a route taken by migratory fish however ensuring there is always enough water in the rivers to protect fish and plant life factors into how both schemes operate with the landscape working with the wildlife weather and surrounding environment of the two rivers have always been a part of running the lanark and galloway schemes their continued role in the regions electricity system highlights the relevancy of smallscale hydropower even as demand for electricity grows tags electricity generation  galloway hydro scheme

hydroelectric power  investors  lanark hydro scheme winter on the hollow mountain 15 january 2020 power generation scotlands landscape is defined by its weather the millennia of wind rain and snow has battered the country ebbing away at its rivers mountains valleys and deep lochs forged by ice ages and volcanos weather also plays an important role in the countrys power generation the country has more than 9 gigawatts gw of installed wind power  enough to sometimes meet double scotlands electricity demand  as well as having a long history of hydropower but while it is an intrinsic part of the country scotlands weather can be anything but pleasant rain can be persistent and when the temperature drops in winter it turns to snow  a lot of it scotland gets more snow than any other part of the uk scottish poet robert burns described the harshness of the winter months in his 1781 poem winter a dirge the wintry west extends his blast and hail and rain does blaw or the stormy north sends driving forth the blinding sleet and snaw sleet and snaw snow fall occurs on average for 38 days a year in scotland compared to an average of 23 days across the rest of the united kingdom and can remain covering mountaintops long into spring ben cruachan the peak of ben cruachan in the western highlands is no exception cruachan power station  on the slopes of the mountain however must be ready to either generate or absorb electricity through all forms of weather  even the most severe on a few occasions the snowfall has been so extreme that weve been unable to access the dam for a few weeks at a time says gordon pirie a civil engineer at cruachan thankfully we have enough controls in place where we are still able to monitor and operate things remotely mountain road from cruachan power station to its dam blocked due to snow this mountainside location and winter weather can make for tough working conditions but cruachan is designed to handle it in fact in some cases it benefits from it taking advantage of wet weather cruachan is built around the geography and climate of the highlands it stores water in an upper reservoir 400 meters 1312 feet up ben cruachan and uses its elevation to run it down the mountain spin a turbine and generate power and when there is excess electricity being generated nationally the same turbines reverse and use the excess electricity to pump water from loch awe up to the reservoir helping to balance the grid this acts as a form of energy storage by essentially stockpiling the excess electricity in the form of water held in the top reservoir for the most part the water used to generate electricity comes exclusively from loch awe and is passed up and down the mountain however 10 of it comes for free as its collected from natural rainfall and surface water that makes its way to the upper reservoir through cruachans aqueducts this system of 14 kilometres of interconnected concrete pipes covers a 23 square kilometre radius around the reservoir and is designed to bring in water from 75 intakes dotted around the top of the mountain a north of scotland hydroelectric board diagram from c1960s showing the aqueducts feeding cruachans dam click to viewdownload some of these intakes are as small as street drains while others are large enough to drive a land rover into its part of piries job to keep them in good working order so they continue to deliver water to the reservoir as the intakes are scattered around the mountaintop they must be able to deal with whatever the scottish winter throws at them gordon pirie civil engineer and cruachan power station dam even in freezing conditions the water will still flow through the aqueduct system the intakes have a builtin feature which allows the water to flow into them even if the surface is frozen solid explains pirie any snow or frost on the ground eventually thaws and makes its way to the reservoir as spring arrives and snow begins to thaw across the highlands greater volumes of water will run off into the reservoir and the power stations engineers work to manage the water level keeping water pressure under control thawing snow can bring greater volumes of water into the reservoir the power station must be able to pump water and absorb excess electricity from the grid at a moments notice this ability to turn excess electricity into stored energy makes cruachan hugely useful in controlling the grids voltage frequency and in keeping it stable  however there must be enough space available in the reservoir for the water being pumped up the mountainside to enter  even when excessive rainfall or melting snow begins to naturally fill it up the power station can control the reservoir levels through a number of means this includes the ability to close off an aqueduct or to run the turbines without generating electricity so the team can move water from the reservoir into loch awe below if the water level and pressure on the dam reaches dangerous levels a dispenser valve can be opened in an emergency sending a jet of water flying out the dam to cascade safely down the mountainside however outside of testing this has never been necessary to do and while the weather might be the most persistent natural force the power station must deal with its not the only one recently we had an issue with a bat roosting within one of the tunnels in which we were carrying out stabilisation works recalls pirie it was looking for a suitable location to hibernate for the winter and the tunnel provided the ideal environment we had to stop works to have a bat survey undertaken and apply for a bat license cruachans location makes for stunning views of the highlands but occasionally brutally cold and perilously wet conditions come with the territory for the power station team working with the sometimesdespairing weather is all part of what allows the hollow mountain to operate as it has done for more than half a century the highlands around ben

highlands towards the west coast of scotland you pass the mighty ben cruachan  its 1126 metre peak towers over the winding loch awe beneath it is the natural world on a huge scale but within its granite core sits a manmade engineering wonder cruachan power station  opened by the queen in 1965 it is one of only four pumpedhydro stations in the uk and today remains just as impressive an engineering feat as when it was first opened cruachan is operated safely and hasnt had a lost time injury in 15 years the robust health and safety policies and practices employed at the power station were not in place all those decades ago it took six years to construct enlisting a 4000strong workforce who drilled blasted and cleared the rocks from the inside of the mountain eventually removing some 220000 cubic metres of rubble the work was physically exhausting  the environment dark and dangerous nicknamed the tunnel tigers the men that carried the work out came from far and wide attracted to its ambition as well as a generous pay packet reflective of the danger and difficulty of the work but few of them were fully prepared for the extent of the challenge one labourer who started at cruachan just after his 18 th birthday recalls i was in for a shock when i went down there the heat the smoke  you couldnt see your hands in front of you inside the mountain the work of hollowing out ben cruachan was realised by handdrilling twotothree metre deep holes into the granite rockface an explosive known as gelignite which can be moulded by hand was packed into the drilled holes and detonated the blasted rocks were removed by bulldozers trucks and shovels before drilling began on the fresh section of exposed granite in total 20km of tunnels and chambers were excavated this way including the kilometrelong entrance tunnel and the 91metrelong 36metrehigh machine hall wilson scott was just 18 when he got a job working as a labourer at cruachan while the machine hall was being cleared out the gelignite it had a smell right away i was told not to put it near your face he says itll give you a splitting headache and your eyes will close with the fumes that come off it it was scary stuff this process allowed for rapid expansion through the mountain with three or four blasts each 12hour shift some 20 metres of rock could be cleared in the course of a day activity was constant and to save the men having to make the journey back up to the surface refreshments came to them there was a bus that went down the tunnel at 11 oclock with a huge urn of terrible tea says scott most of the windows were out of the bus because the pressure of the blasting had blown them in the tea did little to make the environment hospitable however from the water dripping through the porous rocks making floors slippery and exposed electrics vulnerable to the massive machinery rushing through the dense dust and smoke danger was everpresent loose rocks as large as cars would often fall from exposed walls and ceilings while the regular blasting gave the impression the entire mountain was shaking ill tell you something going into that tunnel the first time scott says it was a fascinating place but quite a scary place too above them on top of the mountain a similarly intrepid team tackled a different challenge building the 316metrelong dam they may have escaped the hot and humid conditions at the centre of cruachan but their task was no less daunting cruachan dam construction early 1960s on top of the dam out in the open 400 metres above loch awe the team were exposed to the harsh scottish elements john william ross came to cruachan at the age of 35 to work as a driver and spent time working in the open air of the dam youd get oil skins and welly boots and that was it we didnt have gloves if your hands froze  well thats tough luck isnt it mr ross sadly passed away recently charlie campbell a 19yearold shutter joiner who worked on the dam found an innovative way around the cold youd put on your socks and then youd get womens tights and youd put them over the top of the socks and then youd put your wellies on and thatd keep your feet a wee bit warmer we thought it did anyway maybe it was just the thought of the womens stockings pouring the concrete of the dam  almost 50 metres high at its tallest point  was precarious work especially given the challenges of working with materials like concrete and bentonite a slurrylike liquid used in construction it was horrible stuff it was like diarrhoea thats the only way of explaining it says campbell there was a boy  toastie  i cant remember his real name he fell into it they had quite a job getting him out they thought he was drowned but he was alright many others were not alright the danger of the work and conditions both inside and on top of the mountain meant there was a significant human cost for the project during construction 15 people tragically lost their lives today a carved wooden mural hangs on the wall of the machine hall to capture and commemorate the myth of the mountain and the men who sadly died  a constant reminder of the bravery and sacrifice they made the men that made the mountain the cruachan tunnel tigers the tunnel tigers were united in their efforts but came from a range of backgrounds and cultures polish and irish labourers worked alongside scots as well as displaced europeans prisoners of the second world war and even workers from as far as asia the men would work 12 sometimes 18hour shifts seven days a week campbell adds that some men opted to continue earning rather than rest by doing a ghoster which saw them working a solid 36 hours many men would make treble the salary of their previous jobs with some receiving as much as 100 a week at a time when the average pay in scotland was 12 some teams payslips were stamped with the words danger money  illustrative of the mens motivation to endure such lifethreatening work while it was a dangerous and demanding job many of the tigers look back with fond memories of their time on the site and many stayed in the area for years after it was an experience im glad i had says scott it puts you in good stead for the rest of your days as for cruachan power station its four turbines are still relied on today by great britain to balance everyday energy supply as the electricity system continues to change the pumped hydro stations dual ability to deliver 440 megawatts mw of electricity in just 30 seconds or absorb excess power from the grid by pumping water from loch awe to its upper reservoir

 energy storage  engineering  hydroelectric power  technology a brief history of scottish hydropower 1 october 2019 power generation over the last century scottish hydro power has played a major part in the countrys energy make up while today it might trail behind wind solar and biomass as a source of renewable electricity in great britain it played a vital role in connecting vast swathes of rural scotland to the power grid  some of which had no electricity as late as the 1960s and all by making use of two plentiful scottish resources water and mountains but the road to hydro adoption has been varied and difficult travelled on by brave deathdefying construction workers ingenious engineers and the inspirational leadership of a scottish politician to trace where the history of scottish hydropower began we need to go back to the end of the 19 th century and to the banks of loch ness loch ness scottish highlands from abbeys to aluminium it was on the shores of loch ness that one of the first known hydroelectric schemes was built at the fort augustus benedictine abbey the scheme provided power to the monks living there as well as 800 village residents  though legend has it that their lights went dim every time the monks played their organ however it was the british aluminium company formed in 1894 that first realised the huge potential of scotlands steep mountains lochs and reliably heavy rainfall to generate substantial amounts of hydro power in need of a reliable source of electricity to help turn raw bauxite into aluminium the firm established a hydroelectric plant and smelting works at foyers and loch ness several similar schemes to support the aluminium industry soon appeared around the country but it took another 20 years for the first major hydropower project to supply electricity to the public to emerge in 1926 the clyde valley electrical power co opened the lanark hydro electric scheme  which used energy from the river clydes flow to create power now owned by drax it still has a generation capacity of 17 mw  enough to supply more than 15000 homes  river clyde lanark it was quickly followed by power stations at rannoch and tummel in the grampian mountains and in 1935 by what became a highly influential scheme in the history of scottish hydro power at galloway drawing enough energy from local rivers to support five generating power stations the project was the largest runoftheriver scheme ever created architecturally it also set the tone for later projects with stylised dams and modernist turbine halls a fairer share of power for the highlands the galloway scheme supplied energy to a wide area too including parts of the central highlands scottish labour mp tom johnston a staunch socialist and scottish patriot saw how this new power source could provide massive benefits to northern communities in the early 1940s only an estimated one in six scottish farms and one in a hundred small land crofts had electricity in 1941 johnston became scotlands minister for state with a vision as he put it to create largescale reforms that might mean scotia resurgent expanding hydro power was a priority tom johnston mp two years later he formed the north of scotland hydroelectric board nsheb its aim was to create several new schemes including at tummel and loch sloy that would supply the national grid and bring electricity to more rural scottish areas the projects were met with fierce opposition from landowners and local pressure groups who feared new dams and power stations would ruin the countryside and bring unwelcome industrialisation public enquiries followed but the boards promises that the developments would be sensitive to the environment and bring cheap electricity in areas such as the isle of skye and loch ewe eventually won the day thousands of local men as well as german and italian former prisoners of war  were drafted in to work on the projects among the most courageous were workers known as tunnel tigers who blasted away rock using handheld drills and gelignite to create water channels and underground chambers including at draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro station  deaths caused by everything from blast injuries to fires were common the men also had to cope with incessant rain and cold and were housed in bleak militarystyle camps with little to do in their spare time besides drink fights would break out regularly but the financial rewards were enormous with wages up to ten times higher than labourers employed on highland estates could expect glenlee penstocks the future takes shape the boards first small projects were completed in 1948 at morar and nostie bridge supplying electricity to areas including parts of wester ross catherine mackenzie a local widow performed the morar opening ceremony reportedly declaring let light and power come to the crofts bigger schemes were plagued by problems conveyor belts had to be built to transport stone across 175 miles of moor during construction at sloy for instance and there were frequent stone and timber shortages but sloy eventually opened in 1950 the largest conventional hydro electrical power station in great britain with an installed capacity of 128 mw it would be followed by major schemes at glen affric and loch shin by the mid sixties the board had built 54 main power stations and 78 dams northern scotland was now 90 connected to the national grid hydro board shops began popping up on high streets selling appliances and collecting bill payments tom johnston died in 1965 aged 83 the provost of inverness declared no words can say how grateful we are loch awe beside cruachan power station that same year the worlds then largest reversible pumped storage power station opened at cruachan during times of low electricity demand its turbines pump water from loch awe to the reservoir above when demand rises the turbines reverse and water flows down to generate power a similar scheme opened at foyes in 1974 glendoe near loch ness was the mostrecent major hydro scheme to be built opening in 2009 it has a generation capacity of 100 mw there are plans for a pumped storage scheme at coire glas  with a storage capacity of 30 gwh  more than doubling great britains current total pumped storage capacity draxs cruachan power station could also be expanded in recent years however the real growth has been in smaller hydroelectric schemes that may power just one or a handful of properties  with more than 100 mw of such generation capacity installed in the highlands since 2006 boosting the environment and economy scotland now provides 85 of great britains hydroelectric resource with a total generation capacity of 1500 mw improved power supplies have attracted more industry to the highlands without seriously altering its character and access roads created during hydropower schemes construction have opened up remote areas to tourism for many the dams built by nsheb are among the greatest construction achievements in postwar europe and remain an essential part of great britains attempts to move towards a lowcarbon energy future tags engineering  galloway hydro scheme  hydroelectric power  lanark hydro scheme  technology in energy storage timing is everything 21 august 2019 power generation electricity is unlike any other resource the amount being generated must exactly match demand for it around the clock managing this delicate balancing act is the job of the national grid electricity system operator eso which works constantly to ensure supply meets demand and the grid remains balanced  one of the ways it does this is by storing energy when there is too much and deploying it when there is too little although there are many different ways of storing energy at a small scale at grid level it becomes more difficult one of the few ways it is currently possible is through pumped hydro storage cruachan power station in the highlands of scotland is one of four pumped storage facilities in great britain it uses electricallydriven turbines to pump water up a mountain into a reservoir when there is excess electricity on the grid and then releases the water stored in the reservoir back down to spin the same turbines to generate power when its needed quickly the dual capabilities of these turbines are unique to pumped hydro storage and contribute to the overall grids stability however what dictates when cruachans turbines switch from pump to generate and vice versa is all a matter of what the grid needs  and when the switch from pump to generate while the machine hall of cruachan power station is an aweinspiring place for its size and location 396 metres beneath ben cruachan it generates electricity much like any other hydropower station harnessing the flow of water to rotate any number of its four 100 megawatt mw turbines this mode  simply called generate mode  is usually employed during periods of peak power demand such as mornings and evenings during a major national televised event  or when wind and solar energy output drops below forecast as a result starting up and generating millions of watts of electricity has to be fast it takes just two minutes for a turbine to run up from rest to generate mode says martin mcghie operations and maintenance manager at the power station it takes slightly longer for the turbines to run down from generate to rest but whatever function the turbines are performing they can reach it within a matter of minutes the reverse of generate mode is pump mode which changes the direction of travel for the water this time using electricity from the grid to pump water from the vast loch awe at the foot of ben cruachan to the upper reservoir where it waits ready to be released in contrast to generate mode pump mode typically comes into play at times when demand is low and there is too much power on the system such as during nights or at weekends when there is excessive wind generation  however the grid has evolved since cruachan first began generating in 1965 and this has changed when it and how it operates in the early days cruachan was used in a rather predictable way pumping overnight to absorb excess generation from coal and nuclear plants and generating during daytime peak periods says martin the move to more renewable energy sources like wind mean overall power generation is more unpredictable he continues there has also been a move from cruachan being primarily an energy storage plant to one which can also offer a range of ancillary services to the grid system operator the benefits of spin mode in between pumping water and generating power cruachans turbines can also spin in air while connected to the grid neither pumping not generating this is essentially a standby mode where the turbines are ready to either quickly switch into generation or pumping at a moments notice they spin one way for spin pump the other for spin generate these spin modes are requested by the eso to ensure reserve energy is available to respond rapidly to changes on the grid system in spin generate mode the generator is connected up to the grid but the water is ejected from the space around the turbine by injecting compressed air the turbine does not generate power but is kept spinning allowing it to quickly start up again as soon as the grid has an urgent need for power the air is released and the water from the upper reservoir flows into the turbine to begin generation in under 30 seconds spin pump works on the same basis as spin generate but with the turbine rotating in the opposite direction ready to pump at short notice this allows cruachan to absorb excess generation and balance the system as soon as the eso needs it the use of spin mode by the eso is highly variable and dependant on a number of factors eg weather conditions or the state of the grid system at the time says martin this unpredictability of the increasingly intermittent electricity system makes the flexibility of cruachans multiple turbines all the more important ready for the future grid its not only the types of electricity generation around the system that are changing how cruachan operates martin suggests that the way energy traders and the eso use cruachan will continue to evolve as the market requirements and opportunities change technology is also changing the market and martin predicts this could affect what cruachan does in the future we will face competition from alternative storage technologies such as batteries electric vehicles  as well as competition for the other ancillary services we offer however cruachans flexibility to generate absorb or spin in readiness means it is prepared to adjust to any future changes cruachan is always ready to modify or upgrade to meet requirements as we have done in the past says martin the priority is always to be able to deliver the services required by the grid system operator  in characteristic quick time visit

grid  technology what makes a mountain right for energy storage 22 may 2019 power generation electricity generation is often tied to a countrys geography climate and geology  as an island great britains long coastline makes offshore wind a key part of its renewable electricity while iceland can rely on its geothermal activity as a source of power and heat one of the most geographicallyinfluenced sources of electricity is hydropower a site needs a great enough volume of water flowing through it and the right kind of terrain to construct a dam to harness it even more dependent on the landscape is pumped hydro storage pumped storage works by pumping water from one source up a mountain to a higher reservoir and storing it when the water is released it rushes down the same shafts it was pumped up spinning a turbine to generate electricity the advantage of this is being able to store the potential energy of the water and rapidly deliver electricity to plug any gaps in generation  for example when the wind suddenly dropsor when great britain instantly requires a lot more power  this specific type of electricity generation can only function in a specific type of landscape and the scottish highlands offers a location that ticks all the boxes the perfect spot for pumped storage cruachan power station  a pumped hydro facility capable of providing 440 megawatts mw of electricity sits on the banks of loch awe in the highlands ready to deliver power in just 30 seconds here there is a minimum distance between the two water sources with a maximum drop says gordon pirie civil engineer at cruachan power station it is an ideal site for pumped storage the challenge in constructing pumped storage is finding a location where two bodies of water are in close proximity but at severely different altitudes from the lochside the landscape rises at a dramatic angle to reach 1126 metres 3694 feet above sea level at the summit of ben cruachan the highest peak in the argyll the crest of cruachan dam sits 4008 metres 1315 feet up the slopes creating a reservoir in a rocky corrie between ridges the four 100 mw turbines which also act as pumps lie a kilometre inside the mountains rock the horizontal distance and the vertical distance between water sources is whats called the pipetolength ratio explains pirie its what determines whether or not the site is economically viable for pumped storage the higher water is stored the more potential energy it holds that can be converted into electricity however if the distance between the water sources is too great the amount of electricity consumed pumping water up the mountain becomes too great and too expensive the distance between the reservoir and the turbines is also reduced by cruachan power stations defining feature the turbine hall cavern one kilometre inside the mountain carving a power station out of rock the access tunnel cavern and the networks of passageways and chambers that make up the power station were all blasted and drilled by a workforce of 1300 men in the late 1950s to early 1960s  affectionately known as the tunnel tigers this was dangerous work however the rock type of the mountainside was another geographic advantage of the region its the diorite and phyllite rock essentially granite so its a hard rock but its actually a softer type of granite and thats also why cruachan was chosen as the location says pirie the right landscape and geology was essential for establishing a pumped storage station at cruachan however the west highlands also offer another essential factor for hydropower an abundance of water turning water to power the west highlands are one of the wettest parts of europe with some areas seeing average annual rain fall of 3500 millimetres compared to 500 millimetres in some of the driest parts of the uk this abundance of water from rainfall as well as lochs and rivers also contributes to making cruachan so wellsuited to pumped storage the cruachan reservoir can contain more than 10 million cubic metres of water most of this is pumped up from loch awe which at 385 square kilometres is the third largest freshwater loch in scotland loch awe is so big that if cruachan reservoir was fully released into the loch it would only increase the water level by 20 centimetres however the reservoir also makes use of the aqueduct system made up of 19 kilometres of tunnels and pipes that covers 23 square kilometres of the surrounding landscape diverting rainwater and streams into the reservoir calculating quite how much of the reservoirs water comes from the surrounding area is difficult but estimates put it at around a quarter there are 75 concrete intakes dotted around the hills to gather water and carry it through the aqueducts to the reservoir says pirie the smallest intake is about the size of a street drain in the corner of a field and the largest one is about the size of a threebedroom house pumped storage stations offer the electricity system a source of extra power quickly but it takes the right combination of geographical features to make it work ben cruachan just so happens to be one of the spots where the landscape makes it possible tags cruachan power station  electricity generation  energy storage  engineering  hydroelectric power  power station  sustainability  technology is there such a thing as energy terroir 16 april 2019 power generation terroir comes from the french word terre meaning land earth or soil in the french wine industry it refers to the land from which grapes are grown it is believed the terroir gives the grapes a unique quality specific to that particular growing site terroir dictates the type of wine that comes from a region  its the reason we call one bottle a bordeaux and another a côtes du rhone but could the idea of terroir hold relevance beyond just wine what if we looked at electricity in the same way certain environments are better placed to produce certain types of electricity these are some of the regions making the most of their unique location and landscape to produce electricity that makes sense for them la rance tidal barrage brittany france brittany boasts one third of mainland frances coasts and has long been a top destination for surfers with waves as high as 76 metres in some places with such tempestuous waters its the perfect location for la rance tidal power station  the worlds first station of its kind opened in 1966 the site was chosen because it has the highest tidal range in france tidal barrages like la rance harness the potential energy in the difference in height between low and high tides the barrage creates an artificial reservoir to enable different water levels which then drives turbines and generators to produce electricity while the station has been operating for close to 50 years old tidal mills are still dotted around the rance river some dating back to the 15 th century  proof that tidal power has deep roots in this region xinjiang china whilst china may have some of the worlds most polluted cities it is also the worlds biggest producer of renewable energy  including wind power with one of the largest land masses on the planet one in every three of the worlds wind turbines is in china with the government installing one per hour in 2016 in places like xinjiang  chinas most westerly province the windy weather used to be a nuisance with overturned lorries and derailed trains being a regular sight this is caused by mountain ranges between dabancheng and ürümqi which form a natural wind tunnel increasing the wind speed as air passes through these days the region is harnessing this same wind to produce incredible amounts of electricity  with 278 terwatt hours twh of electricity coming from the region in the first nine months of 2018 onshore wind farm in xinjiang xinjiang local wu gang founded goldwind to build chinas first windfarm here in the 1980s today its the worlds second largest turbine maker the turbines work on a simple premise wind turns the turbine blades which are connected to a rotor causing it to spin this in turn is connected to a generator which takes the winds kinetic energy to produce electricity hengill iceland iceland sits where the north american and eurasian tectonic plates meet meaning that magma rises close to the surface bringing with it a lot of energy potential one example of how the icelandic people are harnessing this power is the hellisheiði  the second largest geothermal power station in the world here highpressure geothermal steam is extracted from 30 wells ranging from 2000 to 3000 metres deep and is used to turn turbines and generate electricity this renewable plant has a capacity of 303 megawatts mw of electricity which is used to power the capital city of reykjavik the site was chosen due to its location in the hengill volcanic area in the south of iceland one of the most active geothermal areas on the planet here a giant magma chamber sits underground with thousands of hot springs above according to icelands national energy authority geothermal power from sites like this accounts for 25 of the countrys electricity production and 66 of primary energy usage but icelanders arent only using the geothermal landscape for energy production  chefs here can cook food simply by burying it in the ground producing delicacies like rúgbrauð  which translates as hot spring bread ouarzazate morocco from icelands belowzero temperatures to morocco a popular holiday destination for sunseekers with 330 days of sunshine a year morocco lays claim to a chunk of the sahara desert famously known as one of the hottest climates in the world where better then to situate the worlds largest solar thermal power plant noor solar thermal plant the moroccan city of ouarzazate nicknamed the  door of the desert plays host to the huge noor complex  which is still under construction and is being implemented in four parts the latest piece of the puzzle is noor iii which was hooked up to moroccos electricity grid last year  here 7400 mirrors reflect sun rays onto noor iiis tower the highest solarthermal tower in the world concentrating at the top of the building to create around 500ºc of heat this heats up the molten salts inside the tower which travel through a series of pipes creating high pressure steam this steam then moves a turbine to generate electricity molten salts are used at noor iii because they can operate at high temperatures and store heat effectively so that the site can continue to produce energy for up to 75 hours when theres no sun once up and running the plant will generate enough energy to power 120000 homes with no atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  along with the other projects at the noor complex noor iii is helping morocco to achieve its goal of obtaining 42 of its power from renewable sources by 2020 ben cruachan scotland the sun rays that shine on the noor complex are few and far between in the highlands but there are mountains aplenty  ben cruachan being one of them ben cruachan is the highest point in the argyll and bute area of scotland and is right next to the picturesque loch awe this provides the backdrop for the worlds first high head reversible pumpedstorage hydro scheme built by british engineer edward mccoll over 50 years ago cruachan power stations reservoir and loch awe viewed from the top of ben cruachan with the help of a 4000strong army of workers nicknamed the tunnel tigers  mccoll turned the slopes of ben cruachan into a geological battery which great britain still relies on today it works by using excess electricity on the national grid to pump water from loch awe at the foot of the mountain up to the cruachan reservoir 300 metres above during times of heightened demand  like when everyone puts the kettle on during a coronation street ad break or when the wind speed suddenly drops around breakfast time  this water is released back down the mountain to turn the turbines that live inside the hollowed mountain in this way cruachan power station can meet the nations energy needs within seconds whereas gas or nuclear stations would take many tens of minutes or hours to reach such capacity while ben cruachan lends itself perfectly to this pumpedstorage hydro facility it is only one of four such sites in the uk the challenge in installing more is that there are only a few sites which are mountainous with suitably large bodies of water nearby  things that are inherently necessary for pumpedstorage hydroelectricity  the growing importance of terroir all of these places embrace the land around them to produce energy in inventive ways and as levels of decarbonisation grow around the world there are an increasing number of places using whats available close to home for energy solutions take barbados  a country that has traditionally relied on imported fossil fuels for 96 of its electricity  but with short driving distances and 220 days of pure sunlight every year the government has seen the potential for electric vehicles run by solar power with modular solar carports now a regular sight in barbados the island has become one of the worlds top users of evs  preserving the picturesque landscape and reducing its dependence on imported petrol solar panels above an office car park in barbados meanwhile palau a small pacific island nation is building the worlds largest microgrid  consisting of 35 mw of solar panels and 45 mwh of energy storage for a nation threatened by rising sea levels making use of its geographic features allows it to work towards its 70 renewable energy target by 2050 and reduce its reliance on imports as more countries continue to move away from fossil fuels taking advantage of their unique terroir will increasingly enable them to produce electricity that works with their landscape tags energy storage  engineering  hydroelectric power  technology the different ways water powers the world 10 april 2019 power generation if the spectacular roman aqueducts that still dot the landscape of europe tell us anything its that hydraulic engineering is nothing new for thousands of years water power has been used to grind wheat saw wood and even tell the time  craigside in northumberland by the 19th century water was able to go beyond performing rudimentary mechanical tasks and generate electricity directly cragside in northumberland england became the first house powered entirely by hydroelectricity in 1878 by 1881 the whole town of niagara falls on the uscanada border was being powered by the force of its eponymous river and waterfall hydropower has many advantages its predictable consistent often zero or low carbon and it can provide a range of ancillary services to power transmission systems in great britain there is 17 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower and another 28 gw of pumped hydro storage capacity but it remains a small part of the overall electricity mix in the fourth quarter of 2018 the 65 of british hydropower that is connected to the national grid accounted for less than one per cent electricity generation or 545600 megawatt hours mwh by contrast wind accounted for 14 of total generation that quarter almost 95 million mwh while hydropower projects can be expensive to construct operational and maintenance costs are relatively low and they can run for an extremely long time  the lanark hydro electric scheme in scotland which drax recently acquired  has been producing power since 1927 today hydropower installations are found at all scales all around the world but the term hydropower covers many different types of facility these are some of the ways water is used to generate electricity impoundment power plants the simplest and most recognisable form of hydropower impoundment facilities work by creating a reservoir of trapped water behind a dam that is then selectively released the water flows through a turbine spinning it which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity from the hoover dam on the nevadaarizona border to the three gorges dam in china  the worlds largest power station of any type with a generating capacity of 225 gw  impoundment dams are some of the most iconic structures in modern engineering three gorges dam china as well as having the potential to provide large quantities of baseload power they can react extremely quickly to grid demands  just by opening or closing their floodgates as the power system operator requires runofriver generation rather than storing and releasing power from behind a dam runoftheriver generators channel off part of a river and use its natural flow to generate power tongland power station galloway hydro scheme because it doesnt require large dams or reservoirs runofriver can be less environmentally disruptive as there is not always a need for large scale construction and flooding is less common stonebyres power station lanark hydro scheme while runofriver facilities tend to be smaller and less flexible than impoundment they still have significant generating potential  the jirau hydroelectric power plant on the madeira river in brazil has a generating capacity of 37 gw pumped storage water can also be good for storing energy that can then be converted to electricity pumped hydro storage facilities operate by pumping water uphill to a reservoir when electricity is cheap or plentiful then letting it flow back downhill through tunnels to a series of turbines that activate generators to generate electricity in the same way as an impoundment dam when electricity is in high demand dam and reservoir cruachan power station their ability to both produce and absorb electricity makes them a vital part of electricity networks playing the role of energy storage systems  in fact a massive 97 of all global grid storage capacity is in the form of pumped hydro their function as giant batteries will only become more important as intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar become more prevalent in the energy mix outlet and loch cruachan power station so too will their ability to ramp up generation very quickly draxs recently acquired cruachan power station in scotland can go from zero to 100 mw or more in less than 30 seconds when generation is called upon  for example when there is a sudden spike in demand tidal range generation swansea bay the sea is also an enormous source of potential hydropower tidal range generation facilities exploit the movement of water levels between and high and low tide to generate electricity tidal dams trap water in bays or estuaries at high tide creating lagoons the dam then releases the water as the rest of the tide lowers allowing it to pass through turbines generating power there are limitations  like wind and solars dependence on the wind blowing and the level of sunlight operators cant control when tides go in or out but its vast generating potential means that it could be a valuable source of baseload power if it were to be deployed more widely great britain in particular has major opportunities for tidal generation the severn estuary between england and wales has the second highest tidal range in the world 15 metres and a barrage built across the estuary could have a generating capacity of up to 86 gw  enough to meet 6 of the britains total electricity demands some environmental groups worry about the impact such projects could have on wildlife due to the level of public funding required the government rejected that plan in 2010 in favour of pursuing its nuclear policy  a second attempt at securing a governmentbacked investment contract known as a cfd  for a smaller 320 mw pathfinder project in swansea bay was also rejected in 2018 the welsh government is however supportive of the project which already has planning permission tidal stream generation rather than building a dam tidal stream generators work like underwater wind turbines sturdy propellers or hydrofoils winglike blades which oscillate up and down rather than spinning around are positioned underwater to transform the energy of tidal streams into electricity while tidal streams move far slower than wind the high density of water compared to air means that more power is generated even at much lower velocities not reliant on large physical structures tidal stream generators are a relatively cheap form of hydropower to deploy and make a much smaller impact on their environment than tidal barrages wave generation unlike tidal power which is generated by the gravitational effects of the sun and moon on the earths oceans wave power ultimately comes from the winds that whip up the oceans surface there are a number of different methods that turn waves into generation including funnelling waves into a tube floating on the surface of the water that contains electricitygenerating turbines or by using the vertical bobbing movement of a tethered buoy to pull and spin a fixed generator an electricitygenerating buoy awaiting installation in spain wave power has yet to be widely implemented but it has significant potential its estimated that the waves off the coasts of the usa could have provided 66 of the countrys electricity generation needs in 2017 alone effectively commercialising wave power could provide another vital tool in developing a sustainable energy landscape for the coming future tidal and wave power generation are less established generation technologies than their landbased cousins but they
