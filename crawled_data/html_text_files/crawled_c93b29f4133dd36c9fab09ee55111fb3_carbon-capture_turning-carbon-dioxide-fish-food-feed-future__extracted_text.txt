power station could turning carbon dioxide into fish food feed the future can we tackle two global challenges with one solution 17 june 2019 carbon capture reducing carbon dioxide co 2  emissions is one todays greatest global challenges but its far from the only issue the world faces the global population is expected to grow by a third to hit 10 billion by 2050  an incredible growth that will place huge stress on securing a sustainable source of nutritious healthy food for future generations one uk startup deep branch biotechnology  is aiming to tackle both problems with a single solution that utilises captured co 2 emissions to create animal feed protein in the past drax has explored using co 2 captured from its biomass units to help prevent a looming summer beer shortage  now its partnering with deep branch to test if captured co 2 can solve some of agricultures mostpressing problems broken food chain the amount of land and resources dedicated to producing animal feed is increasingly unsustainable a third of all the earths cropland is currently used to grow feed crops for livestock  which adds up to more than 90 of all global soy and 60 of all cereals  soy seedlings the process of creating the protein we eat on our plates is extremely resource inefficient says peter rowe deep branch ceo it takes about 6 kilograms kg of feed to produce one kg of pork soy is one of the worlds most widely produced crops but more than 90 of it goes into animal feed its not just on land where feed crops are creating problems of fish caught around the world an incredible 25 is processed into fishmeal for the aquaculture  or fish farming industry the demand for fishmeal is such that at present it outpaces demand for fish even with an increasing number of people shifting to meatfree diets and more alternatives making headlines  meat production is still expected to double by 2050 these industries need serious overhauls if they are to sustain into the coming decades deep branch helped via funding from innovate uk  is looking to aquaculture as a test bed for sustainable protein production whilst also encouraging co 2 capture turning carbon to carp the secret behind deep branchs approach to turning emissions into fish food is a strain of bacteria that feeds on co 2  the partnership will see deep branch connect directly to a source of co 2  with the startup taking up residence in draxs carbon capture usage and storage ccus incubator space here flue gas from one of draxs biomass power generation units will be fed into deep branchs system along with hydrogen enabling a process known as gas fermentation to take place download graphic high res no logo high res with logo normally when people think of fermentation they think about something like wine where sugar is converted into alcohol with a yeast acting as the biological catalyst says rowe our process however uses co 2 and hydrogen instead of sugar rather than yeast our proprietary bacterium acts as the biological catalyst and converts these gases into protein the resulting product is single cell protein which comes out as a milklike liquid when harvested its then dried into powder and 70 of what remains are proteins that can be used as a fishmeal replacement one of the advantages of deep branchs system is that rather than requiring energy to separate co 2  flue gas can be delivered directly to microbes which can convert up to 70 of the captured co 2 into proteins but for such a system to have a real impact it needs to be deployed at scale scaling up the process has been trialled in labs and proved highly efficient with ten kg of co 2 producing seven kg of protein what this new partnership with drax offers is the opportunity to test deep branchs process and technology at gridscale and while deep branch is focusing on aquaculture for now the concept could potentially reach much further through the food chain fish feed because draxs biomass units are carbon neutral at the point of generation the process creates an extremely lowcarbon protein explains rowe if you divorce the negative environmental impacts of industries like agriculture from its growth then you can provide more whilst impacting less deployed at global scale the idea of carbonneutral protein would free up some of the arable land currently being used for soy and other feed crops it means that as well as cutting the carbon intensity of traditional protein sources more land would be available for other uses while helping to halt climate change learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our
