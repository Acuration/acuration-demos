power station new rapid response gas power station approved in bedfordshire an application by drax to build a gas power station in bedfordshire to support the electricity system as more renewables come online has been approved by the secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy beis 13 march 2019 the 299mw open cycle gas turbine ocgt power station at rookery south pit near the villages of stewartby millbrook and marston moretaine will be able to go from cold to full load in less than 20 minutes enabling it to respond quickly to support the grid once operational it will run for up to 1500 hours a year providing flexible reliable power when its needed most and system support services  contributing to a balanced and costeffective electricity system maintaining supplies for up to 150000 homes andy koss drax power ceo said securing this approval from the secretary of state is a crucial step in ensuring development of the new gas generation the uk needs to provide flexible power and system support services to the electricity grid as part of the countrys transition to a low carbon economy rapid response gas power stations are agile enough to ramp up quickly and support the grid at times of peak demand making them highly complementary to intermittent renewable sources of power like wind and solar flexible reliable power stations like this are essential to provide the power britains homes businesses transport and infrastructure need millbrook power station will cost up to 90m to build with around 150 jobs created during the twoyear construction phase it could be generating power as soon as 2022 subject to it securing a capacity market agreement from the government drax applied for a development consent order for millbrook power in 2018 with extensive community consultation as part of the planning and consenting process drax group will continue to engage with communities local to the project as the project progresses ends image caption an artists

order dco is published on the national infrastructure planning website  drax plans to enter millbrook power into the next capacity market auction  the governments mechanism for securing enough power generation for the uk at the lowest cost the uk governments capacity market has been suspended pending the outcome of a european commission investigation  the timing of the next auction is therefore to be confirmed about drax drax groups ambition is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2600strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england b2b supply drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more information visit wwwdraxcom share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net
