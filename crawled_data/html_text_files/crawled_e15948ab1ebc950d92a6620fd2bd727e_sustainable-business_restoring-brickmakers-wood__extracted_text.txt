business the edenrose coppice trust is a woodland network that transforms urban environmental disasters into beautiful natural highbiodiversity woodland settings for people living with a terminal illness haven power has been supporting the trusts ambitious brickmakers wood project in ipswich since april 2016 brickmakers wood is a threeandahalfacre site that is being transformed into a peaceful space for cancer patients disadvantaged children and people with mental or physical health problems and learning difficulties throughout 2017 up to 12 haven power employees spent time volunteering at the project each month volunteers contributed to the restoration of the site and relished getting their hands dirty clearing rubbish and dense overgrowth building new structures creating an allotment and planting wild flowers without haven powers contribution the charity founders would have had to undertake most of the work at brickmakers wood themselves in their words the continual volunteering has transformed the project so we are now two to three years ahead of where we would have been otherwise the site is being transformed into a town centre oasis and has already been put to good use the charity has run skills workshops for 1216 year olds who have been excluded from school encouraging them to learn about woodcraft and how to run a business share related stories press releases drax
