Yorkshire apprentices win top prizes at Drax awards
Two young apprentices from York and Selby have won top prizes at the UK’s biggest renewable power station’s annual apprentice awards event in recognition of their achievements over the past year.
23 December 2021
Cameron Shipstone, age 21 from Hemingborough near Selby, has won Craft Apprentice of the Year after being commended for his excellent communication skills and proactive approach to learning. Cameron received outstanding feedback from his colleagues who said that he has become a valued member of the plant maintenance team.
Cameron, who is now entering the fourth year of his apprenticeship, said:
“I’m very grateful to have won this award since I really enjoyed the past year of my apprenticeship at Drax. I’m most proud of how I’ve been able to contribute to the safe day-to-day running of the power station as well as helping to complete the Unit 1 outage in line with its target date. I’m hoping to further increase my knowledge and skills so I can continue to work on the safe and reliable operation of the power station.”
Cameron Shipstone
The awards also included business apprentices, who have faced the challenge of having to do all their learning virtually this year.
Ben Senior, age 22 from York, was awarded Business Apprentice of the Year for always maintaining a positive attitude and showing great problem-solving skills. Ben’s manager said that he nominated Ben for this award as he consistently works to a high standard and goes out of his way to help the wider team.
Ben said,
“I know how high the standard of the other apprentices across the business is, so this is a real achievement for me. I’m looking forward to my future at Drax and the many career pathways it presents.”
Ben Senior
Covid restrictions meant that this year’s awards event was held virtually, but none of the glamour and excitement was missing as apprentices from across the Drax Group were recognised for their efforts overcoming the unprecedented challenges that Covid-19 brought.
Karen McKeever, Drax Chief HR Officer, who hosted the event, said:
“Drax is committed to championing and supporting people in their early careers. Hiring and developing a talented workforce of the future is essential for a business like Drax, as we strive to deliver cutting edge climate-saving technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
“Apprentices all have unique talents and bring a new perspective, that we can learn from. It’s been inspiring to meet them all and celebrate their achievements. The last couple of years have been challenging for us all due to Covid, but our apprentices have shown great flexibility, resilience and patience in continuing to approach their learning with enthusiasm and dedication.”
This year’s winners were:
Craft Apprentice of the Year (Year 1) – Callum O’Grady, age 22 from Gainsborough
Craft Apprentice of the Year (Year 1, Scotland) – Paul Firth, age 19 from Motherwell
Craft Apprentice of the Year (Year 2) – James Barratt, age 20 from Wakefield
Craft Apprentice of the Year (Year 2, Scotland) and the Paul Chambers Overall Apprentice of the Year – Iain MacPherson, age 19 from Oban
Craft Apprentice of the Year (Year 3) – Cameron Shipstone, age 21 from Hemingborough
Craft Apprentice of the Year (Year 4) – Ben Scott, age 21 from Brough
Business Apprentice of the Year – Ben Senior, age 22 from York
Uniper Engineering Academy Award – Declan Farmer, age 18 from Brough
Drax’s long-running apprenticeship scheme is part of its commitment to developing new talent as well as upskilling the workforce across the region. Drax has 52 apprentices as well as 50 existing employees working towards apprenticeship qualifications at other career levels within the business.
The craft apprenticeship scheme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside highly qualified engineers. It is a four-year programme, and specialises in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation. In addition to engineering disciplines, Drax also offers apprenticeship qualifications in business support areas such as HR, cyber security and administration.
Drax recently launched a major public consultation at its North Yorkshire power station to advance its plans to deploy the pioneering negative emissions technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). If successful, Drax could develop two BECCS units by 2030, capturing and storing at least 8 million tonnes of CO
2
a year.
Scaling up BECCS at Drax would support over 10,000 jobs at its peak which is why it is vital that the region’s workforce has the skills needed to implement this green energy technology, enabling the UK to meet its 2050 net zero target whilst generating the renewable electricity the country needs.

About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology.
Its 3,400 employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties.
For more information visit
www.drax.com
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in England and Scotland. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe. It is also where Drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology BECCS within its CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage) Incubation Area.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.
Pellet production and supply:
Drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the US South and Western Canada which have the capacity to manufacture 4.9 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets (biomass) a year. The pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in Europe and Asia for the generation of renewable power.
Drax’s pellet mills supply around 30% of the biomass used at its own power station in North Yorkshire, England to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.
Customers:
Drax is the largest supplier of renewable electricity to UK businesses, supplying 100% renewable electricity as standard to more than 370,000 sites through Drax and Opus Energy.
It offers a range of energy-related services including energy optimisation, as well as electric vehicle strategy and management.
