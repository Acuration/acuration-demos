storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture transport and store emissions will protect those industries while helping the uk reach its climate goals its just a matter of putting the pipes in place go deeper how do you store co 2 and what happens to it when you do tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  drax power station  negative emissions  sustainability  technology  zero carbon humber how to build a business model for negative emissions 10 may 2021 carbon capture in brief policy intervention is needed to enable enough beccs in power to make a net zero uk economy possible by 2050 early investment in beccs can insure against the risk and cost of delaying significant abatement efforts into the 2030s and 2040s a twopart business model for beccs of carbon payment and power cfd offers a clear path to technology neutral and subsidy free ggrs the uks electricity system is based on a market of buying and selling power and other services  for this to work electricity must be affordable to consumers but the parties providing power must be able to cover the costs of generating electricity emitting carbon dioxide co 2  and getting electricity to where it needs to be this process has thrived and proved adaptable enough to rapidly decarbonise the electricity system in the space of a decade with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation  the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is one of the key technologies needed at scale for the uk to reach net zero yet there is no market for the negative emissions beccs can deliver in contrast to other energy system services  beccs has been repeatedly flagged as vital for the uk to reach its climate goals owing to its ability to deliver negative emissions  the climate change committee has demonstrated that negative emissions  also known as greenhouse gas removals ggrs or carbon removals  will be needed at scale to achieve net zero to offset residual emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and agriculture but there is no economic mechanism to reward negative emissions in the energy market for decarbonisation technologies like beccs in power to develop to the scale and within the timeframe needed the government must implement the necessary policies to incentivise investment and allow them to thrive as part of the energy and carbon markets beccs is essential to bringing the whole economy to net zero the primary benefit of beccs in power is its ability to deliver negative emissions by removing co 2 from the atmosphere through responsibly managed forests  energy crops or agricultural residues then storing the same amount of co 2 underground while producing reliable renewable electricity looking down above units one through five within drax power station a new report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary cornerstone of uk decarbonisation and its wider impacts on a net zero economy developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would have positive spillover effects that contribute to wider decarbonisation green growth and the uks ability to meet its legallybinding climate commitments by 2050 drax has a unique opportunity to fit carbon capture and storage ccs equipment to its existing biomass generation units to turn its north yorkshire site into what could be the worlds first carbon negative power station plans are underway to build a co 2 pipeline in the yorkshire and humber region which would move carbon captured from at drax out to a safe longterm storage site deep below the north sea this infrastructure would be shared with other ccs projects in the zero carbon humber partnership  enabling the uks most carbonintensive region to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing beccs can also have spillover benefits for other emerging industries lessons that come from developing and operating the first beccs power stations as well as transport and storage infrastructure will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects hydrogen production for example is regarded as a key to providing low zero or carbon negative alternatives to natural gas in power industry transport and heating learnings from increased bioenergy usage in beccs can help develop biomass gasification as a means of hydrogen production as well as applying ccs to other production methods the economic value of these positive spillovers from beccs can be far reaching but they will not be felt unless beccs can achieve a robust business model in the immediate future with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation designing a beccs business model the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis outlined several key factors to consider in assessing how to make carbon capture usage and storage ccus economically viable these are also valid for beccs development engineers working within the turbine hall drax power station one of the primary needs for a beccs business model is to instil confidence in investors  by creating a policy framework that encourages investors to back innovative new technologies reduces risk and inspires new entrants into the space the cost of developing a beccs project should also be fairly distributed among contributing parties ensuring that costs to consumerstaxpayers are minimised building from these principles there are three potential business models that can enable beccs to be developed at the scale and in the timeframe needed to bring the uk to net zero emissions in 2050 power contract for difference cfd by protecting consumers from price spikes and beccs generators and investors from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power this approach offers security to invest in new technology the strike price could also be adjusted to take into account negative emissions delivered and spillover benefits as well as the cost of power generation carbon payment another approach is contractual fixed carbon payments that would offer a beccs power station a set payment per tonne of negative emissions which would cover the operational and capital costs of installing carbon capture technology on the power station this would be a new form of support and unfamiliar to investors who are already versed in cfds the advantage of introducing a policy such as fixed carbon payment is its flexibility and it could be used to support other methods of ggr or ccs the same scheme could be adjusted to reward for example co 2 captured through ccs in industry or direct air carbon capture and storage daccs it could even be used to remunerate measurable spillover benefits from frontrunning beccs projects carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two above the frontier report says it would be the most effective business model for supporting a beccs in power project carbon payments would act as an incentive for negative emissions and spillovers while cfds would then cover the costs of power generation cost and revenue profiles of alternative support options based on assuming a constant level of output over time way to go hybrid why does the hybrid business model of power cfd with carbon payment come out on top frontier considered how easy or difficult it would be to transition each of the options to a technology neutral business model for future projects and then to a subsidy free business model by looking ahead to tech neutrality the business model would not unduly favour negative emissions technologies  such as beccs at drax  that are available to deploy at scale in the 2020s over those that might come online later plus the whole point of subsidies is to help to get essential fledgling technologies and business models off to a flying start until the point they can stand on their own two feet the report concluded ease of transition to technology neutrality  all three options are unlikely to have any technology neutral elements in the shortterm although they could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral and ease of transition to subsidy free  while all of the options can transition to a subsidy free system the power cfd does not create any policy learnings around treatment of negative emissions that contribute to this transition the other two options do create learnings around a carbon payment for negative emissions that can eventually be broadened to other ggrs and then captured within an efficient co 2 market overall we conclude that the twopart business model performs best on this criterion the other two options perform less well with the power cfd performing worst as it does not deliver learnings around remunerating negative emissions assessment of business model options green indicates that the criteria is largely met yellow indicates that it is partially met and red indicates that it is not met transition to a net zero future engineer inspects carbon capture pilot plant at drax power station crucial to the implementation of beccs is the feasibility of these business models in terms of their practicality in being understood by investors how quickly they can be put into action and how they will evolve or be replaced in the longterm as technologies mature and costs go down this can be improved by using models that are comparable with existing policies these business models can only deliver beccs in power as well as other negative emissions technologies at scale and enable the uk to reach its 2050 net zero target if they are implemented now every year of stalling delays the impact positive spillovers and negative emissions can have on global co 2 levels the uk government must provide the private sector with the confidence to deliver beccs and other net zero technologies in the time

title of the first net zero carbon city in the uk while they might be battling to be the first in the uk to reach net zero they are far from the only cities with net zero in their sights in the wake of the growing climate emergency cities companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting net zero it has become a global focus based on necessity  for the world to hit the paris agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees celsius its predicted the world must become net zero by 2070  yet despite its ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and societys drive for real change across the uk drax has announced an ambition to
