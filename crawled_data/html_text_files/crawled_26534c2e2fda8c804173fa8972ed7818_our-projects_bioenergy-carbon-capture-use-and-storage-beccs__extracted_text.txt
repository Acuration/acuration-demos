emissions the uk needs negative emissions technologies to meet its 2050 net zero target to help combat the global climate crisis pledge your support now sign a letter to encourage the uk government to select beccs at drax as a track1 project within the east coast carbon capture and storage cluster sign the letter here negative emissions are a vital part of a solution that also includes decarbonising all sectors of the economy  deploying more renewables hydrogen and electric vehicles evs as well as improving energy efficiency bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is the most scalable negative emissions technology available today to remove co 2 from the atmosphere we are trialling beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire and consulting the public on our proposals  beccs delivers a triple benefit negative emissions essential for fighting the climate crisis clean economic growth  preserving and creating jobs reliable renewable electricity to support the grid as more wind and solar are connected the need to know numbers click to viewdownload our beccs projects and partnerships capture technologies we began to pilot the first bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs project of its kind in europe at drax power station in october 2018 the pilot project with ccapture technology captured its first carbon at the uks largest renewable power station in early 2019 a second beccs pilot facility installed by mitsubishi heavy industries mhi within the north yorkshire power plants carbon capture usage and storage ccus incubation area in autumn 2020 enhanced draxs technical understanding for delivering negative emissions  that successful pilot led the two companies to agree a longterm contract for drax to use mhis carbon capture technology  the advanced km cdr process prefeed services were working with worley which will provide prefeed services for two biomasstobeccs unit upgrades the contract includes development of plant layout cost estimation and schedules for feed detailed engineering procurement and construction zero carbon cluster becoming the worlds first carbon negative power station would also make drax a hub of the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster  known as zero carbon humber  helping to decarbonise the north of england new build beccs we have teamed up with bechtel to explore options and locations to construct new beccs plants globally carbon recycling drax power stations ccus incubation area also hosts a feasibility study investigating how carbon dioxide co 2  emissions could be captured and used to make proteins for sustainable animal feed products  the feasibility study is part of reactfirst  an initiative obtaining critical data about a new singlecell protein used in fish and poultry feed that is set to sustainably transform the uks aquaculture and poultry industries another ccus project explored the feasibility of using molten carbonate fuel cells as a technology for capturing co 2  while producing power and supplying the greenhouse gas to a neighbouring horticultural site to improve crop yields  carbon negative in december 2019 we announced a worldleading ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 our ambition is only achievable with an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework  the uk government is developing those as part of its global leadership in addressing the climate crisis the coalition for negative emissions the coalition for negative emissions was formed in october 2020 by a diverse range of organisations including drax cne members have a shared vision to build back better as part of a sustainable and resilient recovery from covid19 by developing pioneering projects that can remove co₂ and other pollutants from the atmosphere the coalition for negative emissions drax beccs timeline with an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework from government we could deploy bioenergy with carbon capture use and storage beccs on two of our biomass generating units by 2030 2019 drax beccs pilot with ccapture started capturing co 2 in world first with 100 biomass feedstock 2020 second drax pilot with mhi to capture co 2 from biomass feedstock installed in the autumn 2021 environmental scoping and two rounds of public consultation 2022 submission of development consent order dco application 2024 construction of first two beccs units underway at drax power station 2027 beccs technology installed on at least one biomass generating unit at drax 2030 beccs installed on two biomass units and drax
