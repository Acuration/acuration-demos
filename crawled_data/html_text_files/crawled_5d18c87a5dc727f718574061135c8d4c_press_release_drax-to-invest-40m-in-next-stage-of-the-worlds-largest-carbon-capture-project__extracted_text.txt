power station drax to invest 40m in next stage of the worlds largest carbon capture project drax plans capital investments of around 40 million at its north yorkshire power station during 2022 on the first phase of its bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs project and ensuring it remains on track to begin delivering vital negative emissions technology in 2027 15 december 2021 drax has approved a further investment in the development of its yorkshire carbon capture project that will see worley commence work on the frontend engineering and design feed phase contract is part of a 2022 capital investment programme of around 40m that includes site preparation works for beccs and decommissioning of coal infrastructure following the end of capacity market obligations at the end of september 2022 announcement is another significant step towards making beccs at drax a reality by 2027 and follows the companys decision to partner with mitsubishi heavy industries mhi group as its technology partner and ambition to source 80 of the construction materials from uk supply chain as part of this investment drax has selected worley to begin the frontend engineering and design feed work at the start of 2022 and may also work with the company on the subsequent design and build phases of the beccs project subject to contract drax will also commence site preparation works for beccs across its north yorkshire power station including relocation and decommissioning work to make space for the project worley a global provider of professional project and asset services delivers engineering procurement and construction as well as consulting services for the energy chemicals and resources sectors around the world beccs is seen as an essential technology to tackle climate change with the project at drax set to capture and permanently lock away at least eight million tonnes of co 2 a year exceeding the governments ambition to deliver 5mt of negative emissions from engineered removals each year by 2030 as outlined in the recently published net zero strategy drax is already the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted its power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal reducing its emissions by more than 90 by deploying beccs technology drax will create and protect tens of thousands of jobs across the north kickstart new green industries and make the uk a global leader in negative emissions technologies drax group ceo will gardiner will gardiner drax group ceo said our investment in beccs and the signing of this contract with worley demonstrates draxs commitment to deliver a vital technology which is urgently needed to address the climate crisis its no longer enough to reduce emissions  the world has got to start removing carbon from the atmosphere if we are to avert this climate crisis the governments ambition for beccs and its backing for the east coast cluster further demonstrates the vital role this negative emissions technology at drax can play in helping the uk reach its net zero targets as well as creating and protecting thousands of jobs and kickstarting a new green economy worley ceo chris ashton chris ashton worley ceo said as a global professional services company headquartered in australia we are pleased that drax has engaged worley in this important carbon capture project our partnership with drax is one of the ways were helping our customers adapt existing assets and decarbonize industrial clusters whilst also supporting worleys strategic focus on sustainability and delivering a more sustainable world the announcement follows draxs decision in the summer to partner with mitsubishi heavy industries mhi group as its technology partner as well as this the company outlined its ambition to source 80 of the construction materials and services from uk supply chain meaning businesses could benefit from contracts worth hundreds of millions of pounds creating and protecting jobs across the north and levelling up the country with an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework from the government beccs could be deployed at drax as soon as 2027  delivering the uks largest carbon capture project and permanently removing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year drax has already kickstarted the planning process to deploy beccs at its power station in north yorkshire  if successful work could get underway to build beccs at drax as soon as 2024 with the creation of thousands of jobs how beccs at drax will work

preparation works which are required prior to decommissioning some of the infrastructure associated with draxs coal operations on the areas of the site where beccs will be built draxs coal units are due to close in september 2022 and work to build beccs could get underway as soon as 2024 with the creation of thousands of jobs drax aims to deploy beccs on two of its biomass generating units by 2030 capturing and permanently storing up to eight million tonnes of co 2 a year more than the 5mt the government has said will be required 2030 in its recently published net zero strategy as part of the net zero strategy published on 19 october the government confirmed its ambition to see significant deployment of mature beccs technologies by 2030 beccs at drax can permanently remove at least eight million tonnes of co 2 from the atmosphere each year whilst supporting the creation of a new global industry in the uk delivering tens of thousands of jobs in a new green economy this builds on what we have already achieved with sustainable biomass in transforming a coal fired power station to become europes biggest decarbonisation project subject to the right regulatory support the first beccs unit could be operational in 2027 with the second commissioned in 2030 enabling drax to achieve its worldleading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 no final investment decision has yet been taken and development remains subject to the uk government introducing the right regulatory framework drax would act as an anchor project for zero carbon humber part of the east coast cluster protecting and creating tens of thousands of jobs kickstarting a new green industry for the region the east coast cluster is made up of both zero carbon humber and net zero teesside supported by the northern endurance partnership  a collaboration between bp eni equinor national grid shell and total with bp leading as operator drax power station produces 12 of the uks renewable electricity keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses drax has reduced its emissions by more than 90 in the last decade and drax is now one of europes lowest carbon energy generators in the summer of 2021 drax selected mitsubishi heavy industries as its technology partner to deliver beccs at drax using its advanced km cdr process tm  in september drax announced its ambition to source 80 of the
