independent advisory board iab of scientists academics and forestry experts to ensure the biomass the company uses to generate renewable electricity meets the highest standards 17 october 2019 former uk government chief scientific adviser professor sir john beddington to chair new independent advisory board iab which will ensure draxs biomass sourcing meets latest scientific research and best practice new biomass sustainability policy drawn from recommendations in a report commissioned by the european climate foundation in the updated policy drax has outlined how it will use the latest science and best practice and work with academic institutions and nonprofit organisations to meet its core commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions protect the natural environment support people and communities and carry out research and outreach drax also details the evidence the company will gather to increase transparency on its biomass sourcing and impacts these include using big data and satellite images to evaluate the impact on forest cover and biodiversity in areas that supply the biomass the company uses new rail line and wood pellet loading bay with sawmill residues in view at drax lasalle bioenergy click to viewdownload in high res this comes in addition to the companys current commitment to certification through the sustainable biomass program a globally recognised certification system designed for biomass from wood for use in energy production drax group ceo will gardiner said will gardiner ceo drax group click image to viewdownload in high res were committed to continuously raising standards in biomass sustainability so our sourcing policies must evolve as the science develops with stronger policies in place and an independent board to challenge us every step of the way we will be setting the standard for others to follow which is important as sustainable biomass plays an increasing role in addressing climate change the uk governments former chief scientific adviser sir john beddington will chair the sixmember iab which will provide independent advice to drax in all areas of its biomass sourcing including procurement practises and feedstock options iab chair sir john beddington said the ipcc and committee on climate change both recognise that sustainably sourced biomass will play an important role in meeting climate change targets i decided to chair the iab because its vital that biomass is sourced sustainably and takes the latest scientific thinking into account john beddington click image to viewdownload in high res as the science evolves we will make recommendations to ensure that the biomass used at drax makes a positive contribution to our climate and the environment draxs biomass sustainability policy draws on recommendations made by forest research the research agency of the forestry commission in a report commissioned by the european climate foundation a philanthropic foundation the forest research report recommends 15 key criteria to deliver sustainable biomass that has the best outcome for the environment these include favouring biomass that is associated with activities to conserve and enhance forest growth and productivity and a commitment not to take from sources that lead to deforestation following the conversion of two thirds of the north yorkshire power station to use biomass instead of coal last year drax reduced its carbon emissions by over 80 since 2012 making it the uks biggest renewable power generator and europes largest decarbonisation project the company has plans to go further in its decarbonisation with the development of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage technologies which could enable drax to become the worlds first negative emissions power station in the
