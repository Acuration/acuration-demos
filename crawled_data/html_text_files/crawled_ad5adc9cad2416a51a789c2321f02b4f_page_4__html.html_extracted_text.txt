What is LNG and how is it cutting global shipping emissions?
5 July 2019
Sustainable business

Shipping is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport. As a result, it’s the transportation of choice for around
90% of world trade
. But even as the most efficient, it still accounts for roughly 3% of global carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions.
This may not sound like much, but it amounts to
1 billion tonnes
of CO
2
and other greenhouse gases per year – more than the UK’s total emissions output. In fact, if shipping were a country, it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. And unless there are drastic changes, emissions related to shipping could increase from
between 50% and 250% by 2050
.
As well as emitting GHGs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency, big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel (also known as heavy fuel oil) release other emissions. These include two that can have indirect impacts – sulphur dioxide (SO
2
) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts.
As a result, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions. In January 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 0.5%.
One approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit ‘
scrubbers
’– devices which wash exhausts with seawater, turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate. But these will only tackle the sulphur problem, and still mean that ships emit CO
2
.
Another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as
biofuels
, batteries or even sails, but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas, or LNG.
What is LNG?
In its liquid form, natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships, replacing heavy fuel oil, which is more typically used, emissions-heavy and cheaper. But first it needs to be turned into a liquid.
To do this,
raw natural gas
is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids. This leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane, which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to -162
o
C, in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times.
The end product is a colourless, transparent, non-toxic liquid that’s much easier to store and transport, and can be used to power specially constructed LNG-ready ships, or by ships retrofitted to run on LNG. As well as being versatile, it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by
90 to 95%
, while emitting 10 to 20% less CO
2
than heavier fuel alternatives.
The cost of operating a vessel on LNG is
around half
that of ultra-low sulphur marine diesel (an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output), and it’s also future-proofed in a way that other low-sulphur options are not. As emissions standards become stricter in the coming years, vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold.
The industry is starting to take notice. Last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on LNG, the highest annual number to date.
One company that has already embraced the switch to LNG is Estonia’s Graanul Invest. Europe’s largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to Drax Power Station, Graanul is preparing to introduce custom-built
vessels that run on LNG
by 2020.
The new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9,000 tonnes of
compressed wood pellets
and Graanul estimates that switching to LNG has the potential to lower its CO
2
emissions by 25%, to cut NOx emissions by 85%, and to almost completely eliminate SO
2
and particulate matter pollution.

Is LNG shipping’s only viable option?
LNG might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping, but it’s not the only solution on the table. Another potential is
using advanced sail technology to harness wind
, which helps power large cargo ships. More than just an innovative way to upscale a centuries-old method of navigating the seas, it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions.
Drax is currently taking part in a study with the Smart Green Shipping Alliance, Danish dry bulk cargo transporter Ultrabulk and Humphreys Yacht Design, to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass.

Manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions. Last year, boats using
battery-fitted technology
similar to that used by plug-in cars were developed for use in Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, while Dutch company
Port-Liner
are currently building two giant all-electric barges – dubbed ‘Tesla ships’ – that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers.
Then there are projects exploring the use of
ammonia
(which can be produced from
air and water
using renewable electricity), and
hydrogen fuel cell technology
. In short, there are many options on the table, but few that can be implemented quickly, and at scale – two things which are needed by the industry. Judged by these criteria, LNG remains the frontrunner.
There are currently just 125 ships worldwide using LNG, but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020. Given that the world fleet boasts more than 60,000 commercial ships, this remains a drop in the ocean, but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways.

What is a fuel cell and how will they help power the future?
27 June 2019
Carbon capture

NASA Museum, Houston, Texas
How do you get a drink in space? That was one of the challenges for NASA in the 1960s and 70s when its Gemini and Apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space.
The answer, it turned out, surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules’ control modules. Primitive by today’s standard, these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells, which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity. The by-product of this reaction is heat but also
water – pure enough for astronauts to drink
.
Fuel cells offered NASA a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s, and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology, presenting the opportunity to clean up roads, power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions from power stations.
Power through reaction
At its most basic, a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions.
All fuel cells consist of three segments, two catalytic electrodes – a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other, and an electrolyte separating them. In a simple fuel cell, hydrogen, the
most abundant element in the universe
, is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other. Two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water.
What
allows this reaction to generate electricity
is the electrolyte, which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other. These charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur. When the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes, it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source.
https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Drax_Fuel_Cells_v6-2.mp4
Many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell, such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen. A fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used. Different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across. The catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate.
For the Apollo missions, for example, NASA used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes, but other types such as phosphoric acids, molten carbonates, or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist.
The by-products to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it, however, their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions, means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation.
Fuel cells as a battery alternative
Fuel cells, like batteries, can store potential energy (in the form of chemicals), and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed. Their key difference, however, is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged, fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in.
One of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles.
Rachel Grima, a Research and Innovation Engineer at Drax, explains:
“Because it’s so light, hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles, like trucks and boats. Whereas battery-powered trucks are more difficult to design because they’re so heavy.”
These vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen, producing only heat and water vapour as waste products. Which – coupled with an expanding
network of hydrogen fuelling stations
around the UK, Europe and US – makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future.
Fuel cells, in conjunction with electrolysers, can also operate as large-scale storage option. Electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells, using excess electricity from the grid to
produce hydrogen from water and storing it
until it’s needed. When there is demand for electricity, the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell.
A project on the islands of Orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local, community-owned wind turbines to power a
electrolyser and store hydrogen
, that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago.
Fuel cells’ ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at Drax for one of the most important areas in energy today: carbon capture.
Turning CO
2
to power
Drax is already piloting bioenergy
carbon capture and storage
technologies, but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to Drax Power Station.
“We’re looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas, oxygen and CO
2
,” says Grima. “It’s basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture.”
The molten carbonate, a 600 degrees Celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell. Natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and CO
2
.
On the other side, flue gas – the emissions (including
biogenic CO
2
) which normally enter the atmosphere from Drax’s biomass units – is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere. The CO
2
and oxygen (O
2
) pass over the electrode where they form carbonate (CO
3
2-
) which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen (H
2
), creating an electrical charge.
“It’s like combining an open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) with carbon capture,” says Grima. “It has the electrical efficiency of an OCGT. But the difference is it captures CO
2
from our biomass units as well as its own CO
2
.”
Along with capturing and using CO
2
, the fuel cell also reduces
nitrogen oxides
(NOx) emissions from the flue gas, some of which are destroyed when the O
2
and CO
2
react at the electrode.
From the side of the cell where flue gas enters a CO
2
-depleted gas is released. On the other side of the cell the by-products are water and CO
2
.
During
a government-supported front end engineering and design (FEED) study
starting this spring, this CO
2
will also be captured, then fed through a pipeline running from Drax Power Station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower. Here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes.
The partnership between Drax, FuelCell Energy, P3P Partners and the
Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy
could provide an additional opportunity for the UK’s biggest renewable power generator to deploy bioenergy carbon capture usage and storage (BECCUS) at scale in the mid 2020s.
From powering space ships in the 70s to offering greenhouse-gas free transport, fuel cells continue to advance. As low-carbon electricity sources become more important they’re set to play a bigger role yet.

Building a sustainable business
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
21 March 2018
Opinion

The UK energy sector is changing rapidly. The boundaries between users, suppliers and generators are blurring as energy users are choosing to generate their own energy and are managing their energy use more proactively while, conversely, generators are increasingly seeing users as potential sources of generation and providers of demand management.
“The UK is undergoing an unprecedented energy revolution with electricity at its heart – a transition to a low-carbon society requiring new energy solutions for power generation, heating, transport and the wider economy”
In that context, our Group’s purpose is to help change the way energy is generated, supplied and used for a better future. This means that sustainability, in its broadest sense, must be at the very core of what we do. Successful delivery of our purpose depends on all our people, across all our businesses, doing the right thing, every day. With the right products and services, we can go even further and help our customers make the right, sustainable energy choices.
As our businesses transform and we embrace a larger customer base, different generation technologies and operate internationally, the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and becoming more complex. At the same time, the range of stakeholders looking to Drax for responsible leadership on sustainability is increasing. The need for transparency is greater than ever, so
our website’s sustainability section
provides a comprehensive insight into the Group’s environmental, social and governance management and performance during 2017.
Some of the highlights include:
Carbon reduction
:
I am pleased that, in 2017, the proportion of our energy generation from renewable sources remained high. 65% of our generation during the year came from sustainable biomass and accounted for 15% of the country’s overall renewable generation. We maintained our rigorous and robust approach to ensure that we only ever use biomass that is sustainably produced and legally sourced.
People
:
Another key achievement was the roll out of our people strategy to 2020 – One Drax – which focuses on talent to deliver on our strategic and operational objectives.
Safety
:
The health and safety of all our employees and contractors is of paramount importance to Drax. While the Group’s safety incident rate remained on target in 2017, the fire at our biomass rail unloading facilities in December did cause an outage, with disruption lasting into 2018. It highlighted once again that the risks of generating using biomass must be mitigated through robust safety procedures and a risk-based plant investment and maintenance programme. Safety therefore remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are determined to do even better.
Customers
:
Our business to business (B2B) Energy Supply business received recognition for their dedication to customer service. Opus Energy won “Utilities Provider of the Year” at the British Small Business Awards 2017.
We initiated a process which would allow us to
participate in the United Nations Global Compact
(UNGC). We are committed to the initiative and its ten principles, which align with our culture of doing the right thing.
Our website’s
sustainability section
also sets out our commitment to
achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals
through our operations, the services we deliver to our customers and in partnership with others.
Global ambitions and goals are important, but so too are our ambitions for our local and regional communities. As such, we have played a key role in the UK
Northern Powerhouse Partnership
, initiatives such as POWERful Women and a
comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement
.
“Sustainability, in its broadest sense, must be at the very core of what we do”
Finally, I do not believe any organisation, however well intentioned, can get its commitment to sustainability perfect on its own and I am very keen for Drax to learn from people reading
our website’s sustainability section
. It sets out what we see as our achievements and aspects in which we believe we need to do better. I would like to invite any stakeholder with an interest to comment on what we’re doing and help us improve where we can. Feedback can be submitted at

Drax Biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies
Sustainable bioenergy

We have increased the capacity at
Drax Biomass Amite and Morehouse pellet plants
to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas (GHG) efficient. Central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals. The developments included the addition of an extra
truck dump
at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks.
Use of
mill residuals and dry shavings
reduces the energy required to make a pellet, as such material does not need to be de-barked, chipped and re-sized in the same way as roundwood. Some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer, which effectively increases the capacity of each plant. This drives down the
average GHG emission
per tonne of pellets produced. A key measure of this is the KWh of electricity per tonne of pellets, and we saw this reduce by about 10% in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year, with further savings anticipated.
LaSalle BioEnergy in Louisiana
At LaSalle, a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail, rather than truck. For the 250 km trip to Baton Rouge, a significant carbon saving compared to trucks will be achieved when LaSalle reaches its capacity of 450,000 tonnes per year. Moving pellets by rail should start in the next year.

The wooden buildings of the future
22 January 2018
Sustainable bioenergy

When we think of modern cities and the buildings within them, we often think of the materials they’re constructed from – we think of the concrete jungle.
Since the 19
th
century, steel, glass and concrete enabled the building of bigger and more elaborate buildings in rapidly-growing cities, and those materials quickly came to define the structures themselves. But today that could be changing.
New technologies and building techniques mean wood, a material humans have used in construction for millennia, is making a comeback and reducing the carbon footprint of our buildings too.
Return of the treehouse
Civilisation has been building structures from wood for longer than you may realise.
The 32-metre tall Pagoda of Horyu-Ji temple in Japan, was built using wood felled in 594 and still stands today. The Sakyumuni Pagoda of Fogong Temple in China is nearly twice as tall with a height of 67 metres. It was built in 1056.
Today, wood is once again finding favour.
The 30-metre tall Wood Innovation and Design Centre of the University of British Columbia (UNBC) in Canada was completed in October 2014 and is among the first of this new generation of wooden buildings. And they’re only getting bigger.
This year, the completion of the 84-metre, 24-storey
HoHo Tower
in Vienna will make it the tallest wooden building in the world. But this will be far surpassed if plans for the
Oakwood Tower
in London are approved. Designed by a private architecture firm and researchers from the University of Cambridge, the proposed building will be 300-metres tall if construction goes ahead, making it London’s second tallest structure after The Shard. And it would be made of wood.
Falling back in love with wood
Wood construction fell out of favour in the 19
th
century when materials like steel and concrete, became more readily available. But new developments in timber manufacturing are changing this.
Researchers in Graz, Austria, discovered that by gluing strips of wood with their grains at right angles to each other the relative weakness of each piece of wood is compensated. The result is a wood product known as cross-laminated timber (CLT), which is tougher than steel for its weight but is much lighter and can be machined into extremely precise shapes. Think of it as the plywood of the future, allowing construction workers to build bigger, quicker and lighter.
Glued laminated timber, commonly known as glulam, is another technology technique enabling greater use of wood in more complex construction. Manufactured by bonding high-strength timbers with waterproof adhesives,
glulam can also be shaped into curves and arches
, pushing wood’s usage beyond straight planks and beam.
These dense timbers don’t ignite easily either. They are designed to act more like logs than kindling, and feature an outer layer that is purposefully designed to char when exposed to flame, which in turn insulates the inner wood.
Susceptibility to mould, insect and water damage is indeed a concern of anyone building with wood, but as the centuries-old Pagodas in Japan and China demonstrate, care for wood properly and there’s no real limit to how long you can make it last.
So, wood is sturdy. But so is steel – why change?
Green giant
Construction with concrete and steel produces an enormous carbon footprint. Concrete production on its own
accounts for 5%
of all our carbon emissions. But building with wood can change that. UNBC’s Innovation and Design centre saved
400 tonnes
of carbon by using wood instead of concrete and steel.
On top of that, building with wood ‘freezes’ the carbon captured by the trees as they grow. When trees die naturally in the forest they decompose and release the carbon they have absorbed during growth back in the atmosphere. But wood felled and used to construct a building has captured that carbon for as long as it stands in place. A city of wooden buildings could be a considerable carbon sink.
This can have further ripple effects. The more timber is required for construction, the more it increases the market for wood and the
responsibly-managed forests
that material comes from. And the more forests that are planted, and managed with proper governance,
the more carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere
.
According to research from Yale university, a worldwide switch to timber construction would, on its own, cut the building industry’s carbon emissions
by 31%
.
Granted, that will be a difficult task. But if even a fraction of that can be achieved, it could mean a future of timber buildings and greener cities.

How quickly will these countries reach their climate targets?
28 June 2017
Power generation

It was no surprise when President Donald Trump echoed his election campaign stance and announced his intention to renegotiate – or failing that withdraw the US – from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. It raised the question, would other countries back away from their own climate change targets?
In fact, many reaffirmed their commitment to the pact and continue their progress towards becoming low carbon economies. For those in the European Union, this means meeting the
2030 climate and energy framework
, which sets three key targets for member states: cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40% from 1990 levels, produce at least 27% of their energy through renewable sources, and improve energy efficiency by at least 27%.
Many countries across Europe, however, have set climate objectives that go beyond these. Whether they can meet those goals is another matter.
Portugal
What are its climate targets?
The Portuguese government has pressed the EU to go further than its 2030 targets and is aiming for
40% of total energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030
. This target is part of its Green Growth Commitment 2030, which also sets out to create more green – or low carbon economy – jobs and improve overall energy efficiency across the country.
How is it achieving this?
Portugal has rapidly increased its renewable energy production by investing in wind (mainly onshore) and hydro power, although it is rapidly developing its solar capabilities. It is also looking at small scale renewable energy generation through wave, thermal and biomass power.
Portugal has two operational coal plants that together are responsible for 16% of the country’s carbon emissions. However, the government is seeking to phase these out prior to 2025.
How is it doing so far?
The growth in renewable energy within the power industry specifically has been a big success story for Portugal. In 2005, renewables accounted for only 16% of total electricity production – by 2015 they produced an average of 52%.
The country made headlines in May 2016 for running on 100% renewable electricity for four days in a row. Unsurprisingly, this means the government is confident of achieving a target of
31% renewables in gross final energy consumption
by 2020, which would mean 57.4% renewable electricity generation.
Germany
What are its climate targets?
Germany set its current climate targets as far back as 2007. It subsequently agreed to the Paris Agreement and the EU’s 2014 climate and energy framework.
Added to this, the country has its own
ambitious aims for 2050
: cut GHG emissions by up to 95% compared to 1990 levels (with an interim target of 40% by 2020), increase the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption to 60%, and increase all electricity generated from renewables to 80%.
How does it plan to achieve this?
Germany’s Climate Action Programme 2020 and
Climate Action Plan 2050
, set out its plans for reducing GHG emissions. Much of this is based around the Energiewende (energy transition), a strategy that will see the country phase-out nuclear power and decarbonise the economy through renewable energy initiatives.
According to these plans, Germany’s energy supply must be
almost completely decarbonised
by 2050, with coal power slowly phased out and replaced with renewables, especially wind power. The utilisation of biomass will be limited and sourced mostly from waste. It also stresses the role of the
European Union Emission Trading System
to meet targets.
How is it doing so far?
Between 1990 and 2015, emissions reduced by 27%. In 2015, the share of renewable sources in German domestic power consumption
amounted to 31.6%.
However, German energy-related
CO₂ emissions rose almost 1% in 2016
, despite a fall in coal use and the ongoing expansion of renewable energy sources. This rise is due in part to an overall increase in energy consumption and an increase in natural gas use and diesel for electricity, heat and transport.
Projections from the environment ministry in September 2016 indicated that Germany will
likely miss its 2020 climate target
.

What are its climate targets?
Alongside its EU and Paris commitments, the UK Houses of Parliament approved the Climate Change Act in 2008, which commits to reducing GHG emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050.
The Act requires the government to set legally-binding
carbon budgets
, a cap on the amount of GHG emitted in the UK over a five-year period. The first five carbon budgets have been put into legislation and will run up to 2032. These include reducing emissions 37% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 57% by 2030.
A key milestone in the UK’s decarbonisation is to entirely phase out coal by 2025, which will mean either closing or converting (as in the case of
Drax Power Station
) existing coal power stations.
How does it plan to achieve this?
Under its legally binding
carbon budget system
, every tonne of GHG emitted between now and 2050 will count. Where emissions rise in one sector of the economy (be it agriculture, heavy industry, power, transport, etc.), the UK must achieve corresponding falls in another.
The UK’s initial focus has been to transition to renewable electricity production. Wind, biomass and solar power have all grown significantly, aided by government support, and by
initiatives like the carbon price floor.
How is it doing so far?
The UK’s progress towards its targets is positive, but leaves room for improvement. Renewables generated 14.9% of the UK’s electricity in 2013. In 2015 they accounted for nearly a quarter of electricity generation and by 2016,
low carbon power sources contributed an average of 40% of the UK’s power
, with wind generating more power than coal for the first time ever.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy estimates that as of
2016 GHG emissions fell 42% since 1990
. Despite this, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said that the government is
not on track to meet its pledge of cutting emissions 80% by 2050
.
However, it points out the UK
is
likely to meet the target of making electricity almost entirely low-carbon by early 2030s, but only if further steps are taken such as including increasing investment in more low-carbon generation (such as biomass), and developing
carbon capture and storage (CCS)
technologies. The UK government is due to publish an
emissions reduction plan
in the autumn of 2017.

Norway
What are its climate targets?
Norway’s climate policy is based on
agreements reached in the Storting
(the Norwegian Parliament) in 2008 and 2012. They stipulate a commitment to reduce global GHG emissions by at least 30% by 2020 from 1990 levels. The government also approved the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
As well as signing the Paris Agreement, Norway has aligned itself with the European Union’s climate target and intends to fulfil its commitment collectively with the EU (of which it is not a member state). This means using the EU emissions trading market, international cooperation on emissions reductions, and project-based cooperation.
How does it plan to achieve this?
Around
98% of Norway’s electricity production
already comes from renewable energy sources, mostly through its more than 900 hydropower plants. The remainder is through wind and thermal power.
Norway exports hydropower to the Netherlands and exchanges renewable energy with Denmark, Sweden and Finland. There are plans for similar green exchanges with Germany and the United Kingdom via interconnectors within the next five years.
Norway is also aided by a substantial carbon sink in its forests which cover 30% of its land surface. They sequester (absorb and store) carbon from the atmosphere to such an extent that it equals approximately half of the Scandinavian country’s annual emissions.
How is it doing so far?
While Norway already has one of the world’s most carbon neutral electricity sectors, its significant domestic oil and gas sector means it still struggles to reduce its overall emissions. As such, the government is expected to rely on carbon trading with the EU or international offsets to meet its ambitious goals.
Nonetheless, earlier this year the
government said
that GHG emissions will fall to around 1990 levels by 2020, although it did not stipulate whether this included buying carbon credits from abroad or not.
