power station your christmas lights were powered by more renewables than ever before this christmas more electricity was generated by renewable sources than ever before this is no christmas miracle its a sign of things to come 29 december 2016 electrification late into the evening of christmas day 2016 millions of people sat down to watch rowan atkinson solve a grisly murder it was the tv drama maigrets dead man and although it wasnt the most watched tv show on christmas day that honour went to the strictly come dancing finale it did cause the biggest televisionrelated sudden surge in electricity demand of the day says sumit gumber energy forecasting analyst at national grid  during a critical ad break in the show demand jumped 400 mw  roughly equivalent to 160000 kettles being switched on  as viewers raced to make cups of tea or go to the bathroom this is known as a tv pickup  while this may have provided the biggest sudden rise in electricity usage of the day it was not the overall peak as is typical on christmas day this years spike in demand came just before one oclock when families were preparing their festive feasts at 371 gw this peak was not only lower than previous years the power used to supply it was generated by more renewables than any christmas before it more than 40 of the electricity generated on christmas day came from renewable sources  what characterises christmas day christmas is a day when electricity usage is at one of its lowest points to put this years 371 gw peak into context an average weekday during december weekday electricity use is higher than on weekends has an electricity peak of nearly 50 gw usually occurring between five and seven oclock when people arrive home and street lighting is switched on the cause for the lower demand during christmas is simple  over the festive period schools as well as a number of offices shops and factories are closed over the last few years average christmas day demand has been fairly typical sitting in a bracket of between 29 gw and 39 gw in 2010 however extreme cold hitting minus three degrees celsius drove lunchtime peak demand as high as 46 gw showing just how important a driver of our electricity use temperature is  but while demand on christmas in 2016 may not have deviated largely from the average over the last few years there were some major leaps forward in how it was generated a greener christmas than ever before this year christmas was characterised by a huge jump in renewable electricity generation  on average 124 gw came from renewable sources  more than ever before of that figure wind contributed the most generating on average 94 gw  equivalent to 31 of all power supplied on christmas day compared to 2015 its a 63 increase and a staggering 195 uplift from five christmases ago in 2012 when just 12 of all electricity generated came from renewable sources biomass generation has also increased providing 2 gw in 2016 compared to the 05 gw it averaged on december 25 th  2012 the increase in renewables also marks an important step towards decarbonisation at its peak emissions from electricity generation this 25 th december were just 168 gkwh a significant drop compared to the 2012 peak of 506 gkwh and the 303 gkwh seen in 2015 this year has been a year of impressive stats in clean energy between july and september for the first time in its 130yearold history more than half of britains power came from lowcarbon sources  on 5 th may the uk did not burn any coal to generate electricity  the first time since 1881 now weve seen one of the cleanest christmases on record its a christmas tradition that is likely to continue biggest tv pickups christmas day 2016 maigrets dead man and eastenders 2230  400 mw equivalent to 160000 25 kw
