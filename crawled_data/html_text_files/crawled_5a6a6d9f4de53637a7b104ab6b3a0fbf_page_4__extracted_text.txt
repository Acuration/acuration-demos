six other energy companies sbp builds upon existing forest certification programmes such as the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council fsc and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc these evidence sustainable forest management practices but do not yet encompass regulatory requirements for reporting greenhouse gas ghg emissions  this is a critical gap for biomass generators who are obligated to report ghg emissions to european regulators there is also limited uptake of forestlevel certification schemes in some key forest source areas sbp is working to address these challenges sbp certification provides assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements for the users of biomass for energy production are met the tool is a unique certification scheme designed for woody biomass mostly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips used in industrial largescale energy production sbp certification is achieved via a rigorous assessment of wood pellet and wood chip producers and biomass traders carried out by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an

are 600 giant balls at drax power station each one weighs 12 tonnes  roughly the same as a saloon car  and is designed for one simple but very specific purpose to pulverise every day thousands of tonnes of biomass and coal are delivered to the power station to fuel its generators but before this fuel can be combusted it must be ground into a powder in pulverising mills so it burns quicker and more efficiently its the giant balls that do the grinding and although these balls may be incredibly durable the constant smashing crushing and pulverising they go through on a daily basis can take its toll maintaining the 600 balls across the power stations 60 mills is a vital part of keeping the plant running as effectively as possible surviving the pulveriser each of the six generating units at drax three biomass and three coal has up to 10 mills that feed it fuel all of which operate at extreme conditions inside each one 10 metal balls rotate 37 times a minute at roughly 3 mph exerting 80 tonnes of pressure crushing all fuel in its path air is then blasted in at 190 degrees celsius to dry the crushed fuel and blow it into the boiler at a rate of 40 tonnes per hour to survive these extremities the balls must be tough drax works with a local foundry in scunthorpe lincolnshire to manufacture them first they are cast as hollow orbs of nickel steel or chrome iron and then smoothed to within one millimetre of being perfectly spherical after 8000 hours of use engineers check how rapidly theyre wearing down by measuring their thickness using ultrasound equipment and if deemed to be too thin which usually occurs after about 50000 hours of use replace them for this they must first remove the top of the mill  including the grinding top ring  and then individually lift out and replace each massive ball those that are removed are typically shipped back to scunthorpe to be recycled transforming for a decarbonised future when drax power station was first built in the 1970s  the mills were designed to only crush coal but since it was upgraded to run primarily on biomass in the form of sustainable wood pellets  they have been adapted to work with the new fuel for the most part this requires only minor changes  the primary difference is that coal is harder to fully pulverise coal typically does not get entirely ground down in the first cycle so a classifier is needed in the mill to separate the heavier particles and recirculate them for further grinding the process of switching one mill from biomass to coal takes about seven days and nights this work was carried out on unit 4s mills ahead of this winter following biomass trials in the spring and summer of 2017 now that the decision has been made to permanently upgrade that fourth power generation unit  converting one of its 10 mills from coal to biomass later in 2018 will take about twice as long using the same essential equipment and process for both fuels helps to quicken the pace of decarbonisation at drax

january 2018 investors rns number  1114c drax group plc drax welcomes the uk government response to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme which will enable drax to convert a fourth unit to biomass the response proposes that rather than imposing a cap on roc 1 support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all roc 1 units this would protect existing converted units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum the response would enable drax to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax will now continue its work to deliver the low cost conversion of a fourth biomass unit accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply drax plans to complete the work on this unit as part of a major planned outage in the second half of 2018 before returning to service in late 2018 the capital cost is significantly below the level of previous conversions repurposing the existing cofiring facility on site to deliver biomass to the unit the unit will likely operate with lower availability than the three existing converted units but the intention is for it to run at periods of higher demand which are often those of higher carbon intensity allowing optimisation of roc 1 generation across three roc 1 accredited units the cfd 2 unit remains unaffected will gardiner chief executive of drax group commented we welcome the governments support for further sustainable biomass generation at drax

december 2017 opinion tony juniper is an environmental campaigner author and director at robertsbridge a consultancy helping advise drax on its sustainability programmes back in 2006 while working as director at friends of the earth i approved a new report to be published in support of our then campaign for a new climate change act we wanted to show uk government ministers how it would indeed be possible to make cuts in emissions so that by 2050 the uk could progressively have reduced greenhouse gas pollution by 80 per cent compared with emissions in 1990 it was a radical and demanding agenda that wed adopted and it was important to show the practical steps that could be made in achieving it the analysis we presented was based on an electricity sector model that we had developed different data and assumptions could be inputted and using this we set out six possible lower carbon futures in our best case scenario we foresaw how it would be feasible to slash emissions by about 70 per cent by 2030 this was based on an ambitious energy efficiency programme and a shift away from fossil energy and toward renewables including wind and solar power in that renewables mix was also an important role for biomass to replace coal in the countrys largest power station  drax this was not only crucial for backing up intermittent renewable sources but also a key piece in a future electricity sector that we believed should avoid the construction of new nuclear power stations in november 2008 our campaign succeeded and the uk was the first country in the world to adopt a new national law for the sciencebased reduction of greenhouse gas emissions since then ive been working as an independent sustainability advisor including with the advisory group robertsbridge of which i was a cofounder my work has included assisting various companies in meeting the targets set out in that new law for example i was the chair of the industry campaign action for renewables which sought government and public support for the largescale expansion of wind tidal and wave power different campaigners tried to stop the expansion of these renewable sources of electricity however and succeeded in derailing support for onshore wind power developments although in its infancy concerns were also raised about proposals for different kinds of tidal power in the years after the climate change act i was encouraged to see that drax began to switch over to wood pellets to generate power but concerned to see that this too had come under attack the broadly agreed view that sustainable biomass could have a role in the phase out of coal had gone and in its place were claims that it was actually worse than burning coal it was against this backdrop of changed perspectives that myself and robertsbridge colleagues were pleased to be invited to help drax in devising a new sustainability plan early on in our conversations with drax it became clear that part of the challenge with biomass  deciding the extent to which it is a rational choice to help with the process of decarbonisation is how the answer to that touches so many different issues for example when it comes to the exit from coal cleaner alternatives must be brought forward to replace it including wind and solar power but although these sources of renewable energy are growing rapidly they still come with their own challenges especially because wind cant generate on still days and solar ceases at night this intermittency raises issues about what the best electricity storage or complementary clean power sources might be to back them up when needed there are important questions about the best sources of biomass and the extent to which longdistance transport of that fuel is desirable on top of that are issues linked with the management of the forests from which the raw material is sourced and whether the extraction of wood to generate power can be compatible with carbon neutrality there is the matter of nature conservation and the extent to which wood fuel demand will affect the status of species and habitats of conservation concern for example to what extent might the wood pellet industry be driving the conversion of seminatural woodlands to plantations all of this is bound up with the economic and social conditions prevailing in the landscapes from which the wood is derived and the extent to which those buying wood fuel can pursue positive outcomes for the environment even when carbon and wildlife are at best of marginal concern to the local forest owners growing the wood then there is the extent to which economic incentives might be linked with the carbon stocks held in the forest for example strong demand for wood is held to be the main reason why since the 1950s the volume of carbon stored in standing timber in the forests of the us south has increased by over 100 demand for wood might seem counterintuitive as a positive factor in maintaining tree cover but in the us south it has been a big part of the picture on top of all this is the question of what would happen if there were no demand for wood fuel in landscapes that have seen volatility in demand arising from the decline in newsprint in favour of digital devices and the slowdown in us house building following the 2008 financial crisis this is not easy to answer although seeking answers is a complex task our advice to drax was that it should work with its many stakeholders in finding the best possible fit between its business planning and these and other questions one way of doing that would be to set out the different issues in an accessible manner and hence the production of the film that can be seen here  its called  the biomass sustainability story  and while most of us can agree with the basic idea that we have to stop burning coal it seems the big questions are about what might be the best ways to do it might biomass have a role i believe it does have a look at the film and see what you think especially if you feel as though youve already made up your mind tags biomass energy  climate change  coal  fossil fuels  renewable energy  sustainability  wood pellets 7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass policy 28 november 2017 sustainable bioenergy biomass is playing an important role in moving the uk away from coal at drax power station in the form of compressed wood pellets  biomass is already supplying roughly 17 of great britains renewable power  but more than just being a low carbon replacement for fossil fuel generation it is also crucial in maintaining the stability of the power network among renewable sources of power biomass is unique in being able to provide the same range of ancillary services that can be provided by coal power stations  such as frequency control and inertia  this inherrent flexibility is vital in maintaining stability on britains high voltage transmission system wood pellets can also reliably generate power helping to fill in the gaps left by intermittent renewables when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine and avoiding reliance on diesel coal and gas however for the uk and the wider global environment to reap the maximum benefits from biomass it must be produced sustainably more than this its supply chain must be low in emissions so that clear savings can be made versus power generation with fossil fuels to ensure this the use of biomass is regulated in the uk under eu timber regulations and the renewables obligation ro  but further guidelines are set to be introduced as part of the european parliaments update to the renewable energy directive red which will specify criteria for all biomass there is a clear need for this but for these to be truly successful they need to be based on a set of robust key principles a new report by drax outlines seven of these which can ensure sustainable biomass usage in the future 1 forest biomass for bioenergy should be sourced from sustainable forests the sustainability of the forests from which biomass is sourced is key to ensuring its usage has a positive impact on the environmental social and economic health of that supply region for example a properly managed forest can boost carbon stock as the younger faster growing trees that are replanted after felling absorb more co 2 than older overmature trees thinning operations also increase the growth of the biggest and best trees  ensuring more carbon is stored in longer term solid wood products generators should be able to demonstrate they are avoiding biomass sourced from higherrisk areas where extracting biomass could cause longterm carbon stock decreases in soils or ecosystems as well as other factors such as biodiversity loss soil erosion or depletion of water sources 2 bioenergy from forest biomass should not be produced from highrisk feedstocks feedstocks the raw materials turned into biomass pellets must come from sustainable sources and avoid protected and sensitive sites that could be considered a risk in 2016 around 40 of all feedstock supplied to drax originated as a sawmill residue  processes such as thinning also serve as a source of biomass feedstock while also benefitting the overall health and quality of the forest thinning a semi mature stand of trees allows the forest owner to maximise the production of higher value sawtimber trees storing more carbon and generating more stable revenue streams having a variety of wood products markets from saw logs through to biomass incentivises land owners to maintain healthy forests and reduces the risk of conversion of forest to agriculture or urban development 3 carbon savings and emissions should be properly accounted to understand the effectiveness of biomass sustainability policy carbon savings need to be measured factors such as fossil fuel substitution and the emissions associated with harvesting processing and transporting biomass are relatively straightforward to measure 4 bioenergy should be limited to what can be sustainably supplied unlike coal or oil which will eventually run out more trees can be planted grown and harvested that said there is a natural limit to the amount of biomass available on the planet and so it should not be considered an infinite resource this is why its crucial biomass is sourced from sustainable forests managed following set guidelines in short to ensure biomass truly is sustainable it is essential that working forests are actively managed and maintain or increase productivity  5 support should be given to all technologies that achieve significant carbon savings one of the major advantages of biomass over other renewable sources is its potential to help the uk rapidly adapt to meet the eu target of achieving 27 of final energy consumption from renewables the fastest way for biomass to make an impact to the uks carbon emissions is through converting coal power stations to biomass  as is the case at drax power station this repurposing of existing facilities not only offers rapid adoption of renewable energy but also the ability to provide vital ancillary services other renewable sources cant quickly deploying biomass solutions in this manner will serve to help it become an established part of the energy system as it continues to decarbonise 6 the efficient use of raw materials is supported by encouraging buoyant forest biomass markets globally there are substantial amounts of forest residue and forestry industry byproducts that currently go unused biomass should be sourced from regions where the largest surpluses exist and the forest carbon balance can be maintained to enable this to function effectively on a global scale trade restrictions should be avoided pelletisation offers one of the most efficient ways for this raw material to be used by making it safe costefficient and lowcarbon to transport around the world these principals are tried and tested by drax and known to protect forests and ecosystems  as well as optimise supply chains to ensure carbon emissions are kept to a minimum ultimately draxs experience in sustainably using biomass serve as a guide for other producers and governments to quickly decarbonise energy systems 7 the sustainability of forest biomass should be independently verified one of the best ways to guarantee biomass is sourced sustainably is by introducing thirdparties and official guidelines that generators and suppliers can work with in europe forest level management certification schemes can act as an effective indicator that forests are managed in accordance with the guidelines laid out by forest europe  outside of europe where drax sources most of its biomass  independent third part auditors can ensure the uks stringent criteria are being met on the ground read the full report

bioenergy roughly 750 million acres of the us is covered in forestland  an area nearly 12 times the size of the uk approximately twothirds of that land is working timberland producing wood used for construction and furniture in short us forestry is a massive industry enviva is the worlds largest wood pellet producer and biggest biomass supplier to drax power station  but in the context of the us forestry industry in which it operates enviva does things differently were leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices says jennifer jenkins vice president and chief sustainability officer at enviva weve created unique tracking systems and we conduct sciencebased sourcing both of which encourage sound forest stewardship specifically enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesnt protecting bottomland forests a bottomland forest is an area of lowlying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species these forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important however theyre also a part of southeastern americas working forest landscape in fact enviva sources 34 of its wood from these areas  but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest for example in some cases harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive more than that harvesting can also help keep forests as forests in the areas where we work one of the biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use  specifically to developed or agricultural land explains dr jenkins our goal is to keep forests as forests we want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use if landowners can gain a steady income from regular harvests theyre likely to keep their land as working forests however this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe any land that doesnt meet envivas set of strict criteria means enviva wont source from it  it can simply walk away the landowners on the other hand dont have that luxury isnt it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest asks dr jenkins maybe they recognize its value maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead in recognition of our responsibility we made a commitment a fund that keeps forests as forests envivas commitment was to partner with the us endowment for forestry  communities to set up the enviva forest conservation fund  a 5 million 10year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the virginianorth carolina coastal plain it works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects more recently in june 2017  the enviva forest conservation fund announced a total of 500000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as ducks unlimited  an organization which  with the grant  plans to acquire more than 6000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public wildlife management area the fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes including a strict supplier assessment process and the companys track  trace tool  a oneofakind publiclyaccessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced it is entirely transparent and is a testament to envivas commitment to sustainability and doing things differently as dr jenkins explains this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004 as a company that makes wood pellets envivas reason for being is to help lower greenhouse gas emissions an emphasis on sustainability has always been a part of envivas dna tags forests  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets how lasers reduce emissions 25 july 2017 power generation of the air that makes up our atmosphere the most abundant elements are nitrogen and oxygen in isolation these elements are harmless but when exposed to extremely high temperatures such as in a power station boiler or in nature such as in lightning strikes they cling together to form nox nox is a collective term for waste nitrogen oxide products  specifically nitric oxide no and nitrogen dioxide no 2   and when released into the atmosphere  they can cause problems like smog and acid rain at a power station where fuel is combusted to generate electricity some nox is inevitable as air is used in boilers to generate heat but it is possible to reduce how much is formed and emitted at drax power station a system installed by siemens is doing just that it begins with a look into swirling clouds of fire not your average fireplace getting rid of nox is at heart a problem of getting combustion temperatures to a point where they are hot enough to burn fuel effectively too hot and the combustion will form excess amounts of nox gases too cool and it wont combust efficiently says julian groganz a process control engineer who helped install the sppap3000 combustion optimisation system at drax combustion temperatures are the result of the given ratio of fuel and air in each spot of the furnace this is our starting point for optimisation an industrial boiler works in a very different way to your average fireplace in draxs boilers the fuel be it compressed wood pellets or coal  is ground up into a fine powder before it enters the furnace this powder has the properties of a gas and is combusted in the boilers the space inside the boiler is filled with swirling clouds of burning fuel dust says groganz ensuring uniform combustion at appropriate temperatures within this burning chamber  a necessary step for limiting nox emissions  becomes rather difficult heat up the cold spots cool down the hotspots if youre looking to balance the heat inside a boiler you need to understand where to intervene the sppap3000 system does this by beaming an array of lasers across the inside of the boiler lasers are used because different gases absorb light at different wavelengths explains groganz by collecting and analysing the data from either end of the lasers  specifically which wavelengths have been absorbed during each beams journey across the boiler  its possible to identify areas within it burning fuel at different rates and potentially producing nox emissions for example some areas may be full of lots of unburnt particles meaning there is a lack of air causing cold spots in the furnace other areas may be burning too hot forcing together nitrogen and oxygen molecules into nox molecules the lasers detect these imbalances and give the system a clear understanding of whats happening inside but knowing this is only half the battle a breath of fresher air the next job is optimising the rate of burning within the boiler so fuel can be burnt more efficiently explains groganz this is achieved by selectively pumping air into the combustion process to areas where the combustion is too poor or limiting air in areas which is too rich if you limit the air being fed into airrich overheated areas temperatures come down which reduces the production of nox gases says groganz if you add air into airpoor cooler areas temperatures go up burning the remaining particles of fuel more efficiently its a twoforone deal not only does balancing temperatures inside the boiler limit the production of nox gases but also improves the overall efficiency of the boiler bringing costs down across the board it even helps limit damage to the materials on the inside the boiler itself thanks to this system and thanks to its increased use of sustainable biomass which naturally produces less nox than coal drax has cut nox emissions by 53 since the solution was installed more than that it is the first biomass power station to install a system of this sophistication at such scale this means it is not just a feat of technical and engineering innovation but one paving
