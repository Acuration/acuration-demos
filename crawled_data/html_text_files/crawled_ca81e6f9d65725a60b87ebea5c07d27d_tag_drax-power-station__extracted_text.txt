potential routes which could support the drax power station beccs project and wider ccs in the humber region by 2030  the east coast cluster and viking ccs cluster desnz also set out an indicative timeline that shortlisted projects would commence negotiations from autumn 2024 desnz will now receive feedback on its draft proposals pending further updates and the publication of final guidance in due course will gardiner drax ceo said the governments statements are a helpful step forward not just for beccs in the uk but for the wider fight against climate change we can only reach net zero by investing in critical new green technologies such as beccs i welcome the governments draft position and urge them to progress with both track1 expansion and track2 processes in parallel this winter separately in august 2023 the uk government published a biomass strategy which set out its position on the use of biomass in the uks plans for delivering net zero the biomass strategy outlined the potential  extraordinary role which biomass can play across the economy in power heating and transport including a priority role for beccs which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide largescale carbon dioxide removals this is in addition to formal bilateral discussions between drax and the government in relation to a potential bridging mechanism between the

key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture transport and store emissions will

from shops to super computers must reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for

providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris

world differ many ways from the frequency they run at to the fuels theyre powered by to the infrastructure they run on but they all share at least one core component circuits a circuit allows an electrical current to flow from one point to another moving it around the grid to seamlessly power street lights domestic devices and heavy industry without them electricity would have nowhere to flow and no means of reaching the things it needs to power but electricity can be volatile and when something goes wrong its often on circuits that problems first manifest thats where circuit breakers come in these devices can jump into action and break a circuit cutting off electricity flow to the faulty circuit and preventing catastrophe in homes and at grid scale all this must be done in milliseconds says drax electrical engineer jamie beardsall but to fully understand exactly how circuit breakers save the day its important to understand how and why circuits works circuits within circuits circuits work thanks to the natural properties of electricity which always wants to flow from a high voltage to a lower one  in the case of a battery or mains plug this means there are always two sides a negative side with a voltage of zero and a positive side with a higher voltage in a simple circuit electricity flows in a current along a conductive path from the positive side where there is a voltage to the negative side where there is a lower or no voltage the amount of current flowing depends on both the voltage applied and the size of the load within the circuit were able to make use of this flow of electricity by adding electrical devices  for example a lightbulb  to the circuit when the electricity moves through the circuit it also passes through the device in turn powering it a row of switched on household electrical circuit breakers on a wall panel the national grid  your regional power distributor our homes businesses and more are all composed of multiple circuits that enable the flow of electricity this means that if one circuit fails for example if a tree branch falls on a transmission cable only that circuit is affected rather than the entire nations electricity connection at a smaller scale if one light bulb in a house blows it will only affect that circuit not the entire building and while the cause of failures on circuits may vary from fallen tree branches to serious wiring faults to too many highvoltage appliances plugged into a single circuit  causing currents to shoot up and overload circuits the solution to preventing them is almost always the same fuses and circuit breakers in homes circuits are often protected from dangerously high currents by fuses which in great britain are normally found in standard threepin plugs and fuse boxes in a three pin plug each fuse contains a small wire  or element an electrical fuse when electricity passes through the circuit and fuse it heats up the wire but if the current running through the circuit gets too high the wire overheats and disintegrates breaking the circuit and preventing the wires and devices attached to it from being damaged when a fuse like this breaks in a plug or a fuse box it must be replaced a circuit breaker however can carry out this task again and again  instead of a piece of wire circuit breakers use an electromagnetic switch  when the circuit breaker is on the current flows through two points of contact when the current is at a normal level the adjacent electromagnet is not strong enough to separate the contact points however if the current increases to a dangerous level the electromagnet is triggered to kick into action and pulls one contact point away breaking the circuit and opening the circuit breaker another approach to fuses is using a strip made of two different types of metals as current increases and temperatures rise one metal expands faster than the other causing the strip to bend and break the circuit once the connection is broken the strip cools allowing the circuit breaker to be reset this approach means the problem on the circuit can be identified and solved for example by unplugging a highvoltage appliance from the circuit before flipping the switch back on and reconnecting the circuit protecting generators at grid scale power circuit breakers for a highvoltage network circuit breakers are important in residential circuits but at grid level they become even more crucial in preventing widescale damage to the transmission system and electricity generators if part of a transmission circuit is damaged for example by high winds blowing over a power line the current flow within that circuit can be disrupted and can flow to earth rather than to its intended load or destination this is what is known as a short circuit much like in the home a short circuit can result in dangerous increases in current with the potential to damage equipment in the circuit or nearby equipment used in transmission circuits can cost millions of pounds to replace so it is important this current flow is stopped as quickly as possible circuit breakers are the light switches of the transmission system says beardsall they must operate within milliseconds of an abnormal condition being detected however in terms of similarities with the home this is where it ends current levels in the home are small  usually below 13 amps a or ampere for an individual circuit with the total current coming into a home rarely exceeding 80a in a transmission system current levels are much higher beardsall explains a single transmission circuit can have current flows in excess of 2000a and voltages up to 400000 volts because the current flowing through the transmission system is much greater than that around a home breaking the circuit and stopping the current flow becomes much harder a small air gap is enough to break a circuit at a domestic level but at gridscale voltage is so high it can arc over air gaps creating a visible plasma bridge  to suppress this the contact points of the circuit breakers used in transmission systems are often contained in housings filled with insulating gases or within a vacuum which are not conductive and help to break the circuit a 400kv circuit breaker on the drax power station site in addition there will often be several contact points within a single circuit breaker to help break the high current and voltage levels older circuit breakers used oil or highpressure air for breaking current although these are now largely obsolete in a transmission system circuit breakers will usually be triggered by relays  devices which measure the current flowing through the circuit and trigger a command to open the circuit breaker if the current exceeds a predetermined value the whole process says beardsall from the abnormal current being detected to the circuit breaker being opened can occur in under 100 milliseconds circuit breakers are not only used for emergencies though they can also be activated to shut off parts of the grid or equipment for maintenance or to direct power flows to different areas a single circuit breaker used within the home would typically be small enough to fit in your hand a single circuit breaker used within the transmission system may well be bigger than your home circuit breakers are a key piece of equipment in use at drax power station just as they are within your home largely unnoticed the largest power station in the uk has hundreds of circuit breakers installed all around the site a 3300 volt circuit breaker at drax power station they provide protection for everything from individual circuits powering pumps fans and fuel conveyors right through to protecting the main 660 megawatt mw generators allowing either individual items of plant to be disconnected or enabling full generating units to be disconnected from the national grid explains beardsall the circuit breakers used at drax in north yorkshire vary significantly operating at voltages from 415 volts right up to 400000 volts they vary in size from something like a washing machine to something taller than a double decker bus although the size capacity and scale of the circuit breakers varies dramatically all perform the same function  allowing different parts of electrical circuits to be switched on and off and ensuring electrical system faults are isolated as quickly as possible to keep damage and danger to people to a minimum while the voltages and amount of current is much larger at a power station than in any home the approach to quickly breaking a circuit remains the same while circuits are integral parts of any power system they would mean nothing without a failsafe way of breaking them tags drax power station  electricity  electricity generation  engineering  national grid
