drax group plc drax or the group symboldrx rns number  2747e following a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with national grid ofgem and the uk government the board of drax has determined to end commercial coal generation at drax power station in 2021  ahead of the uks 2025 deadline commercial coal generation is expected to end in march 2021 with formal closure of the coal units in september 2022 at the end of existing capacity market obligations will gardiner drax group ceo said ending the use of coal at drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a worldleading carbon negative company by 2030 draxs move away from coal began some years ago and im proud to say were going to finish the job well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline by using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on we have also played a significant role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world having pioneered groundbreaking biomass technology were now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030 making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis stopping using coal is the right decision for our business our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees which will be difficult for them and their families in making the decision to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy its vital that the impact on people across the north is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that people have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future coal in front of biomass storage domes at drax power station 2016 drax will shortly commence a consultation process with employees and trade unions with a view to ending coal operations under these proposals commercial generation from coal will end in march 2021 but the two coal units will remain available to meet capacity market obligations until september 2022 the closure of the two coal units is expected to involve oneoff closure costs in the region of 2535 million in the period to closure and to result in a reduction in operating costs at drax power station of 2535 million per year once complete drax also expects a reduction in jobs of between 200 and 230 from april 2021 the carrying value of the fixed assets affected by closure was 240 million in addition to 103 million of inventory at 31 december 2019 which drax intends to use in the period up to 31 march 2021 the group expects to treat all closure costs and any asset obsolescence charges as exceptional items in the groups financial statements a further update on these items will be provided in the groups interim financial statements for the first half of 2020 as part of the proposed coal closure programme the group is implementing a broader review of operations at drax power station this review aims to support a safe efficient and lower cost operating model which alongside a reduction in biomass cost positions drax for longterm biomass generation following the end of the current renewable support mechanisms in march 2027 while previously being an integral part of the drax power station site and offering flexibility to the groups trading and operational performance the longterm economics of coal generation remain challenging and in 2019 represented only three percent of the groups electricity production in january 2020 drax did not take a capacity market agreement for the period beyond september 2022 given the low clearing price enquiries drax investor relations mark strafford 44 0 7730
