Summary

Summary
Iain Staffell is a multi-disciplinary scientist holding degrees in Physics, Chemical Engineering and Economics.  He is a Senior Lecturer in Sustainable Energy at the Centre for Environmental Policy with fifteen years’ experience in energy R&D.
Iain is co-developer of the
Renewables.ninja
, an open web platform that lets you simulate the hourly power output from wind and solar power plants located anywhere in the world.  Iain also leads the
Electric Insights
project, an interactive website and quarterly report on the supply, demand, price and environmental impacts of Britain's electricity.  He is one of the founders of
Power Swarm
, a network of 400 academics, industry and government experts working on power system transformation
Iain's research centres on decarbonising electricity systems, ranging from the economics of battery storage and productivity of offshore wind farms to efficient ways of integrating renewables into electricity markets.  Broad research areas include the potential of an interconnected super-grid and smart energy storage systems to reduce the cost and carbon emissions of generating electricity across Europe; the impacts that climate change will have on the business case for renewables; the role of flexible fossil power in balancing decarbonised energy systems; and residential-scale microgeneration for decarbonising the heat sector.
As energy, renewables and carbon are never far from the public eye, Iain's resarch and commentary have appeared in

Teaching
Iain co-convenes the Energy Policy option of the
Environmental Technology
MSc course, lecturing on energy systems, economics and policy.  He also teaches for Imperial College Business School on the MSc in
Economics & Strategy for Business
and
Climate Change, Management & Finance
, and for the Energy Futures Lab on the MSc in
Sustainable Energy Futures
.
