releases scotlands first minister humza yousaf called on the uk government to provide an appropriate market mechanism for projects such as cruachans expansion while on a tour of the facility today tuesday the scottish government has formally approved plans to expand the iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station through building a new underground plant at the site the new plant would strengthen uk energy security with flexible generation while enabling more wind power to come online with the right support from the uk government the new plant could be operational as soon as 2030 with almost 1000 jobs created and supported during development renewable energy leader drax group has secured development consent from the scottish government for its groundbreaking plans to build a new c500m underground pumped storage hydro plant at its existing cruachan facility in argyll the decision made through the section 36 process is a significant moment in scotlands journey to net zero with new longduration storage plants critical to enabling more wind and solar power to come online in the next decade scotlands first minister humza yousaf visited draxs iconic power station on the shores of loch awe today tuesday where he underlined his call for the uk government to provide an appropriate market mechanism for hydro power and other long duration energy storage technologies mr yousaf recently wrote to the prime minister urging him to take action so developers can have the certainty required to build a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants the new 600 mw plant at cruachan is part of a wider 7 billion strategic investment plan by drax in clean energy technologies between 2024 and 2030 such as long duration storage and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which tackle climate change and enhance national energy security constructed adjacent to the existing underground facility the plant would effectively more than double the sites total generation capacity to over 1 gw growing the uks pumped storage hydro capacity is crucial to integrating more wind and solar power onto the energy grid enhancing the nations energy security while tackling climate change pumped storage plants act like giant water batteries by using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from sources such as wind farms when supply outstrips demand these same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when the country needs it will gardiner drax group ceo said this is a major milestone in draxs plans to build britains first new pumped storage hydro plant in a generation these plants play a critical role in stabilising the electricity system helping to balance supply and demand through storing excess power from the national grid when scotlands wind turbines are generating more power than we need cruachan steps in to store the renewable electricity so it doesnt go to waste with the right support from the uk government drax will invest c500m to more than double cruachans generating capacity and support almost 1000 jobs across the supply chain during construction the expansion of cruachan requires an updated financial stabilisation mechanism from the uk government the current absence of a framework for largescale longduration storage technologies has resulted in no new plants being constructed in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in the decarbonisation process first minister of scotland humza yousaf said im delighted to visit cruachan today to hear more about the plans to grow scotlands pumped storage hydro capacity through the expansion of the existing facility in argyll hydro power has real potential to play a greater role in our transition to net zero and to help ensure a resilient and secure electricity supply across the uk the expansion of cruachan will help to strengthen our energy security by providing much needed resilience in the system supporting hundreds of jobs and providing a real boost to the scottish economy however we know that there remain a number of challenges in developing new hydro power projects in scotland the scottish government will continue to urge the uk government to provide an appropriate market mechanism for hydro power and other long duration energy storage technologies to ensure that the potential for hydro power is fully realised drax acquired cruachan alongside the galloway and lanark hydro schemes in 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible renewable power generation ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes drax applied for development consent from the scottish government under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 in may 2022 the uk government has pledged to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in largescale longduration storage projects by 2024 a report by kpmg for drax found that a cap  floor regime was the standout solution to unlock private investment in the technology while incentivising system needs to be met efficiently no investment decision has yet been taken by drax and development remains subject to an appropriate regulatory framework among other considerations about drax drax groups purpose

development of carbon removals projects in this country in 2022 drax provided around 11 of the uks renewable energy and it plays a vital role in maintaining the countrys energy security draxs ambition is to invest billions in carbon removal projects in the uk and the us through gamechanging technology  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs drax group ceo will gardiner said the cccs report is welcome as it is a holistic view of the scale of the challenge facing us all in reaching net zero as well as acknowledging the vital role that carbon removals technologies like beccs will play in getting us there we support its recommendation that faster progress is needed to reach the uks ambitious carbon removals targets with the right support from the uk government we plan to invest billions into delivering beccs at our power station in yorkshire our formal discussions with the uk government on beccs deployment and parallel discussions about a bridging mechanism to support the transition to beccs have been productive and we are looking forward to continuing these in the coming months we also await the publication of the uk governments biomass strategy which we hope will reinforce the critical role that beccs will play in energy security and decarbonisation as well as timelines for the deployment of initial beccs projects in the uk the company has also confirmed today that the decommissioning of its two remaining coal units at drax power station will continue and that they will not be available to generate power this winter this confirmation follows a recent request by national grid eso to explore the possibility of extending coal generation at drax power station but concluded that due to a combination of technical maintenance and staffing reasons the extension of coal over this winter was not possible the company first announced in april this year that after almost 50 years of coal power generation at drax power station its coal units would close
