power station summer in the station 6 october 2016 power generation bees buzz and heat haze fizzes on the tarmac its summer and since the days are warm and long demand for electricity sinks as lights are left off and life is lived outdoors electricity demand is lower so the assumption would be that activity at the uks power stations is minimal the reality however is far different instead the fall in demand is an opportunity to perform crucial maintenance work  to upgrade and extend the life of power stations across the world in many ways summer in the station is the busiest time of the year slowing the beating heart of the country to get up close and personal with the equipment and carry out major repairs large sections of the power station need to come offline  this is a procedure called an outage at drax power station there are six units which together supply around 78 of the uks supply taking one offline is a big project but a necessary one many years ago we use to do a mixture of major and minor outages but we have reconfigured the outage cycle so all we do now are major outages now we run a schedule where each unit has an outage every four years says andrew squires outage manager at drax this year each of our six units have come offline  five outages have already been completed and one is set to be back in service at the beginning of november with two of these being major outages and the other four taken off the system for essential high pressure hp turbine module repair works to ensure this all operates smoothly planning starts early the process starts a minimum of a year in advance during which time scoping planning parts and materials are ordered for the outage its a necessary advance given the challenging timescales projects and numbers of people that are needed to carry out the work required calling in the helping hands drax drafts in engineering contractors in large numbers to carry out the huge scale of work required to shut down and maintain units at the power station 2016 was a particularly busy year  at peak points 3500 people were on site carrying out the work its a number weve never seen previously squires says main projects delivered during the outage timescale in 2016 include changing the generator stator core generator transformer oil burner system and hp turbine module the main steam pipework replacement being the largest of all this pipework runs from the boiler to the turbine and is the first time this had been done in the lifetime of the plant now complete this is set to last the life of the station industry pioneers drax uses compressed wood pellets in three of its six units and this pioneering step brings implications for how theyre maintained in the industry its a whole new challenge for which drax engineers are still writing the rulebook were understanding the engineering implications of using biomass in our boilers and developing strategies for maintenance says squires as europes largest decarbonisation project maintaining and consistently learning comes with the territory its just another challenge for the team to tackle during summer in the station and beyond tags visit us  careers  engineering  power station  technology black start the most important back up plan youve never heard of power generation movies where major cities are razed to the ground or overrun by zombies are good fun when watched safe in the knowledge that such disasters are never likely to happen in the uk but how prepared would britains infrastructure be if faced with a real disaster if for example something were to happen that caused the national electricity grid to shut down what would happen next of course the chance of this ever happening is remote in the extreme nonetheless britain has had a contingency plan in place for decades britains ultimate power back up first things first  if the whole of the network including the power stations supplying the national high voltage electricity distribution network the grid loses power you would need to restart those individual power stations before they can get the grid powered up again the challenge normally all power stations need electrical supply to start up but with a total electricity blackout theres no electricity to restart the system thats why the reboot procedure is called black start  and its one the most important yet littleknown back up plans in the uk the good news there has never been a blackout so widespread that drax has been asked to do a black start preparing for the unlikely but thats not to say that such a procedure may never be needed in october 1987 there was a regional black start in the wake of the powerful hurricane that hit the south of the country the storm damage left kent and sussex disconnected from the national grid  but thanks to black start contingency plans most people barely noticed kingsnorth power station restored power to the area and it ran independently cut off from the rest of the grid until repairs enabled it to be connected up again a total nationwide grid blackout may be unlikely but that doesnt mean its not prepared for tests happen regularly to assess how long it would take to restart an individual generation unit at a major power station bring it up to capacity and make sure that any black start would run smoothly the most recent test took place at drax in july 2011 with representatives from the national grid witnessing the procedure to simulate blackout conditions three of the generating units were disconnected from the grid in that test it took 83 minutes to return one unit back to service a simple plan not all power stations can do a black start  some simply do not have control ability to be the starting point of a system reboot but modern coal gas and biomass power plants are able to restart rapidly on demand this is why drax  first operational in the 1970s  is modern and responsive enough to be a key part of todays black start planning the way it works is actually relatively simple using smaller power sources to start ever bigger ones scaling up and up until the entire country is powered up again draxs auxiliary generating units consist of three gas turbines which can be started from batteries these would in turn generate enough power to restart one or two main generating units the restarted generating units would be used as the backbone of an island network  a network operating independently of the national grid  that would be grown by adding pockets of supply the generating units would match the speed and frequency to create normal grid conditions and to restore supplies fast locally finally the affected areas island networks would be hooked up to each other so electricity can be distributed around the country with the reliability and stability we have become accustomed to staying prepared when the electricity market was privatised there was a risk that such nationwide plans as black start could have fallen apart to prevent this formal contracts were put in place to continue to restart from scratch if necessary drax recently renewed its contract this makes black start  and drax  as important

during rapid decarbonisation  tags investors  national grid  power station  technology this is how you make a biomass wood pellet sustainable bioenergy wood has been used as fuel for tens of thousands of years but this wood  a compressed wood pellet  is different its the size of a childs crayon and weighs next to nothing but when combined with many more it is a smart solution to generating cleaner electricity compared to coal wood pellets like these are being used at drax power station to generate electricity and power cities not only are they renewable and sustainable but because they are compressed dried and made from incredibly fine wood fibres theyre also a very efficient fuel for power stations this is how a compressed wood pellet is made at the drax biomass amite bioenergy pellet plant in mississippi the wood arrives to the yard wood arrives at the plant via truck and is sent to one of four places the wood storage yard the wood circle where wood is primed for processing the piles of sawdust and woodchip or straight into processing bark is removed and kept for fuel logs are fed into a debarker machine which beats the logs together inside a large drum to remove the bark the bark is put aside and used to fuel the woodchip dryer used later in the process thinned wood stems become small chips the logs  lowvalue fibre from sustainably managed working forests  need to be cut down into even smaller pieces so they can then be shredded into the fine material needed for creating pellets inside the wood chipper multiple blades spin and cut the logs into chips roughly 10mm long and 3mm thick the resulting chips are fed into the woodchip pile ready for screening chips are screened for quality and waste is removed chipped down wood can include waste elements like sand remaining bark or stones that can affect pellet production the chips are passed through a screener that removes the waste leaving only ideal sized wood chips the biggest hairdryer youve ever seen the wood chips need to have a moisture level of between 115 and 12 before they go into the pelleting process anything other than this and the quality of the resulting pellets could be compromised the chips enter a large drum which is blasted with hot air generated in a heater powered by bark collected from the debarker the chips are moved through the drum by a large fan ready for the hammer mill small woodchips become even smaller woodchips inside the hammer mill theres a spinning shaft mounted with a series of hammers the wood chips are fed into the top of the drum and the spinning hammers chip and shred them down into a fine powdery substance that is used to create the pellets putting the chips under pressure  a lot of pressure the shredded woodchip powder is fed into the pellet mill inside a rotating arm presses the powdered wood fibre through a grate featuring a number of small holes the intense pressure heats up the wood fibre and helps it bind together as it passes through the holes in a metal ring dye forming the compressed wood pellets resting and cooling down fresh pellets from the mill are damp and hot and need to rest and cool before transporting off site theyre moved to large storage silos kept at low temperatures so the pellets can cool and harden ready for shipping one of the biggest domes youve ever seen this is the final stage before shipping specially designed and constructed storage domes are used to store the wood pellets after they are transported to the mississippi river louisiana and before they make their way across the atlantic to the uk tags about us  wood pellets  power station  biomass energy  technology the power industry in 2016 where are we now power generation britain is in the middle of a transition while at one point it was the centre of the global coal industry its now pushing further towards renewable resources but 2016 has been a tumultuous year marked by political changes that have sent shock waves through the whole country the energy industry is no exception  but that is not to suggest its on shaky ground here we look at some of the years major events and how theyve affected the energy landscape leaving europe britains vote to leave the eu could have a major impact on the domestic energy landscape europe has played a central role in setting emissions targets for power stations promoting renewable technologies and trading carbon the uk also benefits from being in the single energy market where energy market rules and regulations are harmonised across a number of european countries a postbrexit resolution to these issues is likely to remain uncertain for some time as drax ceo dorothy thompson told a conference in florida in late september it will take a number of years for the uk to actually exit the eu and we think politicians on all sides will push for an orderly departure implementing the paris agreement following last years paris agreement on climate change the uk government demonstrated its commitment to being a world leader in clean energy by setting its fifth carbon budget the budget initially proposed by the independent advisory body the committee on climate change sets a cap on the uks greenhouse gas emissions for the period 20282032 the cap is ambitious and would require the uk to reduce its emissions to a level 57 lower than they were in 1990 the government is working on a new emissions reductions plan that will map out how it intends to meet this goal and accelerate decarbonisation in the power heat transport and agricultural sectors political change the reshuffle following theresa mays election as conservative leader and therefore prime minister also marked the end of the department of energy and climate change decc previously responsible for overseeing the countrys energy policy and its transition towards greener more renewable energy sources while the decision raised concerns in some quarters over the governments commitment to decarbonisation placing energy policy at the heart of a modern industrial strategy under the new department for business energy and industrial strategy could reap dividends in the longterm green light for hinkley point perhaps the single most highly scrutinised energy issue of the year and an indirect fallout of the summers political drama was the government delaying its approval of the planned hinkley point c nuclear power station the project backed by edf and chinese investors was when first announced by the french governmentcontrolled energy company in 2007 due to be generating electricity by the festive period just a decade later jumping ahead to 2016 and having been approved by theresa may two months later than the industry anticipated expectations are that the development is unlikely to cook its first christmas turkey until 25 th december 2025  at the very earliest this raises serious questions over what will fill the gap left by aging nuclear power stations that are due to close over the next few years this said delays to hinkley point c present an opportunity for alternative energy sources such as offshore wind solar and compressed wood pellets to make their case to work together as smart affordable solutions that could be in place well ahead of 2025 whole system costs the research and thinking around the issue of whole system costs continued to grow a series of reports from nera consulting and imperial college london showed that intermittent technologies such as wind and solar make managing the national energy grid more expensive in the absence of flexible dispatchable technologies like biomass it is only when these hidden costs are taken into consideration that we can truly understand the affordability of different energy technologies recognising the importance of this issue to good policy making the government has commissioned its own research on whole system costs which is due to be published later this year coal closure 2016 saw some important landmarks in great britains history as a coalusing nation a 12hour stretch in may this year was the first time since 1882  the year gbs first coalfired power station went online  that the country was powered for more than half a day completely by other fuels plans outlined last year by then energy secretary amber rudd had aimed to ban unabated coal power stations by 2025 this year has already seen coalfired casualties full or partial closures of five major coal burning power plants in great britain have taken place in 2016 ferrybridge longannet rugeley fiddlers ferry some units of sses north west coal station will remain active until next year and eggborough reopened in late september for the winter 201617 by the end of 2016 the equivalent of between two and three hinkley cs 8 gw will have come off the system while rudds plans still stand delays to hinkley point c and a lack of new flexible power stations being built in great britain means that the government will need to think carefully about how to get coal off the grid in an orderly fashion to avoid a capacity crunch in the early 2020s ancillary  essential capacity crunched despite the strides made by renewables over the course of the year and the recent boon to the nuclear sectors future gb power infrastructure badly needs flexible fuels the ability to generate more power  or less  in mere seconds when the country demands it is becoming increasingly important with the growth of wind and solar power as more offshore wind arrays are constructed and solar farms and roofs proliferate there are an increasing number of gaps in our electricity supply being filled by power sources that can be dialled up and down when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine while drax and two planned power projects in the north east of england lynemouth and mgt teeside are turning to a coaltobiomass conversion and a new build biomass combined heat and power plant to meet these needs the government continues to look for ways to encourage companies to build new gas power stations as well as emerging battery storage technologies a critical route to incentivising these technologies is the notveryaptlynamed ancillary services market it involves the high voltage electricity system operator in great britain the national grid buying services to ensure the lights stay on the increasingly electric transport sector keeps running and our hightech world of work stays online energy future so far there have been some very big changes over the course of the year however the energy ecosystem in great britain should be robust and flexible enough that the transition from coal to low carbon and renewable technologies in the future should be a secure and affordable one this will require a mix of smart solutions a key enabling technology will be coaltobiomass upgrades that can run as both baseload and flexible generators tags power station  energy policy the single biggest transformation of our century sustainable bioenergy at the turn of the millennium drax was facing a serious issue demand for electricity was high and increasing but so was the desire for sources of power that were less harmful to the environment than coal at that time draxs fuel to continue to meet demand in a cleaner and more sustainable way an alternative approach was needed drax had a legacy in this field  in 1988 it was the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions in the two decades that followed however the sustainability conversation moved beyond how to make coal cleaner instead the focus was finding a truly viable alternative fuel finding a new fuel in those early days the idea of converting a fully coalfired station to another fuel seemed outlandish to say the least we made a lot of peoples heads hurt with this project says drax strategic projects engineering manager jason shipstone no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going back then it was all about experimentation jim price alternative fuel manager at the time explains initially we found a few distressed cargos of wood pellets and sunflower husks that someone had ordered but didnt want we mixed that with coal at very low concentration price and his team found they could use the plantbased fuel alongside coal at low percentages without it detrimentally affecting the boilers it was a long way from being a new business model but it was a start they spent the next year working with willow wood a subsidized energy crop that proved difficult to turn into a fuel that could be used efficiently to power a boiler then in 2005 after building a prototype plant and finding a way to pulverise the willow into a fine powder  called wood flour  and combine it with coal dust the team hit its first key milestone it was able to power a drax boiler that was the eureka moment says price no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going a change in attitude the response to the success was immediate senior management support for the project had been in place from the beginning but now there was a change across the whole company people started to think maybe it can be done says price work continued on the project and  after more experiments  drax eventually settled on compressed wood pellets this form of biomass ultimately required investment in four vast storage domes that between them store 80000 tonnes of pellets then there was the issue of supply and delivery materials were sourced from the us shipped to the uk then freighted to the plant in specially designed covered train wagons each carrying up to 7600 tonnes everything else had to carry on as normal this had to be seamless we had to work the same as drax has always worked  reliable and available says shipstone jason shipstone drax strategic projects manager played an instrumental role in upgrading drax the final hurdle in 2009 the team overcame one of the final challenges and successfully adapted the boilers to combust the new fuel proving that cofiring the process of using two fuels powering one boiler  in this case wood pellets and coal could work it was enough to show there was a future in wood pellets and it could work at scale although nothing was fully built yet but dorothy thompson ceo of drax was convinced shipstone remembers the conversation after thompson signed the contract to begin the transition in earnest so we can do 10 what does it take to get to 50 she asked recalls shipstone his response no problem it was the right answer he says toward a coalfree future fast forward to 2016 and drax is europes largest decarbonisation project  reducing emissions by at least 80 of the 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide that the three now converted former coal generation units would have released per year although only half of draxs six units have been upgraded from coal to use compressed wood pellets  65 of the electricity generated at the power station is the result of a renewable rather than a fossil fuel its three biomass units produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of four million homes  or more than half of all residential properties in northern england given the challenges the world faces regarding the future of energy production decisive action is required if were to meet carbon reduction targets in the uk the government has voiced ambitions of phasing out coal by 2025 drax has aims of doing it quicker thompson has spoken of plans that see all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before the story of energy since the dawn of the industrial revolution has been one of fossil fuels this simply has to change by finding a way to ease the transition away from coal drax is helping to write the next chapter tags technology  power station  engineering  wood pellets  history the biggest balls of electricity generation power generation when making a cup of tea its unlikely you consider the industrial equipment kicked into action the moment you switch on your kettle and of all of the activity going on behind the scenes its even more unlikely you think about a 12tonne steel ball but without a number of 12tonne balls and the electricity they help generate your kettle would be nothing more than a fancy jug how do giant balls help to generate power the answer lies in the way fuels like coal and compressed wood pellets are used to power boilers and generate electricity drax started its life as a coal power station but today it is in the process of upgrading to run on biomass progress has already been made  three of the stations six units already run on compressed wood pellets draxs biomass fuel generating around 20 of the uks renewable electricity to generate enough power to supply 8 of the uks demand  as drax does  a lot of fuel is needed hundreds of thousands of wood pellets are delivered to drax every day arriving on custombuilt trains travelling from the ports of tyne hull immingham and liverpool the pellets pass through a system of conveyor belts until they arrive at one of four massive conical storage domes  located on site in yorkshire before the wood pellets can be converted into fuel they need to be crushed this is where the balls come into play the pulveriser the wood pellets used at drax are compressed and dried wood that is formed into small capsules the size of a childs crayon  but like with coal to get the best results in the power stations huge boilers the material needs to be turned into a very fine powder in pulverising mills when very fine the fuel burns as efficiently and as quickly as a gas inside each mill are 10 giant steel balls that grind down either the wood pellets or coal each ball is three quarters of a metre in size made of hollow cast steel alloy and weighs roughly 12 tonnes  equivalent in weight to britishmade jaguar xe midsized saloon car or an entire football team and to make sure that each one is up to the task of extreme pulverisation they need to be hard each one is heat treated during manufacture to make sure theyre up robust enough to consistently crush raw fuel the benefit of this durability is that they can readily pulverise fuel to feed drax boilers to power kettles across the
