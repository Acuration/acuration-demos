provide others at drax and their families with some entertainment and make us all feel a little closer together even though we are apart during this lockdown the first two books to have been recorded by employees from across draxs operations in the uk and usa are charlie and the chocolate factory by roald dahl and the ice monster by david walliams the audio library will be launched at drax during national storytelling week jan 30 to feb 6 with the stories being posted on the drax group employee intranet service for people to download and listen to at home if the initiative proves to be popular
