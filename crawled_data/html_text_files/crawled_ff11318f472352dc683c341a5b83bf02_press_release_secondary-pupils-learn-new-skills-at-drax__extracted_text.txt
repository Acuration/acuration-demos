secondary pupils learn new skills at drax through weekly group sessions students worked with the drax visitor centre team on skills including project planning critical thinking and interview techniques 23 july 2019 15 yearold students rose to the challenge of becoming tour guides at the uks biggest power station as part of an initiative aimed at boosting skills year 10 pupils from holy family catholic high school in carlton near selby put their public speaking and presentation skills to the test when they became the latest recruits to the visitor centre team at drax power station  the uks biggest renewable power generator the school has been participating in the diana award mentoring scheme which pairs volunteer mentors from industry with young people to give them an insight into the world of work and career skills training through weekly group sessions the students worked with the drax visitor centre team on skills including project planning critical thinking and interview techniques holy family catholic high school students danny devlin careers lead and physics teacher at holy family school who led the project said the programme has been a massive success and the students have gained so much from it one skill the students identified as something theyd like to improve was public speaking and presentation skills and what better way to practice this than to explain how drax works the experience has been invaluable to them  they have really grown in confidence none of it would have been achieved without the excellent support and guidance from the staff at drax research for the northern powerhouse partnership has shown that students in the north are falling behind their counterparts in other parts of the country when it comes to education and skills  highlighting the need for employers to do more to help inspire pupils and ensure the region has the skilled workforce it needs to succeed jane breach visitor centre and communities manager at drax said its been really rewarding to work with holy family school as mentors and see the students grow in confidence this exercise helped the students to develop a valuable skill and we are delighted to support the programme as part of our commitment to stem learning in the area providing these kinds of inspirational opportunities for students where they get the chance to work with people in industries like ours are so important  it opens up a whole range of new possibilities for them  and contributes to ensuring the next generation has the skills employers like drax needs draxs commitment to stem learning includes running a longestablished apprenticeship scheme  it has doubled the number of apprentices it is taking on this year compared to two years ago and has reinstated an apprentice scheme at its new power stations in scotland  it has also invested in a new initiative with local schools and colleges through the greenpower project which provides students with ev kit cars to build and race aimed at inspiring them to study stem subjects ends media contacts jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 07712677177 about drax drax groups ambition is to
