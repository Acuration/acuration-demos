technologies must be deployed for the uk to meet its climate targets despite renewables generating more power than fossil fuels for the first time a new report has warned 15 february 2021 2020 was a record year for renewables with biomass hydro solar and wind power generating more power than fossil fuels for the first time carbon emissions from electricity generation fell by 16 as gas and coal power stations were turned off or down due to reduced demand during covid lockdowns experts warn uk must embrace new but proven technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to meet climate targets in years ahead independent analysis conducted by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights via imperial consultants shows the uk will require a range of new green technologies which complement renewables like wind and solar as part of its efforts to meet its national climate goals whilst power from renewables overtook fossil fuels for the first time in 2020  and carbon emissions fell by 16 yearonyear this was in a large part due to reduced demand caused by covid lockdowns when gas and coal power stations were turned down wind and solar generated 30 of britains electricity in 2020  around half the share required by 2025 for the uk to reach its climate targets according to the climate change committee ccc the electric insights report shows that achieving the cccs targets will also require a range of other technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen and nuclear dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights report said 2020 saw britain edge closer to the power system of the future with renewables generating more power than fossil fuels flexible technologies like pumped hydro storage kept the system stable as supply from renewables increased and demand for power fell the next steps we must take towards a net zero power system will be more challenging  driving out the last sources of fossil carbon will require us to go beyond just having more wind and solar power new business models backed by policy and investment will be needed to bring advancedbutproven technologies into the mainstream this means that the electricity used in homes hospitals offices and factories could even be carbon negative  sourced from a range of low zero carbon and negative emissions technologies last year a report by vivid economics found that deploying cutting edge green technologies like beccs and hydrogen could create and support around 200000 jobs across the uk to support a postcovid green economic recovery will gardiner drax group ceo said drax is europes largest decarbonisation project having transformed britains biggest power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal creating the countrys largest singlesite renewable electricity generator whilst supporting thousands of jobs biomass is unique amongst renewable technologies due to its versatility from being used in power generation to hydrogen production  and even new forms of plastics add to this its ability to deliver negative emissions with beccs  biomass is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions  a technology drax is ready to invest in ends media contacts aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07849090368 ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 editors notes renewable power supplied 416 of britains electricity in 2020 compared to 396 by fossil fuels  the firsttime renewable sources generated more power than fossil fuels over a whole year biomass wind and solar all generated record amounts of power over the course of the year power from britains few remain coal units supplied just 16 of the countrys electricity down from 21 in 2019 the ccc forecast that the share of electricity generated from wind and solar in britain must reach 50 by 2025 and climb to 69 by 2030 electric insights

bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 2900 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan customers through its two b2b energy supply brands haven power and opus energy drax supplies energy to 250000 businesses across britain pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the
