new beccs plants globally 4 june 2021 bechtel a world leader in engineering construction and project management has entered into a strategic partnership with renewable energy company drax to explore options and locations to construct new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs plants globally scaling up beccs sustainably over the coming decades will be critical to delivering the paris agreement climate targets and keeping the world on a pathway of limiting warming to 15 degrees the companies will also work together to identify how the design of a new build beccs plant can be optimised using the latest technology and best practice in engineering design bechtel has entered into a partnership with renewable energy company drax to identify opportunities to construct new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs power plants around the world drax is the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted its power station near selby in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal by deploying beccs vital negative emissions technology drax aims to go further by becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 analysis by independent experts including the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change and international energy agency has identified that beccs and other technologies that can remove emissions from the atmosphere will need to be developed at a global scale over the coming years to limit climate change to 15 degrees of warming bechtel will focus its study on strategically important regions for new build beccs plants including north america and western europe as well as reviewing how to optimise the design of a beccs plant using stateoftheart engineering to maximise efficiency performance and cost jamie cochrane bechtel manager of energy transition said technological advancements have created new opportunities to improve how we bring power to communities worldwide we are resolved to work with our customers on projects that deliver effective ways to contribute to a clean energy future tackling the big global challenges related to climate change is key to meeting aggressive environmental targets and we are proud to partner with drax to optimise design and explore locations for the new generation of beccs facilities jason shipstone drax group chief innovation officer said negative emissions technologies such as beccs are crucial in tackling the global climate crisis and at drax were already planning to retrofit this to our uk power station demonstrating global climate leadership in the transformation of a former coalfired power station were interested in potential opportunities for exporting beccs overseas where drax could help other countries take positive action to address the climate crisis and meet the paris climate commitments by using innovative carbon capture technology to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere negative emissions technologies remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit and are widely accepted by the worlds leading authorities on climate change as being essential in the fight against climate change ends notes to editors bechtels study for drax will establish an integrated design for new build beccs power plants assess viability of strategic locations for new build plants provide strategic information to enable drax to build the business case about beccs at drax international organisations  such as the international energy agency  recognise that beccs is the most mature negative emissions technology they estimate that approximately 13 gtco2 of negative emissions from beccs is required globally every year to reach net zero drax aims to deploy beccs on two of its biomass generating units by 2030 capturing and permanently storing up to eight million tonnes of co 2 a year  a significant proportion of the 53mtco2 of negative emissions from beccs the uks independent climate change committee says are needed in order for the uk to reach its climate targets governments enhanced commitments to reduce emissions by 2035 and phase out coal alongside the unipcc and recent ieas reports also reinforce how net zero is only achievable through negative emissions and sustainable beccs beccs is the only negative emissions technology that generates power whilst also capturing and permanently storing carbon away media

compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan pellet production and supply drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the us south and western canada which have the capacity to manufacture 49 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible
