electricity come from one answer might be the power stations wind turbines and solar panels that generate it you might even go as far as to say the wind sun water biomass and gas powering those stations or even the network companies transporting that power around the country but theres also a very important middleman in this process electricity suppliers most of great britain gets its power from one of the big six energy suppliers which buy electricity from the wholesale market and then sells it to consumers however with more businesses and consumers looking for less carbonintense electricity sources there are now a whole host of smaller companies taking on the incumbents and offering allrenewable electricity from ovo to bulb to draxs own haven power and opus energy  consumers and businesses have more and greener options than ever about where to buy their electricity with many even offering 100 renewable electricity but how do these companies ensure the megawatts powering homes offices and street lights come from renewable sources cleaning up the river the electricity we use doesnt just flow through a single cable from a power station to our houses it travels through whats called the transmissions system which is run by national grid eso and local distribution network operators  apart from offgrid installations like solar panels on buildings some of which are unable to export their unused power all the electricity generated by different sources around the country goes into this same system it means megawatts generated by a wind turbine get mixed up with those generated by a nuclear reactor or a coal power station think of it as a river although it is its own entity it is fed by multiple streams of water coming from different sources in the case of electricity megawatts from various generators are fed into a central system which then enter homes offices and devices around the country so what makes green power generated from renewable sources green power used in homes suppliers cant control exactly what megawatts you use but they can influence the makeup of the overall river your electricity is pulled from by what electricity they agree to buy and offer to their customers renewable suppliers match the amount of electricity their customers use with the amount they buy from renewable sources so if a home uses 4 megawatthours mwh a year  a supplier will need to ensure it buys an equal amount of power from national grid which national grid sources from generators if that supplier offers 100 renewable power it will need to ensure it has the right kinds of deals in place with renewable generators to deliver that amount of power it means that while the river of electricity is still a mix from different streams more of the water will come from renewable streams therefore if more homes and businesses switch to renewable suppliers more of the overall river will be renewable which will in turn help to decarbonise the electricity system enabling a lowercarbon economy but how does this fit into the existing electricity business and infrastructure but how do suppliers actually buy renewable power from generators the business of electricity to understand how suppliers ensure they are buying renewable power you first need to understand how the business works or at least how it used to the most obvious place to start is with the generators be they gas power stations or an offshore wind farm the generator is where electricity is produced and are often owned by a supplier suppliers can buy electricity from their own generators often months or years ahead of delivery but if there is a shortfall the supplier can also buy electricity on the wholesale market where other generators can sell their electricity because suppliers are on a competitive market their aim is to buy the electricity for the lowest possible price and sell it for more  but at a better rate than rivals measures like carbon prices or green incentives help lower the cost of renewable and lowcarbon generation and position it as a more economically viable purchase than more expensive fossil fuels like coal  renewableonly suppliers also want to buy electricity as cheap as possible and sell it as affordably as possible but unlike standard suppliers they only buy electricity from renewable sources this can be done by purchasing electricity from independent renewable generators on the wholesale market or arranged through what are known as power purchase agreements  ppas   longerterm contracts between generators and suppliers agreeing on a specific amount of power the advantage of these for the renewable generator is it secures revenue for the future while for the supplier it means a dependable source of electricity for large installations these deals are often signed before construction even begins to ensure investors there will be a return transitioning to a lowcarbon electricity system however is not just about suppliers buying more electricity from renewable sources the future of electricity suppliers as more businesses individuals and communities are becoming prosumers and generating their own electricity the wider role of the supplier in the system is changing the governments feedintariffs financially reward customers for generating their own electricity even if they dont export it to the grid but even small generators can sign deals with suppliers to sell electricity through schemes such as good energys smartgen policy which is open to generators with between 10 and 100 kilowatts kw of installed capacity similarly opus energy helps over 2100 businesses sell more than 1100 gigawatthours gwh of excess wind solar anaerobic digestion and hydro power for larger prosumer businesses the relationship with suppliers and the grid is different rather than the traditional buying and selling of electricity it requires a cooperative approach to understand how the prosumer can best utilise their assets  beyond increasing the amount of lowcarbon electricity decarbonising the electricity system also means making more efficient use of energy and managing the data that can help improve efficiency haven powers partnership with thames water sees it analyse an average of 68 million halfhour smart meter readings every year using the data to help the company improve its billing and forecasting as the wider system becomes more intelligent suppliers will be able to better forecast how much electricity its customers use and help them reduce their consumption the role required of suppliers in a changing system will create opportunities for more renewable and efficient use of electricity and empower more consumers to get their electricity from lowcarbon sources that can help to make the whole countrys electricity greener want a different perspective on the same story watch tvs jonny ball explain  tags biomass energy  customers  electricity  haven power  opus energy  renewable energy  wind power can great britain keep breaking renewable records 15 february 2019 power generation how low carbon can britains electricity go as low as zero carbon still seems a long way off but every year records continue to be broken for all types of renewable electricity 2018 was no different over the full 12month period 53 of all britains electricity was produced from low carbon sources which includes both renewable and nuclear generation up from 50 in 2017 the increase in low carbon shoved fossil fuel generation down to just 47 of the countrys overall mix the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report found electricitys average carbon intensity fell 8 to 217 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatthour of electricity generated gkwh and while this continues an ongoing decline that keeps the country on track to meet the committee on climate changes target of 100 gkwh by 2030 it was however the slowest rate of decline since 2013 it also highlights that while britain can continue to decarbonise in 2019 the challenges of the years ahead will make it tougher to continue to break the records it has over the past few years httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201902drax_record_highs_and_lowsv03mp4 the highs and lows of 2018 last year every type of renewable record that could be broken was broken wind solar and biomass all set new 10year highs for respective annual monthly and daily generation as well as records for instantaneous output generation over a halfhour period and share of the electricity mix the result was a new instantaneous generation high of 21 gigawatts gw for renewables 58 of total output wind had a particularly good year of renewable recordsetting it broke the 15 gw barrier for instantaneous output for the first time and accounted for 48 of total generation during a half hour period at 5am on 18 december  overall low carbon generation which takes into account renewables and nuclear both that generated in britain and imported from french reactors had an equally recordbreaking year with an average of almost 18 gw across the full year and a new record for instantaneous output of 30 gw at 1pm on 14 june  nearly 90 of total generation over the half hour period while low carbon and individual renewable electricity sources hit record highs there were also some milestone lows coal accounted for an average of just 5 of electricity output over the year hitting a record low in june when it made up just 1 of that months total generation fossil fuel output overall had a similarly significant decline hitting a decadelow of 15 gw on average for 2018  44 of total generation over the year one fossil fuel that bucked the trend however was gas which hit an alltime output of 27 gw for instantaneous generation on the night of 26 january there was low wind on that day last year plus much of the nuclear fleet was out of action for reactor maintenance in one case with seaweed clogging a cooling system  this was all aided by an ongoing decline in overall demand as ever smarter and more efficient devices helped the country reach the decades lowest annual average demand of 335 gw more impressive when considering how much the countrys electricity system has changed over the last decade however is the record low demand net of wind and solar only 99 gw was needed from other energy technologies at 4am on 14 june  how the generation mix has changed the most remarkable change in britains electricity mix has been how far out of favour coal has fallen from its position as the primary source from 2012 to 2014 in the space of four years it has crashed down to sixth in the mix with nuclear wind imports biomass and gas all playing bigger roles in the system this sudden decline in 2015 was the result of the carbon price nearly doubling from 954 to 1808 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  in april making profitable coal power stations lossmaking overnight  with coal continuing to crash out of the mix biomass has become the mostused solid fuel in britains electricity system interconnectors are also playing a more significant part in britains electricity mix since their introduction to the capacity market in 2015  thanks to increased interconnection to europe britain is now a net importer of electricity with 22 twh brought in from europe in 2018  nine times more than it exported while more of britains electricity comes from underwater power lines less of it is being generated by water itself hydros decline from the fifth largest source of electricity to the eighth is the most noticeable shift outside coals slide new largescale hydro installations are expensive and a secondary focus for the government compared with cheaper renewables hydros role in the electricity mix is also affected by drier hotter summers which means lower water levels for solar by contrast the warmer weather will see it play a bigger role and its expected to overtake coal in either 2019 or 2020 what is unlikely to change in the nearfuture however is the position at the top in 2018 gas generated 115 twh  more than nuclear and wind combined but this is just one constant in a future of multiple moving and uncertain parts 2019 a year of unpredictability britain is on course to leave the eu on 29 march the effects this will have on the electricity system are still unknown but one influential factor could be britains exit from the emissions trading scheme ets the euwide market which sets prices of carbon emitted by generators this may mean that rather than paying a carbon price on top of the ets as is currently the case britains generators will only have to pay the new fixed carbon tax of 16 per tonne the uk government says will come into play in april topped up by the carbon price support cps of 18tonne lower prices for carbon relative to the fluctuating ets  cps could make coal suddenly economically viable again the black stuff could potentially become cheaper than other power sources this aboutturn could cause the carbon intensity of electricity generation to bounce up again in one or more years between 2019 and 2025 the date all coal power units will have been decommissioned the knockon effect of lower carbon prices combined with fluctuations in the pound against the euro could see a reverse from imports to exports as britain pumps its cheap potentially coalgenerated electricity over to its european neighbours thats if the interconnectors can continue to function as efficiently as they do at present which some parties believe wont be the case if human traders have to replace the automatic trading systems currently in place sizewell b nuclear power station a reversal of importing to exporting could also reduce the amount of nuclear electricity coming into the country from france future nuclear generation in britain also looks in doubt with toshiba and hitachis decisions to shelve their respective plans for new nuclear reactors which could leave a 9 gw hole in the lowcarbon base capacity that nuclear normally provides renewables have the potential to fill the gap and become an even bigger part of the electricity system but this will require a push for new installations 2018 saw a 60 drop in new wind and solar installations and less than 2 gw of new renewable capacity came onto the system making it the slowest year for renewable growth since 2010 britains electricity has seen significant change over the last decade and 2018 once again saw the country take significant strides towards a low carbon future but challenges lie ahead records might be harder to break but it is important the momentum

instantly think of video games television or cinema along with the special glasses you needed to watch it but another form of 3d is i believe going to be at the heart of the energy revolution which is rapidly gathering place the three ds in this case are data diversification and decarbonisation together they will transform the way businesses buy use and sell their energy help companies take control of their energy use and save money and also play a key part in our journey towards a zero carbon lower cost energy future were already seeing some real innovations in the energy sector our trial of a storage battery with a customer of opus energy is an example offering a farming business in northampton the chance to sell stored energy generated by solar panels back to the grid at times of peak demand  a potential new revenue stream but other innovations and advances will maintain the pace of change and data will be at the core of this now the new generation of smart meters are being installed in businesses  revolutionising customer relationships with their energy suppliers the data from the new meters will finally give customers insight into where and when they use energy suppliers will have to work much more closely with customers to help them access new opportunities for cost savings access to new markets and even new revenue streams an example would be a restaurant with the data smart meters will provide the restaurants supplier will be able to tell the owners how their energy use compares to the local competition and where improvements can be made the detail could go as far as identifying whether the restaurants equipment is older and less efficient whether rivals have installed newer kit or whether other businesses are switching off their equipment earlier or using it at different cheaper times using energy during the peak weekday morning and early evening hours is often the most expensive time to do so data will give businesses the insight into how they can use energy more efficiently and when they use it offering them the chance to avoid buying at peak times whenever possible and driving efficiencies this is why haven powers trading team is now working closely with gridbeyond  the partnership allows our customers to trade the power they produce as well as optimise their operations to help balance the grid at times of peak demand the really smart thing is that in doing so customers are reducing their energy costs and making their operations more sustainable trading desks at haven powers ipswich hq the way demand changes and is managed by businesses and consumers on a diversified power system will also be key the business energy sector is already diversifying as many customers are able to generate and store their own power but the next step is for more customers to be paid to reduce their usage at peak times think of a busy time for the national grid  half time in the fa cup final or after the results in strictly come dancing previously the grid would have to pay a power station to ramp up generation to meet demand but these days customers are paid to reduce demand for 30 minutes or so  in effect becoming a huge virtual power station  this has happened for some time of course with larger industrial customers but now smaller companies can benefit from this too thanks to the data and insight they will have from their smart meters this empowers customers and puts them not the energy companies in control of the key decisions about their energy a close advisory relationship between energy suppliers and their customers will become ever more important to make sure business can choose to avoid the high demand periods and maximises use during the lower cheaper times in fact i can see a time when customers will end up paying more for insight and advice than they do for the power they buy  and theyll save money overall in doing so and if we get all this right it will help drive one of the most important of the three ds  decarbonisation sustainability is increasingly becoming a primary focus for businesses and demand for renewable energy is growing because it is now costeffective that will help us in our drive towards a zero carbon future as more and more renewable energy comes onstream though the uk will continue to need power generated from more flexible assets as well so there are huge opportunities out there to transform our energy landscape but they have to be viewed positively the smart metering programme can be viewed as a regulatory burden or it can be seen as an opportunity we take the positive view likewise batteries were once the preserve of massive companies only but now as technology develops they are becoming available for smaller firms too the more we can innovative on a larger scale the more the technology will work its way into smaller markets too adding momentum to the energy revolution the opportunities are huge if we get it right so too will be the benefits to one of the biggest priorities of all  the work to decarbonise the uk and create the lower carbon future we all want tags customers  electricity  energy policy  national grid  smart grid  sustainability  technology electricity and magnetism the relationship that makes the modern world work 30 january 2019 power generation locked in a parisian vault and stored in a double set of bell jars is a small cylinder of metal made of platinumiridium the carefully guarded lump weighs exactly one kilogram but more than just weighing one kilogram it is the kilogram from which all other official kilograms are weighed international prototype kilogram with protective double glass bell known as the international prototype kilogram or colloquially as le grand k the weight was created in 1889 and has been carefully replicated to offer nations around the world a standardised kilogram but over time le grand k and its clones have slightly deteriorated through wear and tear despite extremely careful use in an age of micro and nanotechnology bits of metal arent quite accurate enough to dictate global weighs and so as of may this year it will no longer be the global measurement for a kilogram  an electromagnet is part of its replacement an electromagnet is effectively a magnet that is turned on by running an electric current through it cutting the current turns it off while increasing or decreasing the strength of the current increases and decreases the power of the magnet it can be used to measure a kilogram very precisely thanks to something called a kibble balance which is essentially a set of scales however instead of using weights it uses an electromagnet to pull down one side because the electric current flowing through the electromagnet can be increased decreased and measured very very accurately it means scientists can define any weight  in this case a kilogram  by the amount of electrical current needed to balance the scale  this radical overhaul of how weights are defined means scientists wont have to fly off to paris every time they need precise kilograms beyond just replacing wornout weights however it highlights the versatility and potential of electromagnets from their use in electricity generation to creating hard drives and powering speakers the simple way to make a magnet magnets and electricity might at first not seem closely connected one powers your fridge the other attaches holiday souvenirs to it the former certainly feels more useful however the relationship between magnetic and electric fields is as close as two sides of the same coin they are both aspects of the same force electromagnetism electromagnetism is very complicated and therere still aspects of it that are unknown today  it was thinking about electromagnetism that led einstein to come up with his theory of special relativity  however actually creating an electromagnet is relatively straightforward all matter is made up of atoms every neutral atoms core is made up of static neutrons and protons with electrons spinning around them these electrons have a charge and a mass giving the electrons a tiny magnetic field  in most matter all atoms are aligned in random ways and effectively all cancel each other out to render the matter nonmagnetic but if the atoms and their electrons can all be aligned in the same direction then the object becomes magnetic a magnet can stick to an object like a paperclip because its permanent magnetic field realigns the atoms in the paperclip to make it temporarily magnetic too  allowing the magnetic forces to line up and the materials to attract however once the paper clip is taken away from the magnet its atoms fall out of sync and point in random directions cancelling out each others magnetic fields once again whether a material can become magnetic or not relies on a similar principal as to whether it can conduct electricity materials like wood and glass are poor conductors because their atoms have a strong hold over their electrons by contrast materials like metals have a loose hold on their electrons and so are good conductors and easily magnetised nickle cobalt and iron are described as ferromagnetic because their atoms can stay in sync making them a permanent magnet but when magnets really become useful is when electricity gets involved putting magnets to work running an electric current through a material with a weak hold on its electrons causes them to align creating an electromagnetic field because of the relationships between electric and magnetic fields the strength of the electromagnet can also be altered by increasing or decreasing the current while switching the flow of the current will flip its north and south poles having this much control over a magnetic field makes it very useful in everyday life including how we generate electricity find out how we rewind a generator core in a clean room at the heart of drax power station inside each of the six generator cores at drax power station is a 120tonne rotor  when a voltage is applied this piece of equipment becomes a massive electromagnet when steam powers the turbines to rotate it at 3000 rpm the rotors very powerful magnetic field knocks electrons in the copper bars of the surrounding stator out of place sending them zooming through the metal in turn generating an electrical current that is sent out to the grid the 660 megawatts mw of active power draxs unit 1 can export into the national transmission system is enough to power 13 million homes for an hour beyond just producing electricity however electromagnets are also used to make it useful to everyday life almost anything electric that depends on moving parts from pumping loud speakers to circuit breakers to the motors of electric cars depend on electromagnets as more decarbonisation efforts lead to greater electrification of areas like transport  electromagnets will remain vital to daily life into the future tags decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs  electricity  electricity generation  technology  transport the small devices that use lots of power and the big buildings that dont 23 january 2019 electrification when texas instruments set about attempting to create the worlds first handheld calculator in the early sixties it estimated that such a complicated device might require a battery as big and powerful as a cars  with some innovative thinking the team were eventually able to power the device with just a fivevolt battery turning the calculator into a truly handheld device and kickstarting an electronics efficiency revolution continuous advances in the space mean that todays superpowered smartphones run on more efficient powerful  and smaller  sources than ever before but as more of our devices become smart and grow in usage their electricity demand is also increasing on the other hand many bigger objects that traditionally have used a lot of power are becoming more efficient and consuming less electricity than before the small devices eating up electricity think of the most electricityintensive appliance in a home something constantly running like a fridgefreezer might come to mind  or something intensive that operates in short blasts like a hairdryer or kettle however a surprising drain of electricity in homes is tv settop boxes and consoles which as recently as 2016 were reported to account for as much as half of all electricity usage by domestic electronics  this is because of how often they are left in standby mode which means they are constantly using a small amount of electricity in 1999 the international energy agency iea introduced the one watt initiative which led to the electricity consumption of many devices on standby falling from around five watts to below one watt and while this has helped reduce standby or vampire power multiplied across the country  the electricity consumption becomes significant  in the uk there are an estimated 27 million tvs this is not just a tvspecific problem however it is symptomatic of many of the modern devices increasingly found in our homes  from smart lightbulbs to amazons alexa these are constantly using small amounts of electricity listening and connecting to the cloud even when not being directly used in 2014 the iea estimated that by 2020 these networkeddevices could result in 120 billion in wasted electricity  adding to this is the increasing demand of the cloud and data storage which has been estimated could account for 20 of the worlds electricity consumption by 2025  previous alarm bells surrounding the bitcoin networks electricity usage highlights that its not just physical connected objects that will put increasing pressure on electricity supply but also entirely digital products yet even as little things become smarter and require more electricity some big things that have previously consumed huge amounts of electricity are becoming more efficient the big things becoming more efficient buildings are a big source of electricity demand globally office blocks full of lights and blasting heating and airconditioning units are among the main offenders but poorly insulated homes that leak heat also have a significant impact efforts are constantly being undertaken to reduce this via technological means such as companies generating their own electricity onsite from installed renewables  but cutting interstitial demand to a minimum doesnt always have to be hitech the bullitt centre in seattle is a 50000 ft 2 office aiming to be the greenest commercial building in the world this is achieved in part through a rooftop solar array that allows the building to generate more electricity than it consumes but is complimented by more straightforward steps such as maximising natural light and ventilation collecting rainwater and the use of geothermal heat pumps on average the building consumes 230000 kilowatthours kwhyear compared to the average of 1077000 kwhyear for seattle offices retrofitting can also make notable reductions to energy usage and new york artdeco icon the empire state building has been updated to consume 40 less electricity  this is largely thanks to straightforward renovations such as ensuring windows open properly and temperatures can be easily controlled energy efficiency is even extending beyond the confines of the planet the international space station only consumes about 90 kw to run which comes from a solar array stretching more than 2400m 2  when its solar panels are operational about 60 of their generation is used to refill batteries for when the station is in the earths shadow the mars desert research station mdrs in utah technology like this will be essential if humans are going to

love to celebrate inventors its inventors that apples famous 90s tv ad claimed think different and in doing so set about changing the world the renewable electricity sources we take for granted today all started with such people who for one reason or another tried something new these are the stories of the people behind five sources of renewable electricity whose inventions and ideas could help power the world towards a zerocarbon future the magicians hydro house water wheel by the side of the trail to the power house at cragside rothbury northumberland using rushing rivers as a source of power dates back centuries as a mechanised way of grinding grains for flour the first reference to a watermill dates from all the way back to the third century bce  however hydropower also played a big role in the early history of electricity generation  the first hydroelectric scheme first came into action in 1878 six years before the invention of the modern steam turbine  what important device did this early source of emissionsfree electricity power a single lamp in the northumberland home of victorian inventor william armstrong this wasnt the only feature that made the house ahead of its time water pressure also helped power a hydraulic lift and a rotating spit in the kitchen  while the house also featured hot and cold running water and an early dishwasher one contemporary visitor dubbed the house a palace of a modern magician the first commercial hydropower power plant however opened on vulcan street in appleton wisconsin in 1882 to provide electricity to two local paper mills as well as the mill owner hj rogers home after a false start on 27 september the vulcan street plant kicked into life in earnest on 30 september generating about 125 kilowatts kw of electricity it was very nearly americas first ever commercial power plant but was beaten to the accolade by thomas edisons pearl street plant in new york which opened a little less than a month earlier the switch to silicon that made solar possible when the international space station is in sunlight about 60 the electricity its solar arrays generate is used to charge the stations batteries the batteries power the station when it is not in the sun for much of the 20 th century solar photovoltaic power generation didnt appear in many more places than on calculators and satellites but now with more largescale and rooftop arrays popping up solar is expected to generate a significant portion of the worlds future energy its been a long journey for solar power from its origins back in 1839 when 19year old aspiring physicist edmond becquerel first noticed the photovoltaic effect the frenchman found that shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution created an electric current  he did not however have any explanation for why this happened american inventor charles fritts was the first to take solar seriously as a source of largescale generation  he hoped to compete with thomas edisons coal powered plants in 1883 when he made the first recognisable solar panel using the element selenium however they were only about 1 efficient and never deployed at scale it would not be until 1953 when scientists calvin fuller gerald pearson and daryl chapin working at bell labs cracked the switch from selenium to silicon that the modern solar panel was created bell labs unveiled the breakthrough invention to the world the following year using it to power a small toy ferris wheel and a radio transmitter fuller pearson and chapins solar panel was only 6 efficient a big step forward for the time but today panels can convert more than 40 of the suns light into electricity  the wind pioneers who believed in selfgeneration offshore wind farm near øresund bridge between sweden and denmark like hydropower wind has long been harnessed as a source of power with the earliest examples of windpowered grain mills and hydro pumps appearing in persia as early as 500 bc the first electricitygenerating windmill was used to power the mansion of ohiobased inventor charles brush the 60foot 183 metres wooden tower featured 144 blades and supplied about 12 kw of electricity to the house charles brushs wind turbine charged a dozen batteries each with 34 cells the turbine was erected in 1888 and powered the house for two decades brush wasnt just a wind power pioneer either and in the basement of the mansion sat 12 batteries that could be recharged and act as electricity sources small turbines generating between 5 kw and 25 kw were important at the turn of the 19 th into the 20 th century in the us when they helped bring electricity to remote rural areas however over in denmark scientist and teacher poul la cour had his own grander vision for wind power  la cours breakthroughs included using a regulator to maintain a steady stream of power and discovering that a turbine with fewer blades spinning quickly is more efficient than one with many blades turning slowly he was also a strong advocate for what might now be recognised as decentralisation  he believed wind turbines provided an important social purpose in supplying small communities and farms with a cheap dependable source of electricity away from corporate influence in 2017 denmark had more than 53 gigawatts gw of installed wind capacity  accounting for 44 of the countrys power generation the prince and the power plant larderello italy italian princes arent a regular sight in the history books of renewable energy but at the turn of the last century on a tuscan hillside piero ginori conti prince of trevignano set about harnessing natural geysers to generate electricity in 1904 he had become head of a boric acid extraction firm founded by his wifes greatgrandfather his plan for the business included improving the quality of products increasing production and lowering prices but to do this he needed a steady stream of cheap electricity in 1905 he harnessed the dry steam which lacks moisture preventing corrosion of turbine blades from the geographically active area near larderello in southern tuscany to drive a turbine and power five light bulbs  encouraged by this conti expanded the operation into a prototype power plant capable of powering larderellos main industrial plants and residential buildings it evolved into the worlds first commercial geothermal power plant in 1913 supplying 250 kw of electricity to villages around the region by the end of 1943 there was 132 megawatts mw of installed capacity in the area but as the main source of electricity for central italys entire rail network it was bombed heavily in world war two following reconstruction and expansion the region has grown to reach current capacity of more than 800 mw globally there is now more than 83 gw of installed geothermal capacity  the engineer who took on an oil crisis with wood compressed wood pellet storage domes at baton rouge transit drax biomass port facility on the mississippi river while sawmills had experimented with waste products as a power sources and compressed sawdust sold as domestic fuel  it wasnt until the energy crisis of the 1970s that the term biomass was coined and wood pellets became a serious alternative to fossil fuels as a response to the 1973 yom kippur war the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries opec placed oil embargoes against several nations including the uk and us the result was a global price increase from 3 in october 1973 to 12 in march 1974 with prices even higher in the us where the countrys dependence on imported fossil fuels was acutely exposed  one of the most vulnerable sectors to booms in oil prices was the aviation industry to tackle the growing scarcity of petroleumbased fuels boeing looked to fuelefficiency engineer jerry whitfield  his task was to find an alternative fuel for industries such as manufacturing which were hit particularly hard by the oil shortage and subsequent recession this would in turn leave more oil for planes wood pellets from morehouse bioenergy a drax biomass pellet plant in northern louisiana being unloaded at baton rouge transit for storage and onward travel by ship to england whitfield teamed up with ken tucker who  inspired by pelletised animal feed  was experimenting with fuel pellets for industrial furnaces the pelletisation approach combined with whitfields knowledge of forcedair furnace technology opened a market beyond just industrial power sources and whitfield eventually left boeing to focus on domestic heating stoves and pellet production one of the lasting effects of the oil crisis was a realisation in many western countries of the need to diversify electricity generation  prompting expansion of renewable sources and experiments with biomass cofiring since then biomass pellet technology has built on its legacy as an abundant source of lowcarbon renewable energy with largescale pellet production beginning in sweden in 1992 production has continued to grow as more countries decarbonise electricity generation and move away from fossil fuels since those original pioneers first harnessed earths renewable sources for electricity generation the cost of doing so has dropped dramatically and efficiency skyrocketed the challenge now is in implementing the capacity and technology to build a safe stable and lowcarbon electricity system tags electricity  electricity generation  sustainability  technology what causes power cuts 16 january 2019 power generation on the night of 5 december 2015 61000 homes and properties across lancaster were plunged into darkness storm desmond had unleashed torrents of rain on great britain causing rivers to swell and spill over with waters rising to unprecedented levels the river lune began threatening to flood lancasters main electricity substation the facility where transformers step down electricitys voltage from the transmission system so it can be distributed safely around the local area to prevent unrepairable damage the decision was taken to switch the substation off cutting all power across the region lights phones internet connections and atms all went dead across the city it would take three days of intensive work before power was restored it was a bigger power outage than most but it offers a unique glimpse into the mechanisms behind a blackout  not only how theyre dealt with but how theyre caused what causes blackouts in great britain flooded electricity sub station in lancaster sunday 6 december 2015 when the lights go out a common thought is that the country has run out of electricity however a lack of electricity generation is almost never the cause of outages only during the miners strikes of 1972 were major power cuts the result of lack of electricity production rather than meeting electricity demand power cuts in great britain are more often the result of disruption to the transmission system caused by unpredictable weather if trees or piles of snow bring down one power line the load of electric current shifts to other lines  if this sudden jump in load is too much for the other lines they automatically trip offline to prevent damage to the equipment this in turn shifts the load on to other lines which also then trip potentially causing cascading outages across the network last marchs beast from the east  which brought six days of near subzero temperatures deep snow and high winds to great britain is an example of extreme weather cutting electricity to as many as 18000 people  highwinds brought trees and branches down onto powerlines while ice and snow impacted the millions of components that make up the electricity system engineering teams had to fight the elements and make the repairs needed to get electricity flowing again lancaster was different however with the slow creep of rising rainwater approaching the substation the threat of long lasting damage was plain to see in advance and so rather than waiting for it to autotrip authorities chose to manually shut it down getting reconnected an emergency generator brought from london is reversed into position adjacent to the sub station in bold street morecambe near lancaster monday 7 december 2015 electricity north west is lancasters network operator and after shutting down the substation it began the intensive job of trying to restore power on monday 7 december two days after the storm hit the first step of pumping the flooded substation empty of water had finally been completed and the task of reconnecting it began to begin restoring power to the region 75 large mobile generators were brought from as far away as the west country and northern ireland and hooked up to the substation allowing 22000 customers to be reconnected once partial power was restored the next challenge lay in repairing and reconnecting the substation to the transmission network while shutting the facility had prevented catastrophic damage some of the crucial pieces had to be completely replaced or rebuilt after three days of intensive engineering work the remaining 40000 properties that had lost power were reconnected preventing blackouts in a changing system the cause and scale of lancasters outage were unusual for great britains electricity system but it does highlight how quickly a power cut may arise in a time of transition when the grid is decarbonising and the network is facing more extreme weather conditions because of climate change it could create even more new challenges coal is scheduled to be taken entirely off the system after 2025 making the country more reliant on weatherdependent sources such as wind and solar  potentially increasing the volatility of the system on the other hand growing decentralised electricity generation may reduce the number of individual buildings affected by outages in the future solar generation and storage systems present on domestic and commercial property may also reduce dependency on local transmission systems and the impact of disruptions to it the cables and poles that connect the transmission system will always be vulnerable to faults and disruptions however by preparing for the future grid great britain can reduce the impact of storms on the electricity system if youre experiencing a power cut in your area please call the tollfree

generation simplified 2 november 2018 power generation generating electricity in a power station is a huge complex operation thousands of tonnes of fuel millions of gallons of water intense temperatures and incredibly high pressures all go into spinning turbines and turning generators  which in turn creates electricity but strip it back to its basics and making electricity is relatively simple all it takes is a magnet metal and motion turning motion into electricity british scientist michael faraday first realised the relationship between magnetic fields and electricity in 1831 he noticed when a magnet moved through a coil of copper a current flows through the wires the same thing happens if the wires are moved and the magnetic is static all that matters is that there is motion in a magnetic field  allowing the kinetic energy to be converted into electrical energy this simple observation is still the basis of how electricity is generated around the world today to replicate this process in miniature we can use spinning copper wires and an everyday magnet at this scale the electric current induced is very small  not even enough to power an led light however an ammeter shows the tiny voltage passing along the wires this is possible because of the relationship between magnetic fields and electric currents httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201811dra469_efordummies_v1mp4 how electrons create electricity the key to how magnetic fields convert motion into electric currents is found in atoms every neutral atoms core is made up of static neutrons and protons with electrons zooming around them however with the right outside force introduced electrons can be stimulated which causes them to break away from an atom and set off a chain reaction that knocks other electrons free in turn creating an electric current a magnet can provide this outside force passing the magnetic field through copper wires for example breaks electrons from their copper atoms and sends them flowing in one direction metals are good at conducting electricity because their atoms have a looser hold on their electrons than materials like wood or glass making it easier for a magnetic field to free them the speed at which the magnetic field passes through the atoms affects how many electrons are broken off from them if more kinetic energy is put into the magnet and it passes through faster more electrons are set free and more current flows scaling generation up its this simple principal of magnets metal and motion that powers most of world but in power stations it is scaled up and optimised to supply huge amounts of electrical power each of draxs 600plus megawatt generators contains a 120 tonne rotor which acts as a very strong electromagnet this sits inside the stator which weighs 300 tonnes and contains 84 11metre long copper bars high pressure steam is used to spin a series of turbines which in turn spin the rotor and its magnetic field at 3000 rpm as it spins a voltage is induced in its stator at a frequency of 50 cycles per second which sets the frequency for the entire grid  50 hz sending electrons zooming through the stator bars which carry a huge electric current this is the same in almost every form of electricity generation that uses a rotating generator from wind to hydro to nuclear to biomass  solar generation is the exception but it uses the same principle of knocking around electrons instead of using a magnetic field to break electrons from metal atoms solar panels use photons from sunlight to free electrons from a negatively charged layer of silicon film these are then attracted to a layer of positive film which creates an electrical current that is collected and channelled from each solar panel at its mostbasic electricity generation is simple and even as the world switches to less carbonintense means of production the straightforward concept of using a magnetic metal and motion will remain at its heart tags electricity does electricity have a smell 20 july 2018 electrification freshly baked bread newly cut grass sizzling bacon many of the worlds most evocative smells often need electricity to make them but does electricity itself have a smell the short answer is no an electric current itself doesnt have an odour but in instances when electricity becomes visible or audible it also creates a distinctive smell the smell electricity emits is the contents of the gasses created when electricity conducts through air says drax lead engineer gary preece in an instance of a failure on a switch board for example and theres a flash of electricity gasses are created from the charged air including ozone its the same ozone gas that makes up the lower layer of the earths atmosphere and is often described as having a clean chlorinelike but burnt smell while it can sometimes be dangerous ozone is also a very useful gas what is ozone ozones scientific name is trioxide as it is made up of three oxygen molecules while the normal oxygen we breathe is o 2  ozone is o 3 and is created by electricity in a similar way to how it forms naturally in the atmosphere there are large amounts of oxygen and nitrogen floating around in the atmosphere protecting life on earth from the suns intense uv radiation these rays are so powerful they can ionise the oxygen ripping it apart into two individual molecules however these lonely molecules are highly reactive and will sometimes collide and bond with nearby o 2 to create ozone an electric current at a high voltage  given the right conditions  will conduct through the air ionising oxygen in its wake and creating ozone just as the suns uv rays do when electricity behaves like this its known as a corona discharge  which makes a crackling sound and creates a visible plasma the most common time people may come into contact with a whiff of ozone is when a storm is approaching lighting is essentially a massive plasma that creates ozone as it conducts through the air with the smell often arriving before the storm hits it highlights quite how pungent ozone is considering humans can smell it in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion in ordinary air the concerns and capabilities of ozone while ozone protects the planet when its in the atmosphere it can be dangerous at ground level where it can also form through naturally occurring gases reacting with air pollution sources high exposure to ozone at ground level can lead to lung throat and breathing problems however because it also has a damaging effect on bacteria ozone can be very useful in the medical field and electricity is being used to deliberately create it in fact ozone has been experimented with in medicine for more than a century with its ability to attack and kill bacteria making it useful as a disinfectant during the first world war it was used to treat wounds and prevent them becoming inflamed and was also found to aid blood flow electricity plays an important role in almost everything we interact with on a daily basis affecting all our senses even smell tags
