power station visit drax power station draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station wins six year contract to keep electricity system stable draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in scotland has won a six year contract to provide system support services to the national grid to help maintain secure supplies 29 january 2020 national grid has awarded synchronous compensation contract to draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station the contract is to provide system services to keep the national grid stable the contract means drax will provide services such as inertia which keeps the system stable and reactive power which helps move power around the grid for the next six years andy koss ceo generation drax at cruachan power station click to viewdownload in high res system services such as inertia and reactive power were readily available in the past due to the number of large spinning power stations on the electricity system but the rise of nonsynchronous generators such as solar wind and interconnectors mean these services are now more important and have to be procured separately  andy koss ceo drax generation said provision of these crucial services is central to draxs purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future our strategic aim is to be a leading provider of system services which support the deployment of more renewable power  it could also help to bring us a step closer to our ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 this is the first tender national grid eso has run under phase one of its system stability pathfinder under the terms of the provisional contract one of the four turbines at the 440mw cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in argyll and bute will no longer generate power instead the turbine will only be used to provide the services needed to support the system national grid currently plans further stability tenders to take place both nationally and regionally which provide an opportunity to secure further contracts for some of draxs other power generation assets notes to editors national grid esos system stability pathfinder tender is separate to the capacity market auctions starting tomorrow and units are able to take part in both processes provided they are available to provide the contracted services inertia is a system support service which acts like a shock absorber helping to control changes in frequency to ensure the grid maintains a frequency of 50hz without having enough inertia available to reduce the rate of frequency changes which occur on the system the grid is more vulnerable to power cuts national grid made an announcement about its new approach to stability services today ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e
