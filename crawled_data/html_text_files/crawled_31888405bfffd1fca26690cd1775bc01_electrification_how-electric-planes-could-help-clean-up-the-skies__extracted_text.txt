electric planes could help clean up the skies with companies racing to develop electric aviation technology could flying be on the brink of decarbonisation 7 august 2019 electrification you probably havent heard the phrase flygskam before but you might have felt it the recently coined swedish term refers to the a shame or embarrassment caused by flying and its effect of the environment its not an uncommon feeling either with 23 of people in the country now claiming to have abstained from air travel in the past year to lessen their climate impact from electric cars to cleaner shipping  transport is undergoing dramatic change however aviation is proving more difficult to decarbonise than most forms of transportation as airports cargo and the number of passengers flying every day continues to expand the need to decarbonise air travel is more pressing than ever if aviation is to avoid becoming a barrier to climate action for other transport sectors facing a similar dilemma electrification has proved a key route forward could the electrification of aeroplanes be next the problem with planes aeroplanes still rely on fossil fuels to provide the huge amount of power needed for takeoff globally flights produced 859 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  in 2017  the aviation industry as a whole accounts for 2 of all emissions derived from human activity and 12 of all transport emissions despite growing awareness of the contribution co 2 emissions make to causing the climate change emergency estimates show global air traffic could quadruple by 2050  electrification of air travel presents the potential to drastically cut plane emissions while also offering other benefits electric planes could be 50 quieter with reduced aircraft noise pollution potentially enabling airports to operate around the clock and closer to cities electric planes could also be as much as 10 cheaper for airlines to operate by eliminating the massive expense of jet fuel and fewer moving parts making electric motors easier to maintain compared to traditional jets these cost savings for airlines could be passed on to passengers and businesses needing to move goods in the form of cheaper flights but while the benefits are obvious the pressing question is how feasible is it the race to electric planes start ups are now racing to develop electric planes that will reduce emissions  such ampaire and wright electric the latter has even partnered with easyjet to develop electric planes for shorthaul routes of around 335mile distances which make up a fifth of the budget carriers routes easyjet going electric source easyjetcom  easyjet has highlighted london to amsterdam as a key route they hope wright electrics planes will operate with potential for other zeroemission flights between london and belfast dublin paris and brussels the partners aim to have an electric passenger jets on the tarmac by 2027  ahead on the runway however is israeli firm eviation which recently debuted a prototype for the worlds first commercial allelectric passenger aircraft  named alice the craft is expected to carry nine passengers for 650 miles and could be up and running as early as 2022 the challenge these companies face however is developing the batteries needed to power electric motors capable of delivering the propulsion needed for a plane full of passengers and luggage to take off currently batteries dont have anywhere near the energy density of traditional kerosene jet fuel  60 less  alices battery is colossal weighing 38 metric tons and accounting for 60 of the planes overall weight by contrast traditional planes allocate around 30 of total weight to fuel as conventional jets burn fuel they get lighter whereas electric planes would have to carry the same battery weight for the full duration of a flight closer to home on scotlands orkney islands electric planes could be perfectly suited to replace expensive jet fuel on the regions supershort island hopping service  theres little need for rangeanxiety with the longest flight from kirkwall to north ronaldsay lasting just 20 minutes and the shortest taking less than two minutes between the tiny islands of papa westray and neighbouring westray orkney is already known for its renewable credentials exporting more windgenerated power to the grid than it is able to consume the local council plans to investigate retrofitting its eightseater aircraft which carried more than 21000 passengers last year with electric motors as early as 2022 taking electric long haul the planes currently under development by ampaire wright electric and eviation are small aircraft only capable of short distance flights this is a long way behind the lengths capable of traditional fossil fuelpowered jets built by airline industry stalwarts airbus and boeing which are making their own move into electrification ampaire electric but only for short distances source ampairecom  even with drastic developments in battery technology however airbus estimates its longhaul a320 airliner which seats between 100 and 240 passengers would only be able to fly for a fifth of its range as an electric plane and only manage to carry half its regular cargo load elsewhere french jet enginemaker safran predicts that fullsize batterypowered commercial aircraft wont become a reality until 2050 at the earliest however if going fully electric may not yet be possible for large longhaul planes hybrid aircraft which use both conventional and electric power offer a potential middle ground a team comprising rollsroyce airbus and siemens are working on a project set to launch in 2021 called efan x which would combine an electric motor with a bae 146 aircrafts jet engine airbus say they may have to reduce their cargo to go electric source wwwairbuscom  hybrid models aim to use electric engines as the power source for the energyintensive takeoff and landing processes saving jet fuel and reducing noise around airports then while the plane is in the air it would switch to conventional kerosene engines which are most efficient when the plane reaches cruising altitude airbus aims to introduce a hybrid version of their bestselling singleaisle a320 passenger jet by 2035 while start ups and established jet makers jostle to get electric and hybrid planes off the ground there are other ideas around reducing aviation emissions technology of the future for decarbonising planes the university of illinois is working with nasa to develop hydrogen fuel cells capable of powering allelectric air travel hydrogen fuel cells work by combining hydrogen and oxygen to cause a chemical reaction that generates an electric current while the ingredients are very light the problem is they are bulky to store and on planes making effective use of space is key researchers are combatting this by experimenting with cryogenically freezing the gases into liquids which makes them more spaceefficient to store but makes refuelling trickier as airports would need the infrastructure to work with the freezing liquids there have also been experiments into solarpowered planes in 2016 a team of swiss adventurers succeeded in flying around the world in an aircraft that uses solar panels on its wings to power its propellers with a wingspan wider than a boeing 747 but weighing just a fraction of a traditional jet the solar impulse 2 is capable of staying airborne for as long as six days though only able to carry a lone pilot solar impulse 2 has great staying power while the feat is impressive the solar impulse team says the aim was to showcase the advancement of solar technology rather than develop solar planes for mainstream usage elsewhere mit engineers have been working on the first ever plane with no moving parts in its propulsion system instead the model uses ionic wind  a silent but hugely powerful flow of ions produced aboard the plane ionic wind is created when a current is passed between a thick and thin electrode with enough voltage applied the air between the electrodes produces thrust capable of propelling a small aircraft steadily during flight mit hope that ionic wind systems could be paired with conventional jets to make hybrid planes for a range of uses a general blueprint for an mit plane propelled by ionic wind source mit electric aircraft initiative newsmitedu  like any emerging technology it will take time to develop these alternative power sources to reach the point where they can safely and securely serve the global aviation industry however its clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is underway flying as we know it has been slow to adapt but with a growing awareness and levels of flygskam among consumers there is greater pressure on the industry to decarbonise and lay out positive solutions to cleaner air travel share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net
