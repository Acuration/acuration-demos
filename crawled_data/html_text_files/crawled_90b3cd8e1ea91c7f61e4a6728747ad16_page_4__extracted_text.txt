electricity generation the renewable pioneers 18 january 2019 power generation people love to celebrate inventors its inventors that apples famous 90s tv ad claimed think different and in doing so set about changing the world the renewable electricity sources we take for granted today all started with such people who for one reason or another tried something new these are the stories of the people behind five sources of renewable electricity whose inventions and ideas could help power the world towards a zerocarbon future the magicians hydro house water wheel by the side of the trail to the power house at cragside rothbury northumberland using rushing rivers as a source of power dates back centuries as a mechanised way of grinding grains for flour the first reference to a watermill dates from all the way back to the third century bce  however hydropower also played a big role in the early history of electricity generation  the first hydroelectric scheme first came into action in 1878 six years before the invention of the modern steam turbine  what important device did this early source of emissionsfree electricity power a single lamp in the northumberland home of victorian inventor william armstrong this wasnt the only feature that made the house ahead of its time water pressure also helped power a hydraulic lift and a rotating spit in the kitchen  while the house also featured hot and cold running water and an early dishwasher one contemporary visitor dubbed the house a palace of a modern magician the first commercial hydropower power plant however opened on vulcan street in appleton wisconsin in 1882 to provide electricity to two local paper mills as well as the mill owner hj rogers home after a false start on 27 september the vulcan street plant kicked into life in earnest on 30 september generating about 125 kilowatts kw of electricity it was very nearly americas first ever commercial power plant but was beaten to the accolade by thomas edisons pearl street plant in new york which opened a little less than a month earlier the switch to silicon that made solar possible when the international space station is in sunlight about 60 the electricity its solar arrays generate is used to charge the stations batteries the batteries power the station when it is not in the sun for much of the 20 th century solar photovoltaic power generation didnt appear in many more places than on calculators and satellites but now with more largescale and rooftop arrays popping up solar is expected to generate a significant portion of the worlds future energy its been a long journey for solar power from its origins back in 1839 when 19year old aspiring physicist edmond becquerel first noticed the photovoltaic effect the frenchman found that shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution created an electric current  he did not however have any explanation for why this happened american inventor charles fritts was the first to take solar seriously as a source of largescale generation  he hoped to compete with thomas edisons coal powered plants in 1883 when he made the first recognisable solar panel using the element selenium however they were only about 1 efficient and never deployed at scale it would not be until 1953 when scientists calvin fuller gerald pearson and daryl chapin working at bell labs cracked the switch from selenium to silicon that the modern solar panel was created bell labs unveiled the breakthrough invention to the world the following year using it to power a small toy ferris wheel and a radio transmitter fuller pearson and chapins solar panel was only 6 efficient a big step forward for the time but today panels can convert more than 40 of the suns light into electricity  the wind pioneers who believed in selfgeneration offshore wind farm near øresund bridge between sweden and denmark like hydropower wind has long been harnessed as a source of power with the earliest examples of windpowered grain mills and hydro pumps appearing in persia as early as 500 bc the first electricitygenerating windmill was used to power the mansion of ohiobased inventor charles brush the 60foot 183 metres wooden tower featured 144 blades and supplied about 12 kw of electricity to the house charles brushs wind turbine charged a dozen batteries each with 34 cells the turbine was erected in 1888 and powered the house for two decades brush wasnt just a wind power pioneer either and in the basement of the mansion sat 12 batteries that could be recharged and act as electricity sources small turbines generating between 5 kw and 25 kw were important at the turn of the 19 th into the 20 th century in the us when they helped bring electricity to remote rural areas however over in denmark scientist and teacher poul la cour had his own grander vision for wind power  la cours breakthroughs included using a regulator to maintain a steady stream of power and discovering that a turbine with fewer blades spinning quickly is more efficient than one with many blades turning slowly he was also a strong advocate for what might now be recognised as decentralisation  he believed wind turbines provided an important social purpose in supplying small communities and farms with a cheap dependable source of electricity away from corporate influence in 2017 denmark had more than 53 gigawatts gw of installed wind capacity  accounting for 44 of the countrys power generation the prince and the power plant larderello italy italian princes arent a regular sight in the history books of renewable energy but at the turn of the last century on a tuscan hillside piero ginori conti prince of trevignano set about harnessing natural geysers to generate electricity in 1904 he had become head of a boric acid extraction firm founded by his wifes greatgrandfather his plan for the business included improving the quality of products increasing production and lowering prices but to do this he needed a steady stream of cheap electricity in 1905 he harnessed the dry steam which lacks moisture preventing corrosion of turbine blades from the geographically active area near larderello in southern tuscany to drive a turbine and power five light bulbs  encouraged by this conti expanded the operation into a prototype power plant capable of powering larderellos main industrial plants and residential buildings it evolved into the worlds first commercial geothermal power plant in 1913 supplying 250 kw of electricity to villages around the region by the end of 1943 there was 132 megawatts mw of installed capacity in the area but as the main source of electricity for central italys entire rail network it was bombed heavily in world war two following reconstruction and expansion the region has grown to reach current capacity of more than 800 mw globally there is now more than 83 gw of installed geothermal capacity  the engineer who took on an oil crisis with wood compressed wood pellet storage domes at baton rouge transit drax biomass port facility on the mississippi river while sawmills had experimented with waste products as a power sources and compressed sawdust sold as domestic fuel  it wasnt until the energy crisis of the 1970s that the term biomass was coined and wood pellets became a serious alternative to fossil fuels as a response to the 1973 yom kippur war the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries opec placed oil embargoes against several nations including the uk and us the result was a global price increase from 3 in october 1973 to 12 in march 1974 with prices even higher in the us where the countrys dependence on imported fossil fuels was acutely exposed  one of the most vulnerable sectors to booms in oil prices was the aviation industry to tackle the growing scarcity of petroleumbased fuels boeing looked to fuelefficiency engineer jerry whitfield  his task was to find an alternative fuel for industries such as manufacturing which were hit particularly hard by the oil shortage and subsequent recession this would in turn leave more oil for planes wood pellets from morehouse bioenergy a drax biomass pellet plant in northern louisiana being unloaded at baton rouge transit for storage and onward travel by ship to england whitfield teamed up with ken tucker who  inspired by pelletised animal feed  was experimenting with fuel pellets for industrial furnaces the pelletisation approach combined with whitfields knowledge of forcedair furnace technology opened a market beyond just industrial power sources and whitfield eventually left boeing to focus on domestic heating stoves and pellet production one of the lasting effects of the oil crisis was a realisation in many western countries of the need to diversify electricity generation  prompting expansion of renewable sources and experiments with biomass cofiring since then biomass pellet technology has built on its legacy as an abundant source of lowcarbon renewable energy with largescale pellet production beginning in sweden in 1992 production has continued to grow as more countries decarbonise electricity generation and move away from fossil fuels since those original pioneers first harnessed earths renewable sources for electricity generation the cost of doing so has dropped dramatically and efficiency skyrocketed the challenge now is in implementing the capacity and technology to build a safe stable and lowcarbon electricity system tags sustainability  technology  electricity  electricity generation what causes power cuts 16 january 2019 power generation on the night of 5 december 2015 61000 homes and properties across lancaster were plunged into darkness storm desmond had unleashed torrents of rain on great britain causing rivers to swell and spill over with waters rising to unprecedented levels the river lune began threatening to flood lancasters main electricity substation the facility where transformers step down electricitys voltage from the transmission system so it can be distributed safely around the local area to prevent unrepairable damage the decision was taken to switch the substation off cutting all power across the region lights phones internet connections and atms all went dead across the city it would take three days of intensive work before power was restored it was a bigger power outage than most but it offers a unique glimpse into the mechanisms behind a blackout  not only how theyre dealt with but how theyre caused what causes blackouts in great britain flooded electricity sub station in lancaster sunday 6 december 2015 when the lights go out a common thought is that the country has run out of electricity however a lack of electricity generation is almost never the cause of outages only during the miners strikes of 1972 were major power cuts the result of lack of electricity production rather than meeting electricity demand power cuts in great britain are more often the result of disruption to the transmission system caused by unpredictable weather if trees or piles of snow bring down one power line the load of electric current shifts to other lines  if this sudden jump in load is too much for the other lines they automatically trip offline to prevent damage to the equipment this in turn shifts the load on to other lines which also then trip potentially causing cascading outages across the network last marchs beast from the east  which brought six days of near subzero temperatures deep snow and high winds to great britain is an example of extreme weather cutting electricity to as many as 18000 people  highwinds brought trees and branches down onto powerlines while ice and snow impacted the millions of components that make up the electricity system engineering teams had to fight the elements and make the repairs needed to get electricity flowing again lancaster was different however with the slow creep of rising rainwater approaching the substation the threat of long lasting damage was plain to see in advance and so rather than waiting for it to autotrip authorities chose to manually shut it down getting reconnected an emergency generator brought from london is reversed into position adjacent to the sub station in bold street morecambe near lancaster monday 7 december 2015 electricity north west is lancasters network operator and after shutting down the substation it began the intensive job of trying to restore power on monday 7 december two days after the storm hit the first step of pumping the flooded substation empty of water had finally been completed and the task of reconnecting it began to begin restoring power to the region 75 large mobile generators were brought from as far away as the west country and northern ireland and hooked up to the substation allowing 22000 customers to be reconnected once partial power was restored the next challenge lay in repairing and reconnecting the substation to the transmission network while shutting the facility had prevented catastrophic damage some of the crucial pieces had to be completely replaced or rebuilt after three days of intensive engineering work the remaining 40000 properties that had lost power were reconnected preventing blackouts in a changing system the cause and scale of lancasters outage were unusual for great britains electricity system but it does highlight how quickly a power cut may arise in a time of transition when the grid is decarbonising and the network is facing more extreme weather conditions because of climate change it could create even more new challenges coal is scheduled to be taken entirely off the system after 2025 making the country more reliant on weatherdependent sources such as wind and solar  potentially increasing the volatility of the system on the other hand growing decentralised electricity generation may reduce the number of individual buildings affected by outages in the future solar generation and storage systems present on domestic and commercial property may also reduce dependency on local transmission systems and the impact of disruptions to it the cables and poles that connect the transmission system will always be vulnerable to faults and disruptions however by preparing for the future grid great britain can reduce the impact of storms on the electricity

grid  electricity  electricity generation the inside of a cooling tower looks like no place on earth 29 november 2018 power generation the silhouette of cooling towers on the horizon is one of the most recognisable symbols of electricity generation around the world but inside these massive structures is an environment unlike any other when cooling towers are in operation torrents of warm water cascade down to a huge pond at its base the air cooling it as it falls plumes of water vapour rise through the structure and into the air but when shut down  for maintenance for example  the inside of a cooling tower is a very different place the vast emptiness of the space can be eerily silent even the smallest noise echoes around its concrete shell standing at over 114 metres high each of draxs 12 cooling towers are 86 metres in diameter at their base 53 metres at their summit and could comfortably fit the statue of liberty inside everything about them is huge but they are not the unsophisticated masses of concrete they appear from afar look at a cooling tower and you might think its a substantial thick structure its not explains nick smith a civil engineer at drax its basically like an egg shell it is the shape that gives it its strength for the majority of their height a typical cooling tower is between just 178 and 180 mm  or 7 inches  thick its a testament to the original design and construction that they require such limited maintenance more than half a century after plans were first drawn up especially considering they are in daily use what does a cooling tower do water is an essential part of thermal electricity generation it is turned into highpressure steam in the extreme temperatures of a boiler before being used to spin turbines and generate electricity water within the boiler is demineralised and purified to prevent damage to the turbine blades and infrastructure once it leaves the turbine the steam is cooled to pure water again in the condenser so it can be reused in the boiler to do this the steam is passed over pipes containing cold water from the cooling towers which cools and condenses the steam while also heating up the cold water to roughly 40 degrees celsius the temperature it is at when it enters the cooling tower inside the towers the warm water is poured over whats known as the cooling tower pack a series of stacks of corrugated plastic that sit roughly 30 metres up the tower the heat and the towers height create a natural draught this pulls air in from the cavities at the base of the tower  called the throat  which cools the water to around 20c as it cascades down the stack into a pond below it is then returned to the condenser where the cooling cycle starts all over again only around 2 of the water escapes through the top of the cooling towers as water vapour  which is what can be seen exiting the top of the towers  with a further 1 returned to the river ouse to control water levels these small losses are replenished with water taken from the ouse it highlights the genius of the towers design that their shape alone can cool water so efficiently on an industrial scale with minimal environmental impact a lasting design a cooling towers iconic shape is known as a hyperboloid referring to its inward curve this makes them very stable but to make them strong enough to last as long as they have draxs cooling towers have the added assistance of reinforced concrete concrete is very strong in compression but it has hardly any tensile strength says smith therefore our cooling towers have both vertical and horizontal hoop reinforcement to take any tensile forces generated it is the concrete and steel working together that gives the reinforced concrete its strength the level of design and engineering of draxs cooling towers are all the more impressive considering their age the construction of our first tower was completed in 1970 and designed in the mid 1960s says smith pointing out they were designed at a time where there wasnt huge computing processing power so they would likely have been designed by hand they were constructed to a very high degree of accuracy even when a lot of the equipment used would have been manual he adds designing and building a cooling tower today he adds would require significant computing power and sophisticated settingout equipment to ensure the accuracy of the construction however the underlying principles of the towers shape and how well they have continued to perform since their construction would give little reason to deviate from the current design in fact that consistent performance means that even as the nature of generating electricity develops to include new fuels and technologies cooling towers remain an integral part of the process draxs repower project  which could see the conversion of the plants remaining coal units to gas and the installation of a giant battery facility  is a significant step forward in the evolution of power generation yet the design and purpose of the cooling towers would remain the same the structures that will shape the landscape of the future of electricity generation may include wind turbines biomass domes and solar panels but the enduring functionality of natural draught concrete cooling towers means they will still play a role in producing the countrys electricity

of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which

volatility when combined with renewable earnings and system support from existing biomass generation the acquisition is expected to lead to an increase in the quality of earnings diversified generation and portfolio benefits wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the acquisition accelerates draxs development from a singlesite generation business into a multisite multitechnology operator with the acquisition of this portfolio a fall in gas prices could be mitigated by an increase in gasfired generation reflecting the relative dispatch economics of the different technologies drax expects to benefit from the management of generation across a broader asset base leveraging the groups expertise in the operation trading and optimisation of large rotating mass generation drax believes that the team operating the portfolio has a strong engineering culture which is closely aligned with the drax model and will enhance the groups strong capabilities across engineering disciplines around 260 operational roles will transfer to drax as part of the acquisition complementing and reinforcing draxs existing engineering and operational capabilities financing and capital structure drax has entered into a fully underwritten 725 million secured acquisition bridge facility to finance the acquisition with a term of 12 months from the first date of utilisation of the facility with a sevenmonth extension option and interest payable at a rate of libor plus the applicable margin the acquisition facility agreement the facility is

acquisition the following is a summary of the principal terms of the acquisition agreement acquisition agreement parties and consideration the acquisition agreement was entered into on 16 october 2018 between drax smart generation and the seller pursuant to the acquisition agreement the seller has agreed to sell and drax smart generation has agreed to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of spgen for 702 million subject to certain customary adjustments in respect of cash debt and working capital drax group holdings limited has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of drax smart generation under the acquisition agreement scottish power uk plc has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of the seller under the acquisition agreement conditions to completion the acquisition is conditional on the approval of the acquisition by drax shareholders which is required as the acquisition constitutes a class 1 transaction under the listing rules the shareholder approval condition and the cma having indicated that it has no further questions at that stage in response to precompletion engagement by drax or the cma having provided a decision that the acquisition will not be subject to a reference under the uk merger control regime completion is currently expected to occur on 31 december 2018 assuming that the conditions are satisfied by that date termination for material reduction in available generation capacity drax smart generation has the right to terminate the acquisition agreement upon the occurrence of a material reduction in available generation capacity at any of the cruachan galloway and lanark or damhead creek facilities which subsists or is reasonably likely to subsist for a continuous period of three months the right of drax smart generation to terminate in these circumstances is subject to the sellers right to defer completion if the relevant material reduction in available generation capacity can be resolved by end of the month following the anticipated date of completion break fee a break fee of 146 million equal to 1 of draxs market capitalisation at close of business on the day before announcement is payable if the shareholder approval condition is not met save where this is as a result of a material reduction in available generation capacity as described above precompletion covenants the seller has given certain customary covenants in relation to the period between signing of the acquisition agreement and completion including to carry on the spgen business in the ordinary and usual course the seller will carry out certain reorganisation steps prior to completion pension liabilities drax smart generation has agreed to assume the accrued defined benefit pension liabilities associated with the employees of the spgen group as at the date of signing the acquisition agreement following completion the spgen group will continue to participate in the sellers group defined benefit pension scheme known as the scottishpower pension scheme spps for an interim period of 12 months unless agreed otherwise the interim period while a new pension scheme is set up by the spgen group for the benefit of its employees the new scheme at the end of the interim period the spps trustees will be requested to transfer from the spps to the new scheme an amount of liabilities and corresponding share of assets agreed between the seller and drax smart generation or failing agreement an amount determined by an independent actuary in respect of the past service liabilities relating to the spgen group employees if the amount of assets transferred to the new scheme does not match the amount agreed or independently determined there will be a trueup between the seller and drax smart generation if the spps trustees do not make any transfer to the new scheme within the period of 18 months following the interim period unless this was caused by a breach of the acquisition agreement by the seller drax smart generation has agreed to pay 16 million plus base rate interest to the seller as compensation for the spps liabilities not taken on by the new scheme sellers warranties indemnities and tax covenant the seller has provided customary warranties in the acquisition agreement the seller also has provided drax smart generation with indemnities in respect of certain specific matters including for any losses associated with the reorganisation referred to above a customary tax covenant is also provided in the acquisition agreement transitional services agreement the seller and spgen will enter into a transitional services agreement effective at completion the specific nature terms and charges relating to the services to be provided will be agreed between the seller and spgen prior to completion the seller will also provide assistance in relation to the extraction and separation of the spgen group from the systems of the seller and integration of the spgen group onto the systems of the drax group appendix 2 profit forecast profit forecast for the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 including bases and assumptions the portfolio is expected based on recent power and commodity prices to generate ebitda in a range of 90110 million profit forecast and gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs pumped storage and hydro activities represent a significant proportion of the earnings associated with the portfolio for the purpose of the profit forecast ebitda is stated before any allocation of group overheads as these will be an allocation of the existing drax group cost base which is not expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the portfolio basis of preparation the profit forecast has been compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and on the basis of the accounting policies of the drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to change the ebitda results of the portfolio it also does not reflect the impact of ifrs16 which would apply in respect of the 2019 annual report and accounts the profit forecast has been prepared with reference to unaudited 2017 financial statements based on the audited financial statements of scottish power generation limited and smw limited adjusted to exclude results of assets that do not form part of the portfolio and restated in accordance with drax accounting policies the audited financial statements of the entities forming the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2017 the unaudited management accounts of the portfolio for the nine months ending 30 september 2018 and on the basis of the projected financial performance of the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 the profit forecast is a best estimate of the ebitda that the portfolio will generate for a future period of a year in respect of assets and operations that are not yet under the control of drax accordingly the degree of uncertainty relating to the assumptions underpinning the profit forecast is inherently greater than would be the case for a profit forecast based on assets and operation under the control of drax andor which covered a shorter future period the profit forecast has been prepared as at today and will be updated in the shareholder circular the forecast cost base reflects the expectations of the drax directors of the operating regime of the portfolio under draxs ownership and the central support it will require principal assumptions the profit forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions assumptions within managements control there is no change in the composition of the portfolio there is no material change to the manner in which these assets are operated there are no material changes to the existing running costs  operating costs of the portfolio there will be no material restrictions on running each of the assets in the portfolio other than those that would be envisaged in the ordinary course no material issues with the migration of services including trading and information technology from scottish power to drax no hedges are transferred as part of the transaction transaction costs and oneoff costs associated with the integration are not included assumptions outside of managements control the acquisition of the portfolio is completed on 31 december 2018 there is no material change to existing prevailing uk macroeconomic and political conditions prior to 31 december 2019 there are no material changes in market conditions in electricity generating market and no change to the uk energy supply mix there are no material changes in legislation or regulatory requirements eg rocs capacity market grid charges impacting the operations or accounting policies of the portfolio there are no changes to recent market prices for clean spark spread power carbon and other commodities there is no material change from the historical 10year average rainfall there are no material adverse events that have a significant impact on the financial performance of any of the acquired assets including any more unplanned outages than would be expected in the ordinary course prior to completion the business will be operated in the ordinary course there are no material issues with the transitional services provided by scottish power to drax pursuant to the tsa including the migration of such services to drax there is no material change in the management or control of the drax group end tags daldowie

chief executive officer drax group 21 march 2018 annual report market background the uk is undergoing an energy revolution  a transition to a lowcarbon economy requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy through our flexible lower carbon electricity proposition and business to business b2b energy solutions the group is positioning itself for growth in this environment more details can be seen on page 4 of our annual report  our strategy our purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used through addressing uk energy needs and those of our customers our strategy is designed to deliver growing earnings and cash flow alongside significant cash returns for shareholders our ambition is to grow our ebitda to over 425 million by 2025 with over a third of those earnings coming from pellet production and b2b energy supply to create a broader more balanced earnings profile we intend to pay a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders progression towards these targets is underpinned by safety sustainability operational excellence and expertise in our markets summary of 2017 we made significant progress during 2017 but were below our expectations on the challenging scorecard targets we set ourselves in pellet production and biomass availability the latter reflecting the significant incident we experienced on our biomass rail unloading facilities at the end of 2017 which extended into january 2018 energy supply performed well with opus energy in line with plan and haven power exceeding its targets through a combination of this performance and the progress of our strategy we have delivered ebitda of 229 million significantly ahead of 2016 140 million and with each of our three businesses contributing positive ebitda for the first time the group scorecard is reported in full in the remuneration report  pp 81107 of our annual report  and the kpis are also shown below they reflect the diversity of our operations and our need to maintain clear focus on delivering operational excellence on a statutory basis we recorded a loss of 151 million which reflects unrealised losses on derivative contracts previously announced accounting policy on the accelerated depreciation on coalspecific assets as well as amortisation of newly acquired intangible assets in opus energy we also calculate underlying earnings a profit after tax of 27 million which excludes the effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and to assess the performance of the group without the income statement volatility introduced by noncash fair value adjustments on our portfolio of forward commodity and currency futures contracts during the year we refinanced our existing debt facilities reducing our debt cost we also confirmed a new dividend policy which will pay a sustainable and growing dividend 50 million in respect of 2017 consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth at year end our net debt was 91 million below our 2x net debt to ebitda target providing additional headroom there is more detail on our financial performance in the group financial review on page 46 of our annual report  in the us our pellet production operations recorded yearonyear growth in output of 35 with our first two plants now producing at full capacity during the second half of 2017 we also completed the installation of additional capacity enabling our morehouse and amite facilities to handle a greater amount of residue material supporting efforts to produce good quality pellets at the lowest cost as part of our target to expand our biomass selfsupply capability we completed the acquisition of lasalle bioenergy lasalle adding pellet production capacity lasalle commenced commissioning in november 2017 and due to its close proximity to our existing us facilities once complete will provide further opportunities for supply chain optimisation as in 2016 we benefited from the flexibility of selfsupply this often overlooked attribute of our supply chain enables us to manage biomass supply across the power generation business planned outage season and to benefit from attractively priced biomass cargoes in the shortterm spot market in power generation we experienced a significant incident on our biomass rail unloading facilities including a small fire on a section of conveyor we fully investigated the incident and following repairs over the christmas period have now recommissioned the facility with enhanced operating procedures this is a timely reminder of the combustible nature of biomass and the need for strong controls and processes to protect our people and assets our biomass units continued to produce high levels of renewable electricity from sustainable wood pellets for the uk market  drax produced 15 of the uks renewable electricity  enough to power sheffield leeds liverpool and manchester combined in doing so we are making a vital contribution to the uks ambitious targets for decarbonisation across electricity generation heating and transport  an 80 reduction by 2050 vs 1990 levels we benefited from the first year of operation of our third biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd scheme which provides an indexlinked price for the power produced until march 2027 the unit underwent a major planned outage between september and november with a full programme of works successfully completed the flexibility reliability and scale of our renewable generation alongside an attractive total system cost means we are strongly placed to play a longterm role in the uks energy mix to that end we continue to see longterm biomass generation as a key enabler allowing the uk government to meet its decarbonisation targets and the system operator to manage the grid the uk government recently confirmed support for further biomass generation at drax power station and we now plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  allowing us to provide even more renewable electricity whilst supporting system stability at minimum cost to the consumer our heritage is coal but our future is flexible lowercarbon electricity we are making progress with the development of four new standalone ocgt plants situated in eastern england and wales and our work to develop options for coaltogas repowering with battery technologies  if these options would be supported by 15year capacity market contracts providing a clear investment signal and extending visibility of contractbased earnings out to the late 2030s in b2b energy supply we completed the acquisition of opus energy a supplier of electricity and gas to corporates and small businesses the transaction completed in february 2017 and opus energy has continued to operate successfully within the group achieving its targets and making an immediate and significant contribution to profitability alongside this good performance we have also implemented the operational steps necessary to realise further operational benefits of the acquisition and we now source all of opus power and gas internally haven power delivered a strong performance with the sale of large volumes of electricity to industrial customers through our customer focus and efficiencies margins have improved and the business generated a positive ebitda for the first time together our b2b energy supply business now has over 375000 customer meters making it the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk we are delivering innovative lowcarbon power solutions with 46 of our energy sold from renewable sources as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power we see this as a significant opportunity for the group in the medium to long term in october 2017 we completed the sale of billington bioenergy bbe to aggregated micro power holding amph consideration for the transaction was 23 million comprised of 16 million of shares in amph and 07 million of cash the sale of bbe is aligned with our strategy to focus on b2b energy supply however through our shareholding in amph we will retain an interest in the uk heating market whilst gaining exposure to the development of smallscale distributed energy assets political regulatory and economic background we continue to operate in a changing environment the full impact of the uks decision to leave the eu is still unknown the immediate impact on the group was a weakening of sterling and an associated increase in the cost of biomass which is generally denominated in other currencies through our utilisation of mediumterm foreign exchange hedges the group protected the cash impact of this weakness in 2017 sterling has generally strengthened and we have been able to extend our hedged position out to 2022 at rates close to those that we saw before brexit in terms of uk energy policy the governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts svt are not a common feature of the b2b market at the microbusiness end of this market which is closer in size to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are active in renewing contracts the uk governments response to its consultation on the cessation of coal generation by 2025 has confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by october 2025 we believe our assets projects and ability to support our customers electricity management will support the governments ambition to maintain reliability when coal generation ceases running a resilient reliable grid is not simply about meeting the power demand on the system there are also system support services which are essential to its effective operation as the grid decentralises and becomes dependent on smaller distributed generation the number of plants able to provide these services is reducing biomass generation our proposed ocgts and our repowering project would allow us to meet these needs but this will not come for free a reliable flexible lowcarbon energy system will require the right longterm incentives in november 2017 the government confirmed that the uk will maintain a total carbon price the combined uk carbon price support  cps  and the european union emissions trading scheme  eu ets at around the current level cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing the level of carbon emissions in generation and we continue to support the pricing of carbon a view echoed in a report prepared for the uk government by the leading academic professor dieter helm against this backdrop we continue to make an important contribution to the uk economy according to a study published by oxford economics in 2016  draxs total economic impact  including our supply chain and the wages our employees and suppliers employees spend in the wider consumereconomy was 17 billion supporting 18500 jobs across the uk safety sustainability and people the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors is vital to the group with safety at the centre of our operational philosophy we also recognise the growing need to support the wellbeing of our employees and their mental health during the year we continued to use total recordable injury rate trir as our primary kpi in this area performance was positive at 027 but we expect this to improve in the coming year the incident at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did not lead to physical injuries but was nonetheless a significant event and caused disruption into 2018 we consequently launched an incident investigation to ensure our personal and process safety management procedures are robust to promote greater awareness around wellbeing we have embedded this in our new people strategy and expect to focus more energy and resources on this important area during 2018 strong corporate governance is at the heart of the group  acting responsibly doing the right thing and being transparent as the group grows the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and recognising the importance of strong corporate governance  we have published a comprehensive overview of our sustainability progress in 2017 on our website  this also highlights future priorities to broaden our approach to sustainability and improved reporting of environment  social and governance esg performance we have also completed the process which allows us to participate in the un global compact ungc  an international framework which will guide our approach in the areas of human rights labour environment and anticorruption during 2017 we published our first statement on the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in compliance with the uk modern slavery act we have added modern slavery awareness to our programme of regular training for contract managers and reviewed our counterparty due diligence processes we have continued to maintain our rigorous and robust approach to biomass sustainability  ensuring the wood pellets we use are sustainable lowcarbon and fully compliant with the uks mandatory sustainability standards for biomass the biomass we use to generate electricity provides a 64 carbon emissions saving against gas inclusive of supply chain emissions our biomass lifecycle carbon emissions are 36g co 2  mj less than half the uk governments 79g co 2  mj limit our people are a key asset of the business through 2017 we developed a new people strategy the strategy focuses on driving performance and developing talent to deliver the groups objectives we have established groupwide practices including a career development and behaviour framework focused on performance and personal development research and innovation a key part of our strategy is to identify opportunities to improve existing operations and create options for longterm growth to that end we have established a dedicated research and innovation ri team led by the drax engineers who delivered our worldfirst biomass generation and supply chain solution we are actively looking at ways to improve the efficiency of our operations notably in our biomass supply chain biomass is our largest single cost and as such we are focused on greater supply chain efficiency and the extraction of value from a wide range of lowvalue residue materials in b2b energy supply we are using our engineering expertise to help offer our customers valueadding services and products which will improve efficiency and allow them to optimise their energy consumption in the following sections we review the performance of our businesses during the year performance review pellet production our pellets provide a sustainable lowcarbon fuel source  one that can be safely and efficiently delivered through our global supply chain and used by draxs power generation business to make renewable electricity for the uk our manufacturing operations also promote forest health by incentivising local landowners to actively manage and reinvest in their forests  operational review safety remains our primary concern and we have delivered yearonyear reduction in the level of recordable incidents output at our amite and morehouse pellet plants increased significantly although was below our target for the year we have remained focused on opportunities to improve efficiencies and capture cost savings as part of our drive to produce good quality pellets at the lowest possible cost we still have more work to do in this area to optimise quality and cost as our performance was below target for the year as part of our plans to optimise and improve operations we added 150k tonnes capacity at our existing plants bringing total installed capacity to 11 million tonnes and increasing the amount of lower cost sawmill residues we are able to process and used in our pellets  case study lowcost highimpact capacity increase byproducts of higher value wood industries such as sawdust from sawmills offer a lowcost source of residues for use in our pellet production process and during 2017 we added an additional 150k tonnes of capacity at our pellet plants to allow us to use more of this material by investing in giant hydraulic platforms known as truck dumps operators at amite and morehouse can unload a 50foot truck carrying either sawdust or wood chips and weighing 60 tonnes in less than two minutes increasing processing capacity reducing the cost of processing and increasing the use of lower cost residues find out more wwwdraxcomtruckdumps and wwwdraxcomsustainabilitysourcing at our baton rouge port

increase selfsupply we acquired a 450k tonne wood pellet plant  lasalle bioenergy lasalle commissioning of the plant began in november 2017 and we expect to increase production through 2018 lasalle is within a 200mile radius of our existing facilities by leveraging the locational benefits of these assets we aim to deliver further operational and financial efficiencies case study locational benefits

2016 63 million negative ebitda driven by increasing volumes of wood pellets produced and sold to the power generation business sales of pellets in the year ending 31 december 2017 totalled 136 million an increase of 84 over 2016 gross margin increased reflecting higher production volumes raw fibre procurement transportation and processing comprised the majority of cost of sales and as such this remains an important area of focus and an opportunity for the business through incremental investment in plant enhancements we expect to see further benefits from efficiencies and greater utilisation of lower cost residues total operating costs have increased reflecting an increase in operations at amite morehouse and the port of baton rouge alongside the addition of lasalle we

capacity as part of our selfsupply strategy performance review power generation drax power station remains the largest power station in the uk almost twice the size of the next largest during the year the station met 6 of the uks electricity needs whilst providing 15 of its renewable electricity alongside important system support services  with an increase in intermittent renewables and a reduction in the responsive thermal generation historically provided by coal  the system of the future will require capacity which is reliable flexible and able to respond quickly to changes in system demand

strategy in progress gas power station development we are developing options for four new ocgt gas power stations two of which already have planning permission and could be on the system in the early 2020s subject to being awarded a capacity agreement a hightech new control room at drax power station will allow engineers to have real time remote control of our ocgt assets via a fibreoptic cable network able to fire up from cold and produce power in minutes rather than hours  our ocgts will help maintain system security as intermittent renewable sources of power increase and older thermal

its clean growth plan  setting out its plans for delivery of its legally binding target to reduce 2050 carbon emissions by 80 versus 1990 levels across electricity generation heating and transport this reinforces the drax proposition  flexible reliable lowcarbon electricity in november the government updated its intentions regarding the future trajectory of uk carbon price support cps indicating that the total cost of carbon tax in the uk the total of cps and the eu emissions trading scheme would continue at around the current level  the tax is currently set at 18tonne  whilst coal remains on the system we believe that cps has been the single most effective instrument in reducing carbon emissions from generation and that having an appropriate price for carbon emissions is the right way to provide a market signal to further reduce emissions in support of the uks longterm decarbonisation targets the uk government has now confirmed an end to noncompliant coal generation by 2025 we support this move subject to an appropriate alternative technology being in place with this in mind we have continued to develop options for our remaining coal assets to convert to biomass or gas to provide the reliable flexible capacity which we believe will be required to manage the increasingly volatile energy system of the future most recently with confirmation of government support for further biomass generation at drax power station we plan to continue our work to develop a lowcost solution for a fourth biomass unit  accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply generation capacity and system support 2017 saw the first full year of operation of our biomass unit under the contract for difference cfd mechanism which provides indexlinked revenues for renewable electricity out to 2027 our other biomass units are supported by the renewable obligation certificate roc mechanism which similar to the cfd is also indexlinked to 2027 this acts as a premium above the price of power we sell from these units we sell power forward to the extent there is liquidity in the power markets which combined with our fuel hedging strategy provides longterm earnings and revenue visibility lower gas prices higher carbon costs and the continued penetration of intermittent renewables have kept wholesale electricity prices subdued with increasing levels of intermittent renewables we are continuing to see opportunities to extract value from flexibility  shortterm power and balancing market activity the provision of ancillary services and the value achieved from outofspecification fuels  to capture value in this market we continue to focus resource on optimising availability and flexibility of both coal and biomass units this whole process requires a high level of teamwork between the operational and commercial teams across the group to capture and protect value over the period 2017 to 2022 we expect to earn 90 million from a series of oneyear capacity market contracts for our coal units demonstrating that they still have a role to play the first of these contracts commenced in october 2017 adding 3 million to ebitda lastly we continue to source attractively priced fuel cargoes  outofspecification coals and distressed cargoes which help keep costs down for the business and consumers we do this for both coal and biomass this is a good example of how our commercial and operational teams work together to identify opportunities to create value for the business as these fuels typically require more complex handling processes you can follow the market and see prices at electricinsightscouk strategy in progress repowering away from coal options for drax power station to operate into the late

safety performance we completed a major planned outage on the unit supported by the cfd contract this unit provides stable and reliable baseload renewable electricity to the network and longterm earnings visibility for the group the safe and efficient completion of these complex works is a credit to those involved and reflects our continued focus on opportunities for improvement and efficiencies the entire organisation has responded to a number of challenging unplanned events most notably in december we experienced a fire on a section of conveyor at our biomass rail unloading facility and consequently an unplanned outage from late december 2017 to midjanuary 2018 following investigation and recommissioning the facility has returned to service with enhanced operating procedures although this issue did not relate to the operation of the biomassgenerating units the resulting restriction on fuel deliveries by rail required the optimisation of generation across our biomass units resulting in lower ebitda and full year biomass availability than our target for the year financial results financial performance has significantly improved with ebitda of 238 million 2016 174 million principally due to the cfd mechanism value from flexibility was below our target for the year principally reflecting a lower level of ancillary service payments versus 2016 our operational performance drives the results the financial impact of the unplanned outage on the rail unloading facility was mitigated by optimisation of our available biomass and the use of additional generation capacity retained for selfinsurance purposes however this incident is a reminder of the need to invest appropriately to maintain a high level of operational availability and flexibility at

performance review b2b energy supply our b2b energy supply business  comprised of opus energy and haven power  is the fifth largest b2b power supplier in the uk as the power system transforms we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to a world of more decentralised and decarbonised power the key factors influencing our business are regulation competition and our operational performance regulation and competition the uk governments main focus has been on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic consumers on legacy standard variable tariff svt contracts the government will take forward legislation which will provide the regulator ofgem with the authority to cap these domestic tariffs svts are not a feature of our business our focus remains on the b2b market at the microbusiness end of the market which is closer in proximity to domestic most of our customers are on fixed price products and are actively rather than passively renewing their power supply contracts the b2b market remains competitive with 65 different suppliers across the market our haven power and opus energy businesses offer customercentric power gas and services we offer simplicity and flexibility across our products and actively engage with customers to help them manage their energy requirements and reduce carbon emissions strategy in progress an innovative energy supplier 90 of the electricity that opus energy supplied last year came from clean renewable sources at no extra cost to their predominantly small and mediumsized business customers for those customers who want it 100 renewable energy contracts are also available  this was exactly what all saints church in ascot was looking for to power their business assistant church warden chris gunton commented we wanted to move to a greener energy supplier without paying a premium so approached an energy broker for guidance they advised us that opus energy were a reliable company with a good reputation and when we asked for a quote they were the most competitive it was a similar story for the salisbury museum in wiltshire nicola kilgourcroft finance manager said we were looking for an energy supplier that offered great value combined with the right length of contract and good ethics opus energy ticked all these boxes for us alongside supplying customers opus energy has power purchase agreements with over 2300 independent uk renewable energy generators these could be anything from a single wind turbine owned by a village community  to europes greenest zoo hamerton zoo park commented andrew swales director of hamerton zoo working with opus energy has given us competitive prices considerably better documentation and a highly efficient service wed happily recommend them operational review we have remained focused on delivering an excellent standard of customer service which is central to our proposition february 2017 saw the completion of the acquisition of opus energy which has made good progress integrating into the group supported by a dedicated team who have been working on systems people and commercial projects to ensure our processes work effectively together in march we completed the purchase of a new office facility in northampton  enabling the consolidation of four opus energy offices into one and the centralisation of the operational teams sales volumes at opus energy were lower than target reflecting our focus on margin which has remained strong and customer renewal rates were towards the high end of expectation this reflects the continued commitment to a strong level of customer service and in recognition of this opus energy was awarded utility provider to small businesses of the year 2017 at the british business awards  at haven power we have continued to focus on valueadding flexible products and services particularly to industrial  commercial customers whose needs extend beyond commodity supply this is demonstrated through our ability to help customers manage and optimise their power consumption profiles through collaboration with our carefully selected partners through better systems and services customer targeting and a keener focus on cost to serve we are driving efficiencies and improved margin at haven power following the acquisition of opus energy the major enterprise resource platform erp system upgrade was replanned which has led to a revised timeline from q2 2018 onwards we continue to actively manage credit risk by assessing the financial strength of customers and applying rigorous credit management processes with a strong focus continuing to be placed on billing and cash collection health and safety remains an area of focus for the business and we continue to target a reduction in the level of recordable incidents financial results financial performance has significantly improved with ebitda of 29 million in line with our guidance 2016 4 million negative this was principally due to the acquisition of opus energy which added 10 months of ebitda but also improved financial performance from haven power which was ahead of plan third party costs tpcs include grid charges the cost of meeting our obligations under the

generation  will gardiner  opus energy electricity has been causing clocks in europe to run slowly this is why 16 march 2018 electrification on the continent  in the cultured sunblushed terraces of the mediterranean time moves slowly or at least thats the view from the grey british isles it turns out however its true or at least for the first weeks of 2018 it was true  at first it was small  perhaps too small to notice but by early march electrical clocks in europe were running nearly six minutes slow what caused this mass scale time loss electricity but to understand how electricity was causing clocks to lose time you first need to understand how it helps them keep time how does electricity keep time almost all clocks save for the earliest sundials and hourglasses measure time using a simple dynamic oscillation  the repetitive and rhythmic movement of something between two points for example in a pendulum clock each swing or oscillation of a suspended weight between two points shifts a single tooth of a gear which in turn shifts other gears and eventually the hands of a clock face because that movement is consistent and regular it can be used as a measurement of time clock technology has advanced beyond the abilities of a pendulum but it remains driven by this principle of measuring oscillation a quartz clock measures the vibration or oscillation of a piece of quartz an atomic clock measures the vibration of atoms and electrons and an electrical clock measures the oscillation of electricity  otherwise known as its frequency the fundamentals of electrical frequency in the uk and across europe all electricity operates at a frequency of 50 hertz hz which is determined by the number of directional changes alternating current ac electricity makes every second a synchronous electrical clock  the kind found in ovens microwaves and digital alarm clocks  uses this consistent oscillation to measure seconds and tell time electrical clocks have been designed this way because electricitys frequency is consistent  it needs to be any slight deviations above or below 50 hz can damage electrical devices and equipment in great britain national grid and service operators around the country  including drax power station  work to maintain this consistent frequency through a service called frequency response  which instructs generators to either increase or decrease generation depending on overall network demand which in turn controls frequency this is because frequency is regulated by keeping generation and demand across a network perfectly balanced too much generation drives frequency higher not enough causes it to fall its this that caused europes electrical clocks to run slowly but to understand the source of the frequency imbalance you first need to understand how europes grid works how six minutes dropped off the map the continental europe power system connects 25 countries from spain to turkey in one synchronous electrical network which runs on the same frequency and can all share power within this there are smaller transmission system operators tsos that balance the power supply of smaller groups of countries like national grid does for gbs network one of these zones includes serbia macedonia and montenegro a region with wellknown longstanding political tensions kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 however serbia refuses to recognise its sovereignty  a feeling which extends to some parts of kosovos population night view of pristina capital city of kosovo in the northern parts of kosovo along the serbian border the population is largely of serbian origin and side with serbia on the question of kosovos independence they also refuse to pay for its power this leaves the rest of the country  who are largely of albanian descent  to pay the cost of the countrys overall electricity which they do via subsidies added to their bills but when kosovos energy regulator removed the subsidy earlier this year it led to a sudden hole in the money paying generators which in turn led to a fall in how much electricity was being generated crucially however demand didnt fall with it instead kosovo was using more power than it was generating causing electrical frequency on the network to drop and because kosovo is part of a shared and synchronous network that stretches across the continent that frequency imbalance although incredibly small spread across the network overall frequency dropped 001 drop over the continental european grid  too small to trigger a full system shut down but big enough to mean that every second electrical clocks were counting was slightly slower than it should be big enough to mean that over time europe lost six minutes as of 8 march an agreement has been met between the countries to meet demand and so although the power that wasnt being generated hasnt been replaced there is no longer an ongoing imbalance frequency has normalised and clocks  now reset  are running on time tags electricity generation how electricity is made 25 january 2018 power generation every morning we take electricity as a given we switch on lights charge phones and boil kettles without thinking about where this power comes from the electronic devices and appliances that make up our daily routines are not particularly energy intensive boiling a kettle only uses 93 watts toasting for three minutes only requires 60 watts while cooking in a microwave for five minutes takes 100 watts however when people are waking up and making breakfast in almost 30 million households around the uk those small amounts soon create a significant demand for electricity on a typical winters morning  this combined demand spikes to more than 45 gigawatts gw  so this is what it takes to power your breakfast  from the everyday toaster in your kitchen backwards through thousands of miles of cables to the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of machinery in wind farms hydroelectric dams and at power stations such as drax where electricity generation begins the grid the journey starts in the home where all our electricity usage is tracked by meters these are becoming increasingly smart  displaying near realtime information on energy consumption in financial terms and allowing more accurate billing there are already 77 million smart meters installed around the uk but that number is set to triple this year  paving the way for a smarter grid overall what brings electricity into homes is perhaps the most visible part of the energy system on the uks landscape the transmission system is made up of almost 4500 miles of overhead electricity lines nearly 90000 pylons and 342 substations all bringing electricity from power stations into our homes  making sure all this happens safely and as efficiently as possible falls to the uks nine regional electricity networks and national grid regional networks ensure all the equipment is in place and properly maintained to bring electricity safely across the country while national grid is tasked with making sure demand for electricity is met and that the entire grid remains balanced  the station cools down one of the most distinctive symbols of power generation cooling towers carry out an important task on a massive scale water plays a crucial role in electricity generation but before it can be safely returned to the environment it must be cooled water enters cooling towers at around 40 degrees celsius and is cooled by air naturally pulled into the structure by its unique shape this means those plumes exiting from the top of the towers are rather than any form of pollution only water vapour and this accounts for just 2 of the water pumped into the towers drax counts 12 cooling towers each 114 metres tall  enough to hold the statue of liberty with room to spare once the water is cooled it is safe to reenter the nearby river ouse the stations birdseye view the control room is the nerve centre of drax power station from here technicians have a view into every stage of the power generation process the entire system controls roughly 100000 signals from across the power stations six generating units  water cooling air compressors and more while once this area was made up of analogue dials and controls it has recently been updated and modernised to include digital interfaces display screens and workstations specially designed by drax to enable operators to monitor and adjust activity around the plant the heart of power generation at the epicentre of electricity generation is draxs six turbines  these heavyduty pieces of equipment do the major work involved in generating electricity highpressure steam drive the blades which rotates the turbine at 3000 revolutions per minute rpm this in turn spins the generator where energy is converted into the electricity that will eventually make it into our homes these are rugged pieces of kit operating in extreme conditions of 165 bar of pressure and temperatures of 565 degrees celsius each of the six turbine shaft lines weighs 300 tonnes and is capable of exporting over 600 megawatts mw into the grid one of the most important parts of the entire process turbines are carefully maintained to ensure maximum efficiency even a slight percentage increase in performance can translate into millions of pounds in savings  turning fuel to fire to create the steam needed to spin turbines at 3000 rpm drax needs to heat up vast amounts of water quickly and this takes a lot of heat the power stations furnaces swirl with clouds of the burning fuel to heat the boiler biomass is injected into the furnace in the form of a finely ground powder this gives the solid fuel the properties of a gas enabling it to ignite quickly additional air is pumped into the boiler to drive further combustion and optimise the fuels performance pulveriser how do you turn hundreds of tonnes of biomass pellets into a powder every day thats the task the pulveriser take on in each of the power plants 60 mills 10 steel and nickel balls each weighing 12 tonnes  operate in extreme conditions to crush crunch and pulverise fuel these metal balls rotate 37 times a minute at roughly 3 mph exerting 80 tonnes of pressure crushing all fuel in their path air is then blasted in at 190 degrees celsius to dry the crushed fuel and blow it into the boiler at a rate of 40 tonnes per hour the journey begins biomass arrives biomass arrives at drax by the trainload roughly 14 arrive every day at the power station delivering up to 20000 tonnes ready to be used as fuel these trains arrive from ports in liverpool tyne immingham and hull and are specially designed to maximise the efficiency of the entire delivery process  allowing a full train to unload in 40 minutes without stopping the biomass is then taken to be stored inside draxs four huge storage domes  each capable of fitting the albert hall inside the domes can hold 300000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets between them here the biomass waits until its needed at which point it makes its way along a conveyor belt to the pulveriser and the process of generating the electricity that powers your breakfast

need to know about britains electricity last quarter 17 august 2017 power generation for an hour over lunch on wednesday 7 th june more than 50 of britains electricity came from renewables it was only the second time this had ever happened  the first had come just two months earlier in april the second quarter q2 of 2017 was a period largely made up of firsts for britains electricity system while there were only two instances of renewable power tipping the 50 mark between april and june overall wind solar biomass and hydro energy made up more than a quarter of all britains electricity for the first time ever these findings come from electric insights  research on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by top university academics over the past year the quarterly report has shown breaking renewable records is becoming the new normal for britains electricity last quarter was no different here we look at the key findings from q2 2017 and what they mean for the changing nature of the energy sector more than half great britains electricity came from renewables twice wind solar biomass and hydro accounted for 515 of the uks electricity for an hour on 7 th june  generating 191 gigawatts gw combined with nuclear power and imports from france lowcarbon output was a record 286 gw  a massive 89 of total demand this followed 30 th april when britains electricity edged over the 50 renewable mark for a shorter but no less significant period the percentage of renewables making up our power supply is set to grow as additional renewable capacity comes onto the grid there is currently 6 gw of additional wind capacity being constructed in britain solar capacity has already hit 124 gw  more solar panels than analysts thought would be installed by 2050 plans to convert more of britains coal units to biomass will increase the availability of renewable power further still electricity was cleaner than ever there was a key date in the history of coal during q2 on 21 st april britain recorded the first full day it had gone without burning any coal since 1882  the year holborn viaduct power station became the worlds first coalfired public electricity station while that date is symbolic of the uks shift away from coal in practice it means carbon emissions are also dropping to historically low levels carbon intensity reached a new low in q2 averaging 199 gkwh over the quarter  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year for context carbon intensity averaged 740 gkwh in the 1980s and 500 gkwh in the 2000s an important indicator of this falling carbon intensity is that britains electricity now regularly drops below 100 gkwh and reached an alltime low of 71 gkwh on the sunny and windy sunday of 11 th june electric cars are cleaner than before one of the greatest decarbonisation challenges moving forward is how we transform transport electrification is the primary driver of change in this sector and q2 saw britain hit a significant milestone as the total number of electric vehicles evs in the country surpassed 100000 the potential of evs in cleaning up transport is significant but there are also concerns they could in some cases increase co 2 levels due to pollution from power stations however as the last quarters data shows evs are in fact twice as carbon efficient as conventional cars thanks to the amount of renewable and low carbon electricity on the system according to our analysis looking at a few of the most popular models evs werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell from imperial college london but now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk they are delivering much better results the most solar power a quarter has ever seen the longer days in q2 enabled solar power to become a key source of electricity  and for eight hours over the quarter it generated more than all fossil fuels combined it also set output records by supplying 25 of total demand on 8 th april and producing 891 gw on 26 th may while wind remains the largest source of renewable energy generation in the uk solars influence is growing  especially as decentralisation of the power system continues to proliferate  of britains 124 gw solar capacity 57 is concentrated in 1400 solar farms of around 5 mw each while the rest is distributed across almost one million rooftop arrays in homes businesses and other institutions in fact during june 10 of all britains electricity came from these sorts of decentralised sources  sources of power not on the national grid this is unlikely to spell a fundamental shift to an entirely decentralised power grid in the short term but it does hint at the changes the sector is seeing from its carbon profile to its variety to its flexibility britains power system is changing  and thats a good thing explore the data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk commissioned by drax electric insights is produced
