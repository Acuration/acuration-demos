isnt like any other in the uk 25 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the sight was the same day after day trains pulling opentop wagons filled with coal would arrive at drax power station coal was the fuel on which the station ran but as that changes and the world moves from the dirtiest of fossil fuels to renewables and other lower carbon technologies so too do the makeup of draxs daily deliveries now more than half of draxs power is generated from compressed wood pellets instead of coal the trains still arrive daily but in addition to coal carriages more are pulling stateoftheart biomass wagons theyre not only the first of a kind theyre bigger than any others on uk railways moving a modern fuel coal and biomass are fundamentally different whereas coal is a durable fuel that can be left open to the elements without concern if compressed wood pellets are left in the rain they become unusable in short traditional hoppers the large opentop train wagons used to transport coal arent big enough nor do they provide enough protection for transporting biomass to deliver roughly 20000 tonnes of wood pellets to the power station every day it would need an entirely new railway wagon for this drax turned to lloyds register rail now ricardo rail  and wh davis  putting a lid on it one of the first things to solve was the open top the team designed a pneumatically operated roof for each wagon that could open and close on demand  providing easy access for loading but suitable protection for the pellets when in transit a similar system on each wagons base was introduced to make unloading just as simple a typical hopper design includes a wide roof that narrows into a shoot at its base for releasing fuel the drax wagons are different when they arrive at the power station automated flaps on their underside open in stages as they pass through the biomass unloading area this releases pellets into a sorter that delivers them into storage ready to be used for generation with this system in place each train can unload in under 40 minutes the big problem space a more significant hurdle to overcome was the question of space the obvious answer was to make the wagons bigger but uk railways have some of the most restrictive dimensions in the world thanks to its bridges and tunnels  some of which were constructed in victorian times so to get a similar efficiency out of the compressed wood pellet loads as previously obtained with coal the wagons needed to be bigger  not in physical size but in volume the team looked to the normally unused space at the ends of traditional wagons to house the braking and control equipment cubicle while the pipework was designed to run inside the wagons siding creating more inside storage space the result is a wagon with 116m 3 capacity almost a 30 increase in volume compared to the coal wagons they are not only the first ever bespoke biomass wagons theyre also the largest on uk railways bigger wagons better economy the impact of these wagons is felt beyond just the railway lines wh davis is the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer and relationships like this are not only good for drax but positively impact the wider uk economy a joint study by oxford economics for drax calculated that in the east midlands where wh davis is headquartered drax supports 1100 jobs through its supply chain and the resulting economic activity in total the report found drax had added 603 million to the local economy through indirect and induced means nationwide in 2015 that impact extended to a total of 124 billion in contribution to the uk gdp and more than 14000 jobs theres potential for this impact to be even greater roughly 14 trains arrive every day at the power station from ports in liverpool  tyne immingham and hull delivering up to 20000 tonnes every day to fuel the three of draxs six generating units that run on wood pellets but if all six are upgraded it will mean more biomass more deliveries and more trains the railways have always been a part of the power station and in the foreseeable future its likely they always will be tags engineering  railways and trains  supply chain  technology  visit us what does an instrument craftsperson do 10 november 2016 power generation how do you go about fixing a turbine that on a normal day spins 3000 times every minute the first port of call is to call in someone like alice gill an instrument craftsperson at drax power station what does an instrument craftperson do what i do is maintain and repair the equipment that links the outside power plant and the control room  equipment that tracks temperature levels or positioning that then informs our operators in the control room whats happening on the plant things like an oxygen analyser its a probe that sits in the boiler and monitors the oxygen level so the operator can ensure the correct ratio of fuel to air is going into the boiler to reach optimum combustion i might be called on to do calibration checks on that sensor to ensure that its working properly or i might be asked to completely remove it and then to repair it how did you come to be doing this job im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person my dad was always working and fixing things in the garage at home and i liked being in there with him when i was at school i decided i didnt want to go to university so started applying for apprenticeships and looking into engineering opportunities drax was one of those schemes and was the one i most wanted to be selected for  luckily enough i was offered a place the apprenticeship was four years and there are loads of training courses and so much to learn including hands on experience and working in the plant i remember first arriving to the power station and not really believing the scale of the place you think how am i ever going to find my way around but you soon get used to it and it becomes the norm in september i became a full instrument craftsperson so now i can really get stuck in im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person what sort of challenges do you face over the summer ive been doing a lot of work on the turbines its a big job as theyre one of the most important elements driving the plant and generating the power during outages the whole thing gets overhauled and given a full health check the turbine team needs to get into machinery which is densely constructed and put together so its my job to go in and carefully remove instrumentation so they can access it when theyre done i have to go back in refit everything and check its all working again how do you do that when youre removing the instruments its a bit more of a just get it off approach  you just make sure you get it off safely without damaging it then when were refitting it were out there with our multimeters making sure were setting different probes at the right voltages and that everything is calibrated correctly theres a screen in our workshop we use to watch the activity of the turbine so we can see the speed of the turbine creeping up as they switch it back on its always a big moment you know things are going to be alright because youve done everything but there are still some nervous people in the room the turbines are spinning at 3000rpm so you really need it all to be working properly is there anything that could wrong on an average day one of the biggest things that could go wrong in my area is the potential to trip an entire generating unit it might be that you overpressurise something or you accidentally trigger a switch that then sets off a daisy chain of events that ends up in a unit tripping tripping is where the unit turns off which basically leads to a total shutdown in electricity generation from one sixth of drax power station theres something called the 660 club  at full load the units are operating at 660 mw so if you trip one you enter into this infamous club there are a few guys in the 660 club but thankfully i havent joined when operating at full load of 660 mw our units supply the national grid with around 645 mw enough to power an entire city what do you do outside of work ive got a horse called red  ive had him for seven years but ive been riding since i was eight its quite different to working with things that do exactly what you tell them when you get on the horse he just does what he wants  hes got a mind of his own its a big change tags

and their colossal tapering silhouettes are the most iconic element of the architecture of energy drax has 12 of them but a structure of that size poses a considerable maintenance challenge for the first time since draxs six towers were constructed between 1967 and 1974  one of them was in need of repair what could possibly go wrong no matter how well you build something things can go wrong after more than five decades of continuous operation each tower is made from concrete that varies in thickness from seven inches in the middle to around 15 inches at the top and bottom over time even a structure this solid can begin to weaken cooling towers are reinforced with steel bars embedded within their concrete which can rust and expand causing the concrete around it to crack  a process called spalling water vapour which passes through the towers on an almost constant basis can also migrate into poorly compacted concrete inside the tower and cause further cracks before the drax team could set about repairing the towers they needed to know where these cracks were inspecting a structure that tall needed an innovative solution it needed drones surveying the damage drones were used to make a comprehensive photographic record of the towers that could be inspected for signs of damage the drones also helped produce a 3d model of the structure to visualise the towers defects it was the firstofakind for the company the drone survey found that on tower 3b there were a number of cracked concrete patches on the towers that needed repairing and maintenance was scheduled to coincide with draxs 2016 outages  periods during the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the power station undergo routine repair work the next challenge was how to carry out these repairs on a structure taller than the statue of liberty to inspect the cooling tower drax created a 3d model with the help of cyberhawk  engineering at an altitude drax tower 3b is nearly 115 metres tall enough to fit in the statue of liberty or st pauls cathedral with room to spare how do you go about repairing a structure like this the answer steeplejacks steeplejacks were called so because originally they were the people used for scaling the side of church steeples to make repairs but a cooling tower presents a distinctly different structure that cant necessarily be climbed up from the bottom to scale it and make the repairs a different approach was needed drax reached out to specialist steeplejack contractors zenith structural access  who build devices that allow the scaling of industrialscale structures zeniths solution was to fix a metal frame to the top of the tower which then lowers a walkway suspended by strong metal cables down its side from a perch suspended from the top of tower 3b workmen were deployed to make the repairs  more than 100 metres above ground suspended in their cradles the teams sealed the surface of each crack and then injected resin to fix the cracks in the concrete shell where the concrete had spalled new specialist repair mortars were applied regular repairs with the identified defects on the tower fully repaired attention can now move on to others on site routine inspections using drones and binoculars have been planned to take place every three years these will monitor the condition of all the towers and allow for future maintenance to be planned in advance two more towers are already scheduled for repair in 2017s outages once again itll be case for engineering work at elevation tags biomass energy  cooling tower  drax power station  engineering  technology  visit us summer in the station 6 october 2016 power generation bees buzz and heat haze fizzes on the tarmac its summer and since the days are warm and long demand for electricity sinks as lights are left off and life is lived outdoors electricity demand is lower so the assumption would be that activity at the uks power stations is minimal the reality however is far different instead the fall in demand is an opportunity to perform crucial maintenance work  to upgrade and extend the life of power stations across the world in many ways summer in the station is the busiest time of the year slowing the beating heart of the country to get up close and personal with the equipment and carry out major repairs large sections of the power station need to come offline  this is a procedure called an outage at drax power station there are six units which together supply around 78 of the uks supply taking one offline is a big project but a necessary one many years ago we use to do a mixture of major and minor outages but we have reconfigured the outage cycle so all we do now are major outages now we run a schedule where each unit has an outage every four years says andrew squires outage manager at drax this year each of our six units have come offline  five outages have already been completed and one is set to be back in service at the beginning of november with two of these being major outages and the other four taken off the system for essential high pressure hp turbine module repair works to ensure this all operates smoothly planning starts early the process starts a minimum of a year in advance during which time scoping planning parts and materials are ordered for the outage its a necessary advance given the challenging timescales projects and numbers of people that are needed to carry out the work required calling in the helping hands drax drafts in engineering contractors in large numbers to carry out the huge scale of work required to shut down and maintain units at the power station 2016 was a particularly busy year  at peak points 3500 people were on site carrying out the work its a number weve never seen previously squires says main projects delivered during the outage timescale in 2016 include changing the generator stator core generator transformer oil burner system and hp turbine module the main steam pipework replacement being the largest of all this pipework runs from the boiler to the turbine and is the first time this had been done in the lifetime of the plant now complete this is set to last the life of the station industry pioneers drax uses compressed wood pellets in three of its six units and this pioneering step brings implications for how theyre maintained in the industry its a whole new challenge for which drax engineers are still writing the rulebook were understanding the engineering implications of using biomass in our boilers and developing strategies for maintenance says squires as europes largest decarbonisation project maintaining and consistently learning comes with the territory its just another challenge for the team to tackle during summer in the station and beyond tags careers  engineering  power station  technology  visit us inside the dome sustainable bioenergy there are four storage domes at drax power station and each of them can hold 80000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets its these biomass pellets a sustainable fuel that drax is being upgraded to run on and produce renewable electricity wood pellets are an incredible fuel that can match coal for efficiency  the challenge is you just need more of them as the density and calorific value of coal is greater however storing such large quantities in a confined space presents risks that have to be managed 247 atmospheric control the crucial difficulty with storing the pellets is their chemical volatility wood which the pellets are made from emit carbon monoxide co in a confined space such as the storage dome this co can build up and  due to cos extreme flammability  require the entire internal atmosphere to be regulated by a set of highly sophisticated engineering solutions as long as materials are emitting more heat into the atmosphere than they are storing in themselves there is no risk of combustion a single wood pellet in a fuel store poses no fire risk nor does a small pile but when thousands upon thousands are piled together the pressure builds up and causes the pellets to heat up gradually the rate of temperature increase speeds up and before you know the flashpoint threshold has been crossed and theres potential for danger however remove or limit the oxygen supply in the silo and purge the co thats emitted from the pellets and the risk of a thermal event is substantially reduced the challenge for the engineers at drax constructing the domes was finding a way to manage temperatures within the dome neutral nitrogen to do this they created a system to automatically inject nitrogen into the storage dome while nitrogen isnt a truly inert gas it is much less reactive than co and oxygen with this pumped into the domes atmosphere it is a much safer environment to get a steady supply of nitrogen regular air from our atmosphere  which is 78 nitrogen  is passed through a molecular filter which removes the larger oxygen molecules the gas collected at the other end is 96 nitrogen this nitrogenrich air is then injected from underneath the dome and continually distributed around it not only is this a fire prevention method but also a firefighting one that can be pumped in larger quantities in the event of combustion separate to the above measures which are there to manage fuel temperatures the dome is also fitted with a carbon dioxide co2 injection system and water deluge system which are there as fire extinguishing precautions the big ear inside the dome the next problem facing the designers was how to accurately monitor the quantity of compressed wood pellets inside the dome to achieve this each dome is fitted with a sonar system  which sounds a bit like a chirping bird  that provides continuous feedback on how full the dome is the sonar monitoring system provides level profile and volume information which is translated into a 3d image of the stored biomass this method of volumunetric measurement allows the operators to view and monitor in real time the effects of their actions when filling and unloading domes so they can target specific areas particularly when unloading and for fuel accounting purposes other tools and tricks five thermocouple arrays measure the pile temperature and provide feedback in real time to the operators to allow them to assess the status of the dome and effectively plan material filling and reclaim gas monitors measure the levels of co and co2 as well as o2 depletion within the head space of the dome a dome breather vent a two way acting valve which as its name suggests allows the dome to breathe is fitted to the top of the dome and acts as a vacuum breaker maintaining a relatively even pressure allowing air in during unloading and releasing head space gasses during nitrogen inserting the final piece of the atmospheric control puzzle is regulating pressure at the top of each dome is a controllable aperture called a slide gate which is closed unless the dome is being filled to allow material to enter a dome aspiration system is installed here to filter and remove displaced air from within the head space during filling but also allow a route for co and other offgassing products to escape all the hidden systems within these four huge white domes allow the operator to effectively control their atmospheric conditions and crucially to store massive amounts of potentially volatile biomass safely on site find out more about these giant storage domes  read the story about how they were constructed  tags biomass energy  engineering  technology  wood pellets the single biggest transformation of our century sustainable bioenergy at the turn of the millennium drax was facing a serious issue demand for electricity was high and increasing but so was the desire for sources of power that were less harmful to the environment than coal at that time draxs fuel to continue to meet demand in a cleaner and more sustainable way an alternative approach was needed drax had a legacy in this field  in 1988 it was the first coalfired power station to install fluegas desulphurisation technology which removes 90 of coals harmful sulphur dioxide so 2  emissions in the two decades that followed however the sustainability conversation moved beyond how to make coal cleaner instead the focus was finding a truly viable alternative fuel finding a new fuel in those early days the idea of converting a fully coalfired station to another fuel seemed outlandish to say the least we made a lot of peoples heads hurt with this project says drax strategic projects engineering manager jason shipstone no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going back then it was all about experimentation jim price alternative fuel manager at the time explains initially we found a few distressed cargos of wood pellets and sunflower husks that someone had ordered but didnt want we mixed that with coal at very low concentration price and his team found they could use the plantbased fuel alongside coal at low percentages without it detrimentally affecting the boilers it was a long way from being a new business model but it was a start they spent the next year working with willow wood a subsidized energy crop that proved difficult to turn into a fuel that could be used efficiently to power a boiler then in 2005 after building a prototype plant and finding a way to pulverise the willow into a fine powder  called wood flour  and combine it with coal dust the team hit its first key milestone it was able to power a drax boiler that was the eureka moment says price no one had the answers it was a bit like going for a walk but not knowing where youre going a change in attitude the response to the success was immediate senior management support for the project had been in place from the beginning but now there was a change across the whole company people started to think maybe it can be done says price work continued on the project and  after more experiments  drax eventually settled on compressed wood pellets this form of biomass ultimately required investment in four vast storage domes that between them store 80000 tonnes of pellets then there was the issue of supply and delivery materials were sourced from the us shipped to the uk then freighted to the plant in specially designed covered train wagons each carrying up to 7600 tonnes everything else had to carry on as normal this had to be seamless we had to work the same as drax has always worked  reliable and available says shipstone jason shipstone drax strategic projects manager played an instrumental role in upgrading drax the final hurdle in 2009 the team overcame one of the final challenges and successfully adapted the boilers to combust the new fuel proving that cofiring the process of using two fuels powering one boiler  in this case wood pellets and coal could work it was enough to show there was a future in wood pellets and it could work at scale although nothing was fully built yet but dorothy thompson ceo of drax was convinced shipstone remembers the conversation after thompson signed the contract to begin the transition in earnest so we can do 10 what does it take to get to 50 she asked recalls shipstone his response no problem it was the right answer he says toward a coalfree future fast forward to 2016 and drax is europes largest decarbonisation project  reducing emissions by at least 80 of the 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide that the three now converted former coal generation units would have released per year although only half of draxs six units have been upgraded from coal to use compressed wood pellets  65 of the electricity generated at the power station is the result of a renewable rather than a fossil fuel its three biomass units produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of four million homes  or more than half of all residential properties in northern england given the challenges the world faces regarding the future of energy production decisive action is required if were to meet carbon reduction targets in the uk the government has voiced ambitions of phasing out coal by 2025 drax has aims of doing it quicker thompson has spoken of plans that see all coal units taken off the drax system by 2020 if not before the story of energy since the dawn of the industrial revolution has been one of fossil fuels this simply has to change by finding a way to ease the transition away from coal drax is helping to write the next chapter tags engineering  history  power station  technology  wood pellets the biggest balls of electricity generation power generation when making a cup of tea its unlikely you consider the industrial equipment kicked into action the moment you switch on your kettle and of all of the activity going on behind the scenes its even more unlikely you think about a 12tonne steel ball but without a number of 12tonne balls and the electricity they help generate your kettle would be nothing more than a fancy jug how do giant balls help to generate power the answer lies in the way fuels like coal and compressed wood pellets are used to power boilers and generate electricity drax started its life as a coal power station but today it is in the process of upgrading to run on biomass progress has already been made  three of the stations six units already run on compressed wood pellets draxs biomass fuel generating around 20 of the uks renewable electricity to generate enough power to supply 8 of the uks demand  as drax does  a lot of fuel is needed hundreds of thousands of wood pellets are delivered to drax every day arriving on custombuilt trains travelling from the ports of tyne hull immingham and liverpool the pellets pass through a system of conveyor belts until they arrive at one of four massive conical storage domes  located on site in yorkshire before the wood pellets can be converted into fuel they need to be crushed this is where the balls come into play the pulveriser the wood pellets used at drax are compressed and dried wood that is formed into small capsules the size of a childs crayon  but like with coal to get the best results in the power stations huge boilers the material needs to be turned into a very fine powder in pulverising mills when very fine the fuel burns as efficiently and as quickly as a gas inside each mill are 10 giant steel balls that grind down either the wood pellets or coal each ball is three quarters of a metre in size made of hollow cast steel alloy and weighs roughly 12 tonnes  equivalent in weight to britishmade jaguar xe midsized saloon car or an entire football team and to make sure that each one is up to the task of extreme pulverisation they need to be hard each one is heat treated during manufacture to make sure theyre up robust enough to consistently crush raw fuel the benefit of this durability is that they can readily pulverise fuel to feed drax boilers
