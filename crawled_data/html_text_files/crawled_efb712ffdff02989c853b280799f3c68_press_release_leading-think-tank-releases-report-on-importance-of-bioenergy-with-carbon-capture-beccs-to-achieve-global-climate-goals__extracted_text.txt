climate goals a new report by the energy futures initiative provides a policy roadmap for beccs deployment 5 july 2023 the energy futures initiative efi has released a new report focused on actionable pathways for deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at scale the report  taking root a policy blueprint for responsible beccs development in the united states affirms how beccs can advance decarbonization needs by providing the permanent removal of greenhouses gases from the atmosphere while also accelerating the decarbonization of the electric grid with firm and dispatchable climatefriendly power the report was released at an event tuesday afternoon in washington dc cohosted by the efi foundation and resources for the future  the event included remarks from sen martin heinrich dnm sen bill cassidy rla and former us secretary of energy ernest moniz president and ceo of the efi foundation leading projections for keeping global temperature rise to below two degrees rely in significant beccs deployment said moniz efi has examined the opportunities and challenges for meeting this goal and recommends steps to get there efis roadmap outlines the clear need for establishing a holistic policy framework to guide beccs development highlighting the technologys unique potential to offer netnegative emissions at a large scale while also providing a steady economically feasible energy supply notably the authors state that the emerging sector has the potential to make a significant difference if provided with improved financing i am particularly interested in the opportunities that beccs might provide for our forest managers and our communities said sen heinrich it could help make profitable the removal of small diameter woody fuels that are often destined to act as ladder fuels for wildfires as it relates to wildfire mitigation opportunities the efi report notes that integrated wildfire management and beccs feedstock collection not only will close the carbon cycle it also will reduce other atmospheric pollution caused by the current practice of thinning and prescribed burning with regards to beccs the best is yet to come said sen cassidy in louisiana weve long turned wood into wood pellets for use in bioenergy plants and now we have multiple companies exploring the development of new beccs plants in the region  creating more jobs and providing an avenue for louisiana to remain a global leader in energy production eight major elements of the report are organized into three broad themes 1 policies to expand and accelerate beccs deployment 2 leveraging the social economic and environmental cobenefits of beccs and 3 rules of the road to promote responsible development of beccs the biden administrations commitment to reducing economywide ghg emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030along with the longerterm goal of netzero ghg emissions by 2050 highlights the importance of rapid deployment of cdr technologies in the united states we are very pleased to see the efi report is emphatic in its embrace of beccs as a key climate solution said will gardiner ceo of drax to achieve net zero governments must support carbon dioxide removal solutions including beccs if properly supported the us offers a promising environment to deploy beccs with the potential to remove up to 22 gigatons of co2 per year said gardiner over the past two years drax has been progressing a global beccs program  with a primary focus in north america two initial sites in the us south have been selected with nine more sites under evaluation creating a pipeline of development opportunities by 2030 gardiner explained if the policy recommendations in the report were implemented this would enable drax to invest billions of dollars in deploying beccs earlier and in turn unlock climate economic and environmental benefits for our communities the efi report which was sponsored by the hewlett foundation battelle drax and enviva can

2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit httpwwwdraxcomus power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonization project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilization and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver four million tons of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 18 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around five million tons a year drax is targeting eight million tons of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over three million tons of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers in europe and
