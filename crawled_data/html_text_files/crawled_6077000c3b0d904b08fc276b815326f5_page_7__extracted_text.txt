cutting supply chain emissions 15 november 2022 press releases drax the uks biggest generator of renewable electricity is expanding its rail fleet by investing in 30 new rail wagons to deliver the biomass it needs to generate enough renewable power for four million uk homes at its north yorkshire power station the upgraded highcapacity wagons manufactured by british firm wh davis will help to further reduce draxs carbon emissions and make its biomass supply chain more resilient and efficient draxs fleet of 225 rail wagons  the first of their kind in the world were designed and developed by lloyds register rail now ricardo rail and wh davis based in mansfield  the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer the innovative design of these new wagons has increased the amount of biomass able to be transported in each wagon by 30 per cent allowing them to carry 716 tonnes of biomass each reducing the number of rail journeys required and reducing supply chain emissions the first of 30 new wagons are expected to come off the production line early next year and go into operation delivering biomass from the port of tyne to drax reducing emissions on this route by over 25 bruce heppenstall drax plant director said our biomass trains deliver up to 30000 tonnes of biomass to the power station each day enabling drax to power millions of homes and businesses across the uk with reliable renewable electricity and support energy security its therefore vital that we have a robust supply chain and investing in these new wagons will further increase our resilience and cut carbon emissions on our tyne to drax rail route by more than a quarter whilst continuing to support thousands of jobs across the north including at wh davis and davis wagon services facilities since it converted two thirds of its power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal drax has transformed its business to become europes biggest decarbonisation project and the uks largest single site renewable power generator playing a critical role in energy security this transformation has also preserved and supported jobs  with draxs operations supporting almost 6000 jobs across the north at a time when other power stations have closed each train is able to carry sufficient biomass for drax to generate enough reliable renewable electricity to supply around 800 uk homes for a year jonathan hamer managing director of wh davis said these additional 30 new biomass wagons reflect the strength and depth of the davis group including davis wagon services to provide a full turnkey solution for customers from manufacture to maintenance this contract builds on the previous supply to drax for its unique biomass wagon fleet requirements and shows their confidence in the quality and reliability of the wh davis product as the only rail freight manufacturer in the uk it is important for us to win such contracts to ensure the continuity of skills within our locally based work force draxs confidence in us allows this to continue and develop mark fletcher member of parliament for bolsover said this is a fantastic investment which will strengthen the uks energy security whilst supporting local skilled manufacturing jobs these new wagons will help keep the lights on for many years to come and they are a real example of how british companies can lead the world in innovation and engineering i am proud to have such a great company based in the bolsover constituency draxs biomass comes into the ports on the east and west coasts from north america and europe and is brought to the power station by rail because it is more efficient than road transportation drax is committed to boosting the regions economy by investing in skills innovation transport and culture a recent study

communications officer e  email protected t 07936 350 175 notes to editors by using biomass drax has delivered carbon savings of almost 100 per cent compared to when the power station only used coal to generate electricity more than 95 of the electricity drax group produced in 2021 was renewable from its biomass and hydro operations  enough to power five million households the majority of the biomass drax uses comes from north america and europe on ships to ports on the east and west coasts of the uk immingham hull port of tyne and liverpool it is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day over a sixday working week in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 11 per cent of the uks renewable electricity the fuel is transported to drax via rail rather than road to further reduce carbon emissions as it is more efficient than road transportation independent research by oxford economics using 2021 data showed that drax supported over 17800 jobs across the country  almost 6000 of which were across the north of england yorkshire and humber north west and north east in

wwwenergydraxcom tags galloway hydro scheme  hydroelectric power  renewable energy a statement from drax group ceo will gardiner on draxs biomass sourcing 6 october 2022 press releases as the worlds leading producer and supplier of sustainable biomass drax is committed to ensuring the biomass we source delivers positive outcomes for the climate for nature and for the communities in which we operate to be clear not all biomass is sustainable or renewable but when sourced in the right way it does lead to the positive outcomes we are committed to delivering and we have clear policies and processes in place to ensure this is the case as ceo i understand that achieving and sustaining these positive outcomes needs constant challenge  both internally and externally  particularly with those that dont share our vision of the critical role biomass has to play in decarbonising our economy that is why my team and i dedicate so much of our time to engaging with both advocates and critics of biomass and whilst these conversations frequently challenge us they can ultimately make us think differently and change the way we operate for the better biomass remains a relatively new part of the energy mix and it is increasingly important that accurate information is readily available for those wanting to learn more about what we do we take all claims relating to our business very seriously and investigate them but equally we feel it is important to identify those occasions where allegations levied against us are misleading or simply untrue this week we have seen inaccurate statements about drax that have focused primarily on the views of a vocal minority who oppose biomass many of these claims have sought to repeat the inaccurate views about biomass which have for years been promoted by those who are illinformed about the science behind sustainable forestry and climate change and those who have vested interests in seeing the biomass industry fail given the severity of the false claims made i wanted to directly address some of the issues 1 biomass protects and enhances the environment done right biomass plays a critical role in protecting and enhancing our environment not only does biomass displace fossil fuels directly in the production of electricity it also supports markets for wooden products used in construction that replace the use of other carbon intensive materials like cement the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc  the worlds leading sciencebased climate authority backed by thousands of scientists  restated in their latest report the critical role that biomass will play in meeting global climate targets when sourced sustainably the forests that we source our biomass from are managed in accordance with best practices designed to support the health and growth of these forests over the long term for example in canada forest management has helped stop the spread of disease and forest fires that have destroyed forest ecosystems and the biodiversity which exists there in the south of the us we take thinnings that help to open up the forest canopy and get light onto the forest floor which in turn supports habitats for insects wildflowers and species such as quail  which have been in decline 2 demand for pellets does not drive deforestation demand for pellets is not driving deforestation canada has a 0 deforestation rate in the us south forest inventory has more than doubled since the 1950s the demand for pellets is a tiny fraction of overall demand for wooden products less than 01 in the us in canada less than half a percent 036 is harvested each year with pellets being a fraction of that demand the sawdust bark wood chips and thinnings as well as diseased and damaged wood produced when the forests are harvested for other sectors makes up a small proportion of the total fibre harvested  just 5 in british columbia and 4 in the south of the us forest harvest statistics show wood pellet production woody biomass accounts for about 4 of material harvested in the us according to uns faostat forestry  in british columbia 74 million cubic meters m3 harvested through the bc annual allowable cut  converted to metric tonnes mt is about 45 million mt bc exported 237 million mt of wood pellets which is 53 of overall harvest 3 what are category two licences and why does drax hold them under the category two licence programme in british columbia canada drax is eligible to bid for tenure agreements on plots of land that are issued by the british columbia timber sales programme bcts which is an arm of government the category two licence program is based on a wellestablished and legislated process the bidding procedure is a sealed online process and if successful drax has a power of attorney poa in place where all harvesting obligations become the responsibility of the sawmilling company that holds the poa this practice is permitted under the terms of the bcts it is the sawmill company which controls the harvesting and sorting processes of the forest material and thereby ensures that it gets what it needs drax is not involved in the harvesting or sorting process we have arrangements with the sawmills we work with to supply us with sawmill residuals  sawdust chips and bark which is used to produce wood pellets in exchange for the rights to the timber on category two licences the economics of the wood pellet industry do not facilitate full scale harvesting for the manufacture of pellets draxs name stays on the licences paperwork because the company is the bid winner this does not mean drax undertakes any harvesting activity drax currently holds two category two licences in british columbia at this time we are not bidding for any more category two licences in british columbia the bbc claimed that one of the plots of land they featured would not have been harvested had drax not bid on it  because there were no other bidders in circumstances where no one bids on a plot of land the british columbia government often puts it up for auction again 4 the bbc was wrong to give a false impression that logs were being taken from the two featured category two licence areas and taken to our meadowbank pellet plant in british columbia drax did not receive any material from the two featured category two licence areas in the bbcs panorama programme the truck the bbc followed and showed taking logs to the meadowbank facility was we believe visiting a different area of forest to the locations of either of our category two licence areas in the programme the reporter says they followed the logging truck 60 miles 95km north on the highway before turning off on the logging road we dont know where they went but we know the licenses that are in our name are 350km away from our meadowbank facility the logs on that truck were whats categorised in the forestry industry in british columbia as leftover material that sawmills dont want one of the two category two licence sites the bbc focused on was felled and cleared by the sawmill company in december 2021 whilst this sawmill did provide us with residuals relating to our agreement with them it did not come from this site the forest companies control the sorting and harvesting process to ensure they get the materials they need drax is not involved in that process forest companies harvest the forests and cut the trees into log lengths and sort the portions by multiple product class usually this falls into two grades  sawlog grade logs for sawmills and pulp logs for pulp mills sawlogs go to the sawmills and the rest go to where there is a market for them  if there isnt a market it becomes leftover and we may take it 5 why did the programme show slash being left on the forest floor after harvesting slash is a term used for the very lowgrade material which is not merchantable under the british columbia government harvesting rules slash can be left on sites for up to two years to dry out before being taken to a pellet mill or burned on site the company we gave the poa to for the harvest of this site will ensure the slash is managed appropriately in line with the british columbia governments regulations 6 draxs category two licences are not areas of primary forest primary forest is a term which organisations interpret differently drax and many other organisations refer to the un food and agriculture organization definition for primary forest which indicates that primary forests have no clearly visible indications of human activities drax has not acquired any canadian licences for forests designated as primary forests under the un food and agriculture organization definition  the bbcs footage clearly showed that one of the category two licence sites had a nearby road and in the british columbian government harvest plan for one of these sites there is a specific requirement for the 700 road to be screened in our opinion this is evidence that this area was not primary forest and we did not take any material directly from this site areas identified by the government for harvest are carefully selected by them using an exhaustive list of environmental criteria that includes but is not limited to old growth management landscape and site level biodiversity age class distribution old growth riparian management watershed management wildlife management visual quality species at risk rare and sensitive ecosystems cultural heritage resources soil quality species diversity site productivity as well as social and economic considerations 7 does drax use logs which should instead be sent to sawmills to make wood products no to date in 2022 the material used in our canadian pellet plants includes 81 sawmill residuals 8 harvest residuals and 10 roundwood including pulp logs grade 4 all materials are sorted and graded by the sawmilllumber operator before delivery to drax the grade 4 logs that we use are not higher quality logs these can be pulp grade logs but if there is no market for pulp logs then when the sawmills harvest and sort the logs they become leftover from sawmill material and are often then used by drax to make pellets commercial forestry is driven by a demand for high grade saw logs which are processed in sawmills with the resultant timber then used in construction and manufacturing the material that is not used for these purposes  because it is often diseased misshapen or uneconomic  could be used for producing biomass in line with our sourcing policy 8 rigorous independent oversight plays an important part in the governance of the biomass industry drax adheres to all required legislation regulations and standards which govern the energy sector draxs businesses and its supply chains it ensures the ongoing sustainability of its feedstock in accordance with the required legislation the carbon accounting rules that underpin these regulations and standards have been developed in accordance with world leading international science from the un ipcc 2019 refinement to the 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories and are derived from international frameworks such as the eus renewable energy directive red companies which use biomass are required to measure and report on supply chain emissions these requirements are unique in that they are stricter and more onerous than what is required for other energy generation technologies as a result drax reports on its full supply chain and associated emissions to ofgem under legislative requirements including the renewables obligation and cfd drax also provides extensive information to voluntary certification schemes such as the sustainable biomass program sbp fsc and sfi which provide third party oversight to ensure the material we are using meets the required sustainability standards we publish a comprehensive overview of this data in our annual reports including data on scope 1 and 2 emissions and emissions intensity figures which are audited drax makes all data and information on its emissions and catchment areas including evidence of forest growth growing stock and sequestration rates forest productivity available for public consumption our supply chain emissions are reported in full in our annual report and accounts we report all of our emissions scope 1 2 and 3 in addition to this due to the british columbia governments rigorous legislative system and british columbia timber sales sfi certification we have every confidence that areas selected for harvest including under the category 2 programme are done so to fulfill a government management objective this is done as part of the longterm harvest planning process by government with industry and other stakeholders who have interests in the land including first nations and the general public sustainable biomass is increasingly being recognised by governments and scientists around the world as having the potential to play a critical role in tackling the climate crisis supporting communities and contributing to energy security and i hope this information reiterates our commitment to sustainability which sits at the heart of our purpose and everything we do will gardiner drax group ceo view our response to the bbc panorama episode here and more information on biomass sourcing from canada here  drax response to bbc panorama programme on canadian forestry 3 october 2022 press releases a drax spokesperson said canada has some of the most highly regulated forests in the world which ensures the forests in british columbia bc are managed properly and provide positive benefits to nature the climate and people people living in and around these forests are best placed to determine how they should be looked after not the bbc draxs own worldleading sustainable sourcing policies are aligned with the rigorous regulatory frameworks and rules set by both the bc and uk governments the uns ipcc  the worlds leading sciencebased climate authority backed by thousands of scientists  restated in their latest report the critical role that biomass will play in meeting global climate targets when sourced sustainably biomass is used by countries around the world to provide reliable renewable energy whatever the weather which displaces fossil fuels like coal from energy systems supporting climate targets in this edition of panorama the bbc has focused primarily on the views of a vocal minority who oppose biomass the programme makers have sought to repeat the inaccurate claims about biomass which have for years been promoted by those who are illinformed about the science behind sustainable forestry and climate change and those who have vested interests in seeing the biomass industry fail good journalism should start from a neutral position to seek out the facts the panorama team did not contact us while they were conducting their research in canada to arrange to visit our facilities from the outset we were presented with a series of onesided assertions from the bbc our lawyers have written to the bbc to remind them of their legal and regulatory obligations and we are considering further action at drax we are open and transparent about our operations and since becoming aware of the production teams visit to canada many people across our business have collectively spent hundreds of hours engaging with them in an effort to encourage an accurate portrayal of our business and the wider forestry industry as anyone in the bc forestry industry knows the forests there are not harvested for biomass they are harvested for high value timber used in construction 80 of the material used to make our pellets at drax in canada is sawmill residues  sawdust wood chips and bark left over when the timber is processed the rest is waste material collected from the forests which would otherwise be burned to reduce the risk of wildfires and disease this is the material used by drax to produce 12 of the uks renewable and secure electricity playing a vital role in keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
