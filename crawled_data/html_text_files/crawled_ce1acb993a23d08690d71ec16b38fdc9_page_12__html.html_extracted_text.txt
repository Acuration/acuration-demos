Press Release
Drax donates £70,000 more to support laptops for learners
28 October 2021
Press releases

The donation builds on the Drax
Laptops for Learners
initiative which supplied 50 laptops with free internet access to the school last year to ensure students having to learn from home during the Covid-19 pandemic did not fall behind in their studies.
Since March 2020, Selby High School has loaned out over 500 laptops to families to support students with home learning and after seeing the positive impact this has had, the school intends to allow their students to keep the devices and to issue additional laptops to support the educational needs of even more pupils. Drax has offered a five-year financial support package to cover the cost and maintenance of 50 new laptops a year, adding up to a total value of over £70,000 across the five years.
Drax’s Group Director of Sustainability Alan Knight said,
“We work closely with schools in our communities to ensure that young people from all backgrounds have equal access to education. Drax has an important part to play in making sure the next generation has the knowledge and skills needed to support businesses like ours as we continue to develop and grow.
“Our partnership with Selby High School builds on the work we did during lockdown to provide laptops with free internet access to ensure no students were left behind in their studies as well as virtual tours of the power station and online work experience so that students didn’t miss out on the opportunities Drax would usually offer.”
Selby High School Principal Nick Hinchcliffe said,
“The generous donation from Drax has really allowed us to move a step closer to our goal of ensuring that every student at Selby High School has access to technology at home. This will have a huge benefit for some of our most vulnerable learners, and particularly allow us to make sure that any gaps in learning caused by the pandemic are quickly closed.”
Drax is committed to supporting the communities local to its operations. It has invested more than £840,000 to support its customers and local communities during the Covid-19 crisis including donating over 1,200 laptops to schools and colleges across the country.

Drax launches major planning consultation at its North Yorkshire power station
21 October 2021
Press releases

Announcement comes after the Government’s Net Zero Strategy outlined the vital role that BECCS could play in delivering the UK’s decarbonisation ambitions.
This week Government also selected the Drax-backed ‘East Coast Cluster’ as a priority Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) project.
Fly-through video of BECCS facility at Drax Power Station released to support public consultation.
Drax is advancing its plans to deliver vital negative emissions technology by beginning a major planning consultation that will seek the views of the public on its proposals to develop Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) at the Drax Power Station Site in North Yorkshire.
The announcement follows the publication of the Government’s Net Zero Strategy which outlined how vital engineered Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) technologies, such as BECCS, could be in delivering on the UK’s decarbonisation ambitions. The Strategy also stated that BECCS could achieve ambitious contributions towards the UK’s 2030 climate change target, supported by significant deployment of mature BECCS technology from the late 2020s.
In addition, the announcement follows news that the East Coast Cluster, a collaboration between Zero Carbon Humber, Net Zero Teesside, and the Northern Endurance Partnership, which plans to create the UK’s first net zero industrial cluster, has received government backing. Drax is an anchor project in the East Coast Cluster and the commencement of its planning consultation marks the first major action from a project in the Cluster.
Both the Humber and Teesside account for almost half of the UK’s industrial CO2 emissions and decarbonising these regions will have the biggest impact on the UK’s ability to reach its legally binding net zero target.
Drax’s BECCS technology will permanently remove 8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, accelerate economic growth for the Yorkshire and Humber region and put the region at the heart of a global green economy. The proposed scheme will also create and support over 10,000 jobs in the Humber and across the UK.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Negative emissions technologies like BECCS will play a vital role in tackling the climate crisis and the start of this consultation marks a significant milestone in our plans to deliver this innovative technology at our power station in Yorkshire.
“The Government’s recently stated ambition for BECCS and backing for the East Coast Cluster further demonstrates the vital role Drax can play in helping the UK reach its ambitious net zero targets, as well as creating and protecting thousands of jobs in this country.”
BECCS at Drax is a “Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project” (NSIP) under the Planning Act 2008 and the company is therefore required to apply for a Development Consent Order (DCO) prior to the installing and operation of the technology.
Through the consultation process communities are invited to share their views on Drax’s proposals. The consultation will run between 1 November and 12 December 2021 and once complete, the findings will be used to finalise Drax’s planning application prior to its submission in 2022. This timeline keeps the company on-track to begin construction of BECCS in 2024, and operation as soon as 2027.

Background
The Humber and Teesside industrial clusters make up 50% of the UK’s industrial emissions, so decarbonising these regions will have the biggest impact on the UK reaching net zero.
Drax would act as an anchor project for Zero Carbon Humber, protecting and creating tens of thousands of jobs, kickstarting a new green industry for the region.
The East Coast Cluster is made up of both Zero Carbon Humber and Net Zero Teesside, supported by the Northern Endurance Partnership – a collaboration between bp, Eni, Equinor, National Grid, Shell and Total, with bp leading as operator.
Drax is ready to invest more than £2bn in two BECCS units at Drax Power Station, with the creation of tens of thousands of jobs.
BECCS at Drax can permanently remove at least eight million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year, whilst supporting the creation of a new global industry in the UK, delivering tens of thousands of jobs in a new green economy. This builds on what we have already achieved with sustainable biomass, in transforming a coal fired power station to become Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
As a part of its Net Zero Strategy, published on 19 October, the Government confirmed its ambition to see significant deployment of mature BECCS technologies by 2030.
Alongside this Strategy, the Government also set out its intention to explore viable commercial frameworks that could support first of a kind power-BECCS.
Drax Power Station produces 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity, keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses.
Drax has reduced its emissions by more than 90% in the last decade and Drax is now one of Europe’s lowest carbon energy generators.

Pupils meet ‘minibeasts’ at Drax nature reserve during first school visit since Covid started
20 October 2021
Press releases

Drax reaffirmed its commitment to STEM education when the
Skylark Centre and Nature Reserve
opened its doors for the first time in more than 18 months to pupils from Camblesforth Community Primary Academy.
The Key Stage One students were the first group through the doors since the pandemic started, with children learning all about wildlife in a ‘minibeasts’ themed activity day at the nature reserve which is located near Drax Power Station – the UK’s biggest renewable power generator.
Camblesforth Community Primary Academy children taking part in the pond dipping activity
The students took part in pond dipping, created a bug hotel and hunted for insects and other ‘minibeasts’ in the woods before finishing off the day by toasting marshmallows on a fire.
For some of these year one and two primary pupils, it was the first school outing they have had the opportunity to go on due to long periods of learning from home during the pandemic.
Gywneth Beaumont, Teacher at Camblesforth Community Primary Academy said:
“Our pupils had a great time at the Skylark centre. The sessions were well planned and resourced, and the children had a lot of fun while also learning so much in just one day. They especially loved having marshmallows round the fire at the end. The staff were amazing and looked after not only the children but the adults as well. We will definitely be returning.”
Drax Group Head of Sustainable Business Alan Knight added:
“We’re so pleased to be able to welcome young people to our Skylark Centre and Nature Reserve for educational visits again.
“We work closely with schools in our communities to inspire children to study Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects. Getting out of the classroom to explore nature is an important part of that. We hope that experiences like these will spark an interest in learning about the natural world around us.”
The Skylark Centre has recently upgraded its learning resources to ensure that the activities on offer support the national curriculum with a particular focus on science and geography.
The centre has achieved national recognition for its educational visits and has been awarded a Learning Outside the Classroom (LOtC) Quality Badge, endorsed by the Department for Education.
Dr Anne Hunt, Chief Executive of the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom said:
“Educational visits are among the most memorable experiences in a child’s school life.  The LOtC Quality Badge offers teachers a guarantee that the venue is providing high quality educational experiences and have the appropriate risk management structures in place, meaning less paperwork for schools and peace of mind for teachers. I congratulate the Skylark Centre and Nature Reserve on being awarded the LOtC Quality Badge.”
Skye Richard, age 5, from Camblesforth Community Primary Academy
Schools planning a visit to the nature reserve can choose from educational activities centred around plants or insects or a combination of the two, with all the learning materials able to be adapted to suit any primary school age group. The group can then choose an ‘outdoor adventure activity’ to add onto the end of their visit such as den building, orienteering and team building games.
The Visitor Centre Team are continuing to follow government guidance and take all the necessary precautions against Covid-19 to ensure that the Skylark Centre and Nature Reserve is a safe environment for those who visit.
Drax is committed to supporting STEM education and while in-person visits to the power station had to stop throughout the covid-19 pandemic the company has continued to offer educational resources including
virtual tours
and
work experience
. Drax hopes to resume school visits to site early next year.

Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner responds to the Government’s Net Zero Strategy
19 October 2021
Press releases

Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group
, said:
Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner
“The Government’s Net Zero Strategy, published today, is a key step forward as the UK looks towards a zero-carbon future. It’s also a clear endorsement of the vital role that Drax will continue to play in helping the UK reach its net zero targets.
“It highlights the significant contributions that both our negative emissions technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and the expansion of our pumped storage hydro capacity, could play in generating renewable energy in the UK, for the UK, whilst also addressing the climate crisis.
“It is important that the Government now advances its plans to develop business models for greenhouse gas removal technologies so as to enable companies like Drax to invest in these and ensure their deployment in the 2020s.”
Background
BECCS at Drax:
Government proposals envisage that by 2030 significant deployment of mature BECCS technologies will be required, with retrofit applications in the power and industrial sectors.
BECCS applications in the power sector could be deployed by the late 2020s, and potentially achieve ambitious contributions to our NDC target by 2030.”
Strategy stresses the need for Engineered GGRs to deploy over the next decade with an estimated 23Mt of CO2 needed to be removed by 2035 and between 75 and 81Mt by 2050.
New government ambition to deliver at least 5MtCO2/year of engineered Greenhouse gas removals (GGRs) by 2030.
Drax is ready to invest more than £2bn in two BECCS units at Drax Power Station, with the creation of tens of thousands of jobs.
Once up and running BECCS at Drax will permanently remove at least 8Mt of CO2 from the atmosphere each year, whilst supporting the creation of a new global industry in the UK, delivering tens of thousands of jobs in a new green economy. This builds on what we have already achieved with sustainable biomass, in transforming a coal fired power station to become Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
The UK has decarbonised its energy system faster than any other country’s as a result of the support the government made available to renewables like offshore wind, solar and biomass. With the right policies, the same could be achieved for negative emissions technologies – demonstrating the same, global climate leadership the UK has a track record of delivering.
Drax Power Station produces 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity, keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses.
We have reduced our emissions by more than 90% in the last decade and Drax is now one of Europe’s lowest carbon energy generators.
Cruachan expansion:
The strategy outlines flexibility and storage technologies as one of the three key pillars to support the decarbonisation of the power system alongside renewables and nuclear.
Like Drax’s existing Cruachan facility in Argyll, the new station will be able to provide lifeline stability services to the power system alongside acting like a giant water battery. By using reversible turbines to pump water from Loch Awe to the upper reservoir on the mountainside, the station can store power from wind farms when supply outstrips demand.
The stored water would then be released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases. This will help to cut energy costs by reducing the need for wind farms to be paid to turn off when they are generating excess power. The new station would have the capacity to generate enough power for around a million homes.
The new 600MW power station will be located inside Ben Cruachan – Argyll’s highest mountain – and increase the site’s total capacity to 1.04GW.
The new power station would be built within a new, hollowed-out cavern which would be large enough to fit Big Ben on its side, to the east of Drax’s existing 440MW pumped storage hydro station.
More than a million tonnes of rock would be excavated to create the cavern and other parts of the power station. The existing upper reservoir, which can hold 2.4 billion gallons of water, has the capacity to serve both power stations.
If planning consent is given for the new power station, the extra capacity could be available in 2030.
Alongside planning consent, the project will also require an updated policy and market support mechanism from the UK Government.
The lack of an existing framework for large-scale, long-duration storage and flexibility technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects, with no new plants built anywhere in the UK since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation. The government recently issued a call for evidence to explore the need to provide further market intervention to support LLES technologies.



Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner responds to “Track-1” cluster announcement
Press releases

Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group,
said:
“Today’s Government announcement is welcome news, and a crucial next step on the UK’s decarbonisation journey. Drax’s bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project will play a vital role in the East Coast Cluster, enabling the UK’s most carbon intensive regions decarbonise helping the UK to reach net zero.
“BECCS at Drax will protect and create tens of thousands of jobs, whilst showcasing the UK’s global leadership in a vital negative emissions technology. The first BECCS unit at Drax could be operational in 2027, delivering the world’s largest carbon capture project, permanently removing millions of tonnes of CO
2
from the atmosphere, playing a vital role in the fight against the climate crisis.”

New EV platform aims to support UK businesses to reach net zero and builds on other Drax services which help them take control of their energy use through the electrification of their fleets and the optimisation of their operations.
The market-leading tool provides businesses with the vital real-time data to effectively manage their electric vehicle fleet. It combines data on their electric vehicle fleet, charge points and energy consumption in one user-friendly platform.
My Electric Vehicles
shows how vehicles are performing, flags issues and offers solutions on how to resolve them, reducing vehicle downtime and improving productivity. Through an interactive map, businesses can see their full EV fleet, and charge points across the country in real-time.
Road transport accounts for over a quarter of the UK’s emissions, and business sales make up around two thirds of new electric vehicle registrations in the country, so decarbonising this sector will make a significant impact on the UK’s journey towards net zero.
Adam Hall, Director of Energy Services at Drax, said:
“Decarbonising road transport will play a vital role in enabling the UK to reach its legally binding 2050 net zero target . By bringing together vehicles, charge points and energy usage into one convenient place,
My Electric Vehicles
enables departments from across businesses to work hand in hand with each other, making fleet electrification – and cutting carbon emissions – easier for everyone.”
Since August 2021, Drax has been working with SES Water, providers of clean water to parts of Kent, Surrey, and South London, to trial
My Electric Vehicles
across their EV fleet.
Henrietta Stock, Energy and Carbon Manager at SES Water, said:
“We started our electric vehicle journey with Drax in 2019, and by bringing their expertise to the partnership, they’ve really accelerated our progress.
“My Electric Vehicles has enabled us to access live data on vehicle movements and charging station usage all in one place, facilitating our day-to-day fleet management and helping us plan for the future through better understanding of vehicle and charging point utilisation. As we work to deliver our net zero carbon routemap by 2030, this digital tool will be vital.”
To launch My Electric Vehicles, Drax is hosting the ‘EV Fleet Academy’ -, a series of webinars for businesses. The event series will kick off today (11
th
October) with discussions on a LinkedIn group, followed by a live-streamed panel event hosted by motoring journalist Quentin Willson on 12
th
October.
During the two-week EV Fleet Academy, businesses will have access to four informative webinars and other content, covering a range of topics on fleet electrification.

Drax to showcase best of British renewable energy innovation to global investors
7 October 2021
Press releases

Drax will showcase its multi-billion-pound innovative negative emissions technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
Drax recently announced an ambition to source 80% of construction materials and services for BECCS from within the UK.
British businesses could benefit from BECCS at Drax with contracts worth hundreds of millions of pounds, creating thousands of jobs, levelling up the North and enabling the UK to build back better in a post Covid world.
Renewable energy giant Drax is one of just a dozen green companies selected to take part in the government’s Global Investment Summit next week.
The event, hosted by the Prime Minister and the Royal Family, will showcase the opportunities for investment in the UK, demonstrating the government’s commitment to building back better following the Covid-19 pandemic and delivering the Ten-Point-Plan set out last year.
Drax will showcase its multi-billion-pound innovative negative emissions technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which permanently removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and will be needed for the UK to reach its climate targets cost effectively. BECCS will also play a vital role in decarbonising the UK’s industrial sector as part of the East Coast Cluster.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“The UK has a once in a generation opportunity to develop the innovative green technologies which will play a crucial role in tackling the climate crisis. Drax has already transformed itself from the biggest coal fired power station in Western Europe into one of Europe’s lowest carbon utilities and we are now pioneering vital negative emissions technology that will enable us to become the largest carbon capture in power project in the world.

Editor’s Notes

Drax will be showcasing its innovative negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) at the Global Investment Summit.
BECCS at Drax Power Station will deliver at least 8m tonnes of negative emissions a year – equivalent to 15% of the negative emissions the CCC says are required from BECCS in 2050 to hit the UK net zero target.
This multi-billion-pound project will also protect and create over 10,000 jobs across the Humber, decarbonising one of the UK’s most carbon intensive regions, whilst developing green skills and kickstarting new industries.
Drax aims for 80% of the materials and services needed for its BECCS plans to come from UK supply chain. This does not include the carbon capture technology to be delivered by Drax’s technology partner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Leading climate scientists at the UN’s IPCC and UK Climate Change Committee have said that the world cannot address the climate crisis without negative emissions from technologies like BECCS, which permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Work to build BECCS at Drax could get underway as soon as 2024, with the creation of thousands of jobs.
Subject to the right regulatory support, the first BECCS unit could be operational in 2027, with the second commissioned in 2030, enabling Drax to achieve its world-leading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030.
BECCS at Drax will save the UK £13 billion over the coming decade in meeting its climate goals according to an independent report by
energy consultancy Baringa
.

Drax announces 80% British supply chain ambition to support construction of world’s largest carbon capture project
23 September 2021
Press releases

BECCS at Drax could mean British companies benefit from supply contracts worth hundreds of millions of pounds, protecting and creating over 10,000 jobs across the Humber, developing green skills, and helping level up the North.
Announcement made as Drax launches series of nationwide supplier events for UK businesses to get involved in delivering this vital multi-billion-pound project in the 2020s.
Renewable energy company Drax has announced that it aims to source 80% of the construction materials and services needed to deliver its climate saving negative emissions technology
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
from the UK supply chain.
The 80% ambition includes all construction materials needed as part of the deployment of the multi-billion-pound project such as steel, pipes, heat pumps, electricals, and insulation, as well as the support services involved in delivering such a large project.
In doing so, BECCS at Drax has the potential to deliver hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts for British businesses. As well as this, BECCS will protect and create over 10,000 jobs across the Humber, decarbonising one of the UK’s most carbon intensive regions  as part of the East Coast Cluster, whilst developing green skills, kickstarting new industries and helping level up the North.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“BECCS will play a vital role in enabling the UK to reach its legally binding net zero target, as well as saving the energy system billions of pounds in the process.
“Our ambition is to put the UK supply chain at the heart of delivering this crucial climate saving technology and by doing so we’ll create and protect thousands of new jobs, kickstart new industries and help level up the UK.”
The announcement comes as Drax launches the first in a series of nationwide supplier events. Run in partnership with the West & North Yorkshire and Hull & Humber Chambers of Commerce, and organised by business support organisation NOF, the event series will enable new and prospective suppliers to learn more about the BECCS project, as well as how they can be involved in delivering this vital negative emissions technology.
Drax has a proven track record in delivering ambitious and pioneering infrastructure projects – the conversion of its power station in North Yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal has enabled it to become the UK’s largest single site renewable generator, reducing its emissions by over 90% and paving the way for the deployment of BECCS.
A formal public consultation on Drax’s BECCS plans will take place in November, when stakeholders including local communities will be able to learn more about the proposed project and provide their feedback as part of the planning process.
Work to build BECCS at Drax could get underway as soon as 2024, with the first BECCS unit operational in 2027 and a second in 2030, delivering the world’s largest carbon capture in power project and making a signification contribution to the UK’s decarbonisation targets.
