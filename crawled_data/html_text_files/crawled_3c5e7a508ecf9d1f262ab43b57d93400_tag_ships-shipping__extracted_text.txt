ships and shipping the electric transport revolution 16 april 2018 electrification with rapid technological improvements and falls in battery prices improving performance and reducing the cost experts predict that by 2050 90 of newbuild cars will be powered by electricity  however its not only roads where transport is decarbonising electricity may soon power more of the worlds trains plus its planes and boats taking trains forward the electrification of the rail industry has arguably been in the making for a lot longer than evs but theres still progress to be made trains are already one of the mostefficient modes of longdistance transport and network rail claims electric models carbon emissions are 20 to 35 lower than diesel trains electric trains also accelerate and brake faster than dieselpowered models and cause less wear to tracks electrified trains are already commonplace in many parts of the world  japans famously fast and reliable shinkansen railways are electric meanwhile in the uk less than 50 of the rail network is electrified  with transport secretary chris graylings recent pause on development casting doubts on previous ambitious plans to electrify 850miles of track nevertheless advancements are still being made to enable the sector to utilise solar energy as an alternative to the national power grid the concept would prove cost effective and reduce the carbon footprint of trains even further according to a report by climate change charity 1010 and researchers at imperial colleges energy futures lab rail companies could cut their annual running costs by millions of pounds through installing their own trackside solar panels to power electric trains directly with companies spending around 500 million a year on power  the savings on selfgeneration would enable them to cut fares for passengers as well as emissions take off for electric planes of all transport modes air travel has made the least progress in electrification but theres hope yet airbus rollsroyce and siemens recently teamed up to develop the technology needed to create electricallypowered aircraft the companies plan to fly a demonstrator aircraft with one of its existing jet engines replaced by an electric unit in 2020 paul stein chief technology officer at rollsroyce said aviation is the last frontier of the electrification of transport it could lead to a step change in the way we fly with greater efficiency and less noise these proposed hybridelectric aircraft are not powered by onboard batteries like evs but with a gas turbine that generates electricity to drive the propellers  this could reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 predicted mark cousin head of flight demonstration at airbus moving to electric aircraft would also help the aviation industry meet eu targets of a 60 reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  by 2020 as well as 90 less nitrogen oxides and a noise reduction of around 75 ukbased airline easyjet also announced it could be flying electric planes within a decade and is teaming up with us firm wright electric to build batterypowered aircraft according to easyjet the move would enable batterypowered aeroplanes to travel shorthaul routes such as london to paris and amsterdam and edinburgh to bristol wright electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of easyjet passengers the challenge comes in making lithiumion batteries light and safe enough for the air the airline said this was the next step in making air travel less harmful for the environment after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31 between 2000 and 2016  wright electric claims that electric planes will save up to 15 in fuel burn and co 2 emissions  be 50 quieter and 10 cheaper for airlines to buy and operate with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers testing new waters theres a lot of buzz coming out of the maritime industry too every year marine transport emits 1000 million tonnes of co 2  which is why the international maritime organization imo has agreed that a reduction of 50 should come by 2050 compared with 2008 levels although the deal fell short of more ambitious targets preferred by those ranging from the european union to environmental ngos the imo did also commit to pursue efforts toward phasing out co 2 emissions entirely as paris agreement goals to cut carbon dioxide emissions loom businesses around the world are innovating small fleets of batterypowered boats designed for fjords and inland waterways in norway belgium and the netherlands are preparing to set sail  including some able to run autonomously without a crew  dutch company portliner is also gearing up to launch the first fullyelectric emissionfree barges in europe dubbed tesla ships portliner chief executive officer ton van meegen claims these barges would be the first in the world to sail on carbonneutral batteries  the first six barges alone are expected to remove 23000 trucks from the roads annually in the netherlands replacing them with zeroemission methods of transport china also recently launched an electric cargo ship to haul coal which whilst not doing much for its ambitions to cut pollution will at least eliminate shipping emissions from diesel engines electric ships may not yet be the norm globally but progress is underway to cut the 25 of global greenhouse emissions that result from the maritime transport industry once a farflung fantasy in some areas electrified transport is fast becoming a reality evs and rail are leading the way but its

5 incredible numbers from the worlds largest biomass port 26 january 2018 sustainable bioenergy since its origins the port of immingham has held close links with the uks rail and energy networks it was the humber commercial railway and dock company along with the great central railway that first established the dock completing it in 1912 to serve its primary purpose of exporting the most important fuel of the time coal today immingham is the uks largest port by tonnage  and while these transport connections endure theyve changed with the times the port is now connected to modern rail infrastructure and helps run a renewable energy system immingham is one of a number of uk ports that receives shipments of wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity at drax power station in yorkshire with 20000 tonnes of wood pellets arriving at drax every day here are the numbers that tell the story of how the port of immingham keeps more biomass coming in than any other in the world  135 million revamping for renewables the port began to get serious about renewable energy in 2013 when an investment of around 135m kickstarted the creation of the immingham renewable fuels terminal  the largest biomass handling facility in the world developed by the associated british ports as part of a 15year deal with drax the revamp of the former coal port saw an update of its unloading storage rail and road facilities to make it biomassready getting those 60000 tonnes of biomass pellets from ship to train to drax requires tight supply chain systems designed especially for this task 2300 tonnes of biomass unloaded every hour a key component of immingham is its continuous ship unloaders replacing the ports grab cranes in 2013 these two structures use a combination of suction and an archimedes screw to discharge 2300 tonnes of biomass an hour from docking ships the continuous unloaders are bespoke for immingham and designed to keep operating at a constant rate as the humbers tide rises and falls biomass is drawn up through the unloaders to a conveyer that then takes it all the way from the jetty to one of the ports eight silos 120 olympicsized swimming pools of storage unlike coal which can be stored in the open air biomass must be kept dry  immingham stores wood pellets in eight silos each capable of holding 25000 tonnes of biomass with the port doubling its storage space from four silos in early 2016 the sites total capacity now comes in at 336000m 3  the equivalent of more than 120 olympicsized swimming pools  here the biomass can be stored for any time between a couple of days and a couple of months depending on draxs demand 72 trains heading to britains biggest power station every week the next leg of the journey for the wood pellets sees them moved along the conveyer to board draxs specifically designed trains  imminghams rail facilities and draxs train wagons were developed to automate the loading process for maximum efficiency trains slow down to half a mile per hour as they enter the loading bay where sensors and magnets open the hatch doors of the wagons and close them when theyre full the automation of this process allows a 25wagon train to be filled in just 37 minutes in total 12 trains can pass through each day meaning the port can send 72 trains to drax every week with each hoppers full load at 716 tonnes of compressed wood pellets each train can carry between 1700 and 1800 tonnes it takes the total biomass reaching the power station from immingham to a maximum of 130000 tonnes each week 400 million added to the local economy draxs contribution to the yorkshire and humber region includes 3650 jobs and a 4192 million economic impact  this is primarily the result of the impact made by drax power station to the region however its support of other businesses along its supply chains means its economic contribution is felt far beyond its selby site in 2016 drax indirectly supported 1800 jobs in yorkshire and the humber region at facilities such as immingham its indirect economic contribution came to 117 million as the regions biomass industry became increasingly important find out about another major uk port that has been transformed thanks to renewable energy how does biomass get shipped to the uk read the story of one of the us ports sending wood pellets to uk shores tags technology  supply chain  ships and shipping building a 21st century port 16 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy in its long history the port of liverpool has dealt with a number of industries its a port characterised by its ability to adapt to the needs of the time in 1715 it emerged as one of the worlds first ever wet docks in the 18 th century it was used as a hub for the slave trade when slavery was abolished in the early 19th century liverpool switched to bringing in the goods of the thriving empire such as cotton when goods like cotton dried up it switched to the fuel of the industrial revolution coal now as the world and the uk government moves away from fuels like coal and towards lowercarbon and renewable resources the port of liverpool needed to adapt once again gary hodgson chief operating officer at peel ports  explains about three years ago everyone was asking what happens after coal what happens after coal peel ports is one of the biggest operators of liverpools shipping infrastructure including liverpool port seeing that the future of coal was finite it recognised there was a need for a port that could bring in alternative renewable fuels at the same time drax was looking for a logistics partner to facilitate the importing of compressed wood pellets since 2009 drax power station had begun a process of upgrading its coalfired boilers to run on sustainable biomass sourced from huge wellestablished working forests  more than this it had plans to set up its own pellet manufacturing plants in the us south and needed to import large quantities of wood pellets the relationship with peel ports and liverpool was obvious this began a 100 million investment that helped transform the regions portstation transport infrastructure its about working in partnerships with companies says hodgson working this way helps develop solutions that really work the central element of the partnership between drax and peel ports was a radical redesigning of the technical infrastructure not only do compressed wood pellets have fundamentally different physical properties to other fuels like coal they are more combustible and need to be handled safely for the threemilliontonnecapacity facility that peel ports and drax wanted to build innovative supply chain solutions had to be developed shifting biomass in bulk the first challenge was getting the highdensity pellets off giant ships for this peel and drax designed a solution that uses an archimedean screw  a long tube with a spiral winding up the inside that allows liquids or materials that can behave like a liquid like wood pellets to defy gravity and travel upwards at the top of the screw the pellets are emptied onto a conveyor belt and carried to one of three purposebuilt silos tailored to safely storing thousands of tonnes of biomass  here the pellets wait until another conveyor belt deposits them onto speciallydesign biomass trains where they are transported across the peaks of the pennines to drax power station near selby in north yorkshire each step at the port is automated designed with supreme efficiency in mind by a team of drax and peel port engineers endtoend port to power station the whole process can take as little as 12 hours a new chapter for the north in the varied history of the port of liverpool the new facility is another chapter one that is helping transform the logistics infrastructure and the economic growth of the north west now open and operational the facility directly employs 50 people  around 500 additional contractors have worked on the project during its construction and development more than that its an investment in the countrys energy future it secures a fourth port for drax  three others are on the east coast  helping with security of supply we made this investment because we recognised this as the future of the energy mix of the country hodgson explain we cant just rely on one form of power  there has to be an energy mix and we see biomass as a key part of that tags biomass energy  sustainability  supply chain  ships and shipping renewables better together andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 5 april 2016 opinion theres more pressure than ever to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation and no one is keener than the team here at drax power station to make it happen in fact weve been doing it for a decade but we need the right support to finish the job we upgraded our turbines between 200712 to save one million tonnes of co2 emissions weve converted half our station to run on compressed wood pellets instead of coal  reducing emissions by up to 86 per cent  our friends in the north of england have invested millions of pounds to help us make that happen through building new infrastructure at our landing and loading facilities at the port of tyne  the new port at liverpool  at hull and at immingham  weve designed and commissioned our own rolling stock with lloyds register rail to ensure that the compressed wood pellets can be transported to the power station in the most energyefficient way possible and while many jobs in the north of england are being lost with the planned closure of a number of older coalfired power stations we continue to employ over a thousand people directly here in north yorkshire in fact its no exaggeration to say that drax is a genuine northern powerhouse to borrow a phrase from the chancellor of the exchequer which is why we hope he and his colleagues in government will listen when we say that were seriously concerned that the planned auctions for new green energy could result in bill payers missing out on savings of over 2 billion the government has committed to three further renewable energy auctions that will happen over the next few years the first of them is already planned for later in 2016 as far as we know those auctions will only be open to offshore wind and perhaps also something being referred to as less established technologies but independent research published by nera and imperial college london suggests that a single technology approach could waste a significant amount of money the research was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main renewable energy technologies  wind solar and biomass as a result economists conclude that hard working families and businesses could enjoy significant savings if these auctions were opened up to include other renewables but the sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow this makes wind and solar intermittent energy technologies backup power is needed when the weathers not right or when demand is high naturally this standby energy isnt free someone has to pay for it but those additional costs are not currently included in the way that the government calculates how much support the different kinds of renewable energy require and the iclnera research shows that when the true costs are added in offshore wind is actually the most expensive form of renewable energy the affordable solution is to convert existing power stations to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal  this balanced approach also allows more offshore wind and solar onto our electricity network without the need for more fossil fuels to provide overall reliability more biomass conversions can also help the uk end coal by energy secretary amber rudds 2025 target date  thats what we mean when we say drax needs the right support to finish the job were asking the government to consider the true cost of bringing new renewable capacity on stream and then to add sustainable biomass to the auctions for new contracts that decision could save bill payers up to 2bn  it could safeguard thousands of direct and indirect jobs in yorkshire and the north of england and it will give our country the reliable renewable power we need when others just cant deliver it tags ships and shipping  transport  decarbonisation  biomass
