power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station how to switch a power station off coal the biggest power station in the uk takes another leap towards being entirely coalfree meet the engineer leading the process 22 august 2018 sustainable bioenergy in 2003 the uks biggest coal power station took its first steps away from the fossil fuel which defined electricity generation for more than a century it was in that year that drax power station began cofiring biomass as a renewable alternative to coal it symbolised the beginnings of the power stations ambitious transformation from fossilfuel stalwart to the countrys largest singlesite renewable electricity generator this plan presented a massive engineering challenge for drax with significant amounts of new knowledge quickly needed fifteen years later three of its generating units now run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of biomass while coal has been relegated to stepping in only to cover spikes in demand and improve system stability  now drax has converted a fourth unit from coal to biomass this development represents the passing of a two thirds marker for the power stations coalfree ambitions and adds 600plus megawatts mw of renewable electricity to great britains national transmission system  building on the past drax first converted a coal unit to biomass in 2013 with two more following in 2014 and 2016 this put drax in an interesting position going into a new conversion on one hand it is one of the most experienced generators in the world when it comes to dealing with and upgrading to biomass on the other its still relatively new to the low carbon fuel compared with its dealings with coal adam nicholson weve decades of understanding of how to use coal but weve only been operating with biomass since we started the full conversion trials in 2011 says adam nicholson section head for process performance at drax power weve got few running hours under our belts with the new fuel versus the hundreds of man years of coal knowledge and operation all around the country when converting a generating unit the steam turbine and generator itself remain the same the difference is all in the material being delivered stored crushed and blown into the boiler and burned to heat up water and create steam and because biomass can be a volatile substance  much more so than coal  this process must be a careful one drax could build on the learnings and equipment it had already developed for biomass such as specially built trains and pulverising mills  but storage proved a bigger issue the giant biomass domes at drax that make up the ecostore are advanced technological structures carefully attuned to storing biomass but for unit 4 they were off limits instead drax engineers had to come up with another solution the journey of a pellet through the power station normally wood pellets are brought into drax by train unloaded and stored in the biomass domes before travelling through the power station to the mills and then boilers  unit 4 however sits in the second half of the station  built 12 years after the first this slight change in location presented a problem theres no link from the eco store to unit 4 at all explains nicholson you cant use the storage domes and that whole infrastructure to get anything to unit 4 drax engineers set about designing a new conveyor system that could connect the domes to the mills and boiler that powers unit 4 after weeks of design the team had a theoretical plan to connect the two locations with one problem it was entirely uneconomical rail unloading building 1 and storage silos if we were building a new plant it would be relatively easy because you could plan properly and wouldnt have existing equipment in the way says nicholson we had to plan around it and make use of the preexisting plant within that preexisting plant though were vital pieces of equipment some of which had laid dormant since drax stopped fuelling its boilers with a mixture of coal and biomass and opted instead for full unit conversions drax began cofiring across all six units in 2003 using two different materials  a mix of around 5 biomass and 95 coal a direct injection facility was added in 2005 it involved blowing crushed wood pellets into coal fuel lines from two of the power stations 60 mills  then the amount of renewable power drax was able to generate roughly doubled in the summer of 2010 when a 400 mw cofiring facility became operational back to the present day its fortunate for the unit 4 conversion that the cofiring facility includes its own rail unloading building rub 1 and storage silos they are located much closer to the unit than the bigger rub 2 and the massive biomass domes this solved the problem of storage but moving the required volumes of biomass through the plant without significant transport construction still posed a challenge rail unloading building 1 and storage silos for unit 4 left ecostore biomass domes for units 13 right to tackle this the team modified a pneumatic transport system previously tested during cofiring to have the capability to blow entire pellets from the storage facilities around the power station at speeds of more than 20 metres per second the success of this system proved key  it was the final piece necessary to make the conversion of unit 4 economical  the postcoal future andy koss for now draxs fifth and sixth generating unit remain coalpowered but are called upon less frequently with great britain set to go completely coalfree by 2025 there are plans to convert these too but as part of a system of combined cycle gas turbines and giant batteries rather than biomass powered units its an opportunity for drax to again leverage its preexisting plant and provide the grid with a fast actingsource of lowercarbon electricity as with converting to biomass it will pose a complex new engineering challenge  one that will prepare drax to meet the future needs of grid as it continues to change and demand greater flexibility from generators the speed at which the unit 4 project has been delivered is testament to the engineering expertise skill and ingenuity we continue to see at drax were nimble and innovative enough to meet future challenges says andy koss chief executive drax power we may look very different in 10 or 20 years time but the ethos of that innovation and agility is something that will persist repowering the remaining coal plant with gas and up to 200 mw of batteries will sit alongside research into areas such as carbon capture use and storage ccus that is all geared towards expanding drax power beyond a single site generator into a portfolio of flexible power production facilities unit 4s conversion is more than just a step beyond halfway for the power stations decarbonisation but a significant step towards becoming entirely coalfree  find out more about unit 4  share related stories press releases uks
