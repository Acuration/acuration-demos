high school have visited drax groups iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station to understand the critical role the facility plays in supporting scotlands power system cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built in a hollowedout cavern 1km inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain constructed in 1965 its reversible turbines are still at the cutting edge of energy storage technology enabling the plant to act like a giant water battery its turbines pump water from loch awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid the stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this process helps stop wind farms being paid to turn off when they are generating excess power helping scotland to be greener whilst cutting household energy bills oban high school was one of the first schools to visit the power station since it reopened following the lifting of covid restrictions they took part in a tour which supported the work the students are doing to understand how renewable electricity is generated ian kinnaird in the cruachan machine hall draxs scottish assets  generation engineering director ian kinnaird said we work closely with schools to inspire the next generation to study stem subjects and these tours are important in firing up students imaginations by showing them how renewable electricity is generated cruachan plays a critical role in stabilising the electricity system balancing supply and demand by storing excess power from the national grid when scotlands wind turbines are generating more power than we need cruachan steps in to store the renewable electricity so it doesnt go to waste drax has exciting plans to more than double cruachans generating capacity a project that will support new green jobs and help bring more renewable power onto the grid the group of 25 students aged between 16 and 18 were taken on a full tour of the site which included travelling by bus 1km underground to the viewing gallery that looks out onto the huge machine hall which houses the four turbines when all four of its generating units are operating at maximum capacity the plant can supply enough flexible renewable power for around 800000 homes peter bain head teacher at oban high school said the students had a great day at cruachan learning about how important this unique power station is in supporting the scottish energy system and the critical role it plays in keeping the power grid safe and stable visits like this are so valuable because seeing the power station and the scale of the operations is impossible to replicate in a classroom  it really brings the subject to life prior to the pandemic cruachan power station near oban welcomed more than 50000 visitors every year many of whom were students visiting as part of the renewable energy companys initiatives to encourage young people to study stem science technology engineering and maths subjects boosting skills across the region in line with lockdown rules cruachan suspended its public tours in march 2020 to protect its key workers who worked around

storing excess energy when there is an oversupply of power and then releasing when the country needs it most this is especially useful in supporting wind and solar generation storing excess renewable power to be used later instead of going to waste a recent report by the renewable energy association rea highlighted the policy barriers to deploying longduration energy storage and suggested ways to address these barriers such as through the introduction of an income floor despite being a key supporting pillar for intermittent generation from wind and solar power no new pumped storage plants have been built in britain since 1984 enough renewable power to supply 800000 uk homes went to waste in 2020 and 2021 as wind farms were routinely asked to switch off by the electricity system operator and there wasnt enough capacity to ensure this excess renewable power was stored and made available when it was needed drax recently submitted the planning application to build a new underground pumped hydro storage power station at cruachan which will more than double the sites electricity generating capacity the new 600megawatt mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest

investing in more long duration electricity storage such as expanding draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro plant in scotland would mean more excess renewable power could be stored and made available when required cutting costs and carbon emissions the cost of turning off uk wind farms to manage the electricity system rose from almost 300m during 2020 to over 500m in 2021 contributing to higher energy bills and carbon emissions according to a new report costs increased substantially because the system relied on expensive gas power to manage periods when wind power was curtailed as not enough electricity storage was available to prevent the excess renewable power from wind farms going to waste the independent report by lane clark  peacock lcp commissioned by renewable energy leader drax found that over the last two years curtailing wind power added 806m to energy bills in britain rising gas prices made the practice more expensive as gas power stations were increasingly used to support the system when wind power was curtailed click to viewdownload despite the growing need for more homegrown renewable power generation from wind farms to support energy security enough renewable power to supply 800000 uk homes went to waste in 2020 and 2021 as wind farms were routinely asked to switch off by the electricity system operator click to viewdownload this happened as a result of constraints in the transmission system and a lack of longduration storage capacity which is needed to manage periods when renewable power generation outstrips demand britain is a world leader in wind power with capacity increasing from 54gw in 2010 to 257gw in 2021  wind turbines now have the capacity to provide enough renewable power for almost 20 million homes but without any new longduration storage projects built for almost 40 years in the uk the only way to manage the imbalance when generation outstrips demand and prevent damage to the electricity grid is to curtail wind power  a practice which could be significantly reduced if more energy storage was available and with gas power stations overwhelmingly called upon to plug the gaps in supply when wind was constrained due to transmission issues there was an environmental cost an extra two million tonnes of co 2 was emitted during 2020 and 2021 as a result of gas being used to replace curtailed wind power equivalent to putting almost half a million more cars on britains roads chris matson from lcp said increasing the output from wind power is essential for the uk to achieve its climate targets and ensure energy security and yet because investment in the infrastructure needed to support this expansion has not kept pace wind curtailment is costing the consumer and the environment every pound spent on curtailing wind power is a pound wasted find out more about cruachan 2 here  drax has recently submitted an application to construct and operate a new underground pumped storage hydro power station at its existing cruachan facility in scotland the 600 mw plant will be located in one of the most constrained transmission areas and will play a crucial role in supporting more wind power to come online to reduce energy bills and carbon emissions penny small draxs group generation director said penny small drax group generation director this report underlines the need for a new regulatory framework to encourage private investment in longduration storage technologies the uk is a worldleader in offshore wind but for the countrys green energy ambitions to be realised we need the right energy storage infrastructure to support this vital technology make the system secure and reduce costs draxs plan to expand cruachan will strengthen uk energy security by enabling more homegrown renewable electricity to power british homes and businesses reducing system costs and cutting carbon emissions longduration storage projects have been left in limbo in recent years without an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the lack of a framework for these technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes a copy of the  renewable curtailment and the role of long duration storage report can be found here  the report defines consumer costs of curtailing wind as the cost of turning wind plant down bid costs the consumer benefit arising from the nonpayment of lowcarbon support payments to curtailed wind plant and the cost of paying generation to turnup offer costs to replace the lost wind generation of the 806m cost to consumers from wind curtailment in 2020 and 2021 82 663m was from curtailing wind in scotland  underlining the need for flexible technologies in scotland specifically in may drax applied for consent to build a new 600mw pumped storage hydro plant at its existing cruachan facility in argyll scotland the new power station could be operation in 2030 with construction work getting underway in

its kind in the uk in more than 40 years  will provide critical storage capacity to strengthen the uks energy security and enable net zero it will be a major infrastructure project which will support around 900 jobs during six years of construction across the supply chain in a range of industries from quarrying and engineering to transport and hospitality around 150 onsite local construction jobs will be created during the development the up to 600mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 104gw the plant will be housed within a new hollowedout cavern which would be large enough to fit big ben on its side around two million tonnes of rock will be excavated to create the cavern tunnels and other parts of the power station the hollow mountain  cruachans generating units are housed inside the mountain the new plant could be operational in 2030 providing critical stability services to the power system by acting like a giant water battery it will use reversible turbines to pump water from loch awe to the upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from wind farms and other low carbon technologies when supply outstrips demand and then use this stored water to generate renewable power when it is needed a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants can play a major role in reducing emissions and significantly cutting the uks reliance on imported gas through their storage and flexibility services wind farms are routinely paid to turn off when supply outstrips demand or there is insufficient capacity on the national grid transmission system due to a lack of energy storage creating local bottlenecks in 2020 enough wind power to supply around a million homes went to waste

and cut costs this major infrastructure project will support hundreds of jobs and provide a real boost to the scottish economy only by investing in longduration storage technologies can the uk reach its full renewable potential and drax is ready to move mountains to do just that claire mack scottish renewables chief executive said  pumped storage hydro is a critical technology needed to meet net zero over the last decade we have managed to develop the technologies to decarbonise the power system such as wind and solar but what we really need now is greater flexibility to fully optimise those technologies thats why the success of longduration storage projects such as cruachan 2 is absolutely vital to scotland and the whole of the uk draxs plans to expand cruachan has also won support from former australian prime minister malcolm turnbull during his time in office mr turnbull announced the construction of snowy hydro 20  the biggest pumped hydro scheme in the southern hemisphere he is now a board member of the international hydropower association and cochair of the international forum on pumped storage hydropower commenting on draxs exciting expansion plans mr turnbull said  within the climate crisis the world is facing an ignored crisis  how to ensure that we do not fall back on fossil fuels when the wind isnt blowing and the sun isnt shining we need green energy security solutions and draxs plans to expand cruachan will enable the uk to enhance its energy security and enable more renewable power to come online in order to deploy this critical technology drax must
