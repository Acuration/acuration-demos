gas taxing coal off the system 13 march 2017 power generation in the spring budget 2017 the chancellor announced that the government remains committed to carbon pricing philip hammonds red book revealed that from 202122 the government will target a total carbon price and set the specific tax rate  giving businesses greater clarity on the total price they will pay further details on carbon prices are to be set out at autumn budget 2017 researchers at imperial college london have modelled what would have happened during 2016 with no carbon tax and also with an increased carbon tax they have compared both with what actually happened their conclusion no carbon tax would mean more coal less gas higher emissions a higher carbon tax would mean less coal more gas lower emissions since it was announced in 2011 the carbon price support cps has encouraged generators and industry to invest in lower carbon and renewable technologies it has also forced coal generators to fire their boilers only when they are really needed to meet demand such as during the winter months or at times of peak demand and still or overcast weather conditions during the summer months the introduction of the carbon price has meant that gas power stations which are less carbon intensive than coal have jumped ahead of coal in the economic merit order of energy generation technologies and produced a greater share of the uks power the same is the case for former coal generation units that have since upgraded to sustainable biomass  three such units at drax power station result in savings in greenhouse gas ghg emissions of at least 80 a coal cliff edge the carbon price support has resulted in significant savings in the countrys greenhouse gas emissions helping the uk meet its international climate change commitments removing or reducing the cps too soon and britains power mix risks going back in time it would improve the economics of coal and encourage britains remaining coal power stations to stay open for longer creating a risk to security of supply through a cliff edge of coal closures in the mid2020s changing the economics to favour coal also makes it harder to reach the uk governments goal of bringing a new fleet of gas power stations online what if  dr iain staffell from the centre for environmental policy at imperial college london has modelled a scenario in which the carbon price support did not exist in 2016 if the government had abolished all carbon pricing we would probably have seen a 20 increase in the power sectors carbon emissions said staffell removing the carbon price support would have the equivalent environmental impact of every single person in the uk deciding to drive a car once a year from lands end to john ogroats without the carbon price support emissions from electricity consumption would be 20 higher meaning an extra 250 kg per person equivalent to driving a car 800 miles running the numbers the carbon price support is capped at 18tco 2 until 2021 in his budget on 8 th march 2017 chancellor philip hammond  rightly in the view of drax  confirmed the governments commitment to carbon pricing using data from national grid and elexon and analysis from dr iain staffell electric insights shows how coal power generation was only needed last winter when electricity demand was greater than could be produced by other technologies alone coal was only used at times of peak demand because it was among the most expensive energy technologies in part due to the cps what if that wasnt the case and the government had decided to scrap the cps before that point in time more coal is burnt particularly during the daytimes  on average coal produces 2500 mw more over this week equivalent to four of drax power stations six generation units and what does dr iain staffells model suggest would have happened if the cap was doubled to 36tco 2  the change is stark even for a week in the winter with an average temperature across the country of 86 o c to see coal generation reduced so much compared to the actual cps of 18tco 2 or the 0tco 2 scenario model illustrates the impact of the carbon price support could bill payers save one argument for reducing the carbon price support  or scrapping it altogether  is the possibility that consumers and nondomestic electricity bill payers would save money its worth noting that apparent savings for electricity bill payers are lowered when the whole way that power is priced is accounted for by the time it reaches homes and businesses carbon price support does increase the cost of wholesale power says staffell but if you add the extra taxes other renewable and low carbon support measures transmission and balancing charges and fees imposed by electricity suppliers the overall impact on consumer bills is modest so if the government abolished all carbon pricing we could expect a 1 pkwh reduction in our tariffs but a 21 increase in our carbon emissions as a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers from imperial college london has already shown there are other ways to save bill payers money while encouraging a low carbon future their analysis published in early 2016 found that households and businesses could save 2bn if the government considered the whole system cost of electricity generation and supply when designing its competitions for support under its contracts for difference cfd scheme 2016 redux without the carbon price support the uk wouldnt have managed to send carbon emissions back to 19 th century levels  so if 2016 was played out one more time but with no carbon price support coal generation would have increased by 102 28 terawatthours to 56 twh gas generation would have decreased by 21 27 twh to 101 twh carbon emissions would have risen by 21 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to 92mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have increased by 20 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 349 gco 2 kwh and if 2016 had seen a doubling of the cps to 36tco 2  coal generation would have decreased by 47 129 twh to 147 twh gas generation would have increased by 9 118 twh to 1395 twh carbon emissions would have decreased by 10 73 mt co 2  to 686 mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have decreased by 9 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 263 gco 2 kwh the two scenarios presented above only modelled the impact of no or a higher carbon price support on nuclear coal and gas power supply in the realworld changes to the carbon price support would also impact on energy technologies that operate under the renewables obligation ro such as two of draxs three biomass units and much of the countrys other renewable capacity cps changes would also likely impact imports and storage while no analysis is perfect this clearly illustrates the significantly negative impact that scrapping or reducing the carbon price support would have on the uks decarbonisation agenda it also highlights the benefits that the governments decision to remain committed to carbon pricing will deliver what if  britain had no carbon price support httpstcongz1jzmhtx pictwittercommiusyf73gq  drax draxgroup march 13 2017 commissioned by drax electric insights is produced

playing a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used as the uk moves to a low carbon future  with the right conditions we can do even more converting further units to run on compressed wood pellets  this is the fastest and most reliable way to support the uks decarbonisation targets whilst minimising the cost to households and businesses  in a challenging commodity

andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 19 december 2016 opinion half a decade ago we began a major transformation at drax power station converting it to run on sustainable biomass this week weve reached another milestone in that journey weve been granted a contract for difference cfd  a uk government financial support thats now been approved by the european commission it allows us to fully convert a third power generation unit to run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of renewable biomass the granting of the cfd is a symbolic moment in our decarbonisation journey  it marks the close of one phase of development where the power station now makes more renewable than fossil fuel power and the start of the next this next chapter began when we announced two major projects the acquisition of opus energy and our plans to build four new rapid response open cycle gas turbine ocgt power stations  like the upgrade of drax power station these new peaking plants are an important step in helping the country achieve a decarbonised energy system they will do this by enabling more renewables to come onto the system the need for a diverse power network nearly 45 of the uks power already comes from gas mostly generated by combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plants but while ccgt plants can deliver a steady supply of baseload power and flex up and down within seconds  just like drax power station does with both coal and biomass  they cant turn on and be at full capacity at very short notice starting from cold to quickly power the equivalent of a small city in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days however is exactly what the uk power network is increasingly going to need solar and wind power cant generate electricity when its dark or still so to facilitate more of these intermittent renewables coming onto the grid we need sources that can be quickly ramped up to fill the gaps when lower carbon technologies arent able to provide the essential power for the modern world this is where ocgt stations come in alongside other standby technologies such as storage and demand side response ocgt stations have turbines that work like jet engines this means they can start up incredibly quickly getting to full load in just 30 minutes meeting surges quickly when intermittent renewables cant and nuclear biomass and ccgt power stations are already providing baseload electricity our proposed plants could be online as soon as the winter of 202021  a few years before the last remaining coalfired power stations close down they will operate for roughly 500 hours a year with a maximum availability of 1500 hours depending on demand and each will have a capacity of 299 mw each will generate enough instant power to simultaneously boil 120000 kettles  as well as allowing more renewables onto the system these gas plants support the governments vision for reducing the carbon intensity of our energy grid  gas has half the carbon footprint of coal  more than that we have expertise in it drax ceo dorothy thompson  has developed and operated 3160 mw of gas assets in the past for intergen while a number of our engineers have worked across development construction and operation of gas projects we trade in it too so we know the market well in short a move into gas is one we are well suited too a secure economic future thanks to capacity market contracts our ocgt plants will have limited reliance on income from the energy markets in the future the capacity market is a government scheme designed to boost the uks energy security it does this by paying new and existing power plants a fixed price to be available to generate electricity in future winters the time of the year when demand is at its highest the price they are paid is determined by a competitive auction which allows government to secure as much capacity as it needs at the lowest price possible building new power stations requires substantial investment so having fixedprice contracts for power allows generators  like us  and their shareholders to invest in low carbon projects  safe in the knowledge that it will be economical to do so were aiming to secure 15year capacity contracts for one ocgt in england and one in wales within the next two years in the most recent capacity auction  the price was driven too low to justify a commitment to build the first two plants this doesnt mean development on the plants will stop critical development work will continue throughout 2017 and next december the plants will be reentered into the competition continued commitment to biomass our new power stations mark a new chapter for drax group but what they dont affect is our commitment to biomass drax power station is already generating a majority of its electricity using high density wood pellets  and the granting of the cfd means we can now finalise the coaltobiomass upgrade of half of the uks biggest power station and continue to invest in these assets with the right support we stand ready to complete the conversion of our north yorkshire site and run entirely on sustainablysourced biomass a study from engineering and design company arup found that after onshore wind converted biomass power plants are the most affordable largescale renewable power solution in the uk more than that the costs of undertaking this conversion have come down over the last few years however there is still room to bring this cost down further and we believe this needs to happen before we can fully convert drax power station we are as determined to achieve this as we have ever been our view has always been to ensure we provide power for a brighter future and our new power stations are the next step in doing this tags decarbonisation  gas  energy policy retooling for a postcoal future dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 6 december 2016 opinion the energy system in great britain is dramatically changing where it was once an industry dominated by coal  a predictable but dirty fuel now our power increasingly comes from renewables  this is a trend that will continue forcing more coal off the system drax has a role in this new future of renewable power we have already converted half of our power station in north yorkshire to run on renewable biomass  and now to support the needs of a system increasingly dominated by intermittent renewables like solar and wind we are developing plans to build four new stateoftheart flexible power stations  two in england and two in wales each will be 299 mw in size and powered by gas two of them could be producing electricity by 2020 its the next step for us in helping change the way energy is generated for a better future supporting a renewable energy mix wind and solar accounted for 15 of britains electricity mix between july and september from an installed capacity that has increased six fold in just six years biomass generation at drax rose from almost nothing to producing 20 the countrys renewable power in the first half of this year renewable energy has come on leaps and bounds this decade  perhaps more than anyone ever thought it would but as well as being much lower in carbon emissions renewables like wind and solar operate very differently to the fuels the gb grid was built on  theyre intermittent they only work when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing so when it suddenly becomes still or dark we need alternatives that plug the gap deliver power and boost security of supply biomass is one part of how we can do this using lower carbon fuels compressed wood pellets the biomass used at drax is a renewable fuel that can be used to generate baseload power that can also be dialled up and down to meet demand like coal it can also provide the ancillary services the grid needs to stay stable unlike combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plants which currently supply roughly 40 of the uks power and take 15 hours to start up from cold our new open cycle gas turbine ocgt plants are like big jet engines  generating electricity at full power in just 20 minutes from cold or 10 minutes from a warm standby its an incredibly fast turnaround and its what the energy network needs and because its a lower carbon fuel than coal with higher flexibility it will support the uks decarbonisation targets  by enabling more wind and solar on the grid we plan to use ocgts to plug the gaps that intermittency creates  essentially flicking the switch on and off at very short notice we anticipate they would run for no more than 1500 hours per year  only at times when the electricity system is under stress through supporting more intermittent renewables we also help to enable more coal off the system a better future for customers this new future will not only mean changes for us the generators but for customers too how energy is supplied and used is evolving and this is something that drax can support with the growing retail side of our business were a company with a wealth of expertise in renewable power and we can use this to help deliver electricity to business customers in a way that caters for todays market were already doing this with haven power  but now were extending this with the acquisition of opus energy  with this new company as part of drax group we will be able to grow our existing retail offering providing more of the uks growing businesses and established industrial and corporates not only with electricity but also with gas our retail offering will provide businesses with a route to sell the power they generate but do not need  plus expertise in how they can use energy more efficiently rd these are the first steps in a new chapter for drax there will be more research and development to come in the future well be looking at how we can extend our american compressed wood pellet supply business drax biomass  and at the potential for power storage systems if we want to continue to be a truly modern energy company

shareholders of opus energy the sellers for the purchase of opus energy for 340 million payable in cash on completion 3  completion of the acquisition is conditional on amongst other things the approval of draxs shareholders and the approval by the european commission of the cfd investment contract 2 awarded to drax by the uk government drax remains confident of approval of the cfd investment contract a circular is expected to be sent to shareholders in early 2017 convening a general meeting to vote on the acquisition completion of the acquisition is also expected to occur in early 2017 background to and reasons for the proposed acquisition the drax board of directors believes that the proposed acquisition provides a unique opportunity and is strategically and financially compelling opus energy will enhance draxs retail offering by combining the leading challenger small and medium enterprise sme business with haven powers strength in the industrial and commercial ic market the combination provides a robust platform for growth combining draxs and haven powers commercial capabilities and vertically integrated business model with opus energys established sme business and experience in both electricity and gas the acquisition leverages draxs flexible reliable renewable generation offering to create energy solutions for customers it also furthers draxs strategic ambition to diversify and improve the quality of its earnings whilst increasing the contribution of businesses with longterm growth opportunities key benefits of the acquisition acceleration of draxs retail strategy the acquisition provides access to a large and profitable sme focused retail business as the leading challenger brand in the sme market opus energy has demonstrated consistent sales and sustained growth in revenue and profitability 7 driven by customer satisfaction and high customer retention levels 85 april 2015 to june 2016 as at 31 march 2016 opus energy had a total of 129025 customers with 265418 meters and as at 30 april 2016 had a nondomestic electricity market share of 8 by meters count opus energys experience and proven success in the sme market combined with haven powers existing presence in the ic market represents an exceptional opportunity for drax to develop a platform for the growth of its retail business and significantly expand its customer base in the profitable sme sector accelerating the implementation of draxs retail growth strategy platform for growth over the last six years opus energy has trebled the number of meters contracted to 265418 as at 31 march 2016 and has driven profitability through its low cost business model and strong customer service proposition the acquisition provides the combined drax and opus energy groups the enlarged group with established routes to market for electricity and gas in the sme market and drax believes that the combination of opus energy and haven power can drive market share growth the sme market covers a broad range of customers  at the large end commercial users similar to ic customers whilst at the smaller end users similar to domestic customers the expertise and platforms shared by the combined business across both ic and sme markets will enable the enlarged group to deliver new products and services and enhanced market coverage compatible and complementary to existing retail business haven power was acquired by drax in 2009 as a credit efficient route to market for the large volumes of electricity produced by drax power and to monetise electricity sales and renewable certificates such as renewables obligation certificates rocs haven power has focused on growing market share in the ic market and currently has limited presence in the sme market where opus is well established the acquisition therefore complements haven power with its focus on a profitable separate and distinct customer segment it will also enlarge the route to market for draxs generation business and allow its retail business to achieve critical mass both in the nondomestic market and within the drax group opus energys expertise in sme electricity and gas sales combined with haven powers track record in the ic market and draxs umbrella of generationbacked power and commodity risk management is anticipated to provide distinct benefits in the future including the opportunity for an alternative hedge to commodity market exposure drax believes that opus energys expertise in different but related markets a challenger mentality and a shared customer service ethos with haven power together with its strong credit and risk management including commodity risk makes opus energy a good cultural fit with drax and contributes to the uniqueness of the acquisition opportunity haven ye

advances transition to broader higher quality longterm earnings draxs current strategy is to enhance quality of earnings and manage its exposure to commodity and power markets by broadening the range of markets in which it operates with improvements in magnitude and stability of net income the acquisition aligns with this strategy and is expected to deliver more broadly based high quality and predictable earnings today and in the longterm this will be driven by more revenue from electricity and gas sales in the sme market and opus energys high levels of customer retention 85 in april 2015 to june 2016 attractive financial returns opus energy is expected to deliver strongly enhanced margins to draxs retail business having experienced consistent midsingle digit ebit margins over the last three financial years opus energy is focussed on small sme and multisite corporate groups obtained via an extensive network of third party intermediaries tpis and is supported by a specialist customer service department the utilisation of tpis has helped to increase opus energys customer base and has established a broad sales network incentivised to maximise margin together with a simplified pricing model and quick customer revenue collection opus energy delivers significantly higher net margins per customer than those currently achieved by haven power in the higher volume low margin ic sector in addition over the last three financial years the difference between opus energys ebit and ebitda has remained consistently low reflecting the low capital intensity of its business the acquisition is expected to add both short and longterm financial benefits to drax drax expects to achieve a return on invested capital higher than its current cost of capital the addition of the wellestablished and growing opus energy business with its high profitability and high cash conversion is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings and cash flow in 2017 with opus energy having delivered reported ebitda of 337 million ebit of 328 million and cash from operations of 343 million in the financial year ended 31 march 2016 synergy potential the principal synergy will be the opportunity to benefit from the sourcing of wholesale electricity and gas from drax power over the past three years the costs associated with wholesale energy purchasing have been approximately 6 million per year by bringing these into the drax group drax expects to eliminate the majority of this cost following completion of the acquisition and replacement of these wholesale energy purchasing agreements the majority of opus energys power and gas wholesale supply requirements for new customers will be provided by drax power drax also expects the consolidation of commodity positions within the enlarged group to achieve some economies of scale opus energys capability within the gas market will give haven the ability to satisfy the increasing demand for dual supply from customers in haven target market at the smaller end of the size range the acquisition will also allow drax to drive traditional operational efficiencies over time opus energys it platform is expected to be able to absorb forecasted customer growth in the immediate future allowing drax the time and flexibility to create a sustainable it platform solution for the enlarged group in the medium term information on opus energy overview founded in 2002 opus energy is a business to business supplier of electricity gas and related services in the uk employing c870 people across northampton oxford and cardiff  by

turnover of 214 million corporate distribution channels are similar to the channels used for smes although greater reliance is placed on tpis with opus energy receiving corporate customer business from over 160 tpis renewables approximately 20 of electricity sourced by opus energy comes from small to midsized embedded renewable electricity generators such generators include wind turbines solar hydro and anaerobic digestion as at 31 march 2016 2197 meters relating to 483mw of export capacity were registered to opus energy for the financial year ended 31 march 2016 purchases of renewable generation totalled 59 million supply all of the gas and approximately 80 of the electricity sold by opus energy is sourced from wholesale supply agreements the remainder of the electricity is purchased from the small to midsized renewable energy generators described above it is intended that the wholesale energy purchase agreements will be replaced with arrangements to source electricity

management team who save for as set out above are expected to remain in their respective roles jonathan kini will continue to lead draxs retail business including opus energy and represent it at draxs executive committee level there will not be any changes to the drax board of directors following the acquisition current trading and outlook opus energy has continued to achieve strong growth in the number of meters supplied since 31 march 2016 electricity meter numbers exceeded 243000 by 31 october 2016 a 15 increase since the end of october 2015 with gas meters up by 29 to over 52000 resulting in a total meter count exceeding 295000 volumes supplied to customers in the first seven months of the financial year were also significantly up 17 in electricity and 22 in gas the average prices charged to customers over the period decreased as a result of lower commodity prices 3 reduction in average electricity price and 5 lower gas prices the combination of these factors has resulted in turnover for the first seven months of the financial year of 337 million which was 13 higher than the same period in 2015 in addition it is expected that ebit for the year ending 31 march 2017 will be generally in line with ebit for the year ended 31 march 2016 summary of the principal terms of the acquisition drax group plc drax group holdings limited drax group holdings and drax developments limited drax developments entered into an acquisition agreement the acquisition agreement with the sellers on 6 december 2016 in relation to the acquisition of opus energy for 340 million as part of the transaction a locked box mechanism has been agreed from 31 march 2016 to the date of completion of the acquisition this has the effect that economic ownership of opus energy and all profits earned passing to drax developments as at 31 march 2016 by preventing cash and cash equivalents being paid out of opus energy to the sellers or persons connected to them other than certain items agreed in the acquisition agreement including the dividend paid in april 2016 to compensate the sellers for this locked box interest of 8 per annum prorated for the actual period between 31 march 2016 and completion of the acquisition will be paid to the sellers at completion of the acquisition as at 31 march 2016 opus energy had net debt of 3 million following completion of the acquisition it is expected that the existing debt facilities of opus energy will be repaid and cancelled and any working capital requirements of opus using debt facilities and existing cash of the enlarged group the acquisition is expected to complete in q1 2017 the acquisition is conditional upon the approval by the european commission of the cfd investment contract awarded to drax by the uk government drax remains confident of approval of the cfd investment contract 2  the approval of the acquisition by drax shareholders which is required as the acquisition constitutes a class 1 transaction under the listing rules and the uk competitions and markets authority the cma not having made an order or a reference under the uk merger control regime such that the acquisition is prohibited from completing whilst the cma completes an investigation drax group holdings has agreed to guarantee the obligations of drax developments under the acquisition agreement certain of the sellers have given to drax developments customary warranties relating to opus energys business and warranties and covenants relating to opus energys tax position drax developments intends to arrange a warranty and indemnity insurance policy to provide cover up to 50 million in respect of those warranties and covenants subject to certain exceptions and limitations financing of the acquisition the consideration in respect of the acquisition will be financed entirely by a new acquisition debt facility of up to 375 million drax aims to maintain a credit rating in the bb range in line with its robust subinvestment grade business model this is consistent with the recent update from sp which reconfirmed the existing rating drax will consider potential options for its longterm financing strategy in 2017 integration drax is developing a detailed integration plan to combine opus energy into the enlarged group ocgt developments drax developments has entered into an agreement with watt power limited a developer of ocgt assets to acquire four 299mw ocgt development projects 1 ocgts are gasfired power plants that can be used by drax to provide flexible support to the electricity system to make up any shortfall in generation two of these projects are in an advanced stage of development and will participate in the 2016 t4 capacity market auction which begins today if either of these projects are awarded a capacity contract in this auction they will commence operations by 2020 supported by a 15 year capacity contract providing a very high level of base revenue certainty until at least 2035 this is consistent with draxs strategy to improve the quality of its earnings and deliver targeted longterm growth the other two projects require further development in anticipation of their targeted participation in the 2019 t4 capacity market auction the initial purchase price for all four developments is 185 million with the total consideration payable dependent on the clearing price in future capacity market auctions 4  the current total gross asset value of these assets is 73 million and as they are development assets there are currently no profits attributable to the assets the consideration will be funded from existing cash and assuming full development the investment in each project is currently expected to be in the range of 80 million to 100 million trading and operational performance since publishing its half year results on 26 july trading conditions in the markets in which drax operates have improved with higher power and commodity prices draxs second major planned biomass unit outage was completed over the summer the outage commenced earlier than planned due to a generator issue but has now been completed with no biomass related issues identified both biomass and coal operations are currently performing well although availability of biomass units over the period has been lower than forecast due to the generator issue noted above and an unplanned outage on fuel feed systems as noted above the cfd investment contract 2 awarded by the uk government remains subject to approval by the european commission and drax remains confident of approval of this contract taking these factors into account amongst others based on the current power prices and good operational availability for the remainder of the year alongside cfd revenues during december drax continues to expect full year ebitda 5 to be around the bottom of the range of current analyst forecasts 6  power sales contracted for 2016 and 2017 as at 28 november 2016 the power sales contracted for 2016 and 2017 were as follows 2016 2017 power sales twh comprising 189 149  fixed price power sales twh 189 132 at an average achieved price per mwh at 485 at 444  gas

swansea 2 the government introduced contracts for difference cfds which are longterm contracts to support the development of low carbon electricity generation to avoid an investment hiatus in the renewables sector before cfds become available under the enduring regime the government introduced a scheme for investment contracts under the final investment decision enabling fid enabling for renewables mechanism these were early cfds intended to provide greater confidence for investors in advance of the enduring cfd 3 as part of the locked box mechanism additional interest of 8 per annum prorated for the actual period between 31 march 2016 and completion of the acquisition will be paid to the sellers at completion of the acquisition 4 the range of consideration payable for the four assets is 185 million to 905 million dependent on the capacity market auction clearing price with the top of this range being associated with a capacity market clearing at 75kw the current 2016 auction price cap however the t4 auctions in 2014 and 2015 cleared towards the low end of the range of expectations at 1940kw and 180kw respectively 5 ebitda is defined as profit before interest tax depreciation including asset obsolescence charges and gains and losses on asset disposals amortisation and unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts 6 based on a range of market forecasts for ebitda published since 26 july 2016 of 135 million to 169 million these forecasts generally assume a cfd investment contract for draxs third biomass unit conversion with a strike price of 100mwh

contains inside information end tags gas  investors mind the gap dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 28 july 2016 opinion later today the edf board is expected to give the goahead for a new nuclear power station at hinkley this will provide some long overdue clarity for britains energy sector but we now need to quickly move on and make the right decisions to secure the best mix of power generation the drawn out debate around hinkley point c has diverted attention away from the sectors biggest challenge the government has made it clear that coal must come off the system by 2025 but coal still provides up to one fifth of the uks electricity and plugging that gap will be far from easy nor will doing so in a way that allows the country to meet its carbon targets while supporting the technologies that will deliver a modern energy system fit for the 21st century the governments intention is absolutely right but how does it intend to meet its target lets be clear a positive hinkley point c decision will play an important role in the necessary energy mix but will provide no silver bullet by most estimates when finally complete the nuclear plant will provide seven percent of the uks electricity needs however this isnt expected to come on grid much before 2030 and lets remember that in 2030 all but one of the uks current operating nuclear reactors are scheduled to be closed hinkley will therefore be replacing only some of the lost nuclear capacity not providing new energy to replace coal the last few years have seen a huge and welcome expansion in renewable sources of generation like wind and solar in the uk but they are intermittent and cannot fill the gap alone they still need to be supported by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine  a regular scenario on these shores as a form of lowcarbon baseload generation nuclear will undoubtedly be part of the answer however as weve already seen with hinkley point c planning funding and building new power stations can be a long and costly process  it has taken over a decade to reach todays decision in the past year alone more than 5 gigawatts gw of coal power generation hinkley point c is set to provide 32 gw  has come off grid well before the governments target of 2025  we dont have the luxury of time every day lost adds to the cost of addressing this challenge gas will play a role but many including the institution of mechanical engineers imeche have pointed out the huge number of gasfired power stations well need to plug the gap that ending coal creates  imeche estimates 30 will be required which is clearly unrealistic since the uk has built just four in the last 10 years at drax we have developed a solution to these challenges  we have used state of the art technology to upgrade some of our coal facilities to generate electricity from biomass in place of coal these facilities are already providing a reliable and flexible flow of electricity that also helps the uk meet its carbon targets the biomass we use is compressed wood pellets which perform in much the same way as coal and deliver an 80 co 2 saving our biomass facilities are already powering three million homes and with the right support we can double this helping to plug the energy gap that old plant coming off and delays to new build will leave us with using biomass is more costeffective than other renewables this was illustrated by a recent study from imperial college and economic consultancy nera when they analysed the hidden costs of the backup needed to meet demand created by intermittent renewables  our biomass facilities can provide all of the electricity services required to keep the uk electricity system stable providing these services is set to become increasingly important in the years ahead as a greater need to backup and balance the system will be required finding the right mix of power generation will not be easy but it is important we make every effort to get it right like hinkley point c biomass is not a silver bullet but it can and must play its part in helping the country transform to a lowcarbon future  tags gas  energy policy  biomass energy the true cost of replacing coalfired electricity generation dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 17 february 2016 opinion to make up for these closures the government is already planning to bring on new capacity a new gasfired power station will open at carrington this summer and were expecting to hear any day now that another nuclear power station will be created at hinkley point and of course more electricity from renewables must be added over the years ahead as we look to meet our go green targets in fact the government already has a plan in place to award contracts for new green energy off the back of three auctions over the next four years the first of them is due later this year drax understands that every one of those auctions is focused on offshore wind however new independent research published by nera economic consulting and imperial college london questions that single technology approach commissioned by drax group plc from leading economists the research reveals the true cost of the main forms of renewable energy  wind solar and biomass and the evidence shows that opening up these auctions to include other renewables could result in significant savings that could be passed on to consumers where could these savings come from renewables like wind and solar are vital but they are by their very nature intermittent that means other forms of power generation need to be available on standby at very short notice to meet the gap between supply and demand the costs of providing this standby electricity are passed on to consumers in their energy bills but crucially they are not reflected in how the government ranks the support that each type of renewable energy requires essentially the costs are hidden the neraicl research shows that if these hidden costs are added in the true picture is very different when the true costs are taken into account the governments preferred option  offshore wind  turns out to be the most expensive in fact the cheapest option is deploying new technology to existing power stations enabling them to use biomass  essentially replacing coal with compressed wood pellets all in all getting cheaper renewables into the mix could save consumers up to 22bn how support for renewables is already funded through a portion of your energy bill and bringing in a more costeffective mix reduces the support needed that is why we at drax are urging the government to look at the true costs of new renewable capacity and include us in the mix for new power contracts to do so would not only lead to a potential 2bn saving for consumers but replacing more coal with biomass gives the uk that reliable standby power we know we will need when other renewables cant deliver it using the latest technology weve already upgraded half of our power station to run on compressed wood pellets the jobs not done with the right support we want to carry on with the work were doing and help the government to achieve its target of getting coal off the system by 2025 tags gas  coal  energy policy  biomass energy  1 2 3 name
