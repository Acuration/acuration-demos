by output than any other company during the difficult winter ahead we will continue to optimise our biomass operations to ensure that more renewable power is available when the country needs it most as governments around the world increasingly look to introduce supportive policies for carbon removals drax is considering more exciting global opportunities for deployment of beccs advancing our ambition to be a leader in this critical technology drax is a growing international business at the heart of the green energy transition and we are accelerating our plans to invest billions of pounds in critical renewable energy and carbon removal technologies which could create thousands of jobs and generate the secure renewable power that this planet urgently needs pellets production the groups sustainable biomass pellet business has continued to support efforts to optimise biomass power generation and security of supply in the uk at times of higher demand this winter as outlined at the groups half year results in july 2022 there has been an incremental increase in costs in north america primarily in transportation and utility costs these cost increases have continued in the second half of 2022 and taken together with costs incurred in providing supplyside flexibility production costs for the business are expected to be higher in 2022 and 2023 these increased costs have been considered in an adjusted transfer price which was implemented in the second half of the 2022 drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce the cost of biomass but will balance this against the need to optimise its supply chain to deliver value for the group in the second half of 2022 drax commissioned a second 40kt satellite plant at russellville arkansas and in august 2022 drax acquired a 90kt pellet plant in princeton british columbia from princeton standard pellet corporation in addition following commissioning in the first half of 2022 both the demopolis alabama and leola arkansas pellet plants have continued to work towards full production and these four plants combined will add over 500kt of full production capacity investment in new production capacity drax has taken a final investment decision fid to invest in two new pellet production projects  a 450kt newbuild pellet plant at longview washington state including the development of a new port facility at this location and a 130kt expansion of its aliceville site alabama the combined investment in these three projects is expected to be in the region of 300 million inclusive of the effect of inflation on construction costs the development of the new plant at longview will provide the group with access to a new fibre basket and drax will also develop port infrastructure at the port of longview adding a fifth port to the groups north american supply chain with the opportunity to consolidate additional capacity in the future the us pacific northwest will be the groups fourth major fibre basket alongside the us south british columbia and alberta the new facility is expected to support further diversification of the groups fibre sourcing production and export capacity supporting sales into asian and european markets as well as ownuse the longview plant will be located next to the port of longview removing the need for rail or road transport of pellets significantly reducing transport time cost and carbon emissions the plant and port are expected to begin commissioning in 2025 the aliceville expansion includes upgrades to existing systems as well as new truck dumps and pelletiser units which will allow for an increase in the amount of sawmill residuals processed the additional capacity is expected to begin commissioning in 2024 generation the groups biomass pumped storage and hydro assets have continued to support uk security of supply providing power system stability at a time of higher gas prices and volatility on the power system drax has continued to optimise biomass generation across all four biomass units roc and cfd maximising generation in the winter based on system need and sustainable biomass supply in october 2022 due to a fall in gas prices and a consequential fall in shortterm power prices drax bought back certain existing forward sold power sales for 2022 on its roc units as a result drax has taken steps to reprofile and optimise biomass supplies between ownuse and thirdparty supply the groups pumped storage and hydro assets have performed strongly in the second half of 2022 providing a wide range of services to the system operator in support of system stability and renewable electricity generation contracted power sales as at 8 december 2022 drax had 283twh of contracted power sales between 2022 and 2024 on its roc and hydro generation assets at an average price of 1358mwh with a further 14twh equivalent of gas sales transacted for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward sales from roc units and highly correlated to forward power prices plus additional sales under the cfd mechanism contracted power sales 8 december 2022 2022 2023 2024 roc twh 107 111 61  average achieved  per mwh 902 1545 1590 hydro twh 03 01   average

over the past 12 months the cost of biomass in the european spot market has increased significantly with cargoes trading at over three times their historic average reflecting higher production costs in its own supply chain those of third parties and higher spot market prices drax has incurred additional costs in the second half of 2022 securing biomass to support its reliable and dispatchable generation accordingly the group currently expects its allin contracted cost of biomass for the uk generation business to be over 100mwh in 2023 this is above the historic average in part reflecting increased transportation and fuel costs associated with higher energy costs inflation and the lower value of sterling captured in the groups foreign exchange hedges these factors alongside the electricity generators levy egl see note below could make generation at certain times less economic and is expected to restrict the groups purchase of additional biomass cargoes at spot prices coal in july 2022 at the request of the uk government drax entered into an agreement with national grid to provide a winter contingency service to support the uk power system via its legacy coal units the units will not generate commercially for the duration of the agreement and will only operate if and when instructed to do so by national grid to date national grid has not instructed the units to run other than for testing the contract which covers the period october 2022 to march 2023 provides drax with a fixed fee for the provision of the units with national grid remunerating drax for costs including the coal and carbon associated with any generation draxs decision in 2020 to end coal generation supports the groups purpose of enabling a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and the transition to a flexible renewable generation model this has led to a c99 reduction in the groups scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions since 2012 and enabled drax to become the uks largest source of renewable electricity by output full year expectations reflecting these factors and the strong pumped storage and hydro performance in the second half of 2022 drax now expects that full year adjusted ebitda 1 for 2022 will be slightly above the top of the range of analyst expectations 2  subject to continued good operational performance and logistics for the remainder of the year the power sales reflected in the generation businesss contracted power sales book includes some exchange traded contracts with higher power prices resulting in an increase in collateral payments on these contracts in 2022 inclusive of these temporary cash outflows the group continues to expect net debt to adjusted ebitda 1 to be significantly below 2x at the end of 2022 electricity generators levy in november 2022 the uk government announced a windfall tax on renewable and lowcarbon generators the egl the egl which is expected to be implemented from 1 january 2023 represents a levy on power sales above a threshold and would apply to draxs three biomass units operating under the renewable obligation scheme and its run of river hydro operations but does not include the sale of rocs draxs cfd biomass unit is exempt along with cruachan pumped storage hydro power station and coal generation through november and december drax has engaged with the uk government regarding the precise details of the egl including uk investment allowances and the treatment of costs for dispatchable generators drax notes the uk governments reference to the potential for cost adjustments in its egl technical note published in november 2022 drax anticipates an update from government on these issues shortly bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs  uk drax has continued to commit development expenditure into its drax power station beccs project including continuing a frontend engineering design study the project would see the addition of post combustion carbon capture and storage ccs to two of the existing biomass units using sustainable biomass and adapting a proven technical solution from drax technology partner mitsubishi heavy industries by 2030 the project aims to permanently remove 8mt of co 2 per annum from the atmosphere in doing so drax power station aims to become one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide removals negative co 2  in the world the uk government recognises the important role which beccs has to play in delivering net zero requiring at least 5mt of co 2 removals per annum from beccs and other engineered greenhouse gas removal technologies by 2030 in august 2022 the uk government published a powerbeccs business model consultation which set a viable investment framework based on a cfd mechanism for both power generation and negative emission production in addition the uk government also set out the timeframe for the selection of track 1 powerbeccs projects stating that shortlisted projects could be confirmed from december 2022 with draft heads of terms for the contracts in the first half of 2023 track 1 projects are expected to commission in the mid2020s and along with expected clarity on the financial model this supports draxs aim to take a fid in 2024 and commission a first unit in 2027 with a second by 2030 the sixmonth extension of coal unit availability to march 2023 is not expected to impact the timing of a fid or intended commissioning date for the project site preparation works for beccs are ongoing and will continue following formal closure of the coal units in march 2023 on conclusion of the contract with national grid see above beccs  north america drax aims to realise its ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 primarily through the development of beccs including the development of beccs globally to realise these opportunities the group is progressing a number of work streams including regulation and policy technology fibre sourcing logistics and commercial over the course of the year the group has made good progress towards its ambition to deliver 4mt per annum of cdrs from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 with a primary focus on north america opportunities under consideration include two newbuild 300mw beccs power units each capable of producing 2twh of renewable electricity from sustainable biomass and each capturing over 2mt of co 2 per annum drax is also developing options for a pellet plant with beccs and the addition of beccs to existing generation assets including coaltobiomasstobeccs key considerations for these opportunities include proximity to sustainable biomass fibre ccs infrastructure regulatory support commercial potential and technology drax is evaluating a range of potential financial models for these projects which could include longterm power purchase agreements ppas longterm cdr offtake agreements and government investment frameworks as part of the development of these models in september 2022 drax announced a memorandum of understanding mou for the worlds biggest carbon removals deal with respira a carbon broker under the terms of the mou respira will be able to purchase up to 2mt of cdrs over a fiveyear period from draxs north american beccs projects regulation and policy development the regulatory environment for beccs in the us has continued to develop in 2022 with the inclusion of beccs as an eligible technology under the department of energy climate goals funding scheme and the increase in 45q support to 85 per tonne of co 2 captured under the inflation reduction act a recent national renewable energy lab report highlights that by 2035 the us could need c100mt of negative emissions from beccs to offset remaining carbon emissions in the power sector in addition recent state level developments in louisiana and california have both been supportive of the development of beccs the louisiana congress approved a bill that classifies biomass as carbon neutral and beccs as carbon negative similarly californias net zero strategy identifies beccs as a critical tool in the delivery of their climate targets the california air resources board which is responsible for climate policy has stated its intention to deploy 75mt of carbon removals including beccs by 2045 potential for significant growth in cdrs research by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the worlds leading authority on climate science states that cdr methods including beccs are needed to mitigate residual emissions and keep the world on a pathway to limit warming to 15 o c all the illustrative mitigation pathways assessed in the ipccs latest report use significant volumes of cdrs and specifically beccs as a key tool for mitigating climate change the ipcc believes that globally between 05 and 95 billion tonnes of cdrs via beccs will be required and the unbacked principles for responsible investment estimate that the cdr market could be worth over a trillion dollars by 2050 drax sees significant growth opportunities linked to beccs in north america and in order to progress these opportunities in 2023 expects to invest in development expenditure in the region of 30 million with a view to progressing these opportunities to a fid drax expects to update on progress with these opportunities in the first half of 2023 biomass sustainability delivering positive outcomes for people climate and nature are at the core of draxs business model and ensuring that drax only uses biomass which is sourced sustainably is central to this ambition biomass  when sustainably sourced  supports good forestry is a renewable source of energy and an important part of both uk and international renewable energy policy drax sources its biomass from wellestablished forestry markets in the us and canada as well as europe the main output from these markets is sawlogs which are processed for use in construction and manufacturing such as house building when used in this way these materials represent a source of longterm carbon storage and when the forest regenerates or is replanted these growing trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere drax supports these forest economies by providing incremental secondary revenues to forest landowners through the purchase of material which is not merchantable to a sawmill such as bark branches lowgrade wood and woody material from forest management activities thinning in addition to purchasing sawmill residues from sawmills these materials often have limited alternative uses in some instances where there would otherwise be no demand for these materials they are burned to reduce the risk of wildfire the spread of disease and to allow the forest to be replanted  this is especially prevalent in canada in the us south the periodic thinning of a forest helps improve the size and quality of sawlogs when the trees reach maturity the economic value of the timber produced and the carbon absorbed and stored as well as forest health and biodiversity if forests were not thinned the revenue from sawlogs would be reduced and landowners may consider other uses for their land such as agricultural crops and livestock farming the management of forestland to produce sawlogs ensures forests are growing vigorously absorbing carbon and forests remain a carbon sink forests in the areas where drax sources material are subject to national and regional regulation and typically supported by and independently monitored for compliance by forest certification schemes such as the forestry stewardship council  fsc 3  sustainable forestry initiative sfi and programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc drax supplements this regulation through its own biomass sourcing policy and checks of its supply chain with third party verification under the sustainable biomass program sbp other in december 2022 drax agreed a new 200 million credit facility with banks within its lending group the facility provides an additional source of

of 2022 we delivered a strong system support performance as our reliable renewable electricity continued to support uk energy security and helped to keep the lights on for millions of british homes and businesses we advanced our strategy to increase biomass pellet production with another 400kt of capacity commissioned from two new pellet plants in the us we also progressed the engineering design work for our uk beccs project which will deliver negative emissions for the uk and pioneer beccs technology at scale beccs is a vital carbon removals technology that the uns ipcc says is needed globally to achieve net zero with the right government support drax is ready to invest 3bn this decade in delivering vital renewable energy technologies including beccs a carbon removal technology that is costeffective but also the only one that generates reliable renewable electricity while removing millions of tonnes of co 2 from the atmosphere pellet production in april 2022 the group completed the commissioning of its 360kt plant at demopolis alabama and its 40kt satellite plant in leola arkansas the group is also currently constructing a second 40kt satellite plant at russellville arkansas allowing greater utilisation of lower cost sawmill residues whilst leveraging on existing infrastructure in the us southeast leola satellite plant under construction february

contracted to highquality thirdparties under longterm contracts with the balance available to drax to fulfil its ownuse requirements strong demand for forest products in construction and manufacturing markets continues to support good fibre residue availability with no material change in fibre cost drax notes an incremental increase in transportation costs in north america principally related to truck driver shortages and haulage costs the group continues to target a final investment decision fid on up to 1mt of new capacity in 2022 as part of its plans to increase total pellet production capacity to 8mt by 2030 generation in the uk the groups biomass hydro and pumped storage assets have continued to play an important role in security of supply providing stability to the uk power system at a time when higher gas prices and interconnector availability have placed the system under increased pressure to maximise renewable output at times of high demand the group is continuing to optimise biomass generation across all four biomass units at drax power station contributing to an increase in average achieved power prices the current power price environment increases the importance of appropriate investment to ensure good operational performance and availability and in march and april 2022 two biomass units underwent planned maintenance outages the units contracted positions in this period were bought back and the generation reprofiled with no net change in output over the roc compliance period draxs two legacy coal units were called into the balancing mechanism by the system operator in january for limited operations to support security of supply these shortterm measures helped to stabilise the power system during periods of system stress and did not result in any material increase in the groups total carbon emissions drax continues to expect to formally close these two legacy coal units following the fulfilment of their capacity market obligations in september 2022 but remains committed to supporting security of supply in the uk drax has recently been asked by the uk government to consider options for a limited extension of its coal operations and this remains under review generation contracted power sales the group has continued to add to its forward power sales book as at 22 april 2022 drax had 222twh of power hedged between 2022 and 2024 on its roc and hydro generation assets at an average price of 781mwh a further 18twh equivalent of gas hedges have been contracted in 2023 and 2024 for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward power sales from the roc units these contracts are highly correlated to forward power prices due to the optimisation of biomass generation in 2022 to support increased generation at times of

ukraine march 2022 drax previously sourced a small volume of russian and belarussian biomass which it has now removed from its supply chain the biomass that drax uses comes from stable sustainable markets in north america and europe and is sourced under longterm fixed formula contracts the removal of russian biomass cargoes from european supply chains has led to higher prices and lower availability in the small european spot market adding incremental costs and limiting the potential to source additional cargoes to support incrementally higher levels of generation in 2022 full year expectations reflecting these factors the group now expects that full year adjusted ebitda for 2022 will be around the top of the range of analyst expectations subject to continued good operational performance reflecting the improved outlook for adjusted ebitda the group expects net debt to adjusted ebitda to be significantly below 2x by the end of 2022 bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs

expect to take a fid in 2024 and expects the uk government to set out the process for selection and support for individual beccs projects such as beccs at drax power station during 2022 the development of beccs in the uk is supported by the groups plans to invest in the expansion of its biomass pellet production to deliver security of supply for the biomass volumes required for beccs which are expected to be underpinned by longterm contracts reflecting the market price of biomass the group is also continuing to develop options to deliver 4mt of negative co 2 emissions each year
