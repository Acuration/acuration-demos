andy koss drax ceo generation negative emissions pioneer drax group is continuing to develop groundbreaking carbon capture technologies through new partnerships and pilot projects putting uk businesses at the forefront of efforts to tackle the climate crisis drax has announced a new partnership with cleantech company econic technologies to explore the potential for using captured carbon dioxide from its biomass power generation to displace oil in the production of plastic products using its pioneering catalyst technology the partnership marks a major step towards enabling other businesses including in the automotive consumer and construction sectors to produce more sustainable polyurethane products econics catalyst technology could save as much as the equivalent of four million petrol cars worth of co 2 per year in this first market alone a new pilot plant has also been installed at the power station in north yorkshire by deep branch biotechnology to explore the feasibility of using draxs co 2 emissions to make proteins for sustainable animal feed products  technology which could enable the agricultural sector to decarbonise the rt hon kwasi kwarteng mp uk minister of state for business energy and clean growth visited the ccus incubation hub at drax power station to see for himself the pioneering work taking place drax was the first company in the world to announce an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 when ceo will gardiner spoke at cop 25 in madrid by applying beccs technology to its biomass generating units drax would remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces across the whole of its operations creating a negative carbon footprint for the company will gardiner drax group ceo said draxs ambition is to be carbon negative by 2030 having pioneered the use of sustainable biomass drax now produces 12 of the uks renewable electricity with the right negative emissions policy for beccs we can do much more removing millions of tonnes of emissions from the atmosphere each year by working with innovative tech companies like econic and deep branch biotechnology we are exploring new opportunities for clean growth which could be critical not only for beating the climate crisis but also in enabling a just transition protecting jobs across the north  delivering for the economy and the environment econic technologies will test the co 2 being captured from draxs successful one tonne a day beccs pilot at its own industrial pilot facility to assess its suitability for producing polymers used in polyurethane plastics click to download leigh taylor from econic technologies discussing the polyurethane products made using waste co2 with kwasi kwarteng mp and jason shipstone drax vp innovation dr rowena sellens econic technologies ceo said tackling climate change requires collaboration at all levels and the econic and drax partnership is a significant step forward as industries establish viable sustainable solutions this project has the scope to unlock the endless potential of co 2 across a vast number of sectors were confident that the co 2 being captured by drax will be suitable for use in our process meaning that we could move forwards to explore potential commercial opportunities together and accelerate the rollout of both our technologies and their positive climate impact click to download robert mansfield from deep branch biotechnology with samples of the protein it will produce using co2 from drax outside the companys new pilot plant within draxs ccus incubation area drax is also working with a number of businesses to deliver a zero carbon humber by 2040  co 2 from drax and other industrial emitters across the region could be captured transported and then stored under the north sea creating the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in line with uk government targets ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes econic technologies has pioneered a catalyst that allows bespoke amounts of co 2 to replace up to 50 of the traditional fossil fuelbased materials used in polymer production the polyurethanes produced have a wide range of uses such as in producing products for the automotive sector consumer goods home furnishings as well as insulation for buildings drax has installed storage cylinders to compress and store small quantities of the co 2 being captured from its successful beccs pilot which will enable econic to test its suitability for use in its processes these will be commissioned in the coming weeks once running they have the capacity to store up to 6kg of co 2 to enable testing to be carried out businesses across the humber region are supporting the zero carbon humber campaign  as the most carbon intensive region in the country  the humber would be able to make a more significant impact on addressing the climate emergency than anywhere else in the uk drax is continuing work with ccapture using funding from the governments ccus innovation fund for work to test and validate the beccs technology it is piloting this is due to be completed later this year by applying beccs technology to all four of its biomass generating units drax could capture and store 16 million tonnes or more of co 2 a year  a significant proportion of the uks target the uk committee on climate changes  net zero  report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 million tonnes of co 2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost
