support new pumped storage hydro plants the scottish governments cabinet secretary for energy neil gray msp has called on the uk government to give developers the certainty they need to invest in a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants a move which could create almost 15000 jobs and enable more renewable electricity to come online 16 august 2023 mr gray gave his backing to the industry while visiting draxs iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station near oban in argyll where the renewable energy giant is progressing plans to build a new 500m underground pumped storage hydro plant at the site expanding the uks pumped storage hydro capacity is crucial to integrating more wind and solar power onto the energy grid enhancing the nations energy security while tackling climate change pumped storage plants act like giant water batteries by using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from sources such as wind farms when supply outstrips demand these same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when the country needs it despite the critical need for them no new plants have been commissioned in the uk since 1984 with existing support schemes for other technologies unsuitable for the unique needs of these largescale infrastructure projects a report by kpmg found that a cap and floor mechanism like the regime used to incentivise investment in crossborder interconnectors could overcome the hurdles currently blocking investment in long duration storage technologies ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said to achieve a safe and secure net zero power grid we need to have a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants to balance our grid as the uk increasingly relies on intermittent renewables to keep our lights on there is a growing need for flexible power sources to plug the gap when the wind doesnt blow or the sun doesnt shine with its reversible turbines cruachan can also store excess power from scotlands wind turbines when they are generating more renewable electricity than we need helping to stop valuable green power from going to waste with the right support from the uk government drax will invest 500m to more than double cruachans generating capacity and support almost 1000 jobs across the supply chain during construction scottish government energy secretary neil gray msp said scotland is a global leader in the production of renewable energy which will play an increasingly important role in the transition to a net zero electricity system by 2045 however pumped hydro storage an important low carbon technology is currently ineligible for uk government support uk government inaction on this issue represents a significant obstacle to progress and risks failing to secure economic benefits such as creating thousands of good quality green jobs earlier this year a report commissioned by the influential trade body scottish renewables found that a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants in scotland could create almost 15000 jobs across the uk with draxs cruachan expansion generating almost half a billion pounds for the uk economy drax acquired cruachan alongside the galloway and lanark hydro schemes in 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible renewable power generation ends media contacts aidan kerr senior media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes drax applied for development consent from the scottish government under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 in may 2022 the plans received consent through the section 36 process in july 2023 the uk government has pledged to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in largescale longduration storage projects by 2024 a report by kpmg for drax found that a cap  floor regime was the standout solution to unlock private investment in the technology while incentivising system needs to be met efficiently no investment decision has yet been taken by drax and development remains subject to an appropriate regulatory framework among other considerations about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 19 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers in europe and asia customers drax supplies renewable electricity to uk businesses offering a range of energyrelated
