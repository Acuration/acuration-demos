power station new tech to tackle climate change could fuel uk economy postbrexit the innovative new technologies required to tackle the worlds greatest challenge  climate change  are creating economic opportunities for the uk to build on its position as a global leader in clean energy after brexit according to will gardiner drax group ceo 28 march 2019 speaking at the fuelling an economy fit for the future panel event at the british chambers of commerce annual conference in london on thursday march 28 mr gardiner said that we can create the zerocarbon economy that provides sustainable jobs and new opportunities in areas that have suffered industrial decline whilst at the same time meeting our climate change objectives will gardiner ceo drax group click to view high resolution photo mr gardiner said climate change is the greatest challenge the world now faces  but it is also creating major new investment and job opportunities which could be transformational after brexit globally by 2030 estimates show that the economic opportunity from creating a zerocarbon economy is upwards of 20 trillion  and the uk is ideally placed to drive the innovation required to take advantage of this were already leading the world when it comes to decarbonising power generation  weve done more than any other country to remove coal from the grid we must continue to drive innovation to deliver further social economic and environmental benefits through new technologies like carbon capture and storage smart meters and electric vehicles drax has converted two thirds of the uks biggest power station at drax in north yorkshire from coal to use sustainable biomass making it the biggest decarbonisation project in europe  delivering carbon savings of more than 80 wood pellet storage dome at drax power station centre and chimney left a beccs pilot is underway to show that 90 of the carbon dioxide emissions could be captured stored or reused click to view high resolution photo it now has ambitions to become the worlds first negative emissions power station by using bioenergy carbon capture and storage technology its beccs pilot plant is the worlds first to capture carbon dioxide from a 100 biomass feedstock  if it can be scaled up the power produced could help reduce the harmful gases accumulating in the atmosphere which cause climate change humber bridge mr gardiner explained that drax is working with the humber local enterprise partnership and other interested parties to explore the role carbon capture utilisation and storage ccus can play in turning the humber estuary into the worlds first netzerocarbon cluster by 2040 the humber is strategically important  it is the most carbon intensive industrial cluster in the uk the deployment of a new technology like ccus could be most transformational there  reducing carbon emissions extending the life of carbon intensive businesses protecting jobs and creating growth mr gardiner explained new technologies are already transforming the way we live and work  they are changing businesses and communities and have the potential to improve everyones quality of life as well as britains ability to compete in a global economy we are funding a phd at sheffield university  customer interaction with vehicle to grid systems using smart technology electricity demand could increase by around 25 compared to today as households and businesses switch to electric vehicles and electric heating we need to ensure that this electric revolution is powered by clean green electricity that provides a more sustainable economy for future generations drax group is also the uks biggest supplier of renewable electricity to businesses through haven power and opus energy its b2b energy supply businesses it supplies electricity to 396000 business premises and is looking at ways in which batteries smart technologies and evs can deliver economic benefits for its customers media contact ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 editors notes will gardiner is speaking at the british chambers of commerce annual conference panel event at 1140am on thursday march 28 2019 titled fuelling an economy fit for the future the british chambers of commerce includes 53 accredited chambers which make up its network representing tens of thousands of businesses of all shapes and sizes which employ almost six million people across the uk the new climate economy report by the global commission on the climate and economy states that analysis showed that bold action could yield a direct economic gain of us26 trillion through to 2030 compared with businessasusual and this is likely to be a conservative estimate beccs is a vital technology in the fight against climate change the royal society and royal academy of engineering have estimated that beccs could enable the uk to capture approximately 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that we will need to capture to become net zero power generation with beccs could also provide essential system services to the uk power grid meaning a more secure costeffective electricity system the humber is ideally located for accessing offshore stores for carbon dioxide in the north sea such as the endurance field which is roughly 60 miles off the coast as well as working with the humber lep drax is in discussions with the bbpa about the possibility of its members using the carbon captured to help keep the fizz in the drinks industry and it is looking at how its co 2 could be used in the creation of synthetic fuels drax power station is the largest renewable power generator in the country  producing enough renewable electricity for more than four million households the conversion of two thirds of the power station from coal to use sustainable biomass has played an important role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world whilst maintaining secure supplies for the millions of homes and businesses which rely on it more renewables like wind and solar are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and helping us to meet our climate targets  but flexible lower carbon generation is also vital for controlling the costs of maintaining a stable low carbon power system the ipcc recognised in its special report last year that to meet our climate change targets up to 85 of global power generation needs to come from renewables by 2050 this means the remainder will have to be provided by flexible sources which can support the system and help to keep costs down  such as biomass hydro pumped storage as well as high efficiency gas about drax drax groups ambition is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2600strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england b2b supply drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more information
