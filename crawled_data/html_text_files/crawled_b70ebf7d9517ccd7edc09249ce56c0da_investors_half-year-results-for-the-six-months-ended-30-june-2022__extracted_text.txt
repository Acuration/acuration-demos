in supporting the countrys security of supply we are accelerating our investment in renewable generation having recently submitted planning applications for the development of beccs at drax power station and for the expansion of cruachan pumped storage power station as a leading producer of sustainable wood pellets we continue to invest in expanding our pellet production in order to supply the rising global demand for renewable power generated from biomass we have commissioned new biomass pellet production plants in the us south and expect to take a final investment decision on up to 500000 tonnes of additional capacity before the end of the year as carbon removals become an increasingly urgent part of the global route to net zero we are also making very encouraging progress towards delivering beccs in north america and progressing with site selection government engagement and technology development in the uk and us we have plans to invest 3 billion in renewables that would
