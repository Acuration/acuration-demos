cruachan power station visit drax power station the history of the pylon how ancient egypt inspired a symbol of the modern world 16 february 2018 electrification pylons are one of the most recognisable and perhaps divisive symbols of great britains electricity system there are plenty who decry these metal giants as blotches strung across the countrys green and pleasant landscape but time has turned the 1930s designs of great britains pylons into something of a modernist classic even beloved by some  what pylons symbolise however is more than just the modernisation of the country in the first half of the 20 th century they also represent the promise of safe and reliable electricity for all there are now more than 90000 pylons across great britain and while the energy system continues to evolve pylons have changed little since they first went up outside edinburgh in the 1920s miesbach to munich the first successful attempt to transmit electricity over long distances using overhead wires took place in 1882 german engineer oskar von miller and his french colleague marcel deprez successfully transmitted 25 kilowatts of electricity 57km along a telegraph line the simple iron line transmitted a 200 volt current from a steam enginepowered generator near miesbach to the glass palace of munich where it was used to power the motor for an artificial waterfall the line failed a few days later and even though it may be a world away from todays 800000 volt ultrahigh voltage transmission lines this first trial laid the foundation for the way we move energy today egypt to edinburgh jump to 1928 and there was something new arising on edinburghs horizon the first grid tower was erected here on july 14 th as part of the recently established central electricity boards ambitious project to create a national gridiron  connecting 122 of great britains most efficient power stations to consumers was a mission that required 4000 miles of cables mostly overhead sir reginald blomfield was called in to tackle this grand challenge blomfield adopted a design submitted by the american firm milliken brothers for the grid towers that would crisscross the country a staunch antimodernist  as he made clear in modernismus his attack on modern architecture  blomfield looked to ancient egypt to name his steel towers in egyptology a pylon is a gateway with two monumental towers either side of it  these represented two hills between which the sun rose and set with rituals to the sun god ra often carried out on the structures it was an epic name to match the grand ambitions of creating a national grid by september 1933 the last of the initial 26000 pylons that made up the national grid were installed  less than a third of the 90000 that make up the system today the grid was now ready to operate on time and on budget around the world to underground as the energy system continues to evolve great britains pylons are changing too in 2015 the national grid unveiled a new danishdesigned pylon that shifts away from the classic industrial tower to a tframed skilift style model designed to minimise the visual impact of the pylons on the landscape another approach also being adopted is burying cables underground the process of digging tracts and burying cables for thousands of miles could cost as much as 500 million but could help preserve areas of natural beauty while ensuring the whole country has access to the safe and reliable electricity it has come to expect as with all change these announcements have caused a surge in nostalgia for the pylon remembered from childhood car journeys across the country around the globe electricity pylons are now ubiquitous and are being pushed to new technological limits in 1993 greenland became home to the longest stretch of overhead powerline between pylons in the ameralik span  while chinas zhoushan island overhead powerline tie set the record for the worlds tallest pylons in 2010 with two 370meter towers despite the advancements its notable how little these structures have changed from the those first installed around the world the proposed humanoid sculptures of icelandic architecture firm choishine bare a resemblance to the original skeletal towers of the 30s and it shows just how successful those original pylons have been at delivering muchneeded electricity to homes and
