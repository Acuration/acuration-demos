electrification the practice laps are over the lights have signalled and the race is well under way in the electric vehicle ev market some companies got off to a great start but teams from all the worlds biggest car makers have plans to catch up and take the lead automanufacturers know fossil fuelpowered cars will eventually be a thing of the past but which companies and countries are actually putting plans into action to shape the future of road transport money follows ambitions today the ev market is relatively small of the 90 million vehicles sold each year evs account for just 1  with sales in 2017 of 100000 across its three models tesla was the dominant player in the field thanks in part to ample press coverage and its outspoken ceo but also its sporty design and performance setting it apart in a class typically concerned with economy and efficiency to put that into perspective nissans leaf the bestselling ev of all time has only ever sold around 300000 cars having launched in 2010 compare these figures to the 1 millionplus ford fseries pickup trucks bought last year  almost entirely in the us alone  and it highlights just how far the ev market has to grow before it begins to push out internal combustion engines ices tesla gigafactory 1 in nevada click to view but a massive surge in ev adoption has long been expected  the international energy agency forecasts a 24 increase by 2030 to 13 million ev sales  the fuel behind this growth includes improved performance a greater range of choice lowering prices and increased marketing spending for much of this the onus falls on manufacturers however they will need the support of governments electricity grids and energy suppliers to ensure the charging infrastructure required is in place to support the forecast growth making evs massmarket will require significant spending from all parties automakers globally now plan to invest as much a 90 billion into evs and battery technology according to reuters  from the us to japan germany to china car makers are laying out the timeline for ev investment and sales  manufacturer  commitment  date tesla targets annual sales of 500000 2018 volvo will no longer sell cars solely powered by ices 2019 nissan 20 of sales will be zeroemission vehicles 2020 jaguar land rover all new models will be electric 2020 ford 40 of global models will be electrified hybrid and ev 2020 tesla targets annual sales of 1 million 2020 daimler targets annual sales of 100000 2020 subaru will launch first full ev model 2021 ford will have 13 new electrified models 2021 tesla targets sales of 100000 electric heavyduty lorries 2022 porsche 50 of new sales will be electric 2023 volvo targets 1 million total sales of evs 2025 daimler 1525 of cars produced will be electric 2025 bmw 1525 of sales will be electric 2025 volkswagen will have 30 new evs accounting for 25 of sales 2025 ford 70 of vehicles sold will be electrified hybrid and ev 2025 renaultnissanmitsubishi alliance targets sales of 2 million medium sized and suv evs 2025 general motors targets sales of 1 million evs 2026 aston martin targets 25 of sales to be electric 2030 honda targets 23 of sales to be electrified 2030 sources bmi research  the european federation for transport and environment  driving electric transformation consumer demand is one driving force in ev adoption but its not the only one government action will play a pivotal role in forcing the move away from ices to hybrid and electric vehicles policy makers see the phase out of petrol and diesel cars as key to reaching paris agreement goals and many have begun to set ambitious dates for banning new sales of fossil fuelpowered vehicles date of ban on new sales of petrol and diesel vehicles countries 2025 norway  2030 india  denmark  ireland  israel  netherlands  germany  iceland  slovenia  sweden  2035 united kingdom  2040 france  taiwan  sri lanka  2050 costa rica  ban on all nonemission free vehicles  resolution not yet passed  under consultation to move from existing 2040 deadline and to add hybrids china the worlds largest car market  is also in the process of building a timeline to eliminate fossil fuelpowered vehicles having banned 553 car models in january as part of its efforts to curb air pollution  the country is also subsidising ev purchases and offers a potentially huge market for electric car makers thats if they can muscle past domestic manufacturers  which accounted for more than half of all evs produced globally last year ev charging in china urban environments are the most affected by exhaust pollution and as a result individual cities are setting their own more ambitious standards for vehicles paris mexico city madrid and athens have set 2025 as the date for a ban on all diesel vehicles from their city centres in the interest of public health visible air pollution over mexico city automanufacturers know they need to change regardless of what some politicians may say  and this will mean tough competition to bring the latest and best electric and hybrid cars onto the market but ultimately it wont just be rivalry that advances evs further into the mainstream governments the energy industry and car companies will need to work together to ensure infrastructure and policies are in place to move completely away from the petrol and diesel models that have driven the roads for so long this means rolling out ev charging infrastructure to facilitate millions of passengers getting from a to b as efficiently as they can with ices albeit with lifestyles changes and commuting habits to allow for longer fuelling times  electricians housebuilders employers retailers and local authorities will need to get busy retrofitting domestic public and commercial properties so people can charge up when their vehicles are idle and it requires smart regulation smarter power grids new services from energy companies automation  investment in storage and behind the meter technology to ensure the necessary power is available when and where its needed the race may be on and there will be winners and losers along the way but its one many
