lewis e4tech 5 december 2018 carbon capture read the full report pdf the global energy revolution as a contribution to cop24 this report informs the debate on decarbonising the global energy system evaluating how rapidly nations are transforming their energy systems and what lessons can be learned from the leading countries across five energy sectors it was commissioned by power utility drax group and delivered independently by researchers from imperial college london and e4tech clean power several countries have lowered the carbon content of their electricity by 100 gkwh over the last decade the uk is alone in achieving more than double this pace prompted by strong carbon pricing china is cleaning up its power sector faster than most of europe however several asian countries are moving towards highercarbon electricity germany has added nearly 1 kw of renewable capacity per person over the last decade northern europe leads the way followed by japan the us and china in absolute terms china has 25 times more renewable capacity than the us fossil fuels twofifths of the worlds electricity comes from coal the share of coal generation is a key driver for the best and worst performing countries in clean power coals share of electricity generation has fallen by onefifth in the us and onesixth in china over the last decade denmark and the uk are leading the way some major asian nations are backsliding many european citizens pay out 100 per person per year in fossil fuel subsidies substantially more than in the us or china these subsidies are growing in more countries than they are falling electric vehicles in ten countries more than 1 in 50 new vehicles sold are now electric china is pushing ahead with nearly 1 in 25 new vehicles being electric and norway is in a league of its own with 1 in 2 new vehicles now electric thanks to strong subsidies and wealthy consumers there are now over 45 million electric vehicles worldwide two thirds of these are battery electric one third are plugin hybrids china and the us together have twothirds of the worlds electric vehicles and half of the 300000 charging points carbon capture and storage sufficient storage capacity has been identified for global ccs rollout to meet climate targets but largescale co 2 capture only exists in 6 countries worldwide 5 kg of co 2 can be captured per person per year the planned pipeline of ccs facilities will double this but much greater scaleup is needed as this represents only onethousandth of the global average persons carbon footprint of 5 tonnes per year efficiency global progress on energy intensity is mixed as some countries improve efficiency while others increase consumption as their population become wealthier residential and transport changes over the last decade are mostly linked to the global recession and technological improvements rather than behavioural shift brics countries consume the most energy per  of output from industry this is linked to the composition of their industry sectors ie greater manufacturing and mining activity compared to construction and agriculture continued  view pdf i staffell m jansen a chase e cotton and c
