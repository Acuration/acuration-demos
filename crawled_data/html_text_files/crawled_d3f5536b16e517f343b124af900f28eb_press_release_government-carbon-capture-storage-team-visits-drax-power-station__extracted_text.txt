policymakers and government officials has visited drax power station near selby in north yorkshire to learn more about the uks largest power station and its plans to pilot new carbon capture technology the delegation from the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis spent the day with the research and innovation team at drax and also met with drax power ceo andy koss to learn more about its bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot  the first of its kind in europe if successful the project could make the renewable electricity produced at drax power station carbon negative andy koss drax power ceo said this project is the next step in our journey to extend the future of the plant protect jobs and deliver clean reliable power for millions of households and businesses with our extensive engineering skill and expertise we have already upgraded half of the power station from coal to use biomass transforming the business to become the largest decarbonisation project in europe if successful this beccs technology could enable us to achieve negative emissions on the biomass generating units at the power station and also help the uk to meet its global climate change targets the demonstration project will see drax partner with leedsbased ccapture and invest 400000 in what could be the first of several pilot projects undertaken at drax power station to deliver a rapid lower cost demonstration of beccs drax plans to convert a fourth generating unit from coal to biomass this summer and is also progressing plans for repowering its two remaining coal units with gas power generation and batteries pictured are steve drayton deputy head of research and innovation drax carl clayton research and innovation engineer drax andy koss drax
