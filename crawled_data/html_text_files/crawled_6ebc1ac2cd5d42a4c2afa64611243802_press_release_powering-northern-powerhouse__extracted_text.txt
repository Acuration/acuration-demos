region have been brought together by the northern powerhouse partnership npp to give their insight into the future of the regions energy industry andy koss drax power ceo  a member of the npp board  chaired by george osborne  has been leading a series of workshops with business leaders across the north to help determine the best way the regions existing energy infrastructure can be reused and repurposed as well as the economic opportunities associated with the transition to a low carbon future and how innovation could transform the regions energy sector drax power station based near selby in north yorkshire is the uks largest  generating 7 of the countrys electricity having upgraded half of the power station to be fuelled by sustainable biomass compressed wood pellets from coal it is now the largest single site renewable electricity generator in the country supplying 17 of the uks renewable power  enough for four million homes andy koss said the north has a proud history of being the countrys powerhouse and should continue to play a central role in driving the uks energy strategy these workshops have demonstrated the deep knowledge skills and expertise the region has in energy and the role technologies such as bioenergy offshore wind and nuclear power could play in delivering the governments industrial strategy he added the potential for new technologies such as electric vehicles and hydrogen gas to help reduce the carbon footprint of our cities is i believe a huge opportunity for the region  not just in terms of potential jobs and the economic benefits but also the positive environmental impacts associated with decarbonisation the workshops are part of the work the northern powerhouse partnership is leading on for its second report  prime capabilities in the north  which will include key recommendations on energy as well as advanced manufacturing health innovation and digital henri murison director of the northern powerhouse partnership said the energy workshops have provided the northern powerhouse partnership with real insight into the future of the norths energy sector the unrivalled expertise in the region is one of the norths great strengths and we will be looking in more detail at the opportunities and ideas that have come out of these sessions and how they can have a significant impact on the uk economy the energy workshops andy koss has led have taken place in york hull warrington lancaster and carlisle the findings from these sessions will be used in the development of the northern powerhouse partnerships second report due to be published in september ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media relations e email protected t 01757 612165 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 01757 612848

drax generated almost 500 million for the regional economy and 12bn for the whole of the uk  our biomass supply chain runs from coast to coast  tyne hull immingham and liverpool  with an average of 17 biomass trains arriving per day over a sixday working week in order to supply us with the pellets needed to generate and supply enough renewable electricity for 4 million homes the northern powerhouse is the hub for high tech engineeringinnovation in renewables so will remain vital to future energy needs and developing a low carbon economy about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used as the uk moves to a low carbon future drax operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies 7 percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax biomass  based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests haven power  based in ipswich providing businesses with electricity opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff providing electricity and gas to businesses billington bioenergy  based in liverpool with depots across the
