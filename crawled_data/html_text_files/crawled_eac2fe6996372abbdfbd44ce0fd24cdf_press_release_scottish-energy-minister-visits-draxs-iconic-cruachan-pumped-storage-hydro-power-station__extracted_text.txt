power station visit drax power station scottish energy minister visits draxs iconic cruachan pumped storage hydro power station scotlands energy minister paul wheelhouse visited draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station to see firsthand the essential role it plays in delivering flexible power to support the decarbonisation of the electricity system 24 october 2019 the iconic cruachan facility in the western highlands can generate flexible power within seconds during times of peak demand helping to keep the lights on for tens of thousands of households it also provides crucial system support services to the electricity grid enabling more renewables such as wind and solar to come onto the network mr wheelhouse said it was fascinating to learn more about how important this unique power station is in supporting the energy system and just how quickly it can respond to changes in demand  delivering the power needed in as little as 30 seconds this kind of flexibility and resilience helps to support the growth of renewables enabling further decarbonisation of the energy system as we strive for net zero carbon emissions in scotland by 2045 the real value the technology adds every day to our energy system is the reason why we and industry partners continue to call on uk ministers to take action to ensure that they provide the revenue certainty developers need to underpin further proposed investments in pumped storage hydro capacity in scotland lr drax ceo generation andy koss scottish energy minister paul wheelhouse overlooking the turbine hall inside cruachan power station andy koss  draxs ceo generation  said  cruachan has been providing stability to the power network since 1965 when the turbines were first installed inside the hollowedout mountain as we move to a system with more renewables the services that cruachan provides are becoming more essential im incredibly proud of the work done by the team and the role they play in driving decarbonisation and economic growth as we continue to deliver the power relied on by thousands of homes and businesses cruachan is one of four pumped storage hydro stations in the uk and has a capacity of 440 mw  enough to power more than 90000 homes during peak demand  built on the shores of loch awe in argyll and bute it was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on this scale to be built in the world  the turbine hall is located 1 km within the hollowedout mountain of ben cruachan and houses four generators  supplying a range of vital balancing and ancillary services to the grid such as frequency control spinning and operating reserves helping to maintain secure power supplies drax acquired cruachan along with hydro facilities in galloway and lanark and a biomassfromwaste plant at daldowie near glasgow at the end of last year scotland is targeting net zero carbon emissions by 2045  five years ahead of the rest of the uk top image caption lr scottish

power stations in strategic locations across the country  from scotland to the south east coast  on 31 st december 2018 the plant has four primary modes of operation and can deliver a range of balancing and ancillary services cruachan acts responsively by generating electricity to meet peaktime demand it can achieve full load in 30 seconds and can maintain its maximum power production for more than 16 hours if necessary cruachan s hollow mountain visitor centre is also a popular tourist desti n ation and was recently named by visitscotland as one of its top visitor attractions  guided tours are available through the cruachan website link and school groups go free to encourage the next generation of engineers this year drax recruited five apprentice engineers for its scottish hydro sites  further boosting stem education and local skills about drax drax groups ambition is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2600strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage hydro facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england for more information visit wwwdraxcom customers drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy
