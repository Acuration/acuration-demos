careers forests sustainability and biomass  the experts view matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 6 october 2016 opinion it was a forestry catastrophe that first inspired matthew rivers interest in forests dutch elm trees an iconic part of the uk landscape for over 250 years were becoming infected with a fatal and fastspreading disease the race was on to save them a schoolboy in north london at the time rivers joined the after curricular school team tasked with saving its trees  first by injecting them with insecticide and when that didnt work by felling and replanting them it was an early foundation in how forests work and the challenges of keeping them healthy decades later rivers is director of corporate affairs at drax its a role he finds himself in following a career as a forester helping to manage forestry businesses and supporting the setting up of wood product manufacturing plants his own estimation of his working life is a humble one however i think im probably a failed farmer he says a forester always plants in hope rivers studied forestry at university in scotland before taking up jobs in the forestry industry across the uk uruguay and finland working in this industry he says is one that requires patience in the uk were talking about 30 or 40year growth cycles the trees i planted at the start of my career are only just coming to maturity now he explains but more than the long investment of time being a forester relies on faith a forester always plants in hope he says when a forester plants a tree he or she most commonly does not know who the end customer will be so when the call came from drax for a forestry expert to help guide the company through an important transformation  upgrading the power station from coal to biomass  the challenge was one he was ready to take drax already had ambitions of converting three boilers to run on biomass that would mean consuming tonnes of compressed wood pellets he says the business needed a supply and rivers was drafted in to set this up as part of the supply solution and chaired by rivers drax set up drax biomass  a pellet manufacturing business in the usa that makes and supplies compressed wood pellets to drax power station  setting up its own manufacturing plant not only means drax needs to rely on fewer external suppliers but also that it can use the learnings about the technologies the economics and the sourcing of the process to continually hone its supply chain to operate responsibly and receive governmental support drax has to be sustainable and this is particularly important when it comes to where and how it sources its fuel this comes with its own challenges no universal definition of sustainability to my understanding there is no universal definition of sustainability says rivers so how do you proof your business for an unclear entity at its heart sustainability is about not doing anything today that would prejudice doing the same thing for the next generation or generations to come a responsibly managed forest is one that is as healthy productive diverse and useful in 100 or 500 years time as it is today they key to this is to think of forests as a whole rivers explains think about a single tree  you fell it and use it to heat your home over one winter but its going to take perhaps 30 years for that tree to grow back he says what do you do for the next 30 years in a sustainably managed forest you have all different ages of tree represented  one thirtieth devoted to each age and when you use an older tree to warm you in winter you plant a replacement that way for every year youll have trees reaching maturity ready to provide your power its a cycle that if managed responsibly keeps delivering a useful resource as well as maintaining the health of the forest rivers continues sustainability is the very nature of what a forester does because if we dont take care of our forests and ensure we have a crop to harvest year after year we lose our livelihood becoming a private forester two decades ago rivers completed a loop he started decades ago amidst the dutch elm crisis and became a forest owner himself in scotland he bought and now manages his own private forest weve had kids birthday parties weve dug out a pond we harvest chanterelles in the autumn  theres a millennium capsule buried somewhere he says its not only a family heirloom its a place for him to exercise a passion  maintaining and managing a responsible and healthy forest tags biomass energy  sustainability  wood pellets  careers my four principles of leadership dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 2 june 2016 opinion 1 have vision the first task of any leader is to have the vision for the future of their organisation this doesnt mean creating it on his or her own it means that a leader needs to be ready to challenge assumptions embrace change have courage and be brave when necessary when i think about this im reminded of the challenges we faced when we decided to upgrade our power station in yorkshire to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal  in delivering this strategy we faced three major hurdles nobody had ever done it before there was no technical solution readily available we had to create one ourselves using our own engineering knowhow there was no supply chain for the compressed wood pellets we would need to build our own civil servants doubted we could deliver it and regardless there was no government support for our vision because we had been so thorough i knew that we had our facts right in particular i was certain that we could produce the same amount of electricity while cutting carbon by 80 per cent the only logical conclusion was to drive forward it would never have happened if we hadnt been confident about our vision im particularly proud of the way drax engineers have developed a worldleading technology to transform the way the uks largest power station works without any interruption to supply in 2015 we generated 79 of the uks electricity or 267 twh from the one single site in north yorkshire according to data in our annual report and from the department for energy and climate change decc  that included 115 twh of compressed wood pellet power  equal to around 13 of the uks total renewable electricity up from 12 a year earlier or enough to meet the needs of around three million homes one in every 10 in the country from the fourth quarter of 2015 we began generating more electricity from sustainable biomass than from coal theres still a long way to go  at least three years if not more  before we can say our work is done but its already a massive achievement 2 always be open and approachable everyone in your organisation needs to understand what youre seeking to achieve and why for me being open is also about being honest approachable and interested in other views not just as an individual but as an entire organisation as president obama said while addressing young people on his recent visit to the uk seek out people who dont agree with you and it will also help you to compromise in some instances you need to push forward while in others you need to compromise that means a leader needs to trust in their vision while being open to challenges at drax we know our employees have integrity and can be trusted at all levels people need to have highly sensitive information to do their job this can be a very challenging issue for a company listed on the london stock exchange where a leak could do very serious damage indeed when we first listed in 2005 this led to boardroom disagreement on one side directors wanted to restrict information to a minimum because they felt this was the best way to limit risk as chief executive i strongly disagreed with this obviously some things need to be kept confidential but i really believe that it is important for a leader to be open in fact i think one of the key strengths of the group is our open and frank culture we have never suffered a significant leak in my time in charge 3 together were stronger a leaders role is not to take all the decisions leadership is about getting the best out of everyone around you that includes the team you work with on a daytoday basis the wider team across the whole organisation and all your stakeholders you never know in advance where the best idea is going to come from if youre recruitment is right youre surrounded by highly qualified experts at drax i encourage colleagues to have their say i am surrounded by people who are willing and able to challenge my views and those of my colleagues on our executive committee i would be silly not to listen to them we all are more engaged when were involved in finding the solution to a problem than when were merely dictated to central business district gaborone botswana 4 drive the future no leader can wait for events to unfold you have to drive your organisation forward in order to shape its future in my opinion indecision is the worst decision of all in my 20s i worked for the national development bank of botswana in gaborone the bank provided farmers with short term loans to buy seed to grow their crops one day a farmer who was clearly very poor turned up to see the loan officer who shared an office with me he hadnt received his loan because the loan officer hadnt processed his application in time so there were no seeds to plant and no crops for the next season for years i blamed the loan officer for the farmers misfortune however from my practical experience as a leader i now know better the loan officers manager who was afraid to reprimand him because he came from a privileged local family should have had more courage because they couldnt decide how to handle the situation the company and the community it served suffered leadership is not an exact science and nothing can compare to experience for the sake of future generations the world needs to urgently move away from coal unlike the manager in gaborone who jeopardised a farmers future my drax colleagues and i know our leadership is driving the future towards the
