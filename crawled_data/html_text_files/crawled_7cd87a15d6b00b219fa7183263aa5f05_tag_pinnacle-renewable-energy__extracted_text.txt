remained stable over the last 20 years increasing slightly from 408 million ha to 416 million ha an increase of 79 thousand hectares this area represents 796 of the total land area in 2020 up from 781 in 2020 the total area of forestland and woodland was 86 of the catchment area in 2020 with farmland making up 13 and urban areas 1 this land base can be considered to be heavily forested and dominated by timberland figure 1 land use type  alabama cluster the timberland area is classified by growth rate potential capable of achieving a minimum of 057 m 3 hayear more than 95 of the timberland area is in private ownership this proportion has remained stable since 2000 as shown in figure 2 figure 2 timberland ownership profile  alabama cluster the total standing volume the amount of carbon stored in the forest area has increased by 115 million m 3 since 2000 an increase of 30 most of this increase has occurred since 2010 with 90 million m 3 added to the inventory since this time reflecting the maturing age class of the forest resource as it passes through the peak growth phase almost all of this increase has been in the softwood pine forest area with a combined increase of 86 million m 3 since 2010 pine sawtimber and chipnsaw both increased by 46 since 2010 and pine pulpwood by 25 over the same period suggesting that the average tree size is getting larger as the forest matures figure 3 standing volume by product class  alabama cluster one measure of the sustainability of harvesting levels is to compare average annual growth against removals this comparison gives a growth drain ratio gdr where removals are equal to or lower than growth a gdr of 1 or more this is a measure of sustainability where the ratio falls below 1 this can indicate that harvesting levels are not sustainable in the longterm figure 4 shows that all pine product classes have a positive gdr since 2010 in particular the pine pulpwood gdr ratio is in excess of 2 suggesting that there is a substantial surplus of this product category by contrast the hardwood gdr for both sawtimber and pulpwood are both lower than 1 suggesting that harvesting levels for hardwood species should be reduced until growth can recover figure 4 growth drain ratio by product class  alabama cluster figure 5 shows the maturing age class of the forest area charting the change in annual surplus and deficit in each product class the trend shows that harvesting of pine sawtimber from 2000 to 2008 represented a deficit of growth compared to harvesting removals this indicates an immature forest resource with a low quantity of forest categorised as sawtimber therefore harvesting volume in mature stands outweighed the growth in midrotation stands as the forest aged and more standing timber grew into the sawtimber category the surplus of annual growth compared to removals increased sawtimber growth in 2020 was 3 million m 3 higher than in 2000 the surplus of pine pulpwood has remained positive and has increased substantially from 3 million m 3 in 2000 to 65 million m 3 in 2020 despite harvesting levels increasing slightly over this period figure 5 annual surplusdeficit of growth and removal by product class  alabama cluster biomass demand began in 2008 at a very small scale representing just 05 of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area from around 2013 it began to increase and reached peak in 2015 with a total demand of 724000 tons of pulpwood in that year representing 81 of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area after that time demand for pulpwood declined as pellet mills switched to mill residuals the latest data on pulpwood demand shows that the biomass sectors made up just 28 of total pulpwood demand in 2020 with just over 216000 tonnes of total demand this demonstrates that the biomass and wood pellet sector is a very small component of the market in this region and unlikely to influence forest management decision making as shown in figure 6 figure 6 pulpwood demand by market  alabama cluster pine pulpwood stumpage prices have declined significantly since a peak in 2013 falling from an annual high of 946 when demand was strongest to just 412 in 2020 as demand for pine pulpwood declined in 2020 pine sawtimber prices have seen a similar decline from a high point in the early 2000s to a plateau from 2011 onwards sawtimber stumpage more than halved in value over this period from 49 per ton to 22 per ton this can have a significant impact on forest management objectives and decision making figure 7 stumpage price change by product category  alabama cluster detailed below are the summary findings from hood consulting on the impact of biomass demand on key issues in the alabama cluster catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows that total timberland area has held steady and averaged roughly 4172000 hectares in the alabama cluster catchment area since alabama pelletsaliceville started up in late2012 more importantly planted pine timberland the predominant source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production has increased more than 75000 hectares 49 in the catchment area since alabama pellets startup in 2012 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last two decades however the evidence is inconclusive as to whether increased demand attributed to bioenergy has caused or is responsible for those changes clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region both of which are longstanding widely used methods of harvesting timber timbermartsouth tms data shows that the prevalence of thinnings temporarily increased in the alabama cluster market from 20072013 due to the weakening of pine sawtimber markets specifically challenging market conditions saw pine sawtimber stumpages prices decline from an average of 47 per ton from 20002006 to just over 23 per ton in 2011 or a roughly 50 decrease from 20002006 average levels this led many landowners to refrain from clearcutting a type of harvest which typically removes large quantities of pine sawtimber as they waited for pine sawtimber prices to improve however pine sawtimber stumpage prices never recovered and have held between 22 and 25 per ton since 2011 ultimately landowners returned to more normal management practices by 2014 with thinnings falling back in line with pre2007 trends the catchment area has also experienced some conversion specifically from 20002020 planted pine timberland increased more than 460000 hectares while natural hardwood and mixed pinehardwood timberland decreased a combined 390000 hectares note that the increase in planted pine timberland and decrease in natural hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland over this period were both gradual and occurred simultaneously this suggests a management trend in which natural timber stands are converted to plantation pine following final harvest its also important to note that there is little evidence that links these changes to increased demand from bioenergy as this conversion trend begun years prior to the startup of alabama pellets and continued nearly unchanged following the pellet mills startup diversion from other markets no demand for softwood pine sawlogs increased an estimated 12 in the catchment area from 20122020 also there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused a diversion from other softwood pulpwood markets ie pulppaper also even though softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy is down 14 since alabama pelletsalicevilles startup in 2012 there is no evidence that increased demand from bioenergy has caused this decrease rather the decrease in demand from nonbioenergy sources is due to a combination of reduced product demand and therefore reduced production and increased utilization of sawmill residuals an unexpected or abnormal increase in wood prices no the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville added roughly 450000 metric tons of softwood pulpwood demand to the catchment area from 20122016 and this increase in demand coincided with essentially no change in delivered pine pulpwood ppw price over this same period ultimately the additional demand placed on the catchment area following the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville was offset by a decrease in demand from other sources from 20122016 and as a result delivered ppw prices remained nearly unchanged however the aliceville facility was shut down for a majority of 2017 due to the catastrophic failure of a key piece of environmental equipment and this was followed by alabama pellets strategic decision to transition to residualconsumption only beginning in 2018 which eliminated more than 360000 metric tons of annual softwood pulpwood demand from 20162018 over this same period softwood pulpwood demand from other sources also decreased nearly 360000 metric tons so with the elimination of roughly 720000 metric tons of annual softwood pulpwood demand from all sources from 20162018 delivered ppw prices in the catchment area proceeded to decrease more than 6 over this period since 2018 total softwood pulpwood demand has increased roughly 4 in the catchment area due to increases in demand from nonbioenergy sources and this increase that has coincided with a simultaneous 4 increase in delivered ppw price statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered ppw price however the relationship between delivered ppw price and nonbiomassrelated softwood pulpwood demand was found to be stronger which is not unexpected given that pine pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 94 of total pine pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2012 ultimately the findings provide evidence that ppw price is influenced by demand from all sources  not just from bioenergy or from pulppaper but from both furthermore note that alabama pellets shift to residualconsumption only beginning in 2018 resulted in no increase in pine sawmill chip prices as the price of pine sawmill chips in the alabama cluster catchment area rather decreased from 20182020 despite a more than 100000metric ton increase in pine sawmill chip consumption by the aliceville mill over this period a reduction in growing stock timber no from 2012 the year alabama pellets started up to 2020 total growing stock inventory increased an average of 26 per year 22 total in the alabama cluster catchment area specifically inventories of pine sawtimber and pine chipnsaw increased 41 and 40 respectively while pine pulpwood ppw inventory increased 25 over this same period a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service usfs data shows the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber in the alabama cluster catchment area increased from 60 in 2012 to 62 in 2020 suggesting that the sequestration rate of carbon also increased slightly over this period note that the increase in overall growth rate and therefore increase in the sequestration rate of carbon can be linked to gains in pine timberland and associated changes with the catchment area forest specifically growth rates decline as timber ages so the influx of new pine timberland due to the conversion of both hardwood forests and cropland has resulted in just the opposite with the average age of softwood pine growing stock inventory decreasing from an estimated 354 years of age in 2000 to 332 years of age in 2010 and to 322 years of age in 2020 total growing stock inventory decreased from 419 to 410 and to 404 years of age over these periods an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals gr ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual timber removals provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2020 the latest available the gr ratio for pine pulpwood ppw the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector equaled 326 recall that a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels moreover note that the ppw gr ratio has increased in the catchment area since the aliceville mills startup in 2012 despite the associated increases in pine pulpwood demand in this catchment area pine pulpwood demand from nonbioenergy sources decreased more than 860000 metric tons from 2012 to 2020 and this decrease more than offset any increase in demand from bioenergy impact of bioenergy demand on timber growing stock inventory neutral according to usfs data inventories of pine pulpwood ppw increased 25 in the catchment area from 20122020 and this increase in ppw inventory can be linked to both increases in pine timberland and harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area specifically pine timberland both planted and natural combined increased more than 185000 hectares in the catchment area from 20122020 over this same period annual harvests of ppw were 65 below maximum sustainable levels timber growth rates neutral the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber increased from 60 in 2012 to 62 in 2020 in the alabama cluster catchment area despite pine pulpwood ppw growth rate decreasing from 151 to 125 over this period however this decrease in ppw growth rate was not due to increased demand attributed to bioenergy but rather to the aging of ppw within its product group and its natural movement along the pine growth rate curve specifically usfs data indicates the average age of ppw inventory in the catchment area increased from an estimated 134 years of age in 2012 to 136 years of age in 2020 forest area neutral in the alabama cluster catchment area total forest timberland area remained nearly unchanged decreasing only marginally from 20122020 however pine timberland  the predominant source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production  increased more than 185000 hectares over this period and this increase can be linked to several factors including conversion from both hardwood and mixed pinehardwood forests as well as conversion from cropland specifically the more than 185000hectare increase in pine timberland from 20122020 coincided with a roughly 197000hectare decrease in hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland and a more than 8000hectare decrease in cropland over this period furthermore statistical analysis confirmed these inverse relationships identifying strong negative correlations between pine timberland area and both hardwoodmixed pinehardwood timberland area and cropland in the catchment area from 20122020 wood prices negativeneutral softwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy increased from roughly 80000 metric tons in 2012 the year alabama pelletsaliceville started up to more than 655000 metric tons in 2015 the year biomass demand reached peak levels however this roughly 575000metric ton increase in softwood biomass demand coincided with essentially no change in delivered pine pulpwood ppw price  which averaged 2640 per ton in 2012 and 2639 per ton in 2015 ultimately the additional demand placed on this catchment area following the startup of alabama pelletsaliceville was offset by a more than 680000metric ton decrease in demand from other sources over this same period and as a result delivered ppw prices remained nearly unchanged also note that alabama pellets strategic shift to consume residuals only a transition that begun in 2018 and had been completed by 2019 resulted in a nearly 480000metric ton decrease in softwood biomass demand in the catchment area from 2015 to 2020 over this same period softwood pulpwood demand from other sources decreased more than 180000 metric tons in total softwood pulpwood demand from all sources decreased more than 660000 metric tons from 2015 to 2020 and this decrease in demand resulted in delivered ppw prices decreasing 5 over this period statistical analysis did identify a positive relationship between softwood biomass demand and delivered ppw price however the relationship between delivered ppw price and nonbiomassrelated softwood pulpwood demand was found to be stronger which is not unexpected given that pine pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has accounted for 94 of total pine pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2012 ultimately the findings provide evidence that ppw price is influenced by demand from all sources  not just from bioenergy or from pulppaper but from both markets for solid wood products positive in the alabama cluster catchment area demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products has increased an estimated 12 since 2012 and this increase in softwood lumber production has consequentially resulted in the increased production of sawmill residuals ie chips sawdust and shavings  byproducts of the sawmilling process and materials utilized by alabama pellets to produce wood pellets moreover the increased availability of sawmill residuals and lower relative cost compared to roundwood after chipping and other processing costs are considered led alabama pellets to make a strategic shift to utilize residuals only for wood pellet production beginning in 2019 so not only has alabama pellets benefited from the greater availability of this lowercost sawmill byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as alabama pellets has provided an additional outlet

2021 opinion today we completed a transformational deal  our acquisition of canadian biomass pellet producer pinnacle renewable energy im very excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the drax family  together we will build on what we have already achieved having become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and the uks largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal the deal positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business  making us a truly international business trading biomass from north america to europe and asia it also advances our strategy to increase our self supply reduces our biomass production costs and creates a longterm future for sustainable biomass  a renewable energy source that the uns ipcc says will be needed to achieve global climate targets its also an important milestone in draxs ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our pioneering negative emissions technology beccs  thats because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax negative emissions from beccs are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery inside a pinnacle pellet mill we already know pinnacle well  it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with drax our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so im looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together we will benefit from pinnacles scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues in 2019 pinnacles production cost was 20 lower than draxs completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 49 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets at 17 plants in locations across western canada and the us south  up from 16mt now it also expands our access to three major north american fibre baskets and four export facilities giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply this positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by demand in asia biomass wood pellet storage dome drax power station we believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with c67 billion of longterm contracts with high quality asian and european customers including drax and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027 drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio we believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics helping to reduce distance time carbon footprint and cost train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station importantly  there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group we recognise that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern us where we currently operate in line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with environmental groups indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas we are determined to create a longterm future for sustainable biomass and deliver beccs  the negative emissions technology that will be needed around the world to meet global climate targets the acquisition of pinnacle takes us a big step forward in achieving our goals read press release drax completes

business 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy if asked to picture canada its beautiful forests often spring to mind in fact 38 of the country is covered by them little wonder that canada has one of the worlds biggest lumber industries but all that lumber milling means a lot of sawdust it was in this sawdust and the other waste products the milling process creates that one fledgling canadian company spotted an opportunity making the most of waste started by two brothers in the 1980s pinnacle originally made animal feed for farmers  compressed pellets of grass and grain then in the late eighties after hearing about wood pellet production in scandinavia and taking a look at all the sawmilling residues being burned up around them they had an idea for a new direction at the time the canadian government was looking to make the sawmilling industry a lot cleaner and more sustainable there was a lot of fibre around that needed to find a home explains vaughan bassett a senior executive with the company canada needed a way to put to good use materials that were previously just thrown away or even burnt out in the open releasing greenhouse gas emissions and wood pellets seemed like a natural fit even better because there was so much waste fibre around at the time pinnacle was able to get its raw material for free and help to avoid the unnecessary emissions all it had to do was pick it up and take it away finding a new business model making the transition from feed pellets to wood pellets involved a lot of trial and error there was a lot of entrepreneurial spirit that went into this thing says bassett it was untried untested unknown and there was no real market it was just a couple of entrepreneurs trying stuff out initially pinnacle produced its wood pellets for local domestic markets  people looking to heat their homes local businesses and schools that used wood burners this is a particularly convenient and efficient form of fuel for communities in offthegrid remote areas of canada but pinnacle was keen to grow and make an even greater impact rising demand for sustainability by the early 2000s some in the power generation industry were starting to rethink their longterm futures looking to shift from fossil fuels like coal to cleaner alternatives in order to meet the challenges of sustainable energy production central to pinnacles business is a commitment to sustainability  something being based in canada where forest management is particularly advanced makes possible being owned by the crown there are very tight controls over how canadian forests are run  and how the trees are used weve probably got the most sustainable wood fibre in the world the numbers are just mad something like 95 of all the forests in canada are forest management certified which is unbelievable look at the next best country and its probably nearer 30 says bassett its left us with an incredible asset that keeps growing every year the industry never takes more wood than what grows indeed carefully managed forestry is key to environmental sustainability fullygrown older trees dont absorb as much co 2  so replacing them with younger growing trees that do can benefit the environment meanwhile the waste product of sawmilling is converted into biomass which produces further benefits by reducing reliance on fossil fuels pinnacle and drax a sustainable partnership pinnacle first started supplying drax with compressed wood pellets in 2009 marking a turningpoint for the company since 2011 our production has doubled says bassett pinnacle now contracts a fleet of ships and has its own dedicated port facility each vessel can transport 60000 tonnes given that drax uses around 16000 tonnes a day with two of its three biomass units at full capacity one shipment keeps a third of the huge power station in north yorkshire going for nearly four days pinnacle now produces in the region of 15m tonnes of pellets a year about half of which goes to drax so theyre a very important part of what we do says bassett read the burns lake and houston pellet plant catchment area analysis here  part of a series of catchment area analyses around the forest biomass
