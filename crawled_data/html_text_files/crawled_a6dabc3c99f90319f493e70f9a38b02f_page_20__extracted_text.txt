entered into a binding conditional agreement with the shareholders of opus energy the sellers for the purchase of opus energy for 340 million payable in cash on completion 3  completion of the acquisition is conditional on amongst other things the approval of draxs shareholders and the approval by the european commission of the cfd investment contract 2 awarded to drax by the uk government drax remains confident of approval of the cfd investment contract a circular is expected to be sent to shareholders in early 2017 convening a general meeting to vote on the acquisition completion of the acquisition is also expected to occur in early 2017 background to and reasons for the proposed acquisition the drax board of directors believes that the proposed acquisition provides a unique opportunity and is strategically and financially compelling opus energy will enhance draxs retail offering by combining the leading challenger small and medium enterprise sme business with haven powers strength in the industrial and commercial ic market the combination provides a robust platform for growth combining draxs and haven powers commercial capabilities and vertically integrated business model with opus energys established sme business and experience in both electricity and gas the acquisition leverages draxs flexible reliable renewable generation offering to create energy solutions for customers it also furthers draxs strategic ambition to diversify and improve the quality of its earnings whilst increasing the contribution of businesses with longterm growth opportunities key benefits of the acquisition acceleration of draxs retail strategy the acquisition provides access to a large and profitable sme focused retail business as the leading challenger brand in the sme market opus energy has demonstrated consistent sales and sustained growth in revenue and profitability 7 driven by customer satisfaction and high customer retention levels 85 april 2015 to june 2016 as at 31 march 2016 opus energy had a total of 129025 customers with 265418 meters and as at 30 april 2016 had a nondomestic electricity market share of 8 by meters count opus energys experience and proven success in the sme market combined with haven powers existing presence in the ic market represents an exceptional opportunity for drax to develop a platform for the growth of its retail business and significantly expand its customer base in the profitable sme sector accelerating the implementation of draxs retail growth strategy platform for growth over the last six years opus energy has trebled the number of meters contracted to 265418 as at 31 march 2016 and has driven profitability through its low cost business model and strong customer service proposition the acquisition provides the combined drax and opus energy groups the enlarged group with established routes to market for electricity and gas in the sme market and drax believes that the combination of opus energy and haven power can drive market share growth the sme market covers a broad range of customers  at the large end commercial users similar to ic customers whilst at the smaller end users similar to domestic customers the expertise and platforms shared by the combined business across both ic and sme markets will enable the enlarged group to deliver new products and services and enhanced market coverage compatible and complementary to existing retail business haven power was acquired by drax in 2009 as a credit efficient route to market for the large volumes of electricity produced by drax power and to monetise electricity sales and renewable certificates such as renewables obligation certificates rocs haven power has focused on growing market share in the ic market and currently has limited presence in the sme market where opus is well established the acquisition therefore complements haven power with its focus on a profitable separate and distinct customer segment it will also enlarge the route to market for draxs generation business and allow its retail business to achieve critical mass both in the nondomestic market and within the drax group opus energys expertise in sme electricity and gas sales combined with haven powers track record in the ic market and draxs umbrella of generationbacked power and commodity risk management is anticipated to provide distinct benefits in the future including the opportunity for an alternative hedge to commodity market exposure drax believes that opus energys expertise in different but related markets a challenger mentality and a shared customer service ethos with haven power together with its strong credit and risk management including commodity risk makes opus energy a good cultural fit with drax and contributes to the uniqueness of the acquisition opportunity haven ye dec 2015 opus ye mar 2016 proforma revenues m 1290 573 1863 gross profit m 19 107 126 gross profit margin 1 19 customer meters

manage its exposure to commodity and power markets by broadening the range of markets in which it operates with improvements in magnitude and stability of net income the acquisition aligns with this strategy and is expected to deliver more broadly based high quality and predictable earnings today and in the longterm this will be driven by more revenue from electricity and gas sales in the sme market and opus energys high levels of customer retention 85 in april 2015 to june 2016 attractive financial returns opus energy is expected to deliver strongly enhanced margins to draxs retail business having experienced consistent midsingle digit ebit margins over the last three financial years opus energy is focussed on small sme and multisite corporate groups obtained via an extensive network of third party intermediaries tpis and is supported by a specialist customer service department the utilisation of tpis has helped to increase opus energys customer base and has established a broad sales network incentivised to maximise margin together with a simplified pricing model and quick customer revenue collection opus energy delivers significantly higher net margins per customer than those currently achieved by haven power in the higher volume low margin ic sector in addition over the last three financial years the difference between opus energys ebit and ebitda has remained consistently low reflecting the low capital intensity of its business the acquisition is expected to add both short and longterm financial benefits to drax drax expects to achieve a return on invested capital higher than its current cost of capital the addition of the wellestablished and growing opus energy business with its high profitability and high cash conversion is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings and cash flow in 2017 with opus energy having delivered reported ebitda of 337 million ebit of 328 million and cash from operations of 343 million in the financial year ended 31 march 2016 synergy potential the principal synergy will be the opportunity to benefit from the sourcing of wholesale electricity and gas from drax power over the past three years the costs associated with wholesale energy purchasing have been approximately 6 million per year by bringing these into the drax group drax expects to eliminate the majority of this cost following completion of the acquisition and replacement of these wholesale energy purchasing agreements the majority of opus energys power and gas wholesale supply requirements for new customers will be provided by drax power drax also expects the consolidation of commodity positions within the enlarged group to achieve some economies of scale opus energys capability within the gas market will give haven the ability to satisfy the increasing demand for dual supply from customers in haven target market at the smaller end of the size range the acquisition will also allow drax to drive traditional operational efficiencies over time opus energys it platform is expected to be able to absorb forecasted customer growth in the immediate future allowing drax the time and flexibility to create a sustainable it platform solution for the enlarged group in the medium term information on opus energy overview founded in 2002 opus energy is a business to business supplier of electricity gas and

story was published the day before the announcement by the european commission please scroll to the bottom of this page for the drax view  when the european union set out its policy for the promotion of renewable energy in the 2009 renewable energy directive red it set a very ambitious target by 2020 renewables should make up 20 of the eus energy consumption each member state was given a specific goal and made to detail exactly how it would hit this the directive was comprehensive in many ways but it didnt include a clear sustainability policy for solid biomass including compressed wood pellets  as one of the largest sources of renewable energy in europe  this left a policy gap that many voices  including drax  have called to be filled its a wish that will now be granted a revised red is set to be published by the eu that will specify clear criteria for all biomass sustainability has always been absolutely central to our biomass strategy but drax has always argued that there is a right way to source biomass and a wrong way dorothy thompson drax group ceo july 2014 importance of sustainable biomass biomass is a wellestablished and essential part of the renewable energy mix it offers a unique mix of reliability flexibility and affordability all while helping to deliver carbon reductions this makes it particularly important as countries like the uk seek to phase out coal generation and hit the targets set out in the paris agreement however in order to secure these carbon benefits biomass needs to be produced sustainably this means that it comes from responsiblymanaged growing forests and that the emissions from the supply chain are measured and minimised in the uk there are already binding sustainability criteria but this isnt the case across the eu biomass use in the uk is regulated under the eu timber regulations and uks own renewable obligation ro biomass sustainability criteria the ro is a form of government support designed to incentivise large scale renewable electricity generation in the uk and to qualify for this energy companies must adhere to sustainability standards such as properly accounting for their greenhouse gas ghg emissions and only sourcing from responsibly managed land and forests  an euwide approach to biomass that follows the uks could see the implementation of a riskbased scheme that asks large energy companies to prove how they mitigate against a set of identified risks  like those in the ro criteria however its important that compliance with these is independently verified  something that could be done by using independent schemes such as the sustainable biomass program sbp the sbp carries out supplybase evaluation of pellet producers to ensure the wood theyre using is qualified as sustainable and theyre meeting the ro criteria programmes like the sbp are already being used by most major biomass power generators in the eu and could act as a blueprint for the future efficiency where effective only a few of the power stations across the eu are suitable for conversion from coal to biomass but those that are like drax can deliver fast significant carbon savings the thermal efficiency of such stations may not be as high as a newly built plant but they do allow governments to quickly move away from coal more than that these plants can continue to provide the critical services  such as voltage control and black start  the grid needs to remain stable and that other renewables cant drax is one of these stations and in the first half of 2016 it was able to deliver around 20 of the uks renewable power thanks to its conversion to biomass it now does this with over 80 carbon reductions relative to coal with the abundance of suitable and sustainablygrown fibre that can be used for biomass electricity generation there is a strong case for the eu to encourage the coal phase out by encouraging others to undergo conversion from coal to biomass but whats also needed is a clear set of sustainability criteria for biomass  the move to define this is a step in the right direction but the final eu proposal needs to be a practical one if the updated red achieves this it will mean a bright future for renewable energy in europe and a clearer path for meeting the continents paris agreement targets  30 november 2016 update  drax welcomes renewable energy directive proposal drax welcomes the publication of the renewable energy directive and bioenergy policy proposal  drax has been at the forefront of calling for standards based on a riskassessment to demonstrate the sustainability of biomass used for energy production matt willey public affairs director of drax power had said that drax has campaigned for a robust pragmatic biomass sustainability policy for the whole eu for many years and today is a step in the right direction it is important that large users of biomass can demonstrate forest regeneration is taking place that areas of high conservation value are protected that soil and water quality is maintained and that harvesting does not exceed the longterm production capacity of the forest we welcome the fact the commission proposes that voluntary national or international schemes including those which use a risk based approach can be used to provide evidence of sustainability the uk already has the toughest sustainability rules in the world so drax can be sure our compressed wood pellets are sustainable but it makes sense to have a common policy across the eu drax power has made huge efforts to demonstrate the sustainability of its biomass  sourcing from regions with large surpluses combined with low wood paying capability drax is able to track and trace every shipment back to low risk areas which assures that biodiversity is protected and promotes sustainable forest management tags energy policy  investors  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp should the carbon tax be scrapped definitely not andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 21 november 2016 opinion carbon emissions from electricity consumption in britain are at their lowest level ever  each unit of electricity produced now contains less than half the carbon it did four years ago this pace of decarbonisation is ahead of expectations  its also entirely necessary carbon dioxide co2 contributes to the warming of the planet and so limiting how much of it is released into the atmosphere is critical nowhere is this more important than in the power sector  one that has relied on carbonintensive fossil fuels like coal for its lifetime the uk government has recently ramped up plans to end coal power generation by 2025  and since 2013 one of its methods for doing so has been an economic one making organisations pay for every tonne of co2 they release it makes carbon emissions an economic disincentive for businesses but surprisingly some of co2s biggest emitters fully support it  drax included how do you put a price on carbon the eu was the first region to put such a scheme in place when in 2005 it introduced the eu emissions trading system eu ets under this system energy companies have to buy permits that allow them to emit co2 but the price of those permits has historically been volatile  dropping as low as below 3 per tonne in 2014 in 2013 the uk introduced the carbon price floor cpf  a means of bolstering the eus cost of carbon by setting a minimum price on emissions currently this is set at 18 per tonne more than four times the value of an eu carbon permit more recently the cpf has become a point of contention as some industries claim it stifles progress and have called for it to be scrapped in the upcoming autumn statement  this opposition has already caused blockers plans to raise the cpf to 30 per tonne by 2020 were halted by previous chancellor george osborne who instead froze it at 18 until the end of the decade but this view isnt universally shared drax along with a number of other energy companies including sse and calon energy recently wrote to the current chancellor philip hammond to argue to keep the price in place until at least 2025  in the letter we state the reason for our support plainly we believe the carbon price floor is central to the uks efforts to decarbonise its electricity system in short if we want a cleaner future the cpf needs to remain in place why price carbon not only does a carbon tax disincentivise using co2heavy fuels and processes it encourages investment in lower carbon and renewable energy sources by making them more cost effective relative to coal diesel and fuel oil more than that it places the decisions on how to reduce co2 emissions into the hands of those making them as long there is a societal cost to global warming it makes sense to put a cost to the emissions that cause it  in 2009 drax began an upgrade of our power station to run on biomass  it was a decision to pursue decarbonisation on our own terms made by people with the knowledge of how best to achieve it today three of our six units are powered by compressed wood pellets which has seen an 80 reduction in carbon emissions when compared to coal its also a significant revenue driver for the country the levy is expected to raise 1 billion this year while globally the world bank estimates the value of implementing carbon pricing initiatives at a little under 50 billion dollars  the revenue is significant but so too are the impacts on emissions since 2012 the uks carbon emissions have fallen by over 45 a year and on may 5th the country reached a milestone the first time since 1881 the uk was powered without burning any coal  this evidence sets out a clear argument the cpf contributes to reducing carbon emissions and for this reason its important it remains a part of the uks decarbonisation strategy scrapping it would be a grave error in the uks future energy plans and could limit our ability to meet the paris agreement targets 2016 has already been an historic year for the electricity industry in britain  but if the cpf is scrapped it will become a milestone year for different reasons rather than the year in which lowco2 power generation took a step forward it will be the year a decarbonised electricity future drifted further from our reach tags about us  coal  investors hinkley may be an important milestone but its no silver bullet to the uks energy challenges dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 7 october 2016 opinion in september the prime minister gave the goahead for the construction of two new nuclear reactors at hinkley point in somerset setting in motion the process for what could be the biggest and most expensive nuclear power station ever built while this monumental decision will provide some long overdue clarity for britains energy sector it has dangerously diverted the attention from a far bigger energy challenge facing the uk  replacing the contribution currently made by coal in november last year the government made a commitment that the uk must stop generating power from coal by 2025 for the sake of future generations this was the right decision to take  coal is after all a fossil fuel of the past thats damaging the environment however it still provides up to one fifth of the uks electricity and plugging that gap will be far from easy doing so in a way that allows the country to meet its carbon targets while supporting technologies that will deliver a modern energy system fit for the 21st century only adds to this challenge hinkley point c will play an important role in the future energy mix but lets be clear  its no silver bullet when finally complete hinkley point c is expected to provide seven percent of the uks electricity  less than a third of what is needed to replace coal whats more this new generation isnt even expected to come on grid much before 2030 by which point all but one of the uks operating nuclear reactors which provide around 20 of the uks current needs are scheduled to close in short hinkley will be replacing lost nuclear capacity and nowhere near all of it rather than providing the new energy we desperately need to plug the gap the end of coal will create this raises the question  what can replace outgoing coal in the necessary timescale while we have seen a huge and welcome expansion in renewable sources of generation like wind and solar in the uk they are intermittent so cannot fill the void alone they still need to be supported by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine  a regular scenario on these shores gas and nuclear will form part of the solution but as weve seen with hinkley planning funding and building new power stations can be a long and costly process  it took over a decade to reach the decision on hinkley point gas fired power stations can be up and running far quicker but obviously planning and approval are still required and only a handful have been built in the last 10 years alternative technologies  like small modular nuclear reactors and electricity storage  held in some quarters as the answer certainly hold potential however the reality is they arent yet fit for purpose at scale and will need much more research and development and in some cases regulatory approval before they become viable dorothy thompson ceo drax group time unfortunately is not a luxury we have this year alone more than six gigawatts gw of coal power generation could come off grid  almost twice the generating capacity of hinkley point every day lost adds to the cost and complexity of addressing the challenge we face  making a solution less likely a recognised costeffective renewable option does exist though but it is often unmentioned in the debate  its called biomass using the latest technology at drax power station we have upgraded half of the coal facilities to generate electricity using sustainable compressed wood pellets instead of coal since this reuses existing coal infrastructure its quicker and more efficient than building new power stations while also providing a reliable and flexible flow of electricity that can help the uk meet its carbon targets the compressed wood pellets we use for example perform in much the same way as coal but deliver a more than 80 co 2 saving this solution is proven and ready to go already draxs facility is powering more than three million homes and delivering 20 of the uks renewable electricity making it the biggest single site renewable generator in the country drax can go further though with the right government support and a levelplaying field  delivered via technologyneutral auctions for energy contracts with all six drax generation units converted plus lynemouth power station  which already has that future secured  and one or two other smaller biomass power stations around 10 of the uks electricity could be generated using this technology well before 2025 finding the right mix of power generation will not be easy but it is important to make every effort to get it right like hinkley point c biomass is no silver bullet but it is ideally placed to play an even greater role in helping the country transform to a lowcarbon future tags energy policy  investors black start the most important back up plan youve never heard of 6 october 2016 power generation movies where major cities are razed to the ground or overrun by zombies are good fun when watched safe in the knowledge that such disasters are never likely to happen in the uk but how prepared would britains infrastructure be if faced with a real disaster if for example something were to happen that caused the national electricity grid to shut down what would happen next of course the chance of this ever happening is remote in the extreme nonetheless britain has had a contingency plan in place for decades britains ultimate power back up first things first  if the whole of the network including the power stations supplying the national high voltage electricity distribution network the grid loses power you would need to restart those individual power stations before they can get the grid powered up again the challenge normally all power stations need electrical supply to start up but with a total electricity blackout theres no electricity to restart the system thats why the reboot procedure is called black start  and its one the most important yet littleknown back up plans in the uk the good news there has never been a blackout so widespread that drax has been asked to do a black start preparing for the unlikely but thats not to say that such a procedure may never be needed in october 1987 there was a regional black start in the wake of the powerful hurricane that hit the south of the country the storm damage left kent and sussex disconnected from the national grid  but thanks to black start contingency plans most people barely noticed kingsnorth power station restored power to the area and it ran independently cut off from the rest of the grid until repairs enabled it to be connected up again a total nationwide grid blackout may be unlikely but that doesnt mean its not prepared for tests happen regularly to assess how long it would take to restart an individual generation unit at a major power station bring it up to capacity and make sure that any black start would run smoothly the most recent test took place at drax in july 2011 with representatives from the national grid witnessing the procedure to simulate blackout conditions three of the generating units were disconnected from the grid in that test it took 83 minutes to return one unit back to service a simple plan not all power stations can do a black start  some simply do not have control ability to be the starting point of a system reboot but modern coal gas and biomass power plants are able to restart rapidly on demand this is why drax  first operational in the 1970s  is modern and responsive enough to be a key part of todays black start planning the way it works is actually relatively simple using smaller power sources to start ever bigger ones scaling up and up until the entire country is powered up again draxs auxiliary generating units consist of three gas turbines which can be started from batteries these would in turn generate enough power to restart one or two main generating units the restarted generating units would be used as the backbone of an island network  a network operating independently of the national grid  that would be grown by adding pockets of supply the generating units would match the speed and frequency to create normal grid conditions and to restore supplies fast locally finally the affected areas island networks would be hooked up to each other so electricity can be distributed around the country with the reliability and stability we have become accustomed to staying prepared when the electricity market was privatised there was a risk that such nationwide plans as black start could have fallen apart to prevent this formal contracts were put in place to continue to restart from scratch if necessary drax recently renewed its contract this makes black start  and drax  as important as ever if a disaster scenario ever struck for real the most important back up plan youd never heard of until now will

corporate governance its a massive tribute to everyone involved with drax that worldleading business experts have recognised our commitment to trust and integrity in this way of course that commitment goes much further than our accounting practices alone i believe my british colleagues would say that it runs right through drax like the writing in a stick of rock indeed it was one of the reasons i was so honoured to be asked to join drax as cfo  from my very first meeting with ceo dorothy thompson i could see that drax would always strive do the right thing in the right way thats just as true for our sustainability data as it is for our business data it was our commitment to doing the right thing that led drax to take on the decision to convert drax power station from coal to compressed

financial results for 2015  ill be the first to admit that they are not good what makes it all the more painful is that one of the strongest operational performances the business has achieved in the last decade was more than wiped out by factors well outside of our control lets be frank for any business operating in the uk energy market 2015 was a tough year the deterioration in the commodity markets were some of the most severe i have seen in my career this was then accompanied by a series of unexpected regulatory announcements which caused many to question the uk governments commitment to decarbonisation like any ceo on results day i have spent this morning speaking to investors journalists and financial analysts instead of focusing too much on what hasnt gone our way in 2015 ive focused on where i think we can make a difference in 2016 and beyond and ive been pleased with their positive reaction the affordable way to end coal in november amber rudd announced the governments proposal to consult on setting a clear end date for coal of march 2025 given it still provides around 25 of the countrys electricity this is an ambitious target part of the solution is new nuclear and gas but as a recent report by the institute of mechanical engineers noted the country will find it very hard to build enough new facilities to replace coal capacity in time  instead of having to take all the existing coal power stations off the grid and build new facilities the country could use the world leading biomass technology that drax has pioneered to upgrade some of them to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal the economic consultancy nera found that more biomass conversions are one of the most sensible ways for the uk to get off coal at the fairest price to the taxpayer  with the right support we stand ready to convert our remaining coal units to become a fully renewable generator helping society and creating shareholder value i fundamentally believe that drax is making a valuable contribution in helping society deal with one of the most pressing issues of our time  cutting carbon emissions to limit climate change we have an approach which is both affordable and reliable so long as we remain operationally strong which i am very confident about then shareholder value will accrue throughout 2016 and beyond we will build on our expertise and continue to evaluate a range of longer term strategic options i lead a strong business that will use the opportunities available to us to create value for our shareholders and help bring about a reliable renewable future
