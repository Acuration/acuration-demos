homes across britain or helping stabilise the national grid  drax power stations impact to our electricity network is far reaching but it doesnt stop at generating and supplying power a new report by oxford economics  commissioned by drax has found that in addition to its important role powering britain drax group also provides an economic boost to areas across the country here are three ways drax group contributed to the uk economy in 2016 167 billion added to uk gdp drax group contributed an estimated 167 billion to uk gross domestic product gdp in 2016 an increase from 124 billion in 2015  of that figure 301 million was added directly  as a result of the groups own activities such as the generating and selling of power and while this is an impressive 61 increase on 2015 the numbers are even more significant when looking at the benefit beyond the groups core activities in 2016 drax groups spending with external suppliers such as rail freight wagon manufacturer wh davis and imserv  which supplies automated meter reading technology to opus energy reached 872 million a further 36m was spent by these suppliers across their own supply chain to help them provide their services to drax there is an even greater impact when considering how this money filters through employees and suppliers into local retail leisure and service economies something which is especially important when the number of jobs drax supports is taken into account 18500 jobs supported across the country drax group directly employed more than 2000 people in 2016 but across the country it supports far more  18500 a significant increase from the 14150 of 2015 these jobs are primarily in highskilled manufacturing engineering construction it professional business services and transport while 3650 of these were in drax power stations native yorkshire and humber area this year saw the groups overall impact extend much further an i mpact beyond the northern powerhouse roughly a quarter 419 million of draxs total contribution to uk gdp was generated in the yorkshire and the humber region when the north west and north east were included the company impacted the northern economy to the tune of 577m and supported over 6000 jobs yorkshire and the humber was closely followed by the east of england  the home of haven power  which saw the second highest impact  registering more than 200 million contributed in gva  and london and the east midlands  this is thanks in part to the growing activities of drax group companies both haven power and opus energy which became a part of drax group in february 2017 are helping the uk move towards a low carbon future by supplying an increasing amount of british companies with renewable power  with offices in ipswich oxford northampton and cardiff haven power and opus energy highlight how drax group businesses are direct drivers for local gdp and employment opus energy supported 1600 jobs and 130 million in gva in wales  while haven power contributed 232 million to the east of england these numbers are noteworthy but what makes them all the more significant is how this translates into tax revenue operations at drax group generated an estimated 327 million for the uks public purse  equivalent to the salaries of almost 14000 nurses or 11900 teachers as the group continues to grow  adding new power generation assets to the national

governments are laying out plans to ban the sale of petrol and dieselpowered cars  while the falling prices of batteries will serve to make the vehicles more affordable to consumers and more profitable for manufacturers a recent report by bloomberg increased its earlier 2016 forecast for electric vehicle ev adoption it now estimates that by 2040 54 of new car sales and 33 of the global car fleet will be electric  this vision of the future points to considerably better air quality in urban and roadside environments across the world but while evs emit none of the tailpipe fumes of traditional fossil fuelpowered cars there is still potential for associated emissions depending on how that electricity is generated for example if the growing demand caused by evs is met with fossil fuels then welltowheel emissions are still in play however as electricity grids decarbonise and become smarter and more efficient evs will become cleaner researchers at imperial college london have shown that in the uk yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to cleaner electricity generation  what this greater reliance on electricity for transport will certainly do however is massively drive up global power demand investment will be needed not only in electricity generation but also in smart technology that can allow the charging and eventually usage of evs to be managed efficiently the growing demand of evs the bloomberg report states global electricity consumption from evs is expected to grow from just 6 twh in 2016 to 1800 twh by 2040 while the figure represents a massive increase in the electricity required to power evs 1800 twh represents just 5 of the projected global power consumption in 2040 by comparison the uk as a whole consumed just 304 twh of electricity in 2016 this clearly highlights the widespread need for global investment in electricity generation on the whole beyond just what will be required to power evs however the unique challenge evs pose is less how they recharge but when they will recharge smoothing spikes assuming supporting infrastructure and technology progress to enable widespread onstreet and home charging then the demand for electricity to charge evs will mostly likely come in the evening this could result in additional pressure being placed on energy generators and national grids due to mass ev charging utilities and regulators will need to implement policies to encourage offpeak charging for example overnight and spread out the demand from evs one way these spikes will be managed is through timeofuse rates to encourage drivers to charge their vehicles at offpeak times to avoid higher electricity bills however technological improvements will also help to manage the demand evs place on energy systems  tech solutions smart charging tech is one of the most important aspects of this in allowing cities utilities and consumers to automate vehicle charging at times when overall demand is lower storage technology will also play a key role in managing increasing demand on both consumer and operator ends adoption of home power storage systems is expected to grow as fast as solar photovoltaic energy has in recent years  which will enable consumers with home solar arrays to store energy and charge vehicles at times to avoid peakhour charges on the supplier end advancement in storage technology will allow generators to deliver electricity above their usual capacity and meet spikes in demand autonomous vehicles while the report suggests autonomous vehicles will not have a significant impact over the next decade the longerterm influence of selfdriving vehicles will have direct consequences on demand autonomous cars will be able to drive in a way that is significantly more efficient than humans by driving closer together and interacting with the surrounding city to prevent congestion with widespread adoption this greater efficiency would mean cars would use less energy and require less time to recharge however ownership of these types of vehicles will likely be shared particularity in urban environments resulting in fewer overall cars on the roads and ultimately plateauing or even declining demand from evs in the 2040s and beyond globally investment is needed to meet and support the growth of evs over the next two decades governments and businesses must begin to roll out charging infrastructure and clean energy solutions to meet future demand as well as the smart city technology that will enable the mass adoption and eventual automation of evs

the worlds most sophisticated artificial intelligence ai beat world champion lee sedol at a game called go  a chesslike board game with more move combinations than there are atoms in the universe before this defeat go had been considered too complicated for even the most complex computers to beat the top humans it was a landmark moment in the development of evermore sophisticated ai technology but the future of ai holds more than simply board game victories it is rapidly finding its way into all aspects of modern life prompting the promise of a fourth industrial revolution one of the areas ai has huge potential is in our energy system and this could have implications for generators consumers and the environment artificial intelligence playing traditional board game go concept the national grid gets wise earlier this year the uks national grid revealed its making headway in integrating ai technology into britains electricity system it announced a deal with googleowned ai company and creator of the go championbeating system deepmind which is set to improve the power networks transmission efficiency by as much as 10  one of the national grids most important tasks is maintaining the frequency of britains power networks to within 1 of 50hz  too high a frequency and electrical equipment gets damaged too low a frequency and you get blackouts managing this relies on ensuring electricity supply and demand are carefully balanced but this is made increasingly difficult with the growing number of intermittent renewables  such as wind and solar  on the grid the ability to process massive amounts of information from a wide variety of data points from weather forecasts to internet searches to tv listings  and create predictive models means ai can preempt surges in demand or instances of oversupply in short it can predict when the country will need more power and when it will need less more than this it can respond to these fluctuations in sustainable and lowcarbon ways for example it can automate demand side response where energy users scale back their usage at peak times for a reward similarly it can automate the purchasing of power from battery systems storing renewable energy such as those connected to domestic solar arrays these solutions which would see ai help to manage supply and demand imbalances would ease some grid management pressures while large thermal generators controlled by human engineers back up such automation with their continuing focus on maintaining grid stability through ancillary services the role of the smart city an undoubtedly large factor in the growing sophistication of ai in the energy space is the amount of energy use data now being captured and this has much to do with the increasing prevalence of smart devices and connected technology smart meters  which will be offered to every uk home by 2020  such as alphabets nest smart thermostat and startup verdigriss energy conserving internet of things iot devices are just a few of the emerging technologies using data to improve individuals abilities to monitor and optimise their household energy use but at scale information collected from these devices can be used by ai to help control energy distribution and efficiency across entire cities  and not just at a macro level but right down to individual devices the idea of a central computer controlling home utilities may seem like a soft invasion of privacy to some but when it comes to the energyintensive function of charging electric vehicles evs much of this optimisation will be carried out in public on street charge points  as ai and smart technology continue to grow more sophisticated it has the potential to do more than just improve efficiency instead it could fundamentally change consumers relationships with energy changing consumer relationships with energy startups in the energy space such as seattlebased drift  are exploring how trends such as peertopeer services and automated trading can be enabled through machine ai and give consumers greater control over their energy for a lower price the company offers consumers access to its own network of distributed and renewable energy sources currently operating in new york it uses ai to assess upcoming energy needs based on data collected from individual customers and locationspecific weather forecasts it then uses this to buy power from its network of peertopeer energy providers using highfrequency algorithmic trading to reduce or eliminate price spikes if demand exceeds expectation yet to be operational in the uk this sort of automation and peertopeer energy supply hints at the increasing decentralisation of energy grids  which are moving away from relying only on a number of large generators instead modern grids are likely to rely on a mix of technologies generators and suppliers and this means a more complex system which is precisely why automation from a central ai system could be a positive step not only could it bring about optimisation and efficiency but it could slash emissions and costs for consumers this silent automation may not have the same headlinegrabbing qualities as beating a world champion in their chosen sport but its impact to the country could be far greater tags artificial intelligence  investors  technology inertia the shock absorbers keeping the grid stable 12 september 2017 power generation from the comfort of home its easy to assume britains power is run across a consistently calm and stable system and while this is for the most part true keeping it this way relies on a set of carefully calibrated and connected tools these include frequency response  which keeps all electricity around the country on the same frequency  and reactive power  the quiet force moving electricity around the grid but theres another at play and at least by name its something youve probably heard of inertia system inertia is energy stored in spinning plant that slows down the rate at which frequency changes rapid changes in frequency can create instability in the system think of it like a car  inertia does the same job as shock absorbers in the suspension smoothing the sudden bumps and potholes keeping the wheels on the ground to maintain control however the changing nature of britains energy system is creating challenges in ensuring there is enough inertia available for a stable future grid the energy systems shock absorbers inertia describes objects natural tendency whether theyre moving or resting to keep doing what theyre doing until forced to change for example when you kick a pebble forces like friction and gravity prevent it hurtling endlessly off into the distance electricity generation in thermal power stations such as drax involves many moving parts none more important than turbines and generators in a turbine high pressure steam hits a set of blades which makes it spin a little like running a fan in reverse the spinning motion is used to power the generator which is a rotor wound in electrified copper wire transforming it into an electro magnet as this magnetic field passes through copper bars surrounding the rotor it generates electricity this spinning turbine has inertia if the fuel powering it is suddenly switched off it will continue to spin until it is stopped either by friction or by force every thermal generator in the uk system spins at 3000 rpm has inertia and generates electricity at a frequency of 50 hz in the uk all electricity is generated at the same frequency and crucially needs to remain stable  even deviations of 1 from this can damage equipment and cause blackouts managing frequency is done by managing generation if demand exceeds supply frequency falls too much supply and frequency rises national grid closely monitors frequency across the system and automatically instructs power generators like drax to respond to changes in frequency by dialing up or down generation and ensuring this change in generation is done smoothly and instantaneously relies on using inertia for example using the inertial forces of spinning generators power stations are able to respond instantly to requests to alter generation so inertia is important to the stability of the power system but because of the changing nature of todays grid we are facing challenges when it comes to inertia many forms of renewable generation arent built around spinning turbines and this means no inertia future challenges renewable sources like the wind turbines currently operational in the uk and solar pv  alongside energy imported from the continent do not provide inertia to the grid this means as the uk moves to decarbonise the energy system and rely on more intermittent and often embedded renewable energy rather than thermalgenerated electricity questions arise over where the grid will get the inertia needed to remain stable one possible solution is synthetic inertia while wind turbines do not contain inherit inertia modern suppliers are now enabling the machines rotating blades to create synthetic inertia  which can add extra power to the grid to support generation loss some regions including germany and quebec now require inertiageneration in turbines as standard  this cant be done with solar pv however smart grids and improving storage technologies have the potential to deal with a lack of inertia batteries which can absorb electricity when there is an oversupply and then release it again when demand is high can respond nearinstantly to fluctuations to help maintain the grids frequency there are of course renewable sources that offer natural inertia including hydro tidal and biomass generation but as the uk shifts to more renewable energy sources with no naturally occurring inertia these turbinebased generation methods will be vital in ensuring wider grid stability gas has an important role too as a lower carbon alternative to coal power and

decarbonisation  tags investors  technology the silent force that moves electricity 31 august 2017 power generation in the early evening of 14 th august 2003 new york city in the midst of a heatwave lost its power  offices stores transport networks wall street and the un building all found their lights and phones cut off gridlocked streets and a stalled subway system forced millions to commute home on foot while those unable to make it back to the suburbs set up camp around the city it wasnt just the big apple facing blackout  what had started with several power lines in northern ohio brushing against an overgrown tree had spread in eight minutes to affect eight us states and two canadian provinces in total more than 50 million people were impacted 6 billion was lost in damages and 12 deaths were reported while a software glitch and the outdated nature of the power system contributed to the disaster the spread from a few highvoltage power lines to the entire north west was caused by a lack of reactive power  the pump powering electricity electricity that turns on light bulbs and charges phones is whats known as active power  usually measured in watts w kilowatts kw megawatts mw or in even higher units however getting that active power around the energy system efficiently economically and safely requires something called reactive power which is used to pump active power around the grid reactive power is measured in mega volt amps reactive  mvar  its generated in the same way as active power by large power stations but is fed into the system in a slightly different manner which leads to limitations on how far it can travel reactive power can only be effective locallyregionally  it does not travel far so across the country there are regional reactive power distributors servicing each local area imagine a long hose pipe that needs individual pumps at certain points along the way to provide the thrust necessary to transport water but power stations arent the only source of reactive power some electronic devices like laptops and tvs actually produce and feed small amounts of reactive power back into the grid in large numbers this increases the amount of reactive power on the grid and when this happens power stations must absorb the excess this is because although its essential to have reactive power on the grid it is more important to have the right amount too much and power lines can become overloaded which creates volatility on the network such as in the new york blackout too little and efficiency decreases think once again of the long hose pipe  if the pressure is too great the hose is at risk of bursting if the pressure is too low water wont travel through it properly this process of managing reactive power is at its heart one of ensuring active power is delivered to the places it needs to be but it is also one of voltage control  a delicate balancing act that if not closely monitored can lead to serious problems keeping volatility at bay across britain all electricity on the national grid must run at the same voltage either 400kv or 275kv  it is stepped down from 132kv to 230v when delivered to homes by regional distribution networks  a deviation as small as 5 above or below can lead to equipment being damaged or large scale blackouts national grid monitors and manages the nationwide voltage level to ensure it remains within the safe limit and doing this relies on managing reactive power ian foy head of ancillary services at drax explains when cables are lightly loaded with a low level of power running through them such as overnight when electricity demand is lower they start emitting reactive power causing the voltage to rise to counter this generators such as drax power station  under instruction from national grid can change the conditions in their transformers from exporting to absorbing reactive power in just two minutes this relies on 24hour coordination across the national grid but as our power system continues to evolve so do our reactive power requirements and this is partly down to the economys move from heavy industry to business and consumer services the changing needs for reactive power large industrial power loads such as those required for big motors mills or coal mines bring voltage down and create a demand for more reactive power explains foy now with more consumer product usage the demand for active power is falling and the voltage is rising the result is that drax and other power stations now spend more time absorbing reactive power rather than exporting it to keep voltage levels down in the past by contrast foy says the power plant would export reactive energy during the day and absorb it at night as britains energy system decarbonises the load on powerlines also becomes lighter as more and more decentralised power sources such as wind and solar are used to meet local demand rather than large power plants supplying wider areas this falling load on the power system increases the voltage and creates a greater need for generators to absorb reactive power from the system it highlights that while draxs role in balancing reactive power has changed it remains an essential service this short story is adapted from a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the areas of balancing services system support services and

for electricity 29 august 2017 power generation during the penultimate week of june 2017 temperatures of thirty degrees celsius or more were recorded across the uk for five days straight it was the hottest continuous spell of weather in the country since the 70s and while this may sound like a minor headline its evidence of an important fact the world is getting warmer  according to the met office experiencing a very hot summer is now likely to occur every five years rather than every 50 by the 2040s more extreme heatwaves could become commonplace  and this could have serious consequences the extreme heatwave that hit europe in 2003 led to a death toll in the tens of thousands and placed extreme strain on the continent  not only on its people but on its infrastructure too if this weather is set to continue what does it mean for our electricity network electricity in extreme weather in hot countries electricity use soars in times of extreme weather due to increased use of cooling devices like air conditioning one us study predicted an extreme temperature upswing could drive as much as an 72 increase in us peak demand in northern europe including the uk where air conditioning is less prevalent  the effects of heat arent as pronounced but that could change in france hot weather is estimated to have contributed to a 2 gw increase in demand this june the uk which has traditionally only seen demand swings due to cold weather  is also beginning to feel the effects of extreme heat according to dr iain staffell of imperial college london for every degree rise in temperature during june 2017 electricity demand rose by 09 300 mw for example on 19 th june when temperature averaged 219 degrees celsius demand reached 32 gw on the 25 th  when temperatures dropped to an average of 159 degrees demand shrank to 266 gw in the very hottest days of summer this can mean the grid needs to deliver an additional 15 gw of power  equivalent to the output of five rapidresponse gas power stations or twoandahalf biomass units at drax power station and while heats effect on demand is considerable its not the only one it has on electricity the problem of cooling water in hot weather generating power doesnt just need fuel its also a waterintensive process power stations consume water for two main reasons to turn into steam to drive generation turbines and to cool down machinery both rely on raising the temperature of the water however this water cant simply be released back into a river or lake after use  even if nothing has been added to it  as warm water can negatively affect wildlife living in these habitats first it has to be cooled  normally via cooling towers  but in hot weather this takes longer and as a result power production becomes less efficient and in some cases plant output must be dialled back this had serious consequences for frances nuclear power plants during the 2003 heatwave these plants  which provide roughly 75 of the countrys electricity  draw water from nearby rivers to cool their reactors during the heatwave however these rivers were both too hot and too low to safely provide water for the cooling process which in turn led to the power stations having to either close or drastically reduce capacity coupled with increased demand france was left on the verge of a largescale black out situations like this are even more critical when considering heats effects on electricitys motorway the national grid how the hot weather impacts electricity when materials get hot they expand  this includes those electricity grids are made from for example overhead power transmission cables are often clad in aluminium which is particularly susceptible to expansion in heat when it expands overhead lines can slacken and sag which increases electrical resistance in the cables  leading to a drop in efficiency transformers which step up and down voltage across grids are also susceptible they give off heat as a byproduct of their operations but to keep them within a safe level of operation they have whats known as a power rating  the highest temperature at which they can safely function when ambient temperatures rise this ceiling gets lower and their efficiency drops  about 1 for every one degree celsius gain in temperature at scale this can have a significant effect overall grids can lose about 1 in efficiency for every three degrees hotter it gets as global temperatures continue to rise these challenges could grow more acute at uk power stations such as drax important upgrade and maintenance work takes place during the quieter summer months if this period becomes one in which there is a higher demand for power at peak times it could lead to new challenges investing in infrastructure and building a power generation landscape that includes a mix of technologies and meets a variety of grid needs is one way in which we can counter the challenges of climate change this will mean we can not only move towards a lower carbon economy and contribute towards slowing global warming but respond to climate change by adapting essential national infrastructure to deal with its effects tags temperature  electricity  investors the peoplepowered renewables revolution 24 august 2017 sustainable business for decades the electricity system was relatively straightforward power was generated by utility companies then sold and supplied to consumers and businesses but this is changing and the power industry may be on the verge of a revolution the falling costs and ongoing innovation around technologies like rooftop solar panels and domestic battery storage is enabling the rise of socalled prosumers  individuals businesses or institutions who not only consume electricity but produce it too according to the national grids 2017 future energy scenarios report this could lead to an almost entirely decentralised cleaner energy system but for this to happen prosumerism needs to be adopted at scale and this relies on technological innovation and changes to attitudes and behaviours the technology powering prosumers the biggest barrier to largescale adoption of prosumerism is technology although research and innovation pounds dollars and euros have been pouring into the technologies that make decentralised power generation possible there are still developments to be made solar is one of the most prominently used renewables by prosumers thanks to the relative affordability of rooftop solar systems even homeinterior giant ikea now offers solar panels and battery systems through a partnership with the uks largest solar company solarcentury but like wind turbines a more costprohibitive solution solar is an intermittent energy source which means domestic users may still need to access the grid to fill gaps in their own generation that is unless battery technology advances to a point where it can store enough solar or windgenerated electricity to fully power homes and businesses affordably  allyear round including in the dark still days of midwinter until then a prosumer who wants to have a reliable flexible selfsupply of energy needs to be able to call on a mix of renewable technologies  just as the national system does hamerton zoo in cambridgeshire for example generates its own energy via a mix of solar wind and biomass it then sells its excess electricity to an energy supplier there are signs that battery technology is starting to take off as an option for powering homes and businesses teslas powerwall is currently the closest home battery system to breaking through to mainstream consumers and many firms are following its lead for example in the uk elon musks company faces new competition from nissan which is partnering with us power firm eaton to build and sell home batteries in the uk  that two electric car manufacturers are in on the act is no surprise  it will be another revolution that of electric vehicles evs usurping the dominance of petrol and diesel models that is set to bring the boon that batteries need to become a popular choice for prosumers the government is also pushing innovation in the space with business and energy secretary greg clark announcing plans to invest 264 million into research in the sector over the next four years energy ownership but what could this mean for the business of electricity the national grid report suggests multiple commercial models will operate together to facilitate a decentralised prosumerbased energy system these would include homes and businesses who wholly own their energy systems as well as systems owned and operated by third parties such as aggregators managing energy or solarrental schemes communityowned projects could also play a role with small renewable energy facilities supplying residents such as the wind turbine in the cambridgeshire village of gamlingay  excess energy could also be sold back to the grid with any money earned reinvested in the community or in its renewable infrastructure similar schemes are already in place in both the business and consumer retail markets in 2016 for example opus energy  a drax group company supplying energy to uk businesses  bought almost 1 twh of power from over 2000 small renewable generators who use technologies such as anaerobic digestion solar onshore wind and hydro  opus energy then sells that power onto its predominantly small and mediumsized enterprise sme customer base this allows it to offer innovative tariffs such as the 100 solar power deal enjoyed by restaurant chain leon this summer haven power the drax retail business specialising in electricity supply for large corporate and industrial clients sells on power from over 20 small renewable generators  and it has a number of large clients such as water utilities who selfgenerate a lot of their own power and work with haven power to help manage their selfsupply against their demand from regional electricity distribution networks and further upstream national grid and power stations for large power generators an increase in prosumerism in the energy sector could mean likely overall demand may decrease which would mean a scaling back of operations however the increased volatility of the grid will give rise to the need for flexibility and for additional ancillary services like frequency response which ensures the countrys electricity is all operating at the same frequency this would most likely be delivered by flexible generators such as gas and biomass which would also be required for winter demand when more electricity is required and there is less wind and solar generation the role of government incentives another key part of the rise of consumer generated power will be government regulation and incentive schemes in the uk new measures have been put in place to encourage individuals to generate their own electricity  these intend to make it easier for prosumers to generate their own power through solar store it in batteries and sell it back to the national grid something which regulator ofgem claims could save consumers between 17 billion and 40 billion by 2050  this isnt the only scheme of its kind currently in action the uks renewable heat incentive rhi encourages homeowners and businesses to adopt lowcarbon heating offering to pay a certain amount for every kwh of renewable heat generated feedin tariffs on the other hand also offer financial incentives  with electricity suppliers paying prosumers for the energy they produce themselves is my home or business big enough the prosumer revolution will not happen overnight selfgeneration and selfstorage of power and the installation of renewable heat systems are more suited to larger properties or those linked up to communitybased projects so for many people living in properties they own rent or in social housing the idea of becoming a prosumer could right now be a little farfetched and although there is evidence that the national transmission grid is already decentralising nor will this revolution mean the complete eradication of all centralised utilities through gradual improvements in smallscale energy generation power storage smart technology and government policies it will become an increasingly affordable and efficient way for communities businesses and institutions to go green tags biomass
