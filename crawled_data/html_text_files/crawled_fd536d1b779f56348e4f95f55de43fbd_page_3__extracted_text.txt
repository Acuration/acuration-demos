supply chain this train isnt like any other in the uk 25 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the sight was the same day after day trains pulling opentop wagons filled with coal would arrive at drax power station coal was the fuel on which the station ran but as that changes and the world moves from the dirtiest of fossil fuels to renewables and other lower carbon technologies so too do the makeup of draxs daily deliveries now more than half of draxs power is generated from compressed wood pellets instead of coal the trains still arrive daily but in addition to coal carriages more are pulling stateoftheart biomass wagons theyre not only the first of a kind theyre bigger than any others on uk railways moving a modern fuel coal and biomass are fundamentally different whereas coal is a durable fuel that can be left open to the elements without concern if compressed wood pellets are left in the rain they become unusable in short traditional hoppers the large opentop train wagons used to transport coal arent big enough nor do they provide enough protection for transporting biomass to deliver roughly 20000 tonnes of wood pellets to the power station every day it would need an entirely new railway wagon for this drax turned to lloyds register rail now ricardo rail  and wh davis  putting a lid on it one of the first things to solve was the open top the team designed a pneumatically operated roof for each wagon that could open and close on demand  providing easy access for loading but suitable protection for the pellets when in transit a similar system on each wagons base was introduced to make unloading just as simple a typical hopper design includes a wide roof that narrows into a shoot at its base for releasing fuel the drax wagons are different when they arrive at the power station automated flaps on their underside open in stages as they pass through the biomass unloading area this releases pellets into a sorter that delivers them into storage ready to be used for generation with this system in place each train can unload in under 40 minutes the big problem space a more significant hurdle to overcome was the question of space the obvious answer was to make the wagons bigger but uk railways have some of the most restrictive dimensions in the world thanks to its bridges and tunnels  some of which were constructed in victorian times so to get a similar efficiency out of the compressed wood pellet loads as previously obtained with coal the wagons needed to be bigger  not in physical size but in volume the team looked to the normally unused space at the ends of traditional wagons to house the braking and control equipment cubicle while the pipework was designed to run inside the wagons siding creating more inside storage space the result is a wagon with 116m 3 capacity almost a 30 increase in volume compared to the coal wagons they are not only the first ever bespoke biomass wagons theyre also the largest on uk railways bigger wagons better economy the impact of these wagons is felt beyond just the railway lines wh davis is the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer and relationships like this are not only good for drax but positively impact the wider uk economy a joint study by oxford economics for drax calculated that in the east midlands where wh davis is headquartered drax supports 1100 jobs through its supply chain and the resulting economic activity in total the report found drax had added 603 million to the local economy through indirect and induced means nationwide in 2015 that impact extended to a total of 124 billion in contribution to the uk gdp and more than 14000 jobs theres potential for this impact to be even greater roughly 14 trains arrive every day at the power station from ports in liverpool  tyne immingham and hull delivering up to 20000 tonnes every day to fuel the three of draxs six generating units that run on wood pellets but if all six are upgraded it will mean more biomass more deliveries and more trains the railways have always been a part of the power station and in the foreseeable future its likely they always will be tags technology  visit us  railways and trains  supply chain  engineering building a 21st century port 16 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy in its long history the port of liverpool has dealt with a number of industries its a port characterised by its ability to adapt to the needs of the time in 1715 it emerged as one of the worlds first ever wet docks in the 18 th century it was used as a hub for the slave trade when slavery was abolished in the early 19th century liverpool switched to bringing in the goods of the thriving empire such as cotton when goods like cotton dried up it switched to the fuel of the industrial revolution coal now as the world and the uk government moves away from fuels like coal and towards lowercarbon and renewable resources the port of liverpool needed to adapt once again gary hodgson chief operating officer at peel ports  explains about three years ago everyone was asking what happens after coal what happens after coal peel ports is one of the biggest operators of liverpools shipping infrastructure including liverpool port seeing that the future of coal was finite it recognised there was a need for a port that could bring in alternative renewable fuels at the same time drax was looking for a logistics partner to facilitate the importing of compressed wood pellets since 2009 drax power station had begun a process of upgrading its coalfired boilers to run on sustainable biomass sourced from huge wellestablished working forests  more than this it had plans to set up its own pellet manufacturing plants in the us south and needed to import large quantities of wood pellets the relationship with peel ports and liverpool was obvious this began a 100 million investment that helped transform the regions portstation transport infrastructure its about working in partnerships with companies says hodgson working this way helps develop solutions that really work the central element of the partnership between drax and peel ports was a radical redesigning of the technical infrastructure not only do compressed wood pellets have fundamentally different physical properties to other fuels like coal they are more combustible and need to be handled safely for the threemilliontonnecapacity facility that peel ports and drax wanted to build innovative supply chain solutions had to be developed shifting biomass in bulk the first challenge was getting the highdensity pellets off giant ships for this peel and drax designed a solution that uses an archimedean screw  a long tube with a spiral winding up the inside that allows liquids or materials that can behave like a liquid like wood pellets to defy gravity and travel upwards at the top of the screw the pellets are emptied onto a conveyor belt and carried to one of three purposebuilt silos tailored to safely storing thousands of tonnes of biomass  here the pellets wait until another conveyor belt deposits them onto speciallydesign biomass trains where they are transported across the peaks of the pennines to drax power station near selby in north yorkshire each step at the port is automated designed with supreme efficiency in mind by a team of drax and peel port engineers endtoend port to power station the whole process can take as little as 12 hours a new chapter for the north in the varied history of the port of liverpool the new facility is another chapter one that is helping transform the logistics infrastructure and the economic growth of the north west now open and operational the facility directly employs 50 people  around 500 additional contractors have worked on the project during its construction and development more than that its an investment in the countrys energy future it secures a fourth port for drax  three others are on the east coast  helping with security of supply we made this investment because we recognised this as the future of the energy mix of the country hodgson explain we cant just rely on one form of power  there has to be an energy mix and we see biomass as a key part of that tags biomass energy  sustainability  supply chain  ships and shipping  1 2 3 name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email
