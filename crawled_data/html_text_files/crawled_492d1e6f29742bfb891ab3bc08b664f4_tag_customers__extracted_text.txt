decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  investors  about us  customers  sustainability  biomass energy turning waste into watts 3 september 2020 sustainable bioenergy think of carbon emissions and the image that comes to mind is often of industrial sites or power generation  not of what we eat and what we throw away but food waste is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions globally food loss and waste from across the food chain generates the equivalent of 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  a year  or about 8 of total greenhouse gas emissions but what if there was a way to reduce those emissions and generate power by using discarded food and other organic waste like grass cuttings or nut shells a technology known as anaerobic digestion is increasingly making this idea a reality how anaerobic digestion works all organic waste products have energy in them but its tied up in the form of calories when food and vegetation rots microorganisms break down those calories into gases and other products methane or ammonium molecules exactly what these other products are depends on whether there is any oxygen present with oxygen the products are water co 2 and ammonia but remove oxygen from the equation and a very valuable gas is produced methane ch 4  the lack of oxygen is also what gives anaerobic digestion its name  when oxygen is present it becomes aerobic digestion during the anaerobic digestion process bacteria and other microorganisms break down organic matter gradually deteriorating complex polymers like glucose or starch into progressively simpler elements such as alcohol ammonia co 2 and ultimately ch 4  a biogas with huge potential as a fuel for other processes anaerobic power in practice the ch 4 produced in anaerobic digestion is incredibly useful as a fuel  turn on a gas hob or stovetop and its predominantly methane that provides the fuel for the flame the chemical compound is also the main component in the natural gas that makes up much of great britains electricity supply this means using anaerobic digestion to create ch 4 out of waste products turns that waste into a valuable power source but its not as simple as putting a bag over a rubbish tip and hoping for the best instead anaerobic digestion is carried out in large tanks called digesters these are filled with feedstocks from biological substances that can include anything from food scraps to alcohol and distillery waste to manure under the right conditions microorganisms and bacteria begin to digest and breakdown these substances into their basic elements the air quantity and temperature of the digesters is carefully regulated to ensure the microorganisms have the best possible environment to carry out the digestion of the feedstock with different types of feedstock and microorganisms operating best in different conditions the biogas created as a result of this digestion is then captured ready to be turned into something useful making use of biogas three different things can happen to the biogas produced during the course of the digestion locally it can be combusted onsite to provide further heat to regulate the temperature of the anaerobic digestion units or it can be combusted in a combined heat and power chp generator where it can generate electricity to be used on site  for example to power a farm  or sold through energy suppliers such as opus energy onto wider regional or national electricity networks this biogas electricity is an important element of great britains energy supply accounting for 6600 gwh or 73 of all power generated by solid and gaseous fuels in 2017 some of the biogas can even be cleaned to remove co 2  leaving behind pure methane that can be pumped onto natural gas grids and used to provide heat and power to households government research estimates a fully utilised biogas sector could provide up to 30 of the uks household gas demands  after the digestion process has been completed and the biogas has been removed what is left behind in the digester is a mass of solid matter called digestate this is extremely rich in nutrients and mineral such as potassium and nitrogen making it an excellent soil enhancer where anaerobic digestion is being used today today much of anaerobic digestion power is generated on farms  unsurprisingly given the ready access to biological waste material to use as feedstock as well as a potential source of electricity and heat it also gives farmers access to a new revenue stream by selling electricity or biogas as well as reducing utility and fertiliser costs while many of these installations are smaller scale some can get quite big linstock castle farm in north cumbria for example has a biogas facility with a 11 megawattmw operating capacity enough to power as many as 2000 homes at a time it was originally installed by the farmers as a more costeffective way of growing their business than buying more dairy cows there is however potential for anaerobic digestion to operate on an even larger scale in the us the city of philadelphia is developing a system that will link all newly built households together into a network where food waste is automatically collected and transported to a biogas generating facility closer to home northumbrian water uses 100 of its sludge the waste produced from purifying water to produce renewable power via anaerobic digestion  its estimated to have reduced the carbon footprint of the facilitys operations by around 20 and saved millions of pounds in savings on operating costs there have also been experiments with using biogas to power vehicles the biobus was the first bus in the uk to be powered by biomethane made from food sewage and commercial liquid waste and ran between bath and bristol airport but anaerobic digestion power is not a magic bullet it will be right in certain situations but not all if utilised effectively anaerobic digestion and biogas could fill a vital

 financial reports the ideas and tricks inside great britains plugs 15 july 2020 electrification it may be bulkier than its foreign cousins and its flat back might make it the perfect household booby trap but the uk plug is a modernday design marvel the uks g type or bs 1363 plug is a product of the postwar age but it has endured for the better part of a century ensuring homes business and sockets around the uk have access to safe usable electricity even as the devices they power have changed become smarter and more connected the threeprong g type remains unchanged but to understand how it came into being its worth first understanding what makes it such a unique and clever bit of design  including its role in achieving the ambitions of one of great britains pioneering female engineers and its moneysaving abilities what makes great britains plugs special the modern plug used across great britain as well as ireland cyprus hong kong and malaysia is a smarter and more advanced item than many of its contemporaries this is thanks to a number of key but often overlooked features a collection of international power point illustrations the first is its earth prong connecting the plug to the earth means if a wire comes loose in say a toaster and touches a metal part the device will short circuit as the electricity runs through to make contact with the earth rather than the entire item becoming electrified and dangerous the longer earth prong also plays the role of gatekeeper for the entire plug when a plug enters a socket the longer earth prong enters before any others pushing back plastic shutters that sit over the live and neutral entrances this means when there is no plug in a socket the live and neutral ports which actually carry electric current to devices are covered over making it very difficult for a child to push anything dangerous into the socket what makes the uk plug special click to download another clever feature inside the great british plug comes in the form of a fuse connected to the live wire if theres an unexpected electrical surge the fuse will blow and cut off the connected device preventing fires and electrocutions all packaged together the g type plug is far from the most compact version  yet it is hugely effective however these ideas didnt come together at the flick of a switch prewar plugs going back to end of the 19 th century the idea of owning devices you could move around your house and connect to the electricity circuit from different rooms was novel electricitys main role in homes was for lighting and was fixed into walls and ceilings with their cables hidden it wasnt until the rise of new electrical appliances in the 20 th century that the need for an easy way to plug electrical items into circuits arose a series of twopronged plugs first emerged in 1883 but there was no standardisation of design which would allow any appliance to be plugged into any socket that began to change in 1904 when us inventor harvey hubbell developed a plug that allowed nonbulb electrical devices to be connected into an existing light socket eliminating the need for the installation of new sockets by 1911 a design for a threepronged plug with an earth connection had emerged with manufacturer ap lundberg bringing the first of this kind of plug to britain by 1934 regulations appeared requiring plugs and sockets to include an earthing prong which eventually gave birth to a three cylindricalpronged plug the bs 546 bs 546 plugs the bs 546 was different from the modern gtype as they didnt contain a fuse and were available in five different sizes depending on the needs of the appliance from small 2 ampere plugs for lowpower appliances to a larger 30 ampere version for industrial machinery the different sizes and spacing of the prongs prevented lowpower devices accidentally being plugged into highpower outlets any chance of globally standardising plugs was doomed from the beginning as different companies in different countries all began developing their own plugs for their products as electricity rapidly gained uptake some attempts were made by the international electrotechnical commission iec to standardise plugs globally but the second world war put a stop to any progress electricity for the people great britain emerged from the second world war with its national grid standing strong  the challenge now was to make electricity not just the power source of factories and wealthy peoples homes but something available for everyone in the wave of new postwar construction other countries not seeing as much damage to their housing stock as the uk did not have the same opportunity to rethink domestic electricity to such an extent therefore the institution of electrical engineers iee assembled a 20person committee to consider the electrical requirements of the countrys new homes breaking new ground caroline haslett the sole woman on the committee caroline haslett had been breaking new ground for female engineers since before world war one in her career she worked with turbine inventor charles parsons and his wife an engineer in her own right and in 1932 became the first woman selected to join the iee her passion for electricity went so far as for her will to request she be cremated via electricity she had long believed in the potential for domestic electricity to improve womens lives by freeing them from the drudgery of preelectric domestic chores from handwashing clothes to cooking on coalfuelled stoves this included ensuring electricity was safe for the people using electricity around the home which in the 1940s was primarily women who also did the vast majority of childcare hasletts drive to make electricity safe in the home was pivotal in shaping many of the iees safety requirements for postwar domestic electricity including what have become the countrys standard plugs and sockets there was another factor aside from safety at play the material cost of the war meant copper the main material used in electrical wiring was in short supply so the iee came up with a new way of wiring homes that would in turn shape our plugs shifting fuses to save copper before the war british sockets were all separately wired back to a central fuse box it made sense because if something went wrong only the fuse connected to that socket would blow rather than the whole house however to cut the amount of copper used the iee instead proposed a clever workaround where the homes electrical sockets are looped up in one ring circuit with the fuses moved to the plugs themselves so if something went wrong in an appliance the fault would stop at the plug where the fuse could easily be accessed and replaced lighting fixtures remained wired in a separate circuit from sockets as they require less current to operate copper was short in supply during world war two this hidden fuse is a big differentiator from other plug types and adds to the g types safety credentials however the iee had to ensure people did not mistakenly insert older threeprong bs 546 plug styles without fuses into the sockets the answer was as simple as switching the socket holes from round to rectangle it means the older round cylinder prongs wouldnt fit into the slot designed for the rectangles found on plugs today the g type plug might seem cumbersome compared to the european or us models but in the 70plus years since its introduction its three prongs and inbuilt fuse has proved an enduring design that can power new devices and smart technology while remaining one of the safest plugs in the world tags electricity  customers  national grid  engineering  technology in a crisis people come first will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 14 may 2020 opinion this crisis will be remembered for many things many are not positive but some are inspiring around the world weve seen tremendous acts of kindness and witnessed remarkable resilience from people continuing to live work and to support one another the actions we are all taking as individuals businesses and communities will not only help us get through this crisis they will shape how we emerge from it at drax we are proud of the ongoing role were playing in supporting the uk and its essential services continuing to generate and supply the electricity needed to keep people healthy and the economy running it is what we have always done and it is what we will continue to do this is possible because our people have continued to carry out their important work in these uncertain times safely and responsibly my leadership team in the uk and us must continue to support them and we must also support the communities they are a part of employees drax power station show their support and appreciation for the heroic efforts of those within the nhs by turning one of its cooling towers blue at 8pm each thursday our communities are at the core of what we do and who we are they support our business globally and enable us to supply energy to the country we have a responsibility to do what we can to help them through this crisis to do this we have put together a covid19 support package totalling more than three quarters of a million pounds that goes beyond just financing to make a positive impact id like to highlight a few of these supporting communities in great britain and the us the robinson family collect their laptop at selby community primary school the closures of schools and the need to turn homes into classrooms has been one of the biggest changes for many families with children now depending on technology and the internet for schooling theres a very real chance those without access may fall behind with a long term negative impact on their education we want to ensure no child is left out so we have donated 250000 to buy 853 new laptops each with three months of prepaid internet access and delivered them to schools and colleges local to our sites across the uk  this has been implemented by drax working closely with headteachers as one of our local heads ian clennan told us schools dont just provide education  theyre a whole support system having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and classmates more easily too  which is also incredibly important at the moment in the us were donating 30000 to support hardship funds for the communities where we operate  our colleagues in louisiana are playing an active role in the community and in amite county mississippi they have helped provide ppe to first responders as well as supporting charities for the families worse affected helping businesses starting with the most vulnerable as an energy supplier to small and medium sized businesses smes we must act with compassion and be ready to help those who are most economically exposed to the crisis to do this we are launching a number of initiatives to support businesses starting with some of the most vulnerable its clear that care homes require extra support at this time we are offering energy bill relief for more than 170 small care homes situated near our uk operations for the next two months allowing them to divert funds to their other priorities such as ppe food or carer accommodation but it is also important we understand how difficult a period this is for small businesses of all kinds many of our customers are facing financial pressure that was impossible to forecast to help relieve this we have agreed deferred payment plans with some of our customers who are unable to pay in full we have also extended current energy prices for three months for 4000 customers of opus energy who have not been able to secure a new contract during this period the impact of this crisis will be long term so we made a significant twoyear charitable donation to business debtline  a dedicated phoneline and webpage will be provided to our small businesses customers offering free debt advice and

covid19 of 60 million principally in relation to its customers business full year expectations for the group remain underpinned by good operational availability for the remainder of 2020 in the customers business the consequences of covid19 are only now starting to become visible it is expected to result in reduced demand and a potential increase in bad debt which represents a major sensitivity particularly in the sme 4 market as a result drax has significantly increased its expectation of potential customer business failures and higher bad debt assuming the continued impact of covid19 throughout 2020 drax now expects a full year adjusted ebitda loss for the customers business the group will closely monitor the impact on the customers business and update the market accordingly in generation the groups expectations for the full year reflect a reduction in roc recycle prices resulting from reduced power demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio the performance of the generation business is dependent on the continuation of biomass deliveries to drax power station biomass generation is currently the most material area of activity for the group and a protracted suspension of the supply chain could lead to lower levels of biomass generation resulting in a reduction in the groups expectations for the full year at present there has been no impact from covid19 and the group has a good supply of biomass throughout the supply chain which continues to be robust and functioning well engineer climbs cooling tower at drax power station click to viewdownload generation during the first three months of 2020 draxs generation portfolio performed well with good asset availability and optimisation of generation underpinning a strong financial performance the business benefits from a strong forward power sales position through 2022 which combined with

on its own for over four months subject to managing deliveries to drax power station biomass generation has performed well in the first three months of 2020 whilst covid19 has not had any measurable impact on biomass generation to date a sustained reduction in electricity demand could result in a reduction in roc recycle prices in the current compliance period the group has adjusted its expectations for the full year but the precise impact will be dependent on the depth and duration of any reduction in demand drax expects to partially offset this through increased activity in system support services across its generation portfolio engineer at cruachan power station click to viewdownload the groups hydro assets have performed well particularly the pumped storage business primarily driven by activity in the system support services market as previously disclosed cruachan pumped storage power station was successful in a tender process run by the system operator to procure inertia and reactive power services the contract is worth up to c5 million per year over six years and is expected to commence during the second quarter of 2020 this was the first tender of its kind and reflects the growing importance of system support services as the generation market becomes increasingly supplied by intermittent renewable power sources the system operator is expected to conduct further tenders over the coming year thermal generation is performing in line with draxs expectations pellet production lasalle bioenergy wood pellet manufacturing plant in louisiana click to viewdownload pellet production has performed well in the first three months of 2020 at present there has been no disruption to production caused by covid19 although the state of louisiana is experiencing a high number of cases the semiautomated nature of the pellet production process limits the need for individuals to be in contact with each other and this has been enhanced by robust business continuity procedures to further reduce the risk to employees and contractors drax continues to monitor developments closely and notes that energy rail port and forestry are designated key sectors in the usa allowing continued operation customers the groups customers business which sells power gas and energy services to the ic 6 and sme markets has seen a significant reduction in demand as a result of covid19 the group has been working to assess the potential impact of this demand reduction the increased risk of business failure and bad debt the impact is expected to be most pronounced in the sme market which represents c30 percent of monthly billing the impact is expected to be partially mitigated by credit insurance in respect of certain customers balance sheet at 31

protection from the recent weakness in sterling to 2025 the group actively manages risk limits with counterparties providing forward foreign exchange contracts and the current weakness in sterling has led to the rebasing of a number of contracts resulting in the acceleration of cash flows from these contracts to the benefit of drax contracted power sales as at 16 april 2020 the power sales
