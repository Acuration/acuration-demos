fossil fuels generated 1878 gw totalling 5879 of the countrys power needs the carbon intensity of the power system fell to just 125gkwh during the seven days from christmas eve  almost 75 lower than a decade earlier when in 2012 the carbon intensity over the same period was 464gkwh a report by drax electric insights last year found that the uk had decarbonised its power grid over the previous

2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 3400 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan pellet production and supply drax owns and has interests in 17 pellet mills in the us south and western canada which have the capacity to manufacture 49 million tonnes of compressed wood pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 30 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses customers through its two b2b energy supply brands haven power and opus energy drax
