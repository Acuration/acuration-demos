power station nearly a third would pay more to go green but value for money is key 24 july 2015 new research commissioned by drax has revealed 31 of people are willing to pay nearly 10 more on average to support green energy they are clear this would be on top of the amount already paid through their energy bills to encourage the shift to lowcarbon energy sources the comres survey shows there is very little understanding of the proportion of an energy bill that goes towards green energy with the majority saying they dont know and 17 saying its more than 100 when the actual average amount on a bill was revealed to the respondents  62  a surprising number said they were prepared to pay more while the average was nearly an extra 10 one in five said theyd be willing to contribute more than an extra 20 but this willingness is conditional in return bill payers want to see renewables investment go into reliable technologies that are affordable and offer value for money the survey showed that 35 of britons ranked value for money or affordability for customers highest out of a range of options the government should prioritise including impact on the landscape impact on the local economy and ability to safeguard jobs reliability of supply had the third highest level of support with 15 ranking it in first place this research is published as the new conservative government reaffirms its commitment to going green and tackling climate change but is clearly emphasising this must be done in the most affordable way possible drax group ceo dorothy thompson said its clear a significant number of people are prepared to pay more to boost green energy in the fight to tackle climate change however its also clear they are not prepared to write a blank cheque and want guarantees that anything extra must be spent on green energy generation that is affordable and reliable at drax were leading europes largest decarbonisation project and already meeting these consumer asks as we take
