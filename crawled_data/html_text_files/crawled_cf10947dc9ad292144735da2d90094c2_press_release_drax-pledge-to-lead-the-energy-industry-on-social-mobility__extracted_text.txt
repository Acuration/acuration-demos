educational partners  and drax power station where she met postgraduate students from staffordshire university who were visiting to see how it has become europes largest decarbonisation project by converting two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal drax recently announced plans to become a carbon negative company by using innovative bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology negative emissions technologies like beccs are critical to the uk to achieve its net zero carbon targets whilst also creating new jobs and opportunities for clean growth andy koss drax ceo generation said companies like drax are developing and innovating using new technologies which will help to combat the climate crisis its important that communities are not left behind during the transition to a more sustainable future  making sure people have the right skills is a key part of that at drax we work with schools and colleges to provide exciting activities and experiences which help to boost education inspiring students by giving them access to new technologies from within the energy sector like electric vehicles which provides invaluable experience in 2019 drax worked with schools and colleges in the selby area to encourage more people to study science technology engineering and maths stem subjects by providing them each with an ev kit car for students to build and race liz ridley deputy principal selby college said our students have got involved in some incredible projects with drax such as building and then racing their own electric vehicle having the chance to work with such experienced and skilled engineers from drax on an exciting project like that was inspiring  it opened the students eyes to new possibilities and gave them some of the skills theyll need in the future to grasp the opportunities which come their way were looking forward to repeating the project again with more of our students this year justine greening discussing stem learning with drax generation ceo andy koss head of sustainable business vicky bullivant and staff and students of selby college drax has a significant network of partnerships with schools and colleges across its operations which encourages access to stem learning it also provides work experience opportunities apprenticeships and graduate recruitment schemes through its commitment to the social mobility pledge drax will publish a report later this year about its performance in delivering a positive social impact which will be used as an example of best practice in the energy industry

supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working
