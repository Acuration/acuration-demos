economy creates for clean growth  playing a vital role in helping the uk and the world to meet its climate targets over a decade ago drax started its journey to phase out coal we are now by far the biggest renewable power producer in the uk having converted twothirds of our generating units to use sustainable biomass instead of coal we have also reskilled our colleagues to use a renewable fuel and play an active role in the low carbon transition were exploring new carbon capture technologies which could enable us to further decarbonise and deliver negative carbon emissions  vital if we are to meet the climate challenge set out by the ipcc we plan to complete the phase out of coal well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline but we will still provide flexible dependable electricity by repowering our remaining two coal units to use natural gas  providing highly efficient flexible power when it is most needed this will not only help support the power grid as it transitions to a low carbon system it will also preserve the life of the plant and help protect jobs view research risk or reward securing a just transition in the north of england ippr north website on the drax group b2b

opus energy and haven power collectively the largest suppliers of renewable energy to uk businesses jonathan kini ceo of drax groups retail businesses says power suppliers have a responsibility to encourage and support businesses to be more sustainable and enable the uk to achieve the clean growth needed to meet our climate targets a recent haven power survey found 59 per cent of businesses think renewable energy is key to a cleaner future but 80 expect suppliers to take the lead in educating them about their renewable energy options jonathan kini said every business is different but it seems most want to be more sustainable and play a part in reaching our climate targets  they just need us the suppliers to help them achieve these aspirations by making renewable electricity the standard businesses become instantly a lot more sustainable which allows us to move the conversation with our customers on to talking about other steps they can take such as reducing their energy consumption generating their own renewable power or even using batteries opus energy has more than 2200 smes which are already generating their own renewable power  so the appetite for more sustainability is definitely there green gb week and the tenth anniversary of the climate change act is an ideal time for businesses to celebrate how far we have come in the last decade and also to

the scale of the challenge ahead if we are to tackle climate change  net zero carbon emissions by 2050 will be required to limit global warming to 15 or 2 degrees and drax is focused on creating a zero carbon lower cost energy future  since we converted two thirds of the power station in yorkshire to use biomass instead of coal we have transformed the business to become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe  delivering carbon savings of more than 80 and enough renewable power for around four million homes at the same time we are supporting sustainable forestry and improving the worlds longterm forest carbon sinks but were not stopping there we are now investing in a bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project  the first of its kind in europe which is due to get underway this autumn this technology has the potential to make the electricity we generate carbon negative reducing the co 2 accumulating in the atmosphere and helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change todays iea market report confirms bioenergy must play a critical role in delivering a secure and sustainable energy system of the future  it can support the grid as more

during the visit to ccaptures premises rachel reeves mp heard how a bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project is expected to get underway at drax power station this autumn which will be the first of its kind in europe the chemistry being used in the pilot project has been developed by ccapture  a leeds university spinout during her visit to the companys facilities rachel reeves who is mp for leeds west got to see some of the equipment which will be installed at drax power station for the pilot rachel reeves said this beccs project between ccapture and drax is groundbreaking if it works it could put yorkshire and the uk at the forefront of the race to develop the beccs technology which is essential to tackling climate change its very exciting and i look forward to hearing more as the pilot progresses beccs is vital to global efforts to combat climate change because the technology will mean the gases that cause global warning can be removed from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced this means power generation would no longer contribute to climate change but would start to reduce the carbon accumulating in the atmosphere drax the biggest power station in the uk near selby in north yorkshire is investing 400000 in the beccs pilot project with ccapture since it converted two thirds of the power station to use biomass instead of coal it has become the biggest single site renewable power generator in the country and the largest decarbonisation project in europe andy koss drax power ceo said this beccs pilot has the potential to make the renewable electricity produced at drax power station carbon negative if were serious about meeting our climate targets then negative emissions are a must  and beccs is whats going to get us there chris rayner founder of ccapture and professor of organic chemistry at the university of leeds added during the six month pilot at drax we aim to use our chemistry to capture a tonne of carbon a day and in the process demonstrate that if the project was scaled up we could achieve one of the holy grails of co 2 emissions strategies  negative emissions in power production thats where we believe the potential co 2 emissions reductions are likely to be the greatest ccapture is a spinout from the department of chemistry at the university of leeds established through funding from ip group plc ends

is the single largest user of sustainable biomass for power in the world  65 of the electricity it produced in 2017 was renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases a report by the energy technology institute in 2016 has suggested that by the 2050s beccs could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year in the uk  approximately half the nations emissions target the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 ccapture is a spin out from the chemistry department at leeds university and has attracted support from ip group the department for business energy and industrial strategys energy entrepreneurs fund and the co 2 capture project

technology to the test 3 october 2018 press releases hundreds of train movements each month at drax the uks biggest power station could soon be managed by the robot  reducing the time needed to checkin fuel deliveries by up to six hours each day the innovative pilot project at drax power station in north yorkshire will begin this month october within its commercial services team to see if the use of robotic process automation rpa can help manage the booking in of millions of tonnes of fuel delivered to the power station each year an average of 20 freight trains a day deliver the biomass and coal needed at drax so it can produce the power required to keep the lights on for around six million households predominantly a biomass power generator more than 70 of the electricity produced by drax is renewable with the majority of rail deliveries bringing wood pellets into the power station to supply its four biomass generating units the process of booking in each rail delivery requires the use of eight separate systems and involves 167 individual steps for one staff member to complete the task which takes them between four and seven hours to complete depending on the number of deliveries the team believes that the use of a purposebuilt digital robot which will handle the processes automatically could deliver the same result in just 40 minutes people would then be required to intervene when the robot identifies anomalies and further investigation or more detailed work is required they believe the time needed for manual intervention would be cut from up to seven hours per day to just one  giving individuals six hours back each day to focus on other more rewarding and engaging tasks andy koss drax power ceo said were constantly looking for new ways to improve our operations to increase efficiency and make staff roles as fulfilling as possible if we can use this robot technology to free up time and allow people to put their skills and expertise to good use so theyre not getting bogged down in the admin we all love to hate then i think well see all sorts of benefits both in terms of efficiencies but also in levels of staff motivation innovation is at the heart of our business  we were pioneers in transforming the uks largest coalfired power station to become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and are exploring the use of bioenergy carbon capture and storage to help us deliver negative emissions and tackle climate change the use of rpa is another example of how were using new technologies to deliver our strategy beth clifford commercial services supervisor who will be trialling the robot said potentially this could massively reduce the more mundane and tedious parts of my job having more time to focus on other tasks will hopefully mean i feel like im adding more value will enjoy my job more and can also take on new work which will be more interesting i cant wait to see how this goes and my colleagues are the same vicky harris commercial service centre manager who is leading the pilot project said well be measuring how effective the trial is and whether it delivers the savings we expect before a final decision is made about rolling it out but were confident this is going to be a really positive development and we will be scoping out other processes at the power station which we think would also benefit from this kind of automation the pilot project using rpa to bookin draxs rail deliveries will run for up to a month rpa is a form of automation using a software robot that mimics human actions  such as mouse clicks on a computer but does not engage in any decisionmaking or the kinds of thought processes associated with artificial intelligence ai which is the simulation of human intelligence by
