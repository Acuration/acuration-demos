most sophisticated artificial intelligence ai beat world champion lee sedol at a game called go  a chesslike board game with more move combinations than there are atoms in the universe before this defeat go had been considered too complicated for even the most complex computers to beat the top humans it was a landmark moment in the development of evermore sophisticated ai technology but the future of ai holds more than simply board game victories it is rapidly finding its way into all aspects of modern life prompting the promise of a fourth industrial revolution one of the areas ai has huge potential is in our energy system and this could have implications for generators consumers and the environment artificial intelligence playing traditional board game go concept the national grid gets wise earlier this year the uks national grid revealed its making headway in integrating ai technology into britains electricity system it announced a deal with googleowned ai company and creator of the go championbeating system deepmind which is set to improve the power networks transmission efficiency by as much as 10  one of the national grids most important tasks is maintaining the frequency of britains power networks to within 1 of 50hz  too high a frequency and electrical equipment gets damaged too low a frequency and you get blackouts managing this relies on ensuring electricity supply and demand are carefully balanced but this is made increasingly difficult with the growing number of intermittent renewables  such as wind and solar  on the grid the ability to process massive amounts of information from a wide variety of data points from weather forecasts to internet searches to tv listings  and create predictive models means ai can preempt surges in demand or instances of oversupply in short it can predict when the country will need more power and when it will need less more than this it can respond to these fluctuations in sustainable and lowcarbon ways for example it can automate demand side response where energy users scale back their usage at peak times for a reward similarly it can automate the purchasing of power from battery systems storing renewable energy such as those connected to domestic solar arrays these solutions which would see ai help to manage supply and demand imbalances would ease some grid management pressures while large thermal generators controlled by human engineers back up such automation with their continuing focus on maintaining grid stability through ancillary services the role of the smart city an undoubtedly large factor in the growing sophistication of ai in the energy space is the amount of energy use data now being captured and this has much to do with the increasing prevalence of smart devices and connected technology smart meters  which will be offered to every uk home by 2020  such as alphabets nest smart thermostat and startup verdigriss energy conserving internet of things iot devices are just a few of the emerging technologies using data to improve individuals abilities to monitor and optimise their household energy use but at scale information collected from these devices can be used by ai to help control energy distribution and efficiency across entire cities  and not just at a macro level but right down to individual devices the idea of a central computer controlling home utilities may seem like a soft invasion of privacy to some but when it comes to the energyintensive function of charging electric vehicles evs much of this optimisation will be carried out in public on street charge points  as ai and smart technology continue to grow more sophisticated it has the potential to do more than just improve efficiency instead it could fundamentally change consumers relationships with energy changing consumer relationships with energy startups in the energy space such as seattlebased drift  are exploring how trends such as peertopeer services and automated trading can be enabled through machine ai and give consumers greater control over their energy for a lower price the company offers consumers access to its own network of distributed and renewable energy sources currently operating in new york it uses ai to assess upcoming energy needs based on data collected from individual customers and locationspecific weather forecasts it then uses this to buy power from its network of peertopeer energy providers using highfrequency algorithmic trading to reduce or eliminate price spikes if demand exceeds expectation yet to be operational in the uk this sort of automation and peertopeer energy supply hints at the increasing decentralisation of energy grids  which are moving away from relying only on a number of large generators instead modern grids are likely to rely on a mix of technologies generators and suppliers and this means a more complex system which is precisely why automation from a central ai system could be a positive step not only could it bring about optimisation and efficiency but it could slash emissions and costs for consumers this silent automation may not have the same headlinegrabbing qualities as beating a world champion in their chosen sport but its impact to the country could be far greater tags artificial intelligence  investors  technology inertia the shock absorbers keeping the grid stable 12 september 2017 power generation from the comfort of home its easy to assume britains power is run across a consistently calm and stable system and while this is for the most part true keeping it this way relies on a set of carefully calibrated and connected tools these include frequency response  which keeps all electricity around the country on the same frequency  and reactive power  the quiet force moving electricity around the grid but theres another at play and at least by name its something youve probably heard of inertia system inertia is energy stored in spinning plant that slows down the rate at which frequency changes rapid changes in frequency can create instability in the system think of it like a car  inertia does the same job as shock absorbers in the suspension smoothing the sudden bumps and potholes keeping the wheels on the ground to maintain control however the changing nature of britains energy system is creating challenges in ensuring there is enough inertia available for a stable future grid the energy systems shock absorbers inertia describes objects natural tendency whether theyre moving or resting to keep doing what theyre doing until forced to change for example when you kick a pebble forces like friction and gravity prevent it hurtling endlessly off into the distance electricity generation in thermal power stations such as drax involves many moving parts none more important than turbines and generators in a turbine high pressure steam hits a set of blades which makes it spin a little like running a fan in reverse the spinning motion is used to power the generator which is a rotor wound in electrified copper wire transforming it into an electro magnet as this magnetic field passes through copper bars surrounding the rotor it generates electricity this spinning turbine has inertia if the fuel powering it is suddenly switched off it will continue to spin until it is stopped either by friction or by force every thermal generator in the uk system spins at 3000 rpm has inertia and generates electricity at a frequency of 50 hz in the uk all electricity is generated at the same frequency and crucially needs to remain stable  even deviations of 1 from this can damage equipment and cause blackouts managing frequency is done by managing generation if demand exceeds supply frequency falls too much supply and frequency rises national grid closely monitors frequency across the system and automatically instructs power generators like drax to respond to changes in frequency by dialing up or down generation and ensuring this change in generation is done smoothly and instantaneously relies on using inertia for example using the inertial forces of spinning generators power stations are able to respond instantly to requests to alter generation so inertia is important to the stability of the power system but because of the changing nature of todays grid we are facing challenges when it comes to inertia many forms of renewable generation arent built around spinning turbines and this means no inertia future challenges renewable sources like the wind turbines currently operational in the uk and solar pv  alongside energy imported from the continent do not provide inertia to the grid this means as the uk moves to decarbonise the energy system and rely on more intermittent and often embedded renewable energy rather than thermalgenerated electricity questions arise over where the grid will get the inertia needed to remain stable one possible solution is synthetic inertia while wind turbines do not contain inherit inertia modern suppliers are now enabling the machines rotating blades to create synthetic inertia  which can add extra power to the grid to support generation loss some regions including germany and quebec now require inertiageneration in turbines as standard  this cant be done with solar pv however smart grids and improving storage technologies have the potential to deal with a lack of inertia batteries which can absorb electricity when there is an oversupply and then release it again when demand is high can respond nearinstantly to fluctuations to help maintain the grids frequency there are of course renewable sources that offer natural inertia including hydro tidal and biomass generation but as the uk shifts to more renewable energy sources with no naturally occurring inertia these turbinebased generation methods will be vital in ensuring wider grid stability gas has an important role too as a lower carbon alternative to coal power and one that will increasingly shift from being the backbone of britains electricity system to playing a supporting flexible role this short story is adapted from a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within

investors  technology the silent force that moves electricity 31 august 2017 power generation in the early evening of 14 th august 2003 new york city in the midst of a heatwave lost its power  offices stores transport networks wall street and the un building all found their lights and phones cut off gridlocked streets and a stalled subway system forced millions to commute home on foot while those unable to make it back to the suburbs set up camp around the city it wasnt just the big apple facing blackout  what had started with several power lines in northern ohio brushing against an overgrown tree had spread in eight minutes to affect eight us states and two canadian provinces in total more than 50 million people were impacted 6 billion was lost in damages and 12 deaths were reported while a software glitch and the outdated nature of the power system contributed to the disaster the spread from a few highvoltage power lines to the entire north west was caused by a lack of reactive power  the pump powering electricity electricity that turns on light bulbs and charges phones is whats known as active power  usually measured in watts w kilowatts kw megawatts mw or in even higher units however getting that active power around the energy system efficiently economically and safely requires something called reactive power which is used to pump active power around the grid reactive power is measured in mega volt amps reactive  mvar  its generated in the same way as active power by large power stations but is fed into the system in a slightly different manner which leads to limitations on how far it can travel reactive power can only be effective locallyregionally  it does not travel far so across the country there are regional reactive power distributors servicing each local area imagine a long hose pipe that needs individual pumps at certain points along the way to provide the thrust necessary to transport water but power stations arent the only source of reactive power some electronic devices like laptops and tvs actually produce and feed small amounts of reactive power back into the grid in large numbers this increases the amount of reactive power on the grid and when this happens power stations must absorb the excess this is because although its essential to have reactive power on the grid it is more important to have the right amount too much and power lines can become overloaded which creates volatility on the network such as in the new york blackout too little and efficiency decreases think once again of the long hose pipe  if the pressure is too great the hose is at risk of bursting if the pressure is too low water wont travel through it properly this process of managing reactive power is at its heart one of ensuring active power is delivered to the places it needs to be but it is also one of voltage control  a delicate balancing act that if not closely monitored can lead to serious problems keeping volatility at bay across britain all electricity on the national grid must run at the same voltage either 400kv or 275kv  it is stepped down from 132kv to 230v when delivered to homes by regional distribution networks  a deviation as small as 5 above or below can lead to equipment being damaged or large scale blackouts national grid monitors and manages the nationwide voltage level to ensure it remains within the safe limit and doing this relies on managing reactive power ian foy head of ancillary services at drax explains when cables are lightly loaded with a low level of power running through them such as overnight when electricity demand is lower they start emitting reactive power causing the voltage to rise to counter this generators such as drax power station  under instruction from national grid can change the conditions in their transformers from exporting to absorbing reactive power in just two minutes this relies on 24hour coordination across the national grid but as our power system continues to evolve so do our reactive power requirements and this is partly down to the economys move from heavy industry to business and consumer services the changing needs for reactive power large industrial power loads such as those required for big motors mills or coal mines bring voltage down and create a demand for more reactive power explains foy now with more consumer product usage the demand for active power is falling and the voltage is rising the result is that drax and other power stations now spend more time absorbing reactive power rather than exporting it to keep voltage levels down in the past by contrast foy says the power plant would export reactive energy during the day and absorb it at night as britains energy system decarbonises the load on powerlines also becomes lighter as more and more decentralised power sources such as wind and solar are used to meet local demand rather than large power plants supplying wider areas this falling load on the power system increases the voltage and creates a greater need for generators to absorb reactive power from the system it highlights that while draxs role in balancing reactive power has changed it remains an essential service

generation during the penultimate week of june 2017 temperatures of thirty degrees celsius or more were recorded across the uk for five days straight it was the hottest continuous spell of weather in the country since the 70s and while this may sound like a minor headline its evidence of an important fact the world is getting warmer  according to the met office experiencing a very hot summer is now likely to occur every five years rather than every 50 by the 2040s more extreme heatwaves could become commonplace  and this could have serious consequences the extreme heatwave that hit europe in 2003 led to a death toll in the tens of thousands and placed extreme strain on the continent  not only on its people but on its infrastructure too if this weather is set to continue what does it mean for our electricity network electricity in extreme weather in hot countries electricity use soars in times of extreme weather due to increased use of cooling devices like air conditioning one us study predicted an extreme temperature upswing could drive as much as an 72 increase in us peak demand in northern europe including the uk where air conditioning is less prevalent  the effects of heat arent as pronounced but that could change in france hot weather is estimated to have contributed to a 2 gw increase in demand this june the uk which has traditionally only seen demand swings due to cold weather  is also beginning to feel the effects of extreme heat according to dr iain staffell of imperial college london for every degree rise in temperature during june 2017 electricity demand rose by 09 300 mw for example on 19 th june when temperature averaged 219 degrees celsius demand reached 32 gw on the 25 th  when temperatures dropped to an average of 159 degrees demand shrank to 266 gw in the very hottest days of summer this can mean the grid needs to deliver an additional 15 gw of power  equivalent to the output of five rapidresponse gas power stations or twoandahalf biomass units at drax power station and while heats effect on demand is considerable its not the only one it has on electricity the problem of cooling water in hot weather generating power doesnt just need fuel its also a waterintensive process power stations consume water for two main reasons to turn into steam to drive generation turbines and to cool down machinery both rely on raising the temperature of the water however this water cant simply be released back into a river or lake after use  even if nothing has been added to it  as warm water can negatively affect wildlife living in these habitats first it has to be cooled  normally via cooling towers  but in hot weather this takes longer and as a result power production becomes less efficient and in some cases plant output must be dialled back this had serious consequences for frances nuclear power plants during the 2003 heatwave these plants  which provide roughly 75 of the countrys electricity  draw water from nearby rivers to cool their reactors during the heatwave however these rivers were both too hot and too low to safely provide water for the cooling process which in turn led to the power stations having to either close or drastically reduce capacity coupled with increased demand france was left on the verge of a largescale black out situations like this are even more critical when considering heats effects on electricitys motorway the national grid how the hot weather impacts electricity when materials get hot they expand  this includes those electricity grids are made from for example overhead power transmission cables are often clad in aluminium which is particularly susceptible to expansion in heat when it expands overhead lines can slacken and sag which increases electrical resistance in the cables  leading to a drop in efficiency transformers which step up and down voltage across grids are also susceptible they give off heat as a byproduct of their operations but to keep them within a safe level of operation they have whats known as a power rating  the highest temperature at which they can safely function when ambient temperatures rise this ceiling gets lower and their efficiency drops  about 1 for every one degree celsius gain in temperature at scale this can have a significant effect overall grids can lose about 1 in efficiency for every three degrees hotter it gets as global temperatures continue to rise these challenges could grow more acute at uk power stations such as drax important upgrade and maintenance work takes place during the quieter summer months if this period becomes one in which there is a higher demand for power at peak times it could lead to new challenges investing in infrastructure and building a power generation landscape that includes a mix of technologies and meets a variety of grid needs is one way in which we can counter the challenges of climate change this will mean we can not only move towards a lower carbon economy and contribute towards slowing global warming but respond to climate change by adapting essential national infrastructure to deal with its effects tags electricity  investors  temperature the peoplepowered renewables revolution 24 august 2017 sustainable business for decades the electricity system was relatively straightforward power was generated by utility companies then sold and supplied to consumers and businesses but this is changing and the power industry may be on the verge of a revolution the falling costs and ongoing innovation around technologies like rooftop solar panels and domestic battery storage is enabling the rise of socalled prosumers  individuals businesses or institutions who not only consume electricity but produce it too according to the national grids 2017 future energy scenarios report this could lead to an almost entirely decentralised cleaner energy system but for this to happen prosumerism needs to be adopted at scale and this relies on technological innovation and changes to attitudes and behaviours the technology powering prosumers the biggest barrier to largescale adoption of prosumerism is technology although research and innovation pounds dollars and euros have been pouring into the technologies that make decentralised power generation possible there are still developments to be made solar is one of the most prominently used renewables by prosumers thanks to the relative affordability of rooftop solar systems even homeinterior giant ikea now offers solar panels and battery systems through a partnership with the uks largest solar company solarcentury but like wind turbines a more costprohibitive solution solar is an intermittent energy source which means domestic users may still need to access the grid to fill gaps in their own generation that is unless battery technology advances to a point where it can store enough solar or windgenerated electricity to fully power homes and businesses affordably  allyear round including in the dark still days of midwinter until then a prosumer who wants to have a reliable flexible selfsupply of energy needs to be able to call on a mix of renewable technologies  just as the national system does hamerton zoo in cambridgeshire for example generates its own energy via a mix of solar wind and biomass it then sells its excess electricity to an energy supplier there are signs that battery technology is starting to take off as an option for powering homes and businesses teslas powerwall is currently the closest home battery system to breaking through to mainstream consumers and many firms are following its lead for example in the uk elon musks company faces new competition from nissan which is partnering with us power firm eaton to build and sell home batteries in the uk  that two electric car manufacturers are in on the act is no surprise  it will be another revolution that of electric vehicles evs usurping the dominance of petrol and diesel models that is set to bring the boon that batteries need to become a popular choice for prosumers the government is also pushing innovation in the space with business and energy secretary greg clark announcing plans to invest 264 million into research in the sector over the next four years energy ownership but what could this mean for the business of electricity the national grid report suggests multiple commercial models will operate together to facilitate a decentralised prosumerbased energy system these would include homes and businesses who wholly own their energy systems as well as systems owned and operated by third parties such as aggregators managing energy or solarrental schemes communityowned projects could also play a role with small renewable energy facilities supplying residents such as the wind turbine in the cambridgeshire village of gamlingay  excess energy could also be sold back to the grid with any money earned reinvested in the community or in its renewable infrastructure similar schemes are already in place in both the business and consumer retail markets in 2016 for example opus energy  a drax group company supplying energy to uk businesses  bought almost 1 twh of power from over 2000 small renewable generators who use technologies such as anaerobic digestion solar onshore wind and hydro  opus energy then sells that power onto its predominantly small and mediumsized enterprise sme customer base this allows it to offer innovative tariffs such as the 100 solar power deal enjoyed by restaurant chain leon this summer haven power the drax retail business specialising in electricity supply for large corporate and industrial clients sells on power from over 20 small renewable generators  and it has a number of large clients such as water utilities who selfgenerate a lot of their own power and work with haven power to help manage their selfsupply against their demand from regional electricity distribution networks and further upstream national grid and power stations for large power generators an increase in prosumerism in the energy sector could mean likely overall demand may decrease which would mean a scaling back of operations however the increased volatility of the grid will give rise to the need for flexibility and for additional ancillary services like frequency response which ensures the countrys electricity is all operating at the same frequency this would most likely be delivered by flexible generators such as gas and biomass which would also be required for winter demand when more electricity is required and there is less wind and solar generation the role of government incentives another key part of the rise of consumer generated power will be government regulation and incentive schemes in the uk new measures have been put in place to encourage individuals to generate their own electricity  these intend to make it easier for prosumers to generate their own power through solar store it in batteries and sell it back to the national grid something which regulator ofgem claims could save consumers between 17 billion and 40 billion by 2050  this isnt the only scheme of its kind currently in action the uks renewable heat incentive rhi encourages homeowners and businesses to adopt lowcarbon heating offering to pay a certain amount for every kwh of renewable heat generated feedin tariffs on the other hand also offer financial incentives  with electricity suppliers paying prosumers for the energy they produce themselves is my home or business big enough the prosumer revolution will not happen overnight selfgeneration and selfstorage of power and the installation of renewable heat systems are more suited to larger properties or those linked up to communitybased projects so for many people living in properties they own rent or in social housing the idea of becoming a prosumer could right now be a little farfetched and although there is evidence that the national transmission grid is already decentralising nor will this revolution mean the complete eradication of all centralised utilities through gradual improvements in smallscale energy generation power storage smart technology and government policies it will become an increasingly affordable and efficient way for communities businesses and institutions to go green tags biomass energy  investors  wind power do electric vehicles actually reduce carbon emissions 19 august 2017 electrification electric vehicles evs are often seen as a key driver towards a greener future indeed transport accounts for roughly a quarter of the uks greenhouse gas emissions and seriously affects air quality in major cities to tackle pollution problems governments around the world are implementing ambitious policies to promote the electrification of transport and phase out ice internal combustion engine vehicles the uk and france both plan to ban the sale of petrol and dieselonly cars by 2040 while india is setting an even more ambitious end date of 2030  added to this are evs growing popularity with drivers there are now almost 110000 electric cars and vans on uk roads spurred on by lowering battery costs and a growing range of models including plugin hybrid vehicles evs now account for 2 of new registrations switching to evs is an obvious way to massively cut pollution in areas of dense traffic but the question remains  how clean are evs on the broader scale when you look at the electricity used to charge them electric vehicles are getting cleaner evs dont give off the same exhaust emissions as engines but the power in their batteries has to come from somewhere follow the flow back from the car through the charging point all the way back to the power station and its likely some of that electricity is coming from fossil fuels and that means emissions they werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell a researcher at imperial college london and author of electric insights  a study commissioned by drax that analyses electricity generation data in britain now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk evs are delivering much better results he continues in fact yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to greener electricity generation today they are twice as efficient as conventional cars take the tesla model s in the winter of 2012 producing the electricity for a full charge created 124g of carbon emissions per km driven roughly the same as a 2l range rover evoque now the carbon intensity of charging a tesla has nearly halved to 74gkm in winter and 41 gkm in summer as the uk continues to break its own renewable energy records for smaller evs the results are even better the nissan leaf and bmw i3 can now be charged for less than half the co 2 of even the cleanest nonplugin ev the toyota prius hybrid so the current outlook for evs is hugely positive  but as their numbers continue to increase will the demand they add to the grid put their clean credentials at risk will evs accelerate electricity demand the national grid suggests there could be as many as nine million evs on uk roads by 2030 which could lead to an additional 410 gw of demand on the system at peak times  this in some cases could lead to a rise in emissions electricity demand in britain typically peaks between 6pm and 10pm when people arrive home and switch on lights and appliances if you were to charge your ev between those evening hours the emissions would be 8 higher than reported in the chart above if you charged between midnight and 6am they would be 10 lower today this demand is met by the existing mix of power stations which last quarter included more than 50 renewable and lowcarbon sources  but when there are sudden spikes in demand above this typical usage the national grid must call in the help of carbonintensive reserve generators such as coalpowered stations polluting diesel generators are also on standby around the uk ready to turn on and feed into regional distribution grids at a moments notice to meet the challenge of peaktime ev charging less carbon intensive power generation storage and smart power management systems are needed these include rapid response gas power stations such as the four drax ocgts planned to come online in the early 2020s as well as gridscale batteries homebased batteries and demandside response schemes as the share of intermittent renewable capacity on the grid increases more backup power needs to be available for when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine keeping our future fuels clean a future increasingly relying on backup generators is far from inevitable especially if the use of smart technology and smart meters increases by analysing electricity costs and countrywide demand smart meters have the potential to ensure evs only charge outside peak times unless absolutely necessary when electricity is more likely to come from renewable or lowcarbon and cheaper sources if the grid continues to decarbonise through advances in renewable technologies and lowercost coaltobiomass conversions the potential of evs electricity coming with associated emissions is diminished even further there is no doubt that evs will make up a significant part in the future of our mobility that they will also play a part in the future of cleaning up that mobility is as good as assured but on this journey its imperative we keep our eyes on

for an hour over lunch on wednesday 7 th june more than 50 of britains electricity came from renewables it was only the second time this had ever happened  the first had come just two months earlier in april the second quarter q2 of 2017 was a period largely made up of firsts for britains electricity system while there were only two instances of renewable power tipping the 50 mark between april and june overall wind solar biomass and hydro energy made up more than a quarter of all britains electricity for the first time ever these findings come from electric insights  research on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by top university academics over the past year the quarterly report has shown breaking renewable records is becoming the new normal for britains electricity last quarter was no different here we look at the key findings from q2 2017 and what they mean for the changing nature of the energy sector more than half great britains electricity came from renewables twice wind solar biomass and hydro accounted for 515 of the uks electricity for an hour on 7 th june  generating 191 gigawatts gw combined with nuclear power and imports from france lowcarbon output was a record 286 gw  a massive 89 of total demand this followed 30 th april when britains electricity edged over the 50 renewable mark for a shorter but no less significant period the percentage of renewables making up our power supply is set to grow as additional renewable capacity comes onto the grid there is currently 6 gw of additional wind capacity being constructed in britain solar capacity has already hit 124 gw  more solar panels than analysts thought would be installed by 2050 plans to convert more of britains coal units to biomass will increase the availability of renewable power further still electricity was cleaner than ever there was a key date in the history of coal during q2 on 21 st april britain recorded the first full day it had gone without burning any coal since 1882  the year holborn viaduct power station became the worlds first coalfired public electricity station while that date is symbolic of the uks shift away from coal in practice it means carbon emissions are also dropping to historically low levels carbon intensity reached a new low in q2 averaging 199 gkwh over the quarter  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year for context carbon intensity averaged 740 gkwh in the 1980s and 500 gkwh in the 2000s an important indicator of this falling carbon intensity is that britains electricity now regularly drops below 100 gkwh and reached an alltime low of 71 gkwh on the sunny and windy sunday of 11 th june electric cars are cleaner than before one of the greatest decarbonisation challenges moving forward is how we transform transport electrification is the primary driver of change in this sector and q2 saw britain hit a significant milestone as the total number of electric vehicles evs in the country surpassed 100000 the potential of evs in cleaning up transport is significant but there are also concerns they could in some cases increase co 2 levels due to pollution from power stations however as the last quarters data shows evs are in fact twice as carbon efficient as conventional cars thanks to the amount of renewable and low carbon electricity on the system according to our analysis looking at a few of the most popular models evs werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell from imperial college london but now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk they are delivering much better results the most solar power a quarter has ever seen the longer days in q2 enabled solar power to become a key source of electricity  and for eight hours over the quarter it generated more than all fossil fuels combined it also set output records by supplying 25 of total demand on 8 th april and producing 891 gw on 26 th may while wind remains the largest source of renewable energy generation in the uk solars influence is growing  especially as decentralisation of the power system continues to proliferate  of britains 124 gw solar capacity 57 is concentrated in 1400 solar farms of around 5 mw each while the rest is distributed across almost one million rooftop arrays in homes businesses and other institutions in fact during june 10 of all britains electricity came from these sorts of decentralised sources  sources of power not on the national grid this is unlikely to spell a fundamental shift to an entirely decentralised power grid in the short term but it does hint at the changes the sector is seeing from its carbon profile to its variety to its flexibility britains power system is changing  and thats a good thing explore the data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by a team of academics from imperial college london led by dr iain staffell and

until april 2020 3 august 2017 opinion renewable technologies now account for a larger proportion of great britains electricity sources than ever before and theyre growing the first quarter of 2017 was another recordbreaking one for renewables biomass wind and hydro all registered their highest energy production ever while solar recorded its highest ever peak output draxs own generation is now 68 renewable and accounted for 17 of the countrys overall renewable generation in the first half of 2017  enough to power over four million homes weve made great progress over a relatively short period however with every step forward we need to ensure our approach is helping enhance stability in a power system increasingly made up of intermittent renewables what will become more and more important for security of electricity supply will be technologies that respond quickly to spikes in demand and drops in supply  for example when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing in short what the power system of today needs is flexibility the flexibility factor a recent report by imperial college london for the committee on climate change ccc highlights the significance of increasing systemwide flexibility in achieving decarbonisation imperials analysis emphasises the cost savings this can have projecting that flexibility in a 50 gkwh system  the lowerend of the cccs 2030 target for a decarbonised system  could save between 71 billion and 81 billion a year in system integration costs without flexibility the costs of balancing the system will rise significantly this in turn could lead to the current fastpace of grid decarbonisation stalling the need for flexibility in our energy system is too financially and environmentally significant to ignore but what sources and technologies will we need to create it the next big thing in system flexibility there are a number of technologies that are often touted as key to a flexible system including storage principally batteries interconnectors rapid response gas plants renewable technologies such as biomass and demand side response all are indeed crucial to a flexible future but alone each one still has its challenges millions of pounds are being invested in battery and storage research  both in the ambition of driving down costs and in increasing capacity however there is a way to go on both fronts for example consider the scale at which batteries must operate the storage domes at drax power station hold up to 300 kt of wood pellets  enough to generate roughly 600 gwh of electricity at the current battery prices of around 350 per kwh it would cost 210 billion to replace their capacity with batteries  even if prices fell dramatically we are still talking about a 60 billion price tag greater interconnection is something energy industry regulator ofgem and the national infrastructure commission nic are calling for but national grid has voiced concerns that wholesale market price swings could lead to changes in power flows across interconnectors this in turn could impact great britains system however they remain a potential solution to solving flexibility not just for their ability to deliver power but in their ability to deliver ancillary services  something which will become increasingly important in a more volatile power system for example if built hinkley point c will have some of the biggest single units on the system 1600 mw which will create more demand for ancillary services such as frequency response technologies such as biomass and gas are well placed to provide this as well as quickly respond to changes in demand and supply they also highlight why it is important to consider each megawatt coming onto the system not all technologies offer electricity and system stability tools ancillary services and so each one should be assessed from a whole system cost perspective  and according to how they fit into the overall supply mix each type of generation can bring diverse services so to achieve true flexibility we cant rely on one technology  instead we will need to rely on many better together to achieve full system flexibility we will need a coordinated combination of sources this means maintaining a stable system that includes increasing levels of intermittent renewables and flexible generation sources like biomass and gas that will supply baseload megawatts plug the gaps left by intermittent renewables and provide ancillary services the four rapid response gas power plants we are developing will play a key role once they are consented secure capacity market contracts and become operational in the early 2020s they will be crucial to plugging gaps in power supply as a result of unfavourable weather conditions creating a system that is sufficiently flexible will make britain much more effective in responding to stresses such as very low wind speeds over several hours  unexpected power station unit outages or high demand more than this it will keep us on track to meeting carbonreduction challenges for an affordable decarbonised power system we need to be stable to be stable we need to be flexible and to be flexible we need to be varied and we need to work together tags decarbonisation  investors understanding the pounds behind the power will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 26 july 2017 opinion editors note on 21 st september 2017 the board announced that will gardiner would replace dorothy thompson as chief executive drax group as of 1 st january 2018 read the announcement to the london stock exchange  this story was written by will two months prior to that announcement and remains unedited below the uk electricity market used to be simpler coal gas and nuclear plants generated energy and fed power into the national grid  retail companies then delivered that power to homes and businesses across the country thanks to regional distribution network operators  today its not as simple the energy system of great britain has grown more complex  it needed to the push to lower carbon emissions led to the introduction of an array of different power generation technologies and fuels to the energy mix these all generate power in different ways at different times and in different conditions added to this are government schemes that have changed how this is all funded in short our electricity market is now more complex drax group has transformed itself to align with this new system it is now an energy company with complementary operations across its supply chain  sourcing fuel  generating 17 of great britains renewable power and then selling much of that electricity directly to business customers in the retail market  this has fundamentally changed both how we do business and the financial mechanisms behind the business where are we now draxs financial and operating strategies are very much interlinked shifting how we generate energy changes how we generate revenue the company is structured according to a set of distinct business segments each of which is treated in a slightly different way the generation business drax has adapted its business model to the uk governments regulatory framework which through successive administrations has broadly promoted investment in renewable and low carbon power generation three of our six electricity generation units  accounting for 68 of our output in the first half of 2017  have been upgraded from coal to produce renewable electricity from sustainable compressed wood pellets  these units are a core part of britains renewable energy mix guaranteed income from the third unit conversion has given us a significantly higher degree of earnings visibility and reduced our exposure to commodity prices h1 2017 107 twh total generation 73 twh biomass generation our coal generation units no longer provide 247 baseload electricity this means we primarily use our coal generation as a support system when the grid needs it we can ramp up and down coal generation responding to demand and ancillary service needs  our renewable generation units do this too ultimately however our longterm goal is to convert the remaining coal units  either to renewables or to gas our research and innovation team is currently looking into how we might be able to do this but early indications show that coaltogas conversion could be an attractive option for delivering flexible and reliable generation capacity for the uk drax power is doing well and generated 137m of ebitda in the first half of this year a 51m increase compared to the first half of 2016 we are confident about the projected growth of our power generation business to 300 million ebitda by 2025 that plan is aided by our move into rapid response gas  a technology that can meet urgent needs of a power system that includes an increasing amount of weatherdependent renewables two of the four rapid response gas projects were developing are ready to bid for 15year capacity market contracts this coming february they are designed to start up from cold faster than coal and combined cycle gas turbine ccgt units these smallyetpowerful plants will respond to shortterm power market price signals and be capable of providing other ancillary services to further enhance security of supply these projects should add an attractive additional source of earnings to our generation business they also will have attractive characteristics as a significant element of their earnings will come from the capacity market  guaranteed government income for 15 years the retail business we directly serve the retail market through haven power  which supplies renewable electricity primarily to industrial and commercial customers last week we announced that haven power was able to breakeven six months ahead of schedule retail is an area were growing and in february 2017 we acquired opus energy  the largest nondomestic uk energy company by meters installed outside the big six this has had a marked effect  today were the largest challenger b2b energy retailer in the uk there is a healthy and regular annuity coming in through the existing retail business and we believe this can generate 80 million of ebitda by 2025 which together with our growing biomass supply business will make up a third of our earnings we demonstrated good progress in the first half of the year earning 11m of ebitda the biomass business our two operational wood pellet manufacturing plants in louisiana and mississippi are progressing well they are both still ramping up to full production and have seen marked improvements in pellet quality and production we are looking to grow our us business and as part of this well need to build on the recent addition of lasalle bioenergy with further acquisitions expansion will grow our capacity for the selfsupply of pellets from 15 to 30 of drax power stations requirements adding an additional one million tonnes of production in the second half of 2017 we expect the profitability of drax biomass to increase lasalle will be commissioned in the first half of 2018 and reach capacity in 2019 whats next the energy landscape continues to change and well need to change with it phasing out coal entirely is priority number one for this well continue to look at options how and when we can convert more units to sustainable biomass depends on trials that we are conducting at drax power station during 201718 the right government support would also make further conversions cost effective we also recognise that its important to look at alternative possibilities for our remaining coal units this is why we are seeking planning permission to convert one or more of our 645 mw megawatt coal units to 1300 mw of gas such an upgrade would be at a discount to a newbuild combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power station of equivalent capacity and thats simply because we would use much of the existing infrastructure and equipment another major prospect is in the technology space and so were continuing to invest in research and innovation batteries and storage are a huge opportunity for us  both in how they could benefit our retail customers and how they could provide solutions for largescale centralised energy systems in short its an area with huge potential we welcome the governments recent initiatives designed to stimulate the development of battery technology  as well as encourage the use of electric vehicles drax has gone through a period of considerable change and that will continue as we meet the uks lowcarbon energy demands we are improving the quality of our earnings reducing our exposure to commodities and positioning to take advantage of future opportunities as we told investors in june if we deliver on these plans we can expect 425 million of ebitda in 2025  tags electricity generation  financial reports  gas  investors  supply chain  will gardiner  1  11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
