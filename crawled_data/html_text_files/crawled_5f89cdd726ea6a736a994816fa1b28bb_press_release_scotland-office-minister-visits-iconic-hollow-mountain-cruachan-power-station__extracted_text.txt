power station scotland office minister visits iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station uk government minister for scotland david duguid has visited drax groups iconic hollow mountain cruachan power station to understand its critical role in unlocking scotlands renewable power potential and hear more about the energy companys plans for a major new hydro project 18 june 2021 cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built inside a hollowedout cavern 1km inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain despite construction starting in 1959 its reversible turbines are still at the cutting edge of energy storage technology enabling the plant to act like a giant water battery uk government minister for scotland david duguid l and drax groups ian kinnaird r with cruachan power stations generating units behind them click to viewdownload its turbines pump water from loch awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid the stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this process helps stop wind farms being paid to turn off when they are generating excess power helping scotland to be greener whilst cutting household energy bills as part of the visit drax groups scottish assets  generation engineering director ian kinnaird also outlined the companys exciting work on plans to build a new second underground pumped hydro storage power station at the cruachan complex he said the uk has led the world in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable power and scotland has been at the forefront of this renewables revolution drax wants to go even further and unlock scotlands full renewable potential by expanding the iconic cruachan pumped hydro storage plant in argyll these innovative plants act like giant water batteries soaking up excess wind and solar power so our homes and businesses can use more green energy when we need it most cruachan power station turbine hall click to viewdownload the construction of a second underground power station at cruachan would be one of the largest infrastructure projects in scotland in recent decades creating jobs and bringing much needed investment to argyll as glasgow prepares to host cop26 in november cruachan shows how countries around the world can harness their full renewable potential create jobs and cut energy bills for consumers when all four of its generating units are operating at maximum capacity the plant can supply enough flexible power for around 800000 homes uk government minister for scotland david duguid said it was fascinating to tour the underground facility and see firsthand how it produces high volumes of power in such an environmentallyfriendly way we need to embrace the kind of technology employed at drax and the next smart systems and flexibility plan due for publication shortly will outline steps to remove barriers to smart technologies its all in line with the uk governments ambitious climate and decarbonisation commitments as we strive to cut our emissions by nearly 80 per cent by 2035 drax groups ian kinnaird l with uk government minister for scotland david duguid r at cruachan power station click to viewdownload drax acquired cruachan alongside the galloway and lanark hydro schemes in 2019 helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible renewable power generation ends media contacts aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07849 090 368 laura davidson office of scretrary of state for scotland e email protected editors notes pumped hydro storage power stations act like giant water batteries  storing excess energy when there is an oversupply of power and then releasing when the country needs it most this is especially useful in supporting wind and solar generation storing excess renewable power to be used later instead of going to waste despite being a key supporting pillar for intermittent generation from wind and solar power no new pumped storage plants have been built in britain since 1984 drax is currently progressing plans for a second underground power station at the existing cruachan complex which could double its capacity main photo drax groups ian kinnaird l with uk government minister for scotland david duguid r at cruachan power station  viewdownload  about

third parties power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation

pellets biomass a year the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses
