source providing 10 of the worlds primary supply  but more than just being a plentiful energy source it can and should be a sustainable one and because of this its also a focus for innovation biomass currently powers 48 of great britains electricity through its use at drax power station and smaller power plants but this isnt the only way bioenergy is being used around the world people are looking into how it can be used in new and exciting ways powering selfsufficient robots what type of bioenergy algae and microscopic animals hows it being used to power two aquatic robots with mouths stomachs and an animaltype metabolism designed at the university of bristol the 30cm rowbot is modelled on the water boatman insect the other which is smaller closer resembles a tadpole and moves with the help of its tail both are powered by microbial fuel cells  fuel cells that use the activity of bacteria to generate electricity  developed at the university of the west of england in bristol as they swim the robots swallow water containing algae and microscopic animals which is then used by their fuel cell stomachs to generate electricity and recharge the robots batteries once recharged they row or swim to a new location to look for another mouthful is there a future its hoped that within five years the rowbot will be used to help clean up oil spills and pollutants such as harmful algal bloom  there are plans to reduce the tadpole bot to 01mm so that huge shoals of them can be dispatched to work together to tackle outbreaks of pollutants purifying water whats used human waste hows it being used the omni processor  a low cost waste treatment plant funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation  does something incredible it turns sewage into fresh water and electricity it does this by heating human waste to produce water vapour which is then condensed to form water this water is passed through a purification system making it safe for human consumption best of all it does this while powering itself the solid sludge left over by the evaporated sewage is siphoned off and burnt in a steam engine to produce enough electricity to process the next batch of waste is there a future the first omni processor was manufactured by janicki bioenergy in 2013 and has been operating in dakar senegal since may 2015 a second processor which doubles the capacity of the first is currently operating in sedrowoolley washington us and is expected to be shipped to west africa during 2017 closer to home and drax power station a similar project is already underway northumbrian water was the first in the uk to use its sludge to produce renewable power but unlike the omni processor it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid resulting in a total saving in the utility companys carbon footprint of around 20 and also multimillions of pounds of savings in operating costs flying across the atlantic whats used tobacco hows it being used most tobacco is grown with a few factors in mind  taste and nicotine content being the most important but two of the 80 acres of tobacco grown at briar view farms in callands virginia us are used to grow tobacco of a very different sort this tobacco can power aeroplanes  us biofuel company tyton bioenergy systems is experimenting with varieties of tobacco dropped decades ago by traditional growers because of poor flavour or low nicotine content the lownicotine varieties need little maintenance are inexpensive to grow and flourish where other crops would fail the company is turning this tobacco into sustainable biofuel and last year filed a patent for converting oil extracted from plant biomass into jet fuel is there a future in the hope of creating a promising source of renewable fuel scientists are pioneering selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to increase tobaccos sugar and seed oil content in 2013 the us department of energy gave a 48m grant to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  in partnership with uc berkeley and the university of kentucky to research the potential of tobacco as a biofuel powering repopulation of a disaster zone whats used wood exposed to radiation by the fukushima nuclear meltdowns hows it being used last year it was announced that german energy company entrade energiesysteme ag will set up biomass power generators in the fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity using the lightly irradiated wood of the area its hoped they will help japans attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear accident entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 995 which could help japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy is there a future the prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy and solar power  tags biomass energy  investors  sustainability  technology how much does it cost to charge my iphone 4 april 2017 electrification its difficult to imagine life without electricity its ubiquity means its easy to forget the incredible feats of science engineering and infrastructure that allow us to undertake a task as simple as plugging in our smartphones in fact so expansive are the nationwide infrastructure networks that lie beyond the wall socket keeping a topoftherange mobile phone charged for a year can cost as much as 67p to work out how much electricity an appliance uses theres a relatively straightforward equation we can follow of power kilowatt kw x time hours used  energy transferred kilowatthour kwh to then work out how much that costs in real terms we need to take the wattage of the appliance worked out in kilowatts as this is the metric electricity tariffs are measured in multiply that by the number of hours it is being used for then multiply that figure kwh by your energy tariff  in the case of an iphone it works out like this a typical iphone charger is 5w 0005 kw  and a full charge from empty takes a maximum of three hours a conservative estimate the average electricity tariff in the uk is 15p per kwh which leads to an equation that looks like this 0005 x 3 x 015  000225 a day and if we assume that an iphone owner might fully charge their phone roughly 300 times a year the total annual sum amounts to a princely 675p theres no other way of looking at this  its a very low number but its important to think about this number in scale extrapolate it across the number of devices in the country and it grows significantly a 2016 study on uk smartphone owners suggests three quarters of all adults have smartphones which would put the country total somewhere in the region of 40 million per day thats 600 mwh of electricity needed to power their smartphones thats the equivalent of 200 mw of power generation or enough to power 565000 households for one hour how much electricity do my other appliances use unfortunately not all appliances are as modern efficient and cost effective as your average smartphone in fact when it comes to household appliances charging your apple iphone samsung sony or windows phone device is one of the least powerhungry activities you can undertake a bigger offender is your fridgefreezer but not because they need a lot of electricity to run instead it comes down to the fact it is plugged in and drawing power for a significant amount of time a fridge freezer is plugged in for 24 hours a day seven days a week and even though modern fridge freezers have good energy efficiency mechanisms to limit their usage they can very easily use 427 kwh a year leading to an annual cost of over 50 to put that into perspective heres how much your other household items cost per hour according to the same equation used earlier whats new as our homes workplaces and industries have become more energy efficient the country as a whole is using less power nowhere is this more evident than in our lighting  today the common led lightbulb uses just 17 of the power needed for an incandescent lightbulb of equivalent brightness the news has been full of stories about how much more power 4k tvs use compared to high definition tvs but because most of us buy a tv once every decade or so replacing your 2007 1080p full hd tv with the uks bestselling 4k model and watching it for an hour will actually use around 70 less power this continued trend towards efficiency has had a marked effect on the countrys use of power in march 2017 the government published its latest electricity demand data for the uk  showing the countrys power needs falling all the way through to 2020 but then something interesting happens from 2026 the forecast shows us beginning to use increasingly more power than we are due to in 2017 to the point where by 2035 were using more power than we are today  19 more why is this one possibility is electric cars in 2015 electric vehicles evs consumed 025 twh of power but thats set to grow significantly in its future energy scenarios report published in 2016 national grid projected evs will consume 19 twh in 2035 but it has already said it believes its projections might be understated  in short the ev revolution could drive demand far higher which leads to the question where is all of this extra power going to come from  understanding the smart home our future energy needs are not just going to be met by more electricity generation capacity  they will also be assisted by something closer to home with the introduction of smart meters  pinpointing the devices and appliances in our homes that use the most electricity will become more widespread more than this well be able to identify what time of day theyre using the most energy and when we might be able to turn them off with this information we can optimise our usage and save money and while cutting down your yearly phone charging budget from 67p to 50p might not sound like much if three quarters of the country are joining you those pennies can quickly add up tags customers  energy prices  investors  technology annual report and accounts 2016 smart energy solutions  qa 10 march 2017 annual report view the drax group plc annual report and accounts q do you think performance got better or worse in 2016 a financially ebitda was in line with our guidance although below 2015 this principally reflects very challenging commodity markets and the removal of the climate change levy exemption we were able to partly offset the impact of these factors with a focus on flexible system support in the prompt and balancing markets ancillary services and improving retail profitability all of which are important parts of our strategy to develop broader noncommodity exposed earnings operationally 2016 was another good year across our business but particularly in generation where the team completed a significant outage programme and on the regulatory front the european commissions approval of the cfd meant we could complete the final stages of the upgrade to our third biomass unit q what were the most significant changes for the group in 2016 a the most important change was the new group strategy which gives us all a very clear direction for the future and will see drax become a broader business across our markets  pellet supply generation and retail  the acquisition of opus energy will strengthen our retail offer and our plans to build four rapid response gas power stations will plug the gaps at times of system stress the new group strategy is underpinned by new people and it strategies which are crucial to its successful delivery haven power has also seen significant change with the arrival of ceo jonathan kini he along with his team have been working to ensure we are well placed to continue growing and to boost our retail offer with the recent acquisition of opus q how do you think 2017 will be different to 2016 a the focus will be on continuing to deliver good performance right across the group but there will also be changes as we work closely with the opus team to ensure we create the best possible retail offer for the uks smes drax power will be progressing the ocgt gas projects  and it will be an exciting year for drax biomass as they look to secure acquisitions of pellet mills and opportunities to export compressed word pellets to other markets everyone across the group will see further evidence of the new strategy rollout particularly in the form of the people and it strategies q how does diversifying into gas fit with your aim to replace coal with renewable generation at drax a it complements it perfectly the european commissions approval of the cfd enabled us to complete the upgrade of half the power station to run on compressed wood pellets in place of coal and in 2016 65 of the electricity we generated at drax was renewable  the job is not yet done and with the right conditions we will upgrade the remaining coal units we can do this in just two to three years  when the conditions are right the planned gas power stations will not be run to produce baseload power but as rapid response units to plug the gaps at times of system stress for example when wind and solar fail to contribute whats required they will also be part of a solution that can accelerate the end of coal in the uk  q can you explain the acquisition of opus wouldnt it have made more sense to grow haven a we acquired haven in 2009 when it was an sme focused business since then the business has grown significantly by principally focusing on the ic market to provide a route to market for around half the electricity drax power produces although it retains a relatively small sme presence opus  like haven  is a challenger business and brings with it 265000 customer metered sites largely smes opus also supplies gas  which for the first time will see us having the ability to provide a dual fuel offer something that is vital for many smes opus gives us immediate scale in the sme market and we think the complementary nature of the haven and opus models can provide a compelling challenger retail proposition for our customers q have you got the right team and systems in place to ensure that opus will join the group with minimal disruption a yes jonathan kini  who leads our retail business has a great depth of experience in sme markets and integration he has strengthened his team to ensure we have the expertise required to make this a very successful transition as opus becomes a member of the drax family however im in no way complacent about the challenges thats why we developed a plan to embed opus covering everything from it to communications its vital we get this right and that our new colleagues become part of delivering our new group strategy and share in our values clearly i also want both haven and opus customers to continue experiencing high levels of service along with the benefits of a more comprehensive retail offer q how is drax power different to when you joined a in many ways drax is now a very different place to what it was when i joined drax more than ten years ago the fact that in 2016 65 of our output was renewable is something im very proud of and right across the power station you can actually see the difference that using compressed wood pellets has made huge storage domes  specially designed train wagons  and a visitor centre and guides explaining the latest chapter in the drax story essentially today the power station operates as two power stations a reliable flexible renewable generator producing electricity for businesses and homes and a fossil fuel generator providing system support and security of supply q you have highlighted the role that drax coal units can play in system support and ancillary services  what is this and why is it important a increasing levels of intermittent renewables and inflexible nuclear present the grid with a challenge and for drax opportunities when the grid needs capacity our coal units have the flexibility to turn on and off and ramp up and down responding to demand as weather and time of day determine the availability of wind and solar it is already common place for drax to twoshift the coal units using them to provide flexible responsive power rather than baseload but its not just about generation  a wellfunctioning grid needs other services too 2017 will see drax seeking further opportunities to provide the electricity grid with this increasingly important system support q did the result of the uks eu referendum have any impact on the business a our business model is largely unaffected by the decision to leave the eu we will continue to generate and sell power in the uk we purchase a significant amount of the fuel we require in foreign currency and our longterm hedging strategy  five years ahead  has protected us against any negative impacts of exchange rate fluctuations for the mediumterm q has the change in the uk government resulted in any different signals being sent out to the renewables sector a i think that still remains to be seen we have to look at the huge changes that have happened in government since the eu referendum as a potential opportunity for us as we continue to make the case for investment in further biomass upgrades what is clear is that the focus is still very much on affordable energy  in 2016 imperial college london and the economic consultancy nera published new research that we commissioned it showed that when whole system costs are factored in biomass is the cheapest large scale renewable technology if government applied this method of support to future cfd auctions consumers could benefit by up to 22 billion as we take forward our new strategy we will also be clearly communicating our plans for rapid response gas power stations and how the system support they will provide contributes to decarbonising the uks energy system q what are the latest plans to convert the remaining generating units that run on coal a we have now delivered on our original strategy to upgrade three generating units to run on compressed wood pellets however we would like to do more and have consistently said that with the right conditions we stand ready to convert further units the transformation weve been through has meant weve learnt a huge amount over the last few years and theres no doubt that for future upgrades we can carry them out quicker and more costeffectively q why do you think questions around the sustainability of biomass continue to be raised a i think many companies involved in the sourcing and supply of sustainable products will face questions in this area what we will do is continue to be open and honest about all aspects of how our business operates including sustainability  much of that evidence can be seen in this annual report  from our own stringent sustainability policy  to how we comply with the uk governments sustainability legislation criteria  however we are never complacent and for example each new pellet supplier to drax is fully and independently audited before a contract is signed and our existing suppliers are audited at least once every three years q which other business roles do you have outside of drax and how do they help the group a im a nonexecutive director at the eaton corporation and also the court of the bank of england i think its important to have roles outside the business as long as they allow you to get the balance right and these do so clearly they should in no way be a distraction from the day job but worth an investment of time that allows you to see how others operate and whether there are lessons that we can learn or best practice that we can adopt q whats the feeling around the board table a id say its one of excitement at the opportunities our new group strategy and acquisitions present for the future while theres obviously satisfaction that weve delivered on what we initially set out to do  upgrade three generating units to run on compressed wood pellets there is certainly no feeling of job done in the months ahead the board will rightly want to see clear and positive

investors the biomass carbon story matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 23 february 2017 sustainable bioenergy there is an important difference between carbon dioxide co 2  emitted from coal and other fossil fuels and co 2 emitted from renewable sources both do emit co 2 when burnt but in climate change terms the impact of that co 2 is very different to understand this difference it helps to think small and scale up it helps to think of your own back garden one tree every year for 30 years imagine you are lucky enough to have a garden with space for 30 trees three decades ago you decided to plant one tree per year every year in this example each tree grows to maturity over thirty years so today you find yourself with a thriving copse with 30 trees at different stages of growth ranging from one year to 30 years old at 30 years of age the oldest has now reached maturity and you cut it down  in the spring of course before the sap rises  and leave the logs to dry over the summer you plant a new seedling in its place through the summer and autumn the 29 established trees and the new seedling you planted continue to grow absorbing carbon from the atmosphere to do so winter comes and when it turns cold and dark you burn the seasoned wood to keep warm burning it will indeed emit carbon to the atmosphere however by end of the winter the other 29 trees plus the sapling you planted will be at exactly the same stage of growth as the previous spring contain the same amount of wood and hence the same amount of carbon as long as you fell and replant one tree every year on a 30year cycle the atmosphere will see no extra co 2 and youll have used the energy captured by their growth to warm your home harvesting only what is grown is the essence of sustainable forest management if you didnt have your seasoned selfsupplied wood to burn you might have been forced to burn coal or use more gas to heat your home over the course of the same winter these fuels would have emitted carbon to the atmosphere which endlessly accumulates  causing climate change not only does your tree husbandry provide you with an endlessly renewable supply of fuel but you also might enjoy other benefits such as the shelter your trees provide and the diversity of wildlife they attract no added carbon this is a simplified example but the principles hold true whether your forest contains 30 trees or 300 million  the important point is that with these renewable carbon emissions provided you take out less wood than is growing and you at least replace the trees you take out you do not add new carbon to the atmosphere that is not true with fossil fuels it is true that you could have chosen not to have trees you could instead build a wind turbine or install solar panels on your land that would be a perfectly reasonable choice but youll still need to use the coal at night when the sun doesnt shine or when the wind isnt blowing worst of all you dont get all the other benefits of a thriving forest  its seasonal beauty and the habitat thats maintained for wildlife of course the wood drax needs doesnt grow in our garden we bring it many miles from areas where there are large sustainably managed forests and we carefully account for the carbon emissions in the harvesting processing and transporting the fuel to drax  thats why we only achieve
