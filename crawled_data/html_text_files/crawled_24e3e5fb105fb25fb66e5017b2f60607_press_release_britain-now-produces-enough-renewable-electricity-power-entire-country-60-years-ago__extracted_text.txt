power the entire country 60 years ago 21 february 2018 britains renewable output grew 27 last year to 96 twh 92 of electricity came from coal in 1958 compared with just 7 in 2017 50 of power generation in 2017 came from low carbon sources the renewable electricity produced in 2017 could have powered the whole of britain in 1958  the year that brought us blue peter the hula hoop and paddington bear 60 years ago 52 million brits used 91 twh of electricity  all of which could have been powered by the 96 twh of renewable electricity produced last year according to the latest electric insights report  published by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax the report also showed that half of britains electricity come from lowcarbon sources in 2017 coal and gas output fell by a tenth and wind farms posted a record year carbon emissions from electricity consumption fell 12 last year a saving which amounts to taking one in seven of britains cars off the road of all grid electricity supplied last year 25 came from biomass hydro wind and solar wind generation was the major factor in helping to increase britains renewable output  it produced 15 of the countrys electricity up from 10 in 2016 and more than twice the output of coal wind generation grew 45 between 2016 and 2017 and higher wind speeds and the completion of several onshore and offshore wind farms contributed to recordbreaking wind output over the year electrical appliances which typically make up 25 of domestic demand were considered luxury items in 1958 when a washing machine cost around 60 this was a big outlay considering that the average salary was 569 and the average family home cost 2253 dr iain staffell from imperial college london explained generation from coal continues to fall and is now the preserve of colder months as opposed to being the mainstay of generation as it was in 1958 60 years ago the power system emitted 93 million tonnes of co 2  in 2017 renewables managed to produce the same amount of electricity by emitting just three million tonnes the share of fossil fuels on the system has fallen from 80 to 50 since 2010 and the effect that shift in the balance of power is having in terms of lowering our carbon emissions is striking andy koss drax power ceo said this report shows the great progress we have made in terms of decarbonising the energy sector we can expect more days without coal on the system as we gear up to the uk coming off coal in 2025 and we are proud of the work that we have done to support this as the largest decarbonisation project in europe as the share of fossil fuels falls and more intermittent renewables come onto the system we need to think about how we maintain stable secure power supplies flexible responsive technologies such as biomass help to support and balance the grid as more renewables come on to the system drax has upgraded half of its power station in north yorkshire from coal to use sustainable biomass with plans to convert a further generating unit this year it is now the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe ends

academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the report analyses raw data that are made publicly available by national grid and elexon which run the electricity and balancing market respectively released four times a year it will focus on supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them along with dr iain staffell the team from imperial included professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributed expertise in energy policy the work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry the q4 2017 report has an additional coauthor luke clark renewable uk the quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website electricinsightscouk which provides live data from 2009 until the present
