drax power station inside the machine shop 24 april 2017 power generation a klaxon sounds and a crane big enough to lift 160 tonnes moves slowly across the inside of a cavernous warehouse below a team of engineers stand around a turbine spindle the size of a double decker bus but weighing four times as much at 65 tonnes waiting for the cranes descent around them other engineers work on similarsized equipment one uses a wrench the size of an arm another programs a computerised lever to carefully strip millimetres from a piece of steel its just a normal day inside drax power station s machine workshop for the last 15 years this workshop has been refurbishing repairing and manufacturing tools and equipment for use at the power station  a fact that sets drax apart from other stations like it were envied by a few stations because we do most things inhouse says turbine engineer and head of the workshop andrew storr were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people storr set up the workshop in 2001 after being asked to reverse engineer a replacement set of governor relays components that help regulate the flow of steam going into the turbines for one of draxs steam turbines today its a thriving centre of activity filled with heavyduty machinery and ingenious engineers a look inside the workshop when youre manufacturing spares its not a matter of going down to our machine shop and just saying make one of those youve got to have the correct grade of material the correct size the correct certification for the material  you cant just have a scrappy piece of steel that you find its got to have paperwork with it to say its certified up to whatever its supposed to be says storr turbine bearings need to be bored to size using a horizontal borer that very accurately shaves out the lining of the inner bearing getting it right is incredibly important explains storr if its made too large it causes the turbine shaft to vibrate if its made too small the bearing becomes too hot and the white metal will melt and pour out the bearing we need to avoid both of these issues at all cost the inside of the turbine blading needs to have seal strips administered by hand as theyre delicately made to limit any damage to the spinning shaft should they touch each other despite the wealth of equipment at the disposal of the team in the shop success depends on the skill of the engineers using it there are three 160tonne cranes in the turbine hall each installed before the turbines were built this meant the construction companies who erected the turbines could lift all heavy components into place with ease due to their size they move slowly it takes approximately 20 minutes for the largest hook to travel from the ground all the way to the top says storr in mechanical engineering its sometimes necessary to fit one part inside another and once these parts are assembled they must stay locked together and not come apart storr says one way the team does this is by shrinking some components and for this they use liquid nitrogen the team places the component that needs to fit inside another into a bath of liquid nitrogen and shrink it at 190 degrees celsius once shrunk the team assembles the two placing the now smaller component into the larger one eventually the inner part warms up to ambient temperature and grows in size making the fit very tight and preventing them from coming apart explains storr in the past drax would send the work they now do in the machine shop to companies off site and because all other power stations in the area would do the same thing wait times would often be long and the quality of the output could vary when we do it inhouse i can keep my eye on it says storr i can reprioritise things depending on what is going to be needed back on the turbine first  weve got 100 control over it we can make sure everythings hunkydory tags technology  drax power station  electricity  electricity generation more power per pound 23 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy as the country moves towards a lower carbon future each renewable power generation technology has its place wind solar hydro and wave can take advantage of the weather to provide plentiful power  when conditions are right reliable affordable renewable power but people need electricity instantly  not just when its a windy night or a sunny day so until a time when storage can provide enough affordable capacity to store and supply the grid with power from ample solar and wind farms the country has to rely in part on thermal generation like gas coal and biomass reliable and available on demand yes but renewable low carbon and affordable too it can be a year ago a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers at imperial college london highlighted how a balanced mix of renewable technologies could save bill payers more than 2bn  now publicly available ofgem data on which its newly published renewables obligation annual report 201516 is based reinforces the case for government to continue to support coaltobiomass unit conversions within that technology mix why because out of all renewables deployed at large scale biomass presents the most value for money  less public funding is required for more power produced renewable costs compared drax power stations biomass upgrades were the largest recipient of renewable obligation ro support during the period 201516 the transformation from coal to compressed wood pellets has made drax the largest generator of renewable electricity in the country and by a significant margin drax power station produced more than five times the renewable power than the next biggest project supported under the ro  the london array dr iain staffell lecturer in sustainable energy at the centre for environmental policy imperial college london and author of electric insights  who has analysed the ofgem data commented based on ofgems renewables obligation database the average support that drax power station received was 4305 per mwh generated this compares to 8870 per mwh from the other nine largest projects biomass receives half the support of the uks other large renewable projects which are all offshore wind the average support received across all renewable generators in the ro scheme  which includes much smaller projects and all types of technology  is 58 per mwh that is around 15 per mwh more than the support received by drax ending the age of coal drax group isnt arguing for limitless support for coaltobiomass conversions and drax power station being the biggest most modern and efficient of power stations built in the age of coal  is a special case but if the ro did exist just to support lots of biomass conversions like drax but no other renewable technologies then in just one year between 201516 1bn of costs saving could have been made for the public purse drax power station may be the biggestsingle site recipient of support under the ro  but it does supply more low carbon power into the national grid than any other company supported by renewable obligation certificates rocs in fact 65 of the electricity generated at its selby north yorkshire site is now renewable thats 16 of the entire countrys renewable power  enough to power four million households thanks to the support provided to drax by previous governments the current administration has a comparatively cost effective way to help the power sector move towards a lower carbon future biomass electricity generated at drax power station has a carbon footprint that is at least 80 less than coal power  supply chain included drax group stands ready to do more  which is why research and development continues apace at the power plant rd that the company hopes will result in ever more affordable ways to upgrade its remaining three coal units to

will know what its used for 3 march 2017 power generation chances are wherever youve been today youve never been further than a few feet away from gypsum its equally likely however you dont know what gypsum is you might not recognise it in its raw form  a soft chalky white mineral made up of calcium and sulphur but you will recognise the things its used in buildings food fertilisers  the list goes on its a hugely versatile mineral and while its naturallyoccurring its also a byproduct of electricity generation where does gypsum come from gypsum is formed naturally when lakes or lagoons with a high amount of calcium and sulphates evaporate this evaporation leaves behind layers of sediments which eventually harden into a mineral gypsum which can then be mined its also sometimes found on the earths surface where it can give rise to spectacular natural environments like the white sands desert in new mexico or slowly crystallise underground into formations like the cave of the crystals in chihuahua mexico but gypsum can also be formed as a byproduct of industrial processes  electricity generation being one when coal is used to generate electricity it releases sulphur at drax power station flue gas desulphurisation fgd technology removes up to 90 of that sulphur dioxide  which takes the form of gypsum  a lot of it in 2016 80000 tonnes of gypsum was produced and sold by drax today that gypsum is sold to just one supplier who uses it to make plasterboard but there are a number of varied uses for this versatile mineral construction one of gypsums most abiding uses in human society has been in construction in ancient times it was used widely for making cement or as a construction material in its own right  the interior of the great pyramids of giza are lined with gypsum today its still a prominent feature of the building industry gypsum is the key component in plasterboard which is produced by passing a gypsum paste between two sheets of paper when the paper sets the resulting gypsum sandwich forms the tough and ubiquitous plasterboard today all gypsum created at drax power station is used to create plasterboard its also a core ingredient in several forms of cement making and can  in its paste form  be applied as a plaster covering for existing walls and surfaces agriculture after its use in construction gypsums most important historical use is as a fertiliser gypsum is rich in sulphur which plants  in particular oil and legume crops  need for healthy growth its the same reason why volcanic soils are particularly fertile gypsums high calcium content also helps strengthen plant cell walls and aids in the absorption of nutrients more than just helping the plants gypsum fertiliser can also help reduce soil toxicity and improve its structure by allowing water to be absorbed and to drain more efficiently arts beyond its many practical uses gypsum also has a long history in the fine arts gypsum in its plaster form often called plaster of paris after the montmartre hill where it was originally quarried can be used for sculpting and decorative ornamentation when left in its solid form gypsum is known as alabaster and has been used for millennia in monumental sculpting often as a softer alternative to marble alabaster sculptures and statues have been produced by ancient societies in egypt syria and byzantium gypsum powder has also been used as an ingredient in colours in delicate inks used in medieval illuminations as well as common blackboard chalk cooking and brewing the presence of nutrients like calcium in gypsum makes it an important ingredient in several recipes including in making certain kinds of tofu but it has a more interesting role in brewing the taste of beer is determined in part by the hardness of the water used in the process the higher the mineral content in water the harder the water soft water can be used to make sweet beers like pilsners but if you want to make a bitter beer gypsum can be added to harden the water with its high sulphur and calcium content which in turn strengthens the flavour its worth mentioning however that only naturallyoccurring gypsum is used in cooking and brewing gypsum acquired through desulphurisation processes is only used in industrial contexts like building medicine as it is malleable and sets quickly sometimes within just a few minutes gypsum has proven an ideal material for sculpting casts and splints and anyone who has braces fitted knows only too well the unpleasant feeling of a plaster mould settling over the inside of their mouths thats gypsum too with an end date fixed for coal  its already a diminishing form of electricity generation  this in turn means less gypsum will created as a byproduct and sold to industry and while this means therell be less of a connection between what your home is built with and what powers it it wont mean that youre any less connected to gypsum every day gypsum has been a part of life for a long time unlike coal its one that will stick around tags technology  drax power station  coal getting more from less 22 january 2017 power generation what can we do to ensure plant integrity increase plant efficiency and ultimately get more megawatts out of the door for less this is a question at the heart of luke varleys work varley is the lead engineer in the turbine section at drax power station  a team who look after arguably the heart of the plant the steam turbines that drive electricity generation as well as managing daytoday maintenance he and a team of engineers and craftspeople within tsg deliver the major overhaul activities on the turbines to keep them running efficiently and safely but as the uks largest power station its a site that needs to run all the time  any maintenance needs to fit around that consistent operation for the most part this happens in the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the station can be temporarily shut down to carry out repairs even though varley recognises theres a large cost involved in shutting part of the plant down it leads to longer term gains were taking on work to improve efficiency because the end result is were using less fuel to get more electricity he says a small percentage increase in biomass efficiency can represent huge cost savings he adds but as a relatively new fuel biomass  in draxs case compressed wood pellets  presents a unique challenge for the engineers working with it the biomass challenge in the days when drax ran only on coal at full load as part of a stable national grid turbine maintenance meant facing common problems where we had problems which were familiar from one hundred years of turbine history  we knew what to look for varley explains but now the plant generates within a far more demanding network that needs flexibility and produces more than half its power using compressed wood pellets theres a need for greater efficiency  it means more innovative thinking and new challenges for example most plants in the industry take each turbine offline to maintain it every eighttoten years but using wood pellets means the turbines need to be as efficient as possible and this means more regular inspections every four years we go back overhaul the module and maximise its efficiency again thats new to the industry within the uk nobody else is doing that he says despite the challenges varley isnt fazed the technical and management challenges they both come with experience he explains his engineering experience began before his start at drax as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game destined for grease my dads been in engineering all his life hed be building a car and id be dragged to a scrap man to help take an engine block out of an old car so he could use it at home varley says i was destined to always be covered in grease so when it came to beginning his career varley was set on what path he wanted to take two options presented themselves working as a trainee draftsman in an air conditioning company or taking an apprenticeship with national power an early visit to drax helped make his decision even though id been around engineering with my dad as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game he took the apprenticeship which led him to a number of power plants but the impression of the drax turbine hall never left him later in my career i spent a lot of my time going around different power stations and in grandness and scale ive never come across anything that matches what weve got at drax so when this job came about and i was asked to join i said sounds good to me today his position of getting more megawatts out of the door for less whilst ensuring safe operation of the plant is one that comes with a lot of responsibility and is built on a long history the guy who was doing this job before me took a lot of pride in it he used to say ive been here man and boy i was even here when it was built and i wouldnt have retired until i knew it was in safe hands varley says i suppose thats the best recognition i could get really tags technology  drax power station  careers  turbines the problem solver power generation one of the things i like about my job is working through the challenges we get on a daily basis and finding a solution explains adam nicholson process performance section head at drax power station  that eagerness to find solutions makes him the ideal candidate for his current job managing daytoday improvements at drax im responsible for the team which ensures the plant operates at optimum efficiency he says his team make sure the turbines boiler emissions combustion and mills are not just working but running as smoothly as possible its a job that brings up constant challenges its ultimately what i became an engineer for he says to follow that problemsolving thirst through earlier in his career nicholson was involved in one of the plants biggest problemsolving missions converting it from running exclusively on coal to also run on compressed wood pellets  it was a unique test  one that required starting from scratch there wasnt a bank of existing knowledge that nicholson and his fellow engineers could call upon we did a lot of testing to learn more about the fuel he explains we had to understand how to get it to the boiler how to process it before we put it in how to convert the mills and then how exactly the combustion would work some of that learning involved experimenting with unorthodox solutions to complex problems the dog tunnel one of the big problems with biomass is you cant expose it to as high a temperature as you can coal nicholson explains this presented a challenge when it came to pulverising it before fuel at the power station can be combusted a set of mills pulverises it into a fine powder using a ring of rotating heavyduty balls  this fuel powder is then dried inside the mill with a mix of hot air drawn from the boiler house and cool air but a fundamental difference between coal and biomass meant this process had to change with coal the air can enter the mills at about 300 degrees with biomass if you get much above about 180 degrees the biomass will set on fire says nicholson as part of the rd phase he needed to work out a way to cool the mills down on a temporary basis we all took a big gulp and thought how are we going to do this part of the problem was the existing ducts werent big enough to deliver enough cool air to the mills to lower their temperature to a safe range nicholson improvised a solution it was known as the dog tunnel he says if he could get a temporary larger air supply to the mills it could provide more cool air and lower the overall temperature allowing the testing to be conducted so he found a company that could supply industrial flexible ducting which he connected to a larger cold air duct and then fed through to a mill to deliver more cool air as its informal name suggests the result didnt look like much but it worked it didnt look like a finished solution but the theory behind it was sound for occasions like this we had to think lets just do it prove it and then we can work on a permanent solution thats ultimately what i became an engineer for to follow that problemsolving thirst through the next challenge now the power station is successfully producing more than half of its electricity from biomass nicholsons daytoday responsibilities lie in ensuring safe operations and driving process efficiencies to do this he keeps tabs on the combustion process  for example by using thermal imaging cameras to monitor the inside of the furnace  and tweaks it to get as much energy as possible from the biomass fuel but at a site as large and complex as drax there will always be new engineering challenges that require inventive thinking often you dont know how youre going to do something until you do a bit more work and try and understand the problem nicholson says were nowhere near the end of our learning curve tags technology  drax power station  careers taming the electric beast power generation its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance says gareth newton as a mechanical engineer in one of the power stations maintenance teams hes a man with a closer eye on that animal than most and when something does need fixing or improving its his job to make sure it happens its a task that keeps him busy on top of the teams ive got a team servicing the filter fans ive got a team doing a filter change on a biomass unit then ive got another company doing a pipework replacement on a discharge line for me somebody else is doing a service on the belt cleaners newton says listing half a typical days responsibilities on any given day he oversees a number of different teams that carry out a variety of maintenance tasks and more often than not that list is a long one hes a part of the materials handling team who deal with all the material arriving and leaving the power station this includes the biomass and coal fuel coming in and the ash gypsum and other byproducts from the generation process going out it means he has a hand in the maintenance of almost all parts of the plant from the compressed wood pellet storage domes to the boiler with such a broad perspective of such a complex plant he knows its not always the things you expect to fail that need fixing monitoring the machine its a machine  its being used its not a showpiece or something in a museum its real and every now and then it will throw a gear out and stop he says those failures dont always happen to a schedule  so when something does go wrong it can be unexpected you might have a 50000 gearbox sat in the stores ready and waiting to replace a faulty one but it will be the 10 probe on a conveyer belt you never thought would break that fails and holds the whole system up he says when something like that happens he adds its not always about having the exact tool that can fix it right there and then its about thinking out of the box the biggest part of this job and i think its one of the biggest parts of heavy industry engineering is not fixing or modifying things with what youve got he says its about using what you havent got to try and engineer your way out he continues if you havent got a tool or part that you need can you make something new can you find a way to make it work or do you even need it its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance keeping your hands dirty newton grew up around engineering his father ran a salvage yard and precious metals business and would bring back broken bits of machinery for the kids to fix as toys ive always had dirty hands he says its something thats stuck with him today even though he now spends a large proportion of his time monitoring jobs at a computer or moving between teams its the practical side of the job that keeps him interested the best part of the job is working with your hands and even though the demands of the living animal that is drax can sometimes keep him on site longer than his working hours its a beast hes happy to look after its a job you either love or hate if you didnt enjoy the engineering side you probably wouldnt like it because theres a lot of ingenuity and thinking on your feet needed he says but there are a lot of jobs out there that i wouldnt want tags technology  drax power station  careers the toolmaster power generation before drax power station was a part of andrew storrs career it was a part of his local environment when i was at school in selby they were building the second half of the station he says we could see them building the cooling towers out of the classroom windows but it wasnt until a careers advisor brought an old cine film of the power station into class that he considered working there part of the film was them stripping the turbine and i watched it and thought i want to do that he says today storr does more than strip the turbines hes part of the engineering team that oversees them  a job that needs to be taken seriously if the turbines off forget the rest of it were not generating electricity  he says weve got to make sure the turbine and the generator are absolutely as bulletproof as possible because weve only got one per unit considering the conditions each one comes under this is no easy task the turbine shaft weighs 300 tonnes and spins at 3000 rpm the high pressure turbine is 165 bar and temperaturewise the steam running through it making it spin is 565 degrees centigrade bulletproof is an understatement when it comes to carrying out maintenance on a turbine its more than likely youll have to visit storrs workshop fixing the governor the workshop hasnt always been there it all started fifteen years ago when a piece of equipment broke it was a turbine governor relay a precision hydraulic actuator that keeps the turbine spinning at the right speed drax needed a new one theyve got to be 100 reliable storr explains if they lose control of the turbine it can either come to a grinding halt or speed up too much and selfdestruct the team went in search of a replacement contacting a manufacturer who came back with a skyhigh quote but storrs boss at the time had another idea he asked whether storr could reverse engineer a full set of governor relays i made the fatal mistake of saying yeah so i set off with a few photographs and a handful of sketches storr explains what followed were sleepless nights and a lot of grey hair but in the end he managed to reproduce a full set that cost nearly half of the original quote better than that they worked perfectly today theyre on unit 5 doing the business building the workshop manufacturing the governor relays was a turning point storr and the team saw there could be further savings and benefits if they did more manufacturing or refurbishment inhouse they had the staff capable of doing it they just needed the facilities although there was some initial scepticism from some in the company drax armed storr with a small budget and he set out on building the workshop that was 15 years ago back then the workshop was designed to only refurbish equipment but it has since grown now they can manufacture too today when drax buys in equipment which is either very expensive or lacking in quality storrs team can modify it make it fit better last longer or improve its efficiency without sending it away from the plant and incurring extra costs were reaping the rewards were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility storr says we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people the workshop has given drax an edge when it comes to its engineering ability but storr remains modest about the achievement the thing is he says ive got a good boss and he will support you but i do see it as a bit of a feather in my cap tags technology  drax power station  careers the life of an electrical engineer power generation a station like drax doesnt run itself its six turbines generate nearly 4000mw of power when operating at full load unsurprisingly for a site that produces 7 of britains electricity needs the role of an electrical engineer is an important one  both when managing how power is connected to the highvoltage electricity transmission grid  and how the giant electrical machines generating the energy work it doesnt get much bigger than drax you need to be at the top of your game every day says lead engineer gary preece a man at the top of his game is a fair way to describe preece he has been an electrical engineer almost his entire life beginning as an apprentice working at the liverpool dockyards at age 16 preece has worked a range of increasingly demanding projects and roles including engineering consultancy and work for the royal navy on their type 26 global combat ship  where he was in charge of designing the onboard power infrastructure he became a member of the drax team five years ago life on the job on a station the size of drax you dont have a typical day there are just too many systems that can change status that can fail or that require immediate attention to remain operational its neverending preece says working as an electrical engineer in a plant the size of drax doesnt just mean getting called down to help out when a fuse blows his responsibilities as lead engineer encompass a broad range of functions theres lots to do theres a lot of handson work but theres also a lot of study work tasks can include scoping out planning and budgeting new projects working with contractors and suppliers fault analysis and power level studies this last role is what preece has come to like most about the job  working with sophisticated computer simulations to model output and crisis scenarios all so drax can operate at its optimal level with national grid i really enjoy a lot of the theoretical work he says we can do so much with this software of course there are times when he does have to fix things and in a power plant mistakes can have major consequences the energy levels in a power plant are so high that when something fails it usually fails spectacularly this means preece needs to be on call all day and all night if theres a technology failure he needs to be on the site finding out what went wrong and directing recovery efforts theres no hiding place if something goes wrong you have to fix it transforming draxs electric infrastructure sometimes individual projects can occupy all aspects of preece engineer thinker and planner one of the most challenging was when drax wanted to import a largely unused industrial generator transformer unit from kent to the station in yorkshire the transformer was split into three 200tonne components before transit preece and his team conducted extensive checks on the components and oil transformers contain oil to insulate the coil to evaluate the state of the machinery and these steps had to be repeated after every stage of the journey to ensure no damage had been sustained after checks were completed the units needed to be transported via the m25 motorway to ports in the south of england from which they would travel by ship on the north sea ready to be unloaded and transported to drax for installation however the team hit complications this time with the highways agency the structures were so heavy that we had to take a ferry from a different port because authorities were worried the bridges we were planning on using to get there wouldnt take the weight of the units we had to do a turnaround in the middle of the motorway getting the extra transformers installed gave the plant some important breathing room in the unlikely event of a failure some power stations dont have spares if there was a failure they could be out of commission for months says preece for a power station as large as drax that would be disastrous but even with the extra transformers on site the number of ways the electrical infrastructure at a power plant can go wrong is huge thats why experienced engineers like preece are as indispensable as the machinery itself drax is one of the best opportunities youre going to get for artistic licence it doesnt get much bigger tags technology  drax power station  careers these three inches of copper can power a city 17 january 2017 electrification a series of unassuming cables extend out of the turbine hall at drax power station  theyre easily missed but these few inches of copper play an instrumental role in powering your home surging through each one is enough electricity to power a city but the process of getting electricity from power station to plug isnt as simple as connecting one wire to a live turbine and another to your iphone charger we need an entire network of power stations cables and transformers linking the network when the country first became electrified it did so in stages each region of the uk was powered by its own selfcontained power supply that changed in 1926 when the uk set up the central electricity board and began what was at the time the biggest construction project britain had ever seen the national grid the project took 100000 men and five years to complete and when it was finished it connected 122 of the countrys most efficient power stations via 4000 miles of overhead cabling it had a sizeable effect in 1920 there were roughly 750000 electricity consumers by 1938 that had risen to 9 million the grid has changed in the 80 years thats passed but it remains the network that transfers power across the country to where its needed whenever its needed the strange thing about electricity is that you could live 10 miles from a power station and you cant be sure the electricity youre using is coming from that station says callan masters an engineer with national grid whose job it is to maintain and upgrade the network the whole system works together  the whole system has a demand and the whole system has to deliver it and to do this the network has to be able to deliver electricity quickly and efficiently masters explains it acts like a motorway for power riding the motorway for power the process of transporting electricity involves a series of stages the first of which is stepping up the voltage when electricity is transported via cables or wires it loses some of its energy as heat think of a lightbulb  as it illuminates it heats up because its losing energy the lower the current of that electricity however the less energy is lost so to reduce these losses when transporting power national grid transmits electricity at low currents which it can do by increasing its voltage at the power station electricity is generated at 23500 volts and is then stepped up to 400000 volts by a transformer the first of these is located on a substation on site at the power station once stepped up the electricity is transported through high transmission cables  before being stepped down via a transformer on the other end this stepped down electricity is passed onto a regional distribution system such as the overhead cables you might find on top of wooden poles before being stepped down a final time thats the role of a little transformer at the end of your street masters explains finally the electricity is transported via a final cable into your home  this time at 230 volts all this needs to happen incredibly quickly as thousands of kettles are switched on to herald the end of eastenders  the demand of electricity surges delivering that electricity at the touch of a button relies on a complex network but it starts with those inconspicuous few inches of copper at the power station tags technology  power station  national grid
