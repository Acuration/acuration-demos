deliver negative emissions 18 may 2021 carbon capture what is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is the process of capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide co 2  from biomass organic matter energy generation why is beccs important for decarbonisation when sustainable bioenergy is paired with carbon capture and storage it becomes a source of negative emissions as co 2 is permanently removed from the carbon cycle experts believe that negative emissions technologies nets are crucial to helping countries meet the longterm goals set out in the paris climate agreement as beccs is the most scalable of these technologies this decade it has a key role to play in combating climate change how is the bioenergy for beccs generated most bioenergy is produced by combusting biomass as a fuel in boilers or furnaces to produce highpressure steam that drives electricitygenerating turbines  alternatively bioenergy generation can use a wide range of organic materials including crops specifically planted and grown for the purpose as well as residues from agriculture forestry and wood products industries energydense forms of biomass such as compressed wood pellets  enable bioenergy to be generated on a much larger scale fuels like wood pellets can also be used as a substitute for coal in existing power stations  how is the carbon captured beccs uses a postcombustion carbon capture process  where solvents isolate co 2 from the flue gases produced when the biomass is combusted the captured co 2 is pressurised and turned into a liquidlike substance so it can then be transported by pipeline  how is the carbon stored captured co 2 can be safely and permanently injected into naturally occurring porous rock formations for example unused natural gas reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers water permeable rocks saturated with salt water this process is known as sequestration  over time the sequestered co 2 may react with the minerals locking it chemically into the surrounding rock through a process called mineral storage beccs fast facts two 600 megawatt mw biomass units upgraded with carbon capture technology could deliver 40 of the negative emissions the climate change committee indicates will be needed from beccs for the uk to reach netzero by 2050 beccs has the potential to remove 2070 million tonnes of co 2 per year in the uk by 2050 all national grids net zero future energy scenarios fes deploy beccs by 2028 and see a rapid increase in capacity in the 2030s there are 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space around the uk according to the british geological survey is beccs sustainable bioenergy can be generated from a range of biomass sources ranging from agricultural byproducts to forestry residues to organic municipal waste during their lifetime plants absorb co 2 from the atmosphere this balances out the co 2 that is released when the biomass is combusted whats crucial is that the biomass is sustainably sourced  be it from agriculture or forest waste responsibly managed sources of biomass are those which naturally regenerate or are replanted and regrown where theres a increase of carbon stored in the land and where the natural environment is protected from harm biomass wood pellets used as bioenergy in the uk for example are only sustainable when the forests they are sourced from continue to grow sourcing decisions must be based on science and not adversely affect the longterm potential of forests to store and sequester carbon biomass pellets can also create a sustainable market for forestry products which serves to encourage reforestation and afforestation  leading to even more co 2 being absorbed from the atmosphere go deeper the triple benefits for the environment and economy of deploying beccs in the uk how beccs can offer essential grid stability as the electricity system moves to low and zerocarbon sources producing biomass from sustainable forests is key to ensuring beccs can deliver negative emissions 5 innovative projects where carbon capture is already underway around the world 7
