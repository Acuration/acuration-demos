its new initiative to help boost education and skills 25 march 2019 school pupils and college students from selby could move into pole position when it comes to boosting their skills by taking part in a city centre electric car race  thanks to an exciting new initiative from the uks biggest power station teams from six schools and a college from selby north yorkshire will build and race their own electric cars as part of drax groups initiative to encourage young people to study stem science technology engineering and maths subjects helping create the skilled workforce businesses need for the regions economy to thrive drax is investing 35000 to support the schools and college near its north yorkshire power station including providing them with the car kits as well as the tools and equipment needed to build them engineers from the power station will also spend time with each of the seven teams to help assemble the cars and learn how to drive them ahead of a city centre race in hull on april 28 organised by the greenpower education trust and sponsored by drax andy koss drax power ceo said inspiring young people to study stem subjects is the key to ensuring the next generation of potential employees has the skills that businesses like ours need a skilled workforce will enable drax and other businesses in the north to continue to grow building a strong regional economy with thriving communities were really excited about working with the schools on their electric vehicles seeing all the students from selby with their cars on the starting grid in hull is going to be a really proud moment for us  and who knows maybe one or two of them will see the chequered flag the northern powerhouse partnership has published reports on social mobility including its educating the north and next steps for the northern powerhouse  northern powerhouse partnership director henri murison welcomed draxs latest scheme he said this initiative by drax to inspire students of all ages is a brilliant way to bring stem subjects to life and make their studies even more relevant to the highlyskilled jobs available in industries here in the north our research and that by the childrens commissioner anne longfield has shown that too many children in the north are falling behind their counterparts in other areas of the uk leading to a serious skills shortage for employers talents are not being fulfilled when those growing up in the north enter the world of work we need more northern powerhouse employers and their employees to give their time to provide inspirational experiences for young people like this one at drax keeping working class boys engaged by what they are learning whilst breaking the glass ceiling for girls and young women four primary schools  barwic parade camblesforth selby community and selby abbey  receive a 15mph goblin g2 batterypowered car which will arrive in flatpack form ready to be assembled by the students and teachers older students from selby high school holy family catholic high school and selby college will build the more powerful formula 24 car which can reach speeds of up to 30mph both types of car take around 15 hours to build with the teams also being required to design their own bodywork they will all have assistance from drax employees who will help the students to learn about battery power engine gearing and how a car works liz ridley deputy principal selby college said being able to give some of our students the opportunity to build their own electric vehicle and then race it is incredibly exciting and a great way to get them engaged in stem learning meeting people from drax and working alongside them to build the cars is giving the students important insights bringing the world of work to life the race day will be a fantastic experience for everyone involved once the schools have built their electric vehicles the students will take on competitors from across the country in the race around the streets of hull in april the project is part of draxs education programme which aims to encourage more people including female students to study stem subjects and increase the opportunities they have to secure
