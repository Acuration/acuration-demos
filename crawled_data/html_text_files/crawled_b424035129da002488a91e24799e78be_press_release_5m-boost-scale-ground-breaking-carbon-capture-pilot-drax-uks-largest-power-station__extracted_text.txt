power station visit drax power station 5m boost to scale up groundbreaking carbon capture pilot at drax uks largest power station ccapture the designer of worldleading and innovative chemical processes for carbon dioxide removal and working alongside the drax group has secured a 5m grant from the uk government for a two year programme of work to progress their bioenergy and carbon capture and storage beccs project at drax power station 27 june 2019 the funding will be used by leedsbased ccapture and draxs innovation team to further develop its understanding of how ccaptures technology could be scaled up at drax in north yorkshire to become the worlds first negative emissions power station in the 2020s  effectively removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from atmosphere at the same time as electricity is being produced the company which was established out of leeds universitys school of chemistry has been working with drax group on its successful beccs project which started capturing carbon dioxide from february proving the technology works the work being undertaken over the next two years includes an extension of ccaptures existing pilot facilities at drax power station plant performance optimisation trials a chemistry validation and testing programme with worldclass research partners sintef and the co 2 technology centre mongstad in norway process design development to move towards commercial scale deployment including repurposing the existing drax infrastructure for beccs this award represents a vote of confidence in the scheme and will give ccapture and drax group a clearer understanding of how the technology could be scaled up in the 2020s enabling drax power station to capture and store up to 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year the funding has been awarded by the department of business energy and industrial strategy beis through its carbon capture utilisation and storage ccus innovation programme minister for energy and clean growth chris skidmore said cutting edge technology to capture carbon will cut emissions as we work towards a net zero economy while creating new jobs  a key part of our modern industrial strategy this innovative project from ccapture and drax represents a major milestone in efforts to rollout carbon capture at scale by the 2030s caspar schoolderman coo and project lead at ccapture said the ongoing support from beis and our shareholders  bp drax and ip group  has allowed ccapture to build a team with unique skills and capabilities the technology that we have developed is a game changer for carbon capture drax groups expertise in repurposing existing infrastructure and ccaptures novel ccus solution could allow the costeffective deployment of beccs for the first time on an industrial scale anywhere in the world aimed at supporting projects which can help deliver cost effective carbon capture initiatives which could then be used in industrial applications the beis funding will help the uk to lead the world in developing ccus technologies will gardiner drax group ceo said if we scale ccaptures beccs technology up at drax across all four of our biomass generating units the impacts will be far reaching as the worlds first negative emissions power station drax could become the anchor for a ccs network in the humber region capturing carbon from other nearby industrial emitters as well as our own co 2  ccaptures technology could enable us to not only make a real impact on reducing our own carbon emissions but also to deliver clean growth and jobs across the north as well as new export opportunities for the uk making this project of major significance globally if draxs beccs pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions drax power station would be helping to remove gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced drax power station is already the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal ends media contacts ccapture professor chris rayner founder t 07879 834689  0113 343 6579 email protected paul taylor taylor keogh communications e email protected t 07966 782611 drax group jessica gorton press officer e email protected t 07712 677177 notes to editors ccaptures technology uses new proprietary solvents to remove carbon dioxide offering a safer and less expensive alternative to current technologies based on the use of amines it provides a means to make the removal of carbon dioxide significantly more economic from arrange of largescale processes such as power generation from coal gas and biomass and the production of cement steel and aluminium ccapture based in leeds was formed in 2009 by prof chris rayner as a spinout from leeds university with funding from ip group it had to date received 22m grant support from the uk government the department of business energy and industrial strategy through its energy entrepreneurs fund with further support from the co2 capture project ccapture has also raised 35m in new equity funding in a round led by bp ventures drax and ip group the funding underlines the credibility of ccaptures technology as the company continues to position itself to help mitigate climate change by providing systems that remove carbon dioxide emissions from power stations and cement steel and aluminium facilities the committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 mt co 2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero drax is talking to a number of industries about using the co 2 it is already capturing in their processes this could be for the production of concrete putting the fizz in the drinks industry or creating synthetic fuels to use in hardtodecarbonise sectors like aviation drax is also working with the humber local enterprise partnership and other interested parties to explore the role ccus can play in turning the humber estuary  the uks most energy intensive industrial cluster  into the worlds first netzerocarbon cluster it is ideally located for accessing offshore stores in the north sea such as the endurance field which is roughly 60 miles off the coast if drax can scale up its beccs pilot it could create more opportunities for capturing and storing carbon dioxide from other industrial emitters in the humber region unlocking the potential to create a new hydrogen economy creating jobs and delivering major environmental benefits globally about ccapture ccapture designs worldleading chemical processes for carbon dioxide removal it has patented a unique solventbased technology which offers a safe lowcost way to remove carbon dioxide from emissions sources such as power stations industrial plants and anaerobic digestion for positive environmental benefit in may 2018 ccapture announced a partnership with drax group to run a pilot of its technology at the north yorkshire power station which will see carbon dioxide captured from biomass used in power generation and show how ccaptures technology can be used as part of a process to remove existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere beccs ccapture is proud of the potential its technology offers to mitigate climate change as part of the growing market for environmentallyconscious power generation and industrial processes the company was formed in 2009 as a spinout from leeds university and is backed by ip group drax and
