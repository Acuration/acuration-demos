power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station how electrical transformers work the super machines pumping up and stepping down electricity so it reaches you safely and efficiently 17 july 2020 power generation getting electricity safely and efficiently from generators through power lines and across the country into our devices is a careful balancing act one of the vital aspects of this is the voltage an electrical substation with transformers the national grids transmission lines work at a voltage of 400000 volts v and 275000v but if electricity were to enter homes at this voltage it would quickly damage anything it powered instead regional distributors deliver electricity into homes at a much lower level of 230v achieving a voltage level thats safe to use requires stepping it up or down through transformers  huge pieces of electrical grid equipment that use a simple idea to have a big impact why we need transformers voltage is like water pressure having high voltage transmission lines means the charged electrons that make up electricity are moving very efficiently through the system with less energy being lost as heat along the way however that same pressure is too much for just charging a phone it would likely overload the devices circuits and leave the user with a smouldering mess thats where transformers step in electricity is produced at a variety of voltages around great britain depending on different types of generation in order to send it to where the demand is without losing too much energy as heat along the journey  a transformer attached to large power generators such as draxs biomass power plant or beatrice offshore wind farm increases the voltage to 400000v or 275000v the voltage depends on what part of the national transmission system the power station is connected to when the electricity arrives via pylons at a particular region of great britain another transformer brings the voltage down to 132000v for the regional distribution system subsequently another reduces it to 11000v in towns and villages before a final transformer reduces the voltage to a safe 230v for use in homes and businesses keeping the voltage high is useful in preventing energy loss to heat but it also does something else important to the electricity shooting around the country keeping voltage high to cut down current if voltage is the water pressure then current is the actual water particles moving through the pipes in electrical terms the current is the charged electrons that actually power our lights and devices when these electrons travel along the electricity grids cables they face resistance imagine a partial blockage in a water pipe this causes some electrical energy to be lost to heat getting the right amount of electricity needed around the country means keeping energy loss as low as possible if the current is lower fewer charged electrons are bumping into resistance at any one point in the system and less electrical energy is being lost conveniently for the grid raising the voltage of electricity causes the current to decrease and vice versa how transformers actually do this is all a matter of coils transformer at cruachan power station winding voltage up and down transformers work using the principal of electromagnetic induction something the british scientist michael faraday first realised in 1831 he noticed that when a magnet moved through a coil of copper wires a current flowed through those wires its this same principal that enables spinning turbines to generate electricity today  michael faraday similarly when a current flows through a copper coil wrapped around an iron core the core becomes magnetic  faraday did experiment with running currents through multiple copper coils but it was scientist and irish priest father nicholas callan who in 1836 discovered the underlying principal of many of the worlds transformers today he found if two separate sets of copper wires were wound around each end of an iron core and an electrical current was passed through one of them the primary winding then a magnetic field is created that causes an electric current to flow in the secondary winding however things change depending on how many times each wire is wound around the core if there are more turns in the secondary winding than the primary one then when a current is induced the voltage increases when there are fewer turns in the secondary winding than the primary the voltage decreases callans induction coil 1845 moreover father callan discovered that the increase or decrease in voltage is directly proportional to the number of turns in the windings so theoretically if an electrical current with a voltage of 5v is passed through a primary winding with 10 turns and creates a current in a secondary winding with 20 turns the voltage will also double in this case to 10v father callans invention is known as an induction coil where the two sets of windings share a long thick iron rod since then the transformer has undergone continual revision optimisation and specialisation for different use cases however the underlying principal of using electromagnetic induction to increase and decrease voltage remains the same from homes to power stations one of the most common types of transformers are distribution transformers  the kind often found on utility poles near homes these transformers perform the final step down from local distribution systems to 230v as the electricity enters homes and businesses these often use an iron core that takes the form of a hollow square with windings wrapped around both ends when a current passes through and magnetises the core it causes it to expand and contract in a process known as magnetostriction which sometimes causes enough vibration to produce an audible hum  a transformer being moved from longannet to cruachan power station in 2019 in these type of transformers its safe for the current to be transferred through the air between the two windings but when higher voltages are being used such as at cruachan power station  the biggest pumped storage facility in scotland  different approaches are needed large power stationscale transformers are submerged in a special insulating oil inside a metal container  the oil provides electrical insulation to prevent short circuits while also cooling the core and windings preventing damage and failure even as the main sources of great britains electricity change from coal and nuclear power stations to wind farms and solar panels transformers will remain an essential part of the grid in getting the right amount of power to where we need it  fast share related stories press releases drax helps businesses save money
