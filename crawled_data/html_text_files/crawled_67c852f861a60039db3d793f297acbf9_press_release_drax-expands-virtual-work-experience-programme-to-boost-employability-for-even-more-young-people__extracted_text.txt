from those who took part engineering student tahmid md who took part in the previous virtual work experience programme said work experience at drax was a great week and i learnt a lot from the programme the cv building and interview sessions were especially helpful and i really enjoyed the engineering projects i took part in drax colleagues have put together a fiveday online programme which

factors the work experience programme is part of draxs mobilising a million initiative which aims to increase social mobility by creating opportunities to further education and improve employability ensuring the country has the skilled workforce needed to support a postcovid green economic recovery drax groups head of sustainable business alan knight said we work closely with schools in our communities to inspire children from all backgrounds to study stem subjects so the next generation has the education and skills needed to support businesses like ours as we continue to develop and grow virtual work experience builds on the work we did during lockdown to provide laptops free internet access and virtual tours of the power station to ensure no students were left behind in their studies department of education minister for apprenticeships and skills gillian keegan said its brilliant to see businesses like drax offering virtual opportunities for young people to learn about and prepare for the world of work as the energy market is changing there are new green jobs opening up for employees offering young people the chance to explore these new opportunities in the workplace is vital to shape their career goals and help them to discover the wide range of choices available for their future students who applied to take part in draxs virtual work experience programme aged 1418
