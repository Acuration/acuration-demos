power leaving a key climate target at risk plugging this new gap could mean an additional 6 million tonnes of co2 emissions and a more than 20 rise in wholesale electricity prices imperial college academics warn the country is too reliant on a single technology and that the cfd system may have to become more flexible in the future new analysis by academics at imperial college london for drax electric insights reveals that the uks stalled offshore wind developments jeopardises its climate targets potentially leading to substantially higher power prices and increased carbon emissions rising inflation left the auction unable to deliver new offshore wind projects as the upper limit set for prices through the contract for difference cfd scheme was now too low the government had hoped to secure up to 5 gw of power at the auction to help meet its target to install 50 gw of offshore wind by 2030 in a special report on the fallout from the auction drax electric insights estimates that the impact of this auction could be felt into the future and later this decade the country runs the risk of an annual shortfall of 26 twh electricity generation this gap will most likely be filled by increased reliance on gas and imports from abroad leading to an additional 6 million tonnes of co2 emissions and a more than 20 rise in wholesale electricity prices the reports authors suggest the current frameworks dependence on wind means it is relying too heavily on a single technology to support the decarbonisation of the uks electricity system and proposes taking a more balanced approach that distributes the share of heavy lifting done by different low carbon technologies would be more effective dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report series said the uks decarbonisation strategy is focused heavily on offshore wind but the auction shows the danger of putting all your eggs in the one basket the uk has to triple its offshore wind capacity in just seven years to meet the governments target with the auction delivering no new capacity theres now a huge shortfall and the goal is looking increasingly unattainable this auction should serve as a wakeup call for both government and industry it may be time to reevaluate the cfd design to ensure it continues to incentivise not only new projects but also generation once they are operational we need to ensure investment is going into a range of low carbon technologies to share the load of decarbonisation other low carbon or renewable technologies which have been gaining interest from industry and government in recent years include small nuclear modular reactors longduration energy storage and carbon capture drax was the first energy company in the world to announce an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 through utilising bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology the company has radically decarbonised its business by transforming its largest power plant  drax power station in north yorkshire  to use biomass to generate renewable electricity instead of coal the company plans to deploy beccs technology at its uk plant this decade permanently capturing and removing up to 8 million tonnes of co2 from the atmosphere each year  more than enough to cover the additional emissions created from the offshore wind auctions failure penny small draxs group generation director said the uk cannot reach net zero without deploying carbon capture and storage technologies at scale thats why we are progressing plans to deploy beccs at drax power station so we can capture and permanently remove up to 8 million tonnes of co2 from the atmosphere each year in addition to removing carbon from the atmosphere beccs simultaneously provides the country with reliable renewable electricity we are engaged in formal discussions with the government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in

sustainability accelerating the development of ccs clusters could deliver an extra 32bn for the uk economy per year from 2050 19 october 2023 press releases new research shows that cluster development could be worth hundreds of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of pounds in gva to the uks economy by 2050 with over 80 of the uks licensed storage in the north sea the majority of these economic benefits could go to the north of england and create an additional 330000 jobs if the uk fails to deliver on its ccs rollout 136000 jobs could be at risk a new independent research report uk cluster potential  how the uk can lead the world in carbon capture and storage by development economics finds that if the uk government accelerates and expands the development of carbon capture and storage ccs clusters across the country it could generate an extra 32bn of gross value added gva for the economy from 2050 onward and nearly 500000 additional jobs the research commissioned by drax group demonstrates that in the most optimistic scenario the uk government could enhance our energy security turbocharge economic growth across the country and cement the uks position as a worldleader in carbon capture and removals technology it states that this scenario could be delivered through policy changes which can unlock investment and clarify how ccs clusters are developed these include finalising ccs business and financial models confirming the role of the uk ets scheme and voluntary carbon markets in supporting investment in ccs providing a nearterm incentive for prospective storage operators to appraise storage locations building on recent north sea transition authority licencing rounds the north of england would be the region to benefit most with 22bn added to the economy per year from 2050 onward and 330000 additional jobs the report also explores the economic impacts of two additional scenarios one where the uk delivers on current ccs policy commitments and another where it does not if the uk does fulfil its ambitions it will be worth an additional 23bn per year from 2050 and an additional 310000 jobs richard gwilliam uk beccs programme director at drax group said carbon capture and removals can be a catalyst for growth stronger energy security increasing employment and reaching net zero in the uk this research demonstrates that if the uk puts its foot on the accelerator and expands the rollout of ccs clusters across the country a unique prize worth tens of billions of pounds to the economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs is within reach at drax we want to play our part in ensuring the uk becomes a global leader in ccs and that is why we are working towards installing two bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs units at drax power station this would see us become a key part of a humberbased carbon capture cluster and we are currently working on routes to deployment through the track 1 expansion and track 2 processes steve lucas director at development economics said this research demonstrates the significant opportunity for the uk to be a global leader in carbon capture and storage and the importance of ccs for key industries which provides jobs growth and opportunity across the uk with ambition clarity and the necessary support from government  following the key suggestions outlined in the reports roadmap  there is a significant prize to be won for the uk economy and environment however in its recent progress report the climate change committee warned that the rollout of ccs is already behind schedule and development economics research shows that if this trend continues and the uk fails to deliver on its ccs policy commitments the economic effects could be severe this includes the loss of 136000 jobs and 9bn gva per year from 2050 from heavyemitting companies which will have no other route to decarbonise and therefore could move their operations abroad to countries with better resourced and more ccs clusters the report argues that the combination of additional support delivered in the most optimistic scenario the countrys past hydrocarbon expertise and 15bn from the investment community for the energy transition would put the uk on the map as a worldleader in ccs it also demonstrates that the humber with existing plans to become the worlds first carbon negative region and 80 of the uks licensed co 2 storage could become a global model for regional cluster development the research shows that with increased ambition the humber could benefit from an additional 42000 jobs and 34bn gva per year by 2050 drax plans plan to invest billions in its beccs plans at north yorkshires drax power station to develop two units which could remove 8mt of carbon from the atmosphere per year while continuing to provide renewable baseload power to the uk grid this will ensure the station continues to generate secure renewable electricity into the future while delivering up to 10000 highskilled jobs in the humber at the projects peak and playing a critical role in delivering carbon removals so the uk can meet its binding engineered greenhouse gas removal target drax is currently exploring the roles the track1 expansion and track2 ccs cluster sequencing can play in supporting the transition to beccs at the selby site powerbeccs remains eligible to participate in either process
