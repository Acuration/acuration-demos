 new gas fired power station approved by government to be located on part of the hirwaun industrial estate which lies adjacent to the a465 heads of the valleys dual carriageway between swansea and abergavenny the hirwaun power project will produce up to 299 megawatts mw of electricity the equivalent of supplying 400000 homes 23 july 2015 hirwaun power ltd has secured consent from the department of energy  climate change for its 200m gasfired power station project near aberdare in south wales subject to raising the necessary finance it will enter commercial operation in 2019 it will operate as a peaking plant providing backup to intermittent renewable generation and create 150 construction jobs and up to 15 permanent and skilled jobs to be located on part of the hirwaun industrial estate which lies adjacent to the a465 heads of the valleys dual carriageway between swansea and abergavenny the hirwaun power project will produce up to 299 megawatts mw of electricity the equivalent of supplying 400000 homes it represents a significant investment into the local economy and will give rise to multimillion pound construction and supply chain contracts support 150 jobs over the two year construction and commissioning period and up to 15 fulltime jobs when operational amber rudd secretary of state for the department of energy  climate change granted planning permission to the hirwaun project after a 2Â½ year public consultation and examination process norman campbell project director at hirwaun power said securing the goverrnments approval for the project is very good news for the hirwaun team and the local economy we would expect our 200m scheme to provide a catalyst for further investment in the area importantly the project also helps to meet the governments policy objectives of security of energy supple and affordability and supports the countrys transition to a low carbon economy the input that we received from the rhondda cynon taff council and the local community during the projects public consultation process was very helpful and we will liaise closely with the council and other local interests during the projects construction and eventual operation however despite the widespread acceptance that new generation plant is required and the considerable investment we have made so far we must still secure the money to get the project built we expect to know whether or not we are successful in doing that by the middle of next year 2016 share name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter to receive a regular
