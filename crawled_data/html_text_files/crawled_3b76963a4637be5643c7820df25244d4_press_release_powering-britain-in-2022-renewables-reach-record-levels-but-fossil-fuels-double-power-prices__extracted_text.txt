but the rising cost of gas led wholesale power prices to almost double yearonyear according to new data 29 december 2022 new analysis shows britains power grid had a recordbreaking green year but the spiralling cost of fossil fuels led power prices to almost double renewable power generated more than twofifths 40 of the countrys electricity for the first time  helping to cut carbon emissions by 27 million tonnes britain exported more power to europe than ever before making it a net exporter of electricity for the first time in over a decade academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights commissioned via imperial consultants analysed the data which highlights the turbulence that britains electricity system has endured amid an unprecedented year for the energy industry renewable power sources  wind solar biomass and hydro  generated 40 of the countrys electricity in 2022  up from 35 in 2021 helping to cut co 2 emissions from the power sector by 27 million tonnes compared to the previous year overall generation from renewables has more than quadrupled over the last decade at one stage during may renewables provided 728 of power to the grid whilst wind farms generated a landmark 20gw of electricity for the first time  the maximum output from wind is now up by a third compared to four years ago  despite the record supply of cheap renewable electricity the unprecedented rise in the cost of gas following russias invasion of ukraine sent power prices to a new alltime high the fossil fuel supplied 42 of the countrys power this year its largest share of the fuel mix since 2016  britain is on course to have annual average wholesale price above 200 per mwh for the first time ever in 2022  up from 113 the year before this is nearly six times higher than the cost of electricity in 2020 34 per mwh the price mwh of fossil fuels over the last three years relative to their averages from 201019 dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report series said this has been a year like no other for the energy industry the public are feeling the pain of high gas prices on their energy bills even though renewables are providing the grid with more cheap green electricity than ever before the lesson from 2022 is that we need to break our addiction to fossil fuels once and for all if we want lower cost and more secure energy supplies if we had not invested in wind solar and biomass over the last decade our energy bills would have been even higher as would the risk of blackouts over winter the energy crisis cannot be solved by increasing our reliance on gas imported from abroad we need to turbocharge our investment in clean energy technologies to become europes renewable electricity powerhouse which will cut fuel bills at home and bring money into the economy by exporting power to our neighbouring countries for the first time in more than a decade britain is a net exporter of electricity to its european neighbours electricity exports quadrupled from last year to 172 twh of electricity  generating around 31bn for the uk economy the country exported a net total of 19twh representing a dramatic swing in power trading from the previous year when britain instead imported a net total of 229twh share of british electricity that was imported and exported each quarter will gardiner drax group ceo said drax plays a critical role in supporting the uk energy system generating more renewable power by output than any other company we can accelerate and strengthen britains longterm energy security by ending our reliance on expensive imported fossil fuels and instead increase investment in homegrown renewables and innovative green technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and pumped storage hydro drax is the uks biggest renewable power producer by output generating enough renewable electricity from biomass and hydro for around 5 million homes  producing as much as 20 of the countrys renewable electricity during times of peak demand in 2022 drax plans to invest billions of pounds expanding its pumped hydro storage capacity at its cruachan power station in scotland and deploying beccs at its power station in north yorkshire to permanently remove 8million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2030 whilst generating the reliable renewable power the country needs ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 ali lewis head of media  pr e email protected t 07712

worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 19 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers in europe and asia customers drax supplies renewable
