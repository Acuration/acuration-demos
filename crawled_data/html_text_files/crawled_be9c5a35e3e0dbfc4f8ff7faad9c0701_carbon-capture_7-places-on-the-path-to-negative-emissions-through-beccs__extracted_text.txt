negative emissions 13 may 2021 carbon capture in brief bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is increasingly being explored and deployed around the world at heat and power stations factories and wastetoenergy plants as they aim to achieve net zero through negative emissions sweden norway denmark the us and uk all have projects either piloting or developing beccs with the aim of achieving negative emissions to reach their net zero climate goals drax the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business has the biggest beccs project aiming for eight million tonnes of negative emissions per year by 2030 beccs projects often form part of low emissions clusters which make use of local sustainable sources of biomass and partner with nearby industries to share co 2 transport and storage infrastructure can a power station make a positive impact on the climate how about a cement factory or even a whole city negative emissions technologies nets aim to help do this by removing carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere reducing the detrimental effects of many industrial processes and even go as far as countering the impacts of climate change among nets beccs offers a means of generating electricity or heat while also removing co 2 from the atmosphere it works by using biomass from sustainable sources which absorb co 2 from the atmosphere when they grow when the biomass is used as fuel that same co 2 is captured and stored permanently and safely  usually under the seabed trials of beccs technology are already underway around the world as companies governments and the third sector work towards their climate goals through negative emissions stockholm exergi  powering the worlds first climate positive city stockholm exergi beccs pilot plant stockholm exergi is the energy utility responsible for the swedish capitals heating cooling electricity and waste processing services it has bold ambitions to become climate positive by 2025 since december 2019 the company has trialled beccs at its heat and power cogeneration plant in the v√§rtan area of stockholm  where it calculates there is potential to capture 800000 tonnes of co 2 per year the project sources biomass from chopped slash made up of branches and treetops as well as residues from the board pulp and paper industries 57 of which come locally from sweden stockholms location is also advantageous for storing co 2  with the nearby north sea offering multiple sites that meet stockholm exergis criteria for carbon sequestration stockholm exergis beccs plant would send captured carbon to the northern lights project fabian levihn head of rd at stockholm exergi highlights the economic advantages beccs offers as a means of carbon offsetting for industries with hardtoabate emissions for industrial emitters to remove the last 20 needed to reach net zero greenhouse gases it will cost as much as us800 per tonne of co 2 or equivalent explains levihn fabian levihn head of rd at stockholm exergi if beccs can be realised at 100 per tonne of co 2  it offers an upside in terms of economic efficiency for climate change abatement of 700 per tonne recent modelling by leading energy consultancy baringa for drax has shown that deploying beccs in the 2020s can present billions of pounds of cost savings compared to waiting until later decades closer to national net zero deadlines mendota california  from cantaloupe to carbon capture the city of mendotas seal proudly declares itself the cantaloupe center of the world now however the agricultural california city is getting a slice of energy innovation with a beccs project designed to deliver negative emissions and reduce air pollution in the region the project comes from a partnership between schlumberger new energy chevron clean energy systems and microsoft it aims to remove as much as 300000 tonnes of co 2 annually the equivalent emissions created generating electricity for more than 65000 us homes the beccs plant which is beginning its frontend engineering and design feed phase before a final investment decision in 2022 is optimised for its location the plant will convert waste from the surrounding agricultural industries such as almond trees into a renewable synthesis gas that will be mixed with oxygen in a combustor to generate electricity desert california more than 99 of the carbon from this process is expected to be captured and then stored in nearby deep geological formations in the desert landscape by using an estimated 200000 tonnes of agricultural waste annually the plant will also help towards the california air resources control boards plan of phasing out almost all agricultural burning in the valley by 2025 the project is expected to create up to 300 construction jobs and about 30 permanent jobs once the facility is operating heidelbergcement  net zero at an industrial scale reaching net zero isnt just about taking the emissions out of energy generation heavy industries must also reduce and remove co 2 with carbon capture and storage ccs and beccs offers a way of achieving this at an even larger scale concrete uses cement heidelbergcement norcems plant in brevik  norway plans to become the first industrialscale ccs project at a cement production plant in the world the project aims to capture 400000 tonnes of co 2 per year which will be compressed and transported by ship away from the plant before being exported via pipeline and stored beneath the north sea bed the plant aims to start co 2 separation from the cement production process by 2024 the end result will be a 50 cut of emissions from the cement produced at the plant however ccs is only part of the companys plan to deliver carbonneutral cement by 2050 heidelbergcement also plans to increase its use of alternative raw materials primarily waste materials and byproducts from other industries  biomass already plays a key part of this making up 381 of the companys alternative fuel mix  importantly it offers a model that can be sustainably applied to cement manufacturing around the world √∏rsted aker and microsoft  taking the carbon out of denmarks heat and power not one to be left behind by its scandinavian neighbours denmark has set the ambitious target of reducing its emissions to 70 of 1990 levels by 2030 beccs and negative emissions will be essential in meeting that goal and the country already has some of the key infrastructure in place √∏rsted operates six biomassfired units that as well as generating power provide around one quarter of denmarks district heating this use of combined heat and power stations mean beccs can decarbonise both utilities simultaneously √∏rsted aker carbon capture and microsoft are partnering to explore ways to do just that aved√∏re combined heat and power plant in denmark operated by √∏rsted √∏rsteds biomass units are powered by low quality or surplus wood that would either be left to rot or be burned in the forest with the biomass units already in operation the partnership will address technological regulatory and commercial challenges around beccs this includes a technology collaboration to integrate microsofts digital expertise into a beccs project along with aker carbon captures capture technology the partnership is exploring the potential to store captured carbon in the north seabased northern lights project  which is expected to have the capacity to transport inject and store up around 15 million tonnes of co 2 per year microsoft is already a partner in northern lights as part of its efforts to operate as carbon negative by 2030  which has seen it forge partnership across the ccs landscape drax  from coal emitter to climate innovator drax has evolved from a coal power station to run four of its 600mwplus generating units on sustainable biomass and is the largest decarbonisation project in europe beccs pilots at the plant have already been successful in capturing more than a tonne of co 2 a day by proving the viability of multiple capture technologies drax has set 2030 as the date when it aims to become carbon negative which would also see its beccs operations scale up to capture as much as 8 million tonnes of co 2 a year  drax power station with biomass storage domes lit up the power station is in an advantageous location to deliver such significant negative emissions located near the uks humber region drax is partnered with a range of industrial emitters through the zero carbon humber partnership which aims to become the worlds first net zero carbon industrial cluster through a combination of industrial ccs hydrogen and beccs sharing carbon capture and transport infrastructure across the region helps to reduce costs for each party and in draxs case can translate into keeping electricity costs down for consumers delivering beccs negative emissions and a net zero carbon cluster is an economic driver for the humber a recent report found it could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades negative emissions from beccs also has an essential role to play in enabling the uk to reach its target of net zero emissions by 2050  drax is ready to invest in this essential technology which will help the uk decarbonise faster and kickstart a whole new industry here says drax ceo will gardiner  drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload by delivering beccs the uk can show the world what can be achieved for the environment and the economy when governments businesses and communities work together fortum oslo varme  turning waste to negative emissions agriculture and forestry waste are some of the worlds primary sources of sustainable biomass however large amounts of household waste are also biological in origins  for example cardboard or vegetable peels food waste recycling bin in a kitchen dealing with cities waste is an environmental necessity and key to achieving net zero on a wider scale wastetoenergy plants have long provided a means to avoid landfill usage but by introducing ccs to such facilities they can deliver positive impact to the cities they serve the fov fortum oslo varme plant in oslo delivers heat and power to the norwegian capital by incinerating waste approximately 50 of which comes from biological origins the wastetoenergy facility first launched a ccs pilot in 2016 to remove co 2 from the atmosphere through beccs the project is part of the citys broader ambition to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 95 between 2009 and 2030 as the citys largest single emissions source introducing ccs to the fov can reduce oslos emissions by 14 an essential step to reach the citys ambitious climate goals the plant currently treats 400000 tonnes of waste per year that cant be recycled and has already conducted a 5500hour pilot with a 95 capture rate the issue of nonrecyclable waste hangs over almost every city in the world and the fovs system could be implemented on as many as 500 similar plants around europe alone delivering power district heating negative emissions from organic materials and waste reduction hofor  keeping beccs on budget hofor is a notforprofit utility currently exploring the potential of beccs and makes an interesting case study for how the technology can be deployed as economically as possible short for hovedstadsomradets forsyningsselskab which roughly translates as greater copenhagen utility hofor is investigating the addition of beccs to its combined heat and power chp station biomassfed chp plants use residual energy from power generation such as steam to heat water that is then circulated through a citywide network of pipes to provide heating it means that the energy utilisation of biomass is very high and importantly for nordic countries provides a large supply of affordable heating maintaining the affordability of its heating supply is crucial for hofor which is bound by regulatory conditions to not undertake investments that make heat more expensive for its customers for this reason hofors exploration of beccs needs to place an emphasis on technologies that have a high readiness level and ways to keep costs to a minimum by partnering with other local utilities as part of the c4 carbon capture cluster copenhagen  the company is looking to share the costs of carbon transport and storage infrastructure keeping heat prices low while delivering negative emissions there is also the potential for hofor to sell captured carbon that can be used to create products such as green aviation fuel carbon offsetting offers another way for the utility to invest in beccs if there is an organised and longterm market for such transactions in place go deeper discover the best business model for beccs negative emissions consist of a range of technologies and naturebased solutions that capture and permanently store co 2 and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere they offer a way to remove emissions that are currently impossible to entirely reduce in industries like aviation
