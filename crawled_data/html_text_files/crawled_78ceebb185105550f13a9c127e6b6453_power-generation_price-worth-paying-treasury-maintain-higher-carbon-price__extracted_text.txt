power station a price worth paying why the treasury should maintain a higher carbon price stephanie zhang and tom smout from aurora energy research set out the issues 25 october 2018 power generation last week it was green gb week  a nationwide campaign supported by the uk government showcasing the countrys green credentials and progress in transitioning towards a low carbon world it is therefore timely that ahead of the autumn budget the energy industry should be speaking about measures such as the carbon price support mechanism which are within the power of government to help keep great britain on track in meeting its decarbonisation goals aurora energy research a leading energy research and analytics firm has produced fresh analysis that suggests that maintaining a higher carbon price is key to phasing out coal power generation and decarbonising the uk electricity sector in a timely costeffective manner  is the carbon price at risk in april 2013 hm treasury introduced the carbon price support  a tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain in part this was a response to low costs in the european emissions trading system which requires generators to buy certificates against their emissions at the time the uk government felt that these certificates were too cheap and wanted to impose a higher carbon price to drive a more modern lowcarbon energy mix this carbon price support has had a huge impact particularly on coal prior to its introduction coal represented 50 of power generation but since it has fallen to record lows 2017 saw the first day without any coal on the power system since the industrial revolution records continue to be broken throughout 2018 with coal generation falling to 1 during summer months  however 2018 has also seen prices within the emissions trading system surge prices started this year at 8tonne and now seem to be steadying at roughly 20tonne this has created uncertainty over the future of the uk carbon price support scheme many in energy from power generators to environmental campaign groups are worried that the treasury might respond to rising european prices by slashing the carbon price support in this years autumn budget which could threaten to undo the success the uk has had in decarbonising its energy mix the carbon price is needed to keep coal at bay aurora has tested the impacts of different trajectories for the carbon price going forward to 2040 and the implications are significant particularly for coal auroras analysis shows that if government maintains the current carbon price support rate of 18tonne then at current eu ets futures levels coal should come off the gb power system in 202122 by contrast the same analysis suggests that if chancellor philip hammond were to reduce the carbon price support to 7tonne then coal power stations would stay on the system until 2025 and increase generation during that time as illustrated below source aurora energy research this would make it difficult for the uk to meet its carbon targets  the uk government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with 5yearly carbon budgets cutting the carbon price support rate to 7tonne would result in 29 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide co 2  during the 4 th carbon budget period which runs from 202327 this is an increase of almost 20 on total power sector emissions  against a carbon budget that the uk is currently on track to miss  the cost of the carbon price a higher carbon price raises electricity prices slightly but the mechanics of this are complex and the rising price of electricity is somewhat offset by lower subsidy payments to low carbon generators comparing a status quo scenario to one where the carbon price support falls to 7tonne raises annual power system costs by 700 million average over 202140 which translates to roughly 9 a year on the average households electricity bill source aurora energy research decarbonisation affects not just the future of gbs power system but also its international reputation and progress in meeting climate change targets  the carbon price support has helped to make gbs power system a success story in reducing carbon emissions while keeping costs reasonable there are always tradeoffs to be made in policy but cutting the carbon price would threaten the progress great britain has made in
