giant drax is collaborating with the university of nottingham and promethean particles on an innovative new carbon capture technology that could shape the future of carbon capture and storage ccs trial is part of draxs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs innovation programme and could see the technology deployed in future beccs plants the new process uses a type of solid sorbent called metalorganic frameworks mofs which promethean particles are a global pioneer in the development and deployment of to capture the co2 released when sustainable biomass is used to generate electricity ccs technologies typically use liquid solvents dr theo chronopoulos drax innovation engineer and lewis neve promethean particles engineering manager mofs have a simple structure which means they can be tailored to separate and soak up specific molecules making them excellent for ccs the trial will last for two months and will allow all three organisations to understand if this new carbon capture process performs well in real conditions on largescale projects jason shipstone draxs chief innovation officer said pilot unit in situ in draxs beccs incubation hub located in drax power station negative emissions technologies like beccs will play a vital role in the fight against the climate crisis so its crucial we continue to innovate and develop new technologies that will support their future deployment this partnership with the university of nottingham and promethean particles is part of our longterm innovation programme and will allow drax to understand the future potential of this technology as we continue to innovate and grow as a business professor ed lester project lead university of nottingham said this is a fantastic opportunity to showcase how these

the inside of mighty ben cruachan over a period of six years from 1959 to 1965 to make way for the uks first pumped storage hydro power station a mural dedicated to these men has pride of place on the walls of the machine hall and it is here where one of peters sons saw a photo of him by chance when watching the comedian frankie boyles tour of scotland on bbc television which featured the power station they knew instantly it was their father in the photo as he was missing an index finger due to an injury caused during a farming accident when he was younger after seeing the programme the brothers frank john martin and peter did some research about the men who built cruachan and got in touch with the visitor centre to arrange a tour as the four men now live in different locations across britain the four of them have only been in the same room together a handful of times over the last 30 years to attend family funerals the visit was delayed due to covid restrictions but the brothers have finally now been able to see the place where their father had spent many years working peter lacey grew up near dublin and moved to scotland with his family in 1950 leaving his job working on his familys farm to take advantage of the generous wages being offered to labourers in scotland  which reflected the danger and difficulty of the work conditions for the men who worked at cruachan during those early years were really tough and tragically 15 of them died these men are commemorated by the mural on the wall of the machine hall as well as in a specially commissioned tartan drax created  which includes 15 strands of a special dark blue thread lr martin frank peter and john lacey in front of the photo of their father peter lacey pictured left on the wall of the cruachan machine hall martin lacey the second youngest of the four brothers said my father like many of the other men working at loch awe gave up so much to better his family we werent a rich family but we never wanted for anything we were so proud of him and always looked forward to him coming home on the weekends when he could the work was physically exhausting and the environment dark and dangerous peter suffered several accidents during his time there including broken ribs during retirement he lost his eyesight too which was put down to the hours he had spent working in the darkness of the tunnel all those years earlier the brothers took a tour of cruachan power station during their visit they were in awe of the size and scale of the power station which their father helped to build we were able to go inside the machine hall which is the size of three football fields and the height of st pauls cathedral the generators are huge when we stood beside the photo of our father and saw the inner workings of the hall i was so impressed they also viewed the mural in the machine hall privately  a very emotional experience for them as they remembered their father who they described as a thoughtful and caring man to us he was a giant of a man at 6ft 3 he was never ill and never felt the cold he never wore a jacket or jumper no matter the weather martin recalled he never asked for much he was a family man and very content with what he had he was extremely hardworking and could never sit still for long even when he wasnt working he always had to be doing something gardening or fixing things martin added our father and mother taught us to love and support each other work hard and be decent people even though its been years since weve been together as a family the lessons they taught us stay with us to this day the brothers now live in different parts of the country frank travelled the furthest for the family reunion at cruachan  coming from skelmersdale in lancashire which is over 280 miles away martin said the staff at cruachan made the visit really special for us id like to thank them again we had a great time and its a trip that we will always remember i hope to visit again in the future with my wife ishbel mcfarlane cruachan visitor centre team leader accompanied the brothers on the tour she said when the brothers got in touch we were more than happy to accommodate them they were a delight to show round the power station and it was so interesting hearing their stories and memories about their father i hope they enjoyed their time at cruachan and will visit again in the future after the visit the brothers each received a scarf made from the special tartan drax commissioned to commemorate the men who built cruachan you can find out more about the

is inviting schools and colleges back to its eponymous power station for the first time since the country went into lockdown due to covid19 prior to the pandemic drax power station near selby in north yorkshire welcomed more than 12000 visitors every year many of whom were students visiting as part of the renewable energy companys initiatives to encourage young people to study stem science technology engineering and maths subjects boosting skills across the region in line with lockdown rules drax suspended its public tours in march 2020 to protect its key workers who worked around the clock throughout the pandemic to ensure the country had the renewable electricity it needed drax produces 12 of the uks renewable electricity  more than any other generator wyke sixth form college in hull was one of the first schools to visit the power station since it reopened taking part in a tour which supported the work the students are doing to understand how renewable electricity is generated plant director bruce heppenstall said we work closely with schools in our communities to inspire the next generation to study stem subjects and were pleased to be able to offer tours of the power station again after being closed to the public for so long these tours are so important  they fire up students imaginations by showing them some of the cuttingedge green technologies were pioneering such as beccs which could play a vital role in addressing the climate crisis as well as delivering jobs and clean growth here in the north wyke sixth form college students in front of drax biomass domes the group of 20 students aged between 16 and 18 were taken on a full tour of the site which included seeing draxs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project beccs is a vital negative emissions technology which drax plans to use to permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year whilst also generating the reliable renewable electricity the country needs beccs at drax would support over 10000 jobs at its peak and it is vital that the regions workforce has the skills needed to deliver this green energy technology enabling the uk to meet its net zero target sophie thompson head of science at wyke sixth form college said the students had a great day at drax learning about how the electricity system works and where our electricity is generated visits like this are so valuable because seeing the power station and the scale of the operations is impossible to replicate in a classroom  it really brings the subject to life during the tour pupils learnt how renewable electricity is generated and discovered how sustainable wood pellets have enabled drax to reduce its carbon emissions by 95 in a decade making it europes biggest decarbonisation project they saw the 427metre turbine hall that houses the huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity as well as the wood pellet storage domes  each large enough to fit the royal albert hall inside and the 115m high cooling towers which are taller than the statue of liberty tours are free to all primary and secondary schools and can be
