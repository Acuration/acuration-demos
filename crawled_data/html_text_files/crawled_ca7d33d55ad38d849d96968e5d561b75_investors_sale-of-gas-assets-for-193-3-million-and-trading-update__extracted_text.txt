company symbol drx drax is pleased to announce that it has reached agreement for the sale of drax generation enterprise limited dgel which holds four combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power stations to vpi holding limited vpi for consideration of 1933 million subject to customary adjustments this includes 290 million of contingent consideration associated with the option to develop a new ccgt at damhead creek the transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions including antitrust approval with completion to take place by 31 january 2021 the ccgts have performed well since acquisition by drax in december 2018 but do not form part of the groups core flexible and renewable generation strategy drax expects to realise a premium on sale use the proceeds to develop its biomass supply chain and accelerate its ambition to become a carbon negative business by 2030 dgel also holds the groups pumped storage and hydro assets and is the shareholder of smw limited the owner of the daldowie fuel plant these assets shares and employees are to be transferred out of dgel prior to completion and will be retained by drax highlights sale of noncore gas generation and development assets for consideration of 1933 million expected premium on sale to book value subject to customary adjustments returns significantly ahead of the groups weighted average cost of capital

focusing on our flexible and renewable generation activities in the uk we expect to deliver a further reduction in the groups co 2 emissions which should accelerate our ambition to become not just carbon neutral but carbon negative by 2030 by using carbon capture and storage with biomass beccs at the power station in north yorkshire to underpin the decarbonisation of the wider humber region we believe we would be creating and supporting around 50000 new jobs and delivering a green economic recovery in the north we greatly value the contribution that our colleagues in gas generation have made to the group over the last two years as we focus on a renewable and flexible portfolio it is right that we divest these gas generation assets and in doing so create value for our shareholders between 2012 and 2019 through investment in sustainable biomass and hydro drax has reduced its carbon emissions by over 85 and become the largest source of renewable electricity in the uk 1  in december 2019 drax announced an ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 the negative emissions provided by beccs will offset carbon emissions within the groups supply chain and help to offset emissions in harder to abate sectors of the economy such as aviation and agriculture in february 2020 drax announced an end to commercial coal generation in 2021 and now by divesting its existing gas generation assets drax will further reduce its carbon emissions drax will continue to provide system support services alongside its decarbonisation strategy through its renewable generation portfolio other development opportunities and demandside response within its customers business these activities provide renewable electricity and a fully flexible generation and supply portfolio which can support the uk power system as it becomes increasingly reliant on intermittent and inflexible generation sources about the assets and transitional arrangements rye house power

england and blackburn mill 60mw commissioned in 2002 in lancashire england drax acquired the ccgts from iberdrola in december 2018 as part of a portfolio of pumped storage hydro and gas generation the majority of the value in the acquisition was ascribed to the pumped storage and hydro assets which in the first six months of 2020 provided 35 million of adjusted ebitda 3  in the same period the ccgts provided 18 million of adjusted ebitda group adjusted ebitda for the first six months of 2020 was 179 million as at 30 june 2020 the gross fixed assets for the ccgts were 182 million the ccgts also have 89 million of capacity market income between 2021 and 2024 4 which will remain with dgel on completion the ccgt business currently employs 121 people in operational roles who will transfer with dgel on completion drax has agreed a series of transitional services to support the transition through 2021 other gas projects drax continues to evaluate options for the development of four open cycle gas turbines and drax power station following the end of coal operations financial total consideration is 1933 million subject to customary completion accounts adjustments comprising 1643 million for the four ccgt power stations and a further 290 million of contingent consideration payable on satisfaction of certain triggers in respect of the option to develop a new ccgt at damhead creek the payment of 1643 million in respect of the four ccgts is payable in cash on completion with an option to defer the payment of 500 million until april 2022 the deferred component would carry an interest rate of four percent and be backed by a letter of credit in the event that the deferral option is exercised drax intends to convert the payment obligation to cash upon completion for the face value subject to fulfilment of preclosing conditions completion is to take place by 31 january 2021 the sale price represents an expected premium compared to the book value of the assets subject to customary adjustments and a return over the period of ownership significantly ahead of the groups wacc biomass strategy  investment in capacity expansion and cost reduction sustainable biomass wood pellet storage domes at baton rouge transit a renewable fuel storage and logistics site operated by drax at the port of greater baton rouge louisiana click to viewdownload the proceeds from the sale of the ccgts are expected to be used to support the development of the groups biomass strategy through which drax aims to build a longterm future for sustainable biomass drax aims to do this by expanding its supply chain to five million tonnes of selfsupply capacity by 2027 15 million today plus 05 million tonnes in development and reducing the cost of biomass to 50mwh 5  these savings will be delivered through the optimisation of existing biomass operations greater utilisation of lowcost wood residues and an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other lowcost renewable biomass across the groups expanded supply chain drax believes that the additional capital and operating cost investment required to deliver this supply chain expansion is in the region of 600 million which the group expects to invest ahead of 2027 drax remains alert to sector opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth the group has identified three models through which it believes it can deliver a longterm future for sustainable biomass all of which are underpinned by the delivery of its supply chain expansion and cost reduction plans these options which are not mutually exclusive are summarised below the delivery of one or more of these models by 2027 would enable drax to continue its biomass activities when the current uk renewable schemes for biomass generation end in march 2027 1 merchant biomass generation at drax power station drax believe that biomass has an important role to play in the uk as a flexible and reliable source of renewable energy supporting increased utilisation of intermittent and inflexible generation across the uk power grid in march 2027 when the current cfd6 and roc 7 renewable schemes end drax believes that through a combination of peak power generation system support services capacity market income and a lowcost operating model for drax power station including lowcost biomass this site can continue to operate as a merchant renewable

what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding objective of being net zero by 2050 this includes an important role for beccs to remove co 2 from the atmosphere creating negative emissions beccs is the only largescale solution for negative emissions with renewable electricity and system support capabilities through combining beccs with its existing four biomass generation units at drax power station drax believes it could remove up to 16 million tonnes of co 2 per year  over two thirds of the cccs 2035 target for beccs in doing so drax aims to become a carbon negative company by 2030 the technology to deliver postcombustion beccs exists and is proven at scale in september 2020 drax commenced a trial of one such technology provided by mitsubishi heavy industries mhi in addition drax is developing innovative technology options including ccapture a partnership between leeds university drax ip group and bp which has developed an organic solvent which could be used for beccs innovation engineer inspects pilot carbon capture facility at drax power station click to viewdownload 3 third party biomass supply drax expects global demand for wood pellets to increase in the current decade as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes which recognise the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation whilst there is an abundance of unprocessed sustainable biomass material globally there remains limited capacity to convert these materials into energy dense pellets which have a lowcarbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation as a result drax expects the global market for biomass to remain under supplied drax is therefore exploring options to service biomass demand in europe north america and asia alongside the uk establishing a presence in these markets could offer the potential for longterm offtake agreements providing diversified revenues from other biomass markets trading update since publishing its half year results on 29 july 2020 the trading and operational performance of the group has remained robust in the usa the groups pellet production business is commissioning 100000 tonnes of new production capacity at its morehouse facility in louisiana as part of its previously announced plans to add 350000 tonnes across its three existing production sites by 2022 the project is part of the groups plan to expand its sustainable biomass supply chain and reduce costs the generation business has continued to perform well in the provision of system support services responding to both the low and high demand needs of the uk electricity system in addition to the successful completion of a major planned outage and upgrade of a biomass unit at drax power station the group has progressed its earlier stage development work on beccs alongside the commencement of a solvent trial with mhi drax has awarded prefeed front end engineering design contracts and expects to incur incremental operating costs associated with the development of a full feed study during 2021 at its half year results in july 2020 drax noted that further lockdown measures in the uk in the second half of 2020 could create a small downside risk on the performance of the customers business principally in the sme 8 market drax is continuing to assess operational and strategic options for this part of the group the groups expectations for 2020
