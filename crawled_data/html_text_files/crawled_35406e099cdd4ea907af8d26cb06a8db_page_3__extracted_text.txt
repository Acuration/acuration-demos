texas instruments set about attempting to create the worlds first handheld calculator in the early sixties it estimated that such a complicated device might require a battery as big and powerful as a cars  with some innovative thinking the team were eventually able to power the device with just a fivevolt battery turning the calculator into a truly handheld device and kickstarting an electronics efficiency revolution continuous advances in the space mean that todays superpowered smartphones run on more efficient powerful  and smaller  sources than ever before but as more of our devices become smart and grow in usage their electricity demand is also increasing on the other hand many bigger objects that traditionally have used a lot of power are becoming more efficient and consuming less electricity than before the small devices eating up electricity think of the most electricityintensive appliance in a home something constantly running like a fridgefreezer might come to mind  or something intensive that operates in short blasts like a hairdryer or kettle however a surprising drain of electricity in homes is tv settop boxes and consoles which as recently as 2016 were reported to account for as much as half of all electricity usage by domestic electronics  this is because of how often they are left in standby mode which means they are constantly using a small amount of electricity in 1999 the international energy agency iea introduced the one watt initiative which led to the electricity consumption of many devices on standby falling from around five watts to below one watt and while this has helped reduce standby or vampire power multiplied across the country  the electricity consumption becomes significant  in the uk there are an estimated 27 million tvs this is not just a tvspecific problem however it is symptomatic of many of the modern devices increasingly found in our homes  from smart lightbulbs to amazons alexa these are constantly using small amounts of electricity listening and connecting to the cloud even when not being directly used in 2014 the iea estimated that by 2020 these networkeddevices could result in 120 billion in wasted electricity  adding to this is the increasing demand of the cloud and data storage which has been estimated could account for 20 of the worlds electricity consumption by 2025  previous alarm bells surrounding the bitcoin networks electricity usage highlights that its not just physical connected objects that will put increasing pressure on electricity supply but also entirely digital products yet even as little things become smarter and require more electricity some big things that have previously consumed huge amounts of electricity are becoming more efficient the big things becoming more efficient buildings are a big source of electricity demand globally office blocks full of lights and blasting heating and airconditioning units are among the main offenders but poorly insulated homes that leak heat also have a significant impact efforts are constantly being undertaken to reduce this via technological means such as companies generating their own electricity onsite from installed renewables  but cutting interstitial demand to a minimum doesnt always have to be hitech the bullitt centre in seattle is a 50000 ft 2 office aiming to be the greenest commercial building in the world this is achieved in part through a rooftop solar array that allows the building to generate more electricity than it consumes but is complimented by more straightforward steps such as maximising natural light and ventilation collecting rainwater and the use of geothermal heat pumps on average the building consumes 230000 kilowatthours kwhyear compared to the average of 1077000 kwhyear for seattle offices retrofitting can also make notable reductions to energy usage and new york artdeco icon the empire state building has been updated to consume 40 less electricity  this is largely thanks to straightforward renovations such as ensuring windows open properly and temperatures can be easily controlled energy efficiency is even extending beyond the confines of the planet the international space station only consumes about 90 kw to run which comes from a solar array stretching more than 2400m 2  when its solar panels are operational about 60 of their generation is used to refill batteries for when the station is in the earths shadow the mars desert research station mdrs in utah technology like this will be essential if humans are going to put buildings on other planets

flexibility and stability and power system security  gas  hydroelectric power  investors acquisition agreement amended to mitigate risk to 2019 capacity payments 3 december 2018 investors rns number 1455j this announcement contains inside information the revised contractual arrangements are designed to mitigate the risk to 2019 capacity payments arising from the recent suspension of the capacity market commenting on todays announcement will gardiner chief executive officer of drax group said the strategic merits of this acquisition remain unchanged and the board believes there is a compelling logic in our move to add further flexible sources of power to our offering which will accelerate our ability to deliver our strategic vision of a lowercarbon lowercost energy future for the uk the capacity market is a central pillar of the uks energy policy and ensures security of supply while minimising costs to consumers the government has stated it is working closely with the european commission to aid their investigation and to reinstate the full capacity market regime including existing agreements as soon as possible to mitigate the risk that capacity payments take time to be restored we have agreed revised terms which provide protection in 2019 beyond 2019 while reinstatement of the capacity market is the most likely outcome we considered other outcomes the more plausible of which would still deliver returns in excess of draxs weighted average cost of capital the acquisition makes financial and strategic sense delivering material value to our shareholders through longterm earnings and attractive returns capacity market on 15 november 2018 the general court of the european union issued a ruling annulling the european commissions 2014 decision not to undertake a more detailed investigation of the uk governments scheme establishing the capacity market the ruling the ruling imposed a standstill period while the european commission completes a further state aid investigation into the capacity market payments to generators scheduled under existing capacity agreements and the holding of future capacity auctions have been suspended cruachan power station on loch awe argylle and bute contracted capacity payments make up a significant proportion of the earnings of the portfolio for the period from 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2022 the cruachan pumped storage hydro asset has contracted capacity payments of 29 million the galloway runofriver hydro assets have contracted capacity payments of 5m million and the combined cycle gas turbine assets have contracted capacity payments of 122 million in aggregate drax notes the uk governments statement in response to the ruling that it is working closely with the european commission to aid their investigation and to seek a timely state aid reapproval decision for the capacity market the uk government also confirmed that the ruling does not change its belief that capacity market auctions are the most appropriate way to deliver secure electricity supplies at the lowest cost and that the ruling was decided on procedural grounds and did not constitute a direct challenge to the design of the capacity market itself lanark hydro scheme lanarkshire based on the information available and legal advice it has received drax believes that the most likely outcome is that the european commission will reapprove the existing capacity market in its current or a broadly similar form despite the above drax recognises there is some uncertainty whether the contracted capacity payments for the 201819 capacity market year which are currently suspended will be paid by the uk government to mitigate the risk that these payments are not received for the 201819 capacity market year drax has agreed with iberdrola certain amendments to the agreement signed on 16 october 2018 arrangements with iberdrola in respect of 201819 capacity payments drax and iberdrola have agreed a risk sharing mechanism in respect of capacity payments for the period 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2019 worth 36 million if less than 100 of these payments are received and the gross profit of the portfolio for the full year 2019 the 2019 gross profit is lower than expected drax will receive a payment from iberdrola of up to 26 million the mechanism also gives iberdrola the opportunity to earn an upside of up to 26 million if less than 100 of these payments are received but the portfolio performs better than expected in 2019 1  under these arrangements if less than 100 of these capacity payments are received iberdrola will make a payment to drax if the 2019 gross profit is less than 155 million the payment will be an amount equal to 72 of any shortfall in the 2019 gross profit below 155 million the amount of the payment is capped at the lower of the amount in respect of capacity payments due to the portfolio but not received and 26 million and drax will make a payment to iberdrola if the 2019 gross profit is more than 165 million the payment will be an amount equal to 72 of any amount by which the 2019 gross profit exceeds 165 million the amount of the payment is capped at the lower of the amount in respect of capacity payments due to the portfolio but not received by drax and 26 million a pylon carries electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe in the mountains of the west highlands of scotland if subsequently drax receives any capacity payments in respect of the period 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2019 drax will pay 72 of those amounts to iberdrola capped at the amount paid by iberdrola to drax under the mechanism above drax and iberdrola have agreed that capacity payments due to the portfolio in respect of the period before completion will be passed through to iberdrola any payments pursuant to the arrangements with iberdrola will be cash adjustments to the consideration and not included in ebitda 2  benefits of the acquisition shoreham power station west sussex based on draxs expectations of the position that is most likely to be achieved in relation to the capacity market following the ruling drax believes the acquisition represents an attractive opportunity to create significant value for shareholders and is expected to deliver returns significantly in excess of draxs weighted average cost of capital drax has considered other possible outcomes for the capacity market which are less likely but may ensue and if they did the financial effects of the acquisition may be adversely affected drax believes that if the more plausible of these outcomes were to ensue the returns from the acquisition would still be in excess of the draxs weighted average cost of capital drax has not attempted to quantify the effect if the less plausible of these other outcomes were to ensue  if there were no capacity market or similar mechanism or if significant structural changes were made to the capacity market drax sees these as a remote possibility and notes that in those circumstances it believes the loss or reduction of capacity payments could be mitigated by increases in wholesale power prices the acquisition strengthens draxs ability to pay a growing and sustainable dividend drax remains committed to its capital allocation policy and to its current 50 million share buyback programme with 42 million of shares purchased to date 2019 profit forecast daldowie fuel plant glasgow based on recent power and commodity prices and assuming that all contracted capacity payments are received the portfolio is expected to generate ebitda in 2019 in a range of 90 million to 110 million from gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments rocs 3 and the daldowie energyfromwaste plant if in light of the ruling the contracted capacity payments payable in 2019 in respect of the portfolio are not received or accrued in 2019 the expected ebitda for the portfolio in 2019 would be reduced by up to 47 million from a range of 90 million to 110 million down to a range of 43 million to 63 million before considering mitigating factors drax believes that the arrangements agreed with iberdrola mitigate in economic terms the majority of the risk that those suspended capacity payments will not be paid assuming performance in line with current expectations and if all capacity payments due in 2019 are received before the end of 2019 net debt to ebitda is expected to fall to draxs longterm target of around 2x by the end of 2019 if capacity payments are not received in 2019 net debt to ebitda is expected to fall to around 2x during 2020 drax current trading and 2018 outlook following the ruling 7 million of contracted capacity payments relating to 2018 principally in relation to draxs remaining two coalfired units will not be paid as and when expected taking this into account and following draxs recent good trading performance and assuming continued good operational availability for the remainder of the year draxs full year ebitda outlook remains in line with

contract agreement with scottish water until 2026 benefits of the acquisition a leading provider of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in

parties and consideration the acquisition agreement was entered into on 16 october 2018 between drax smart generation and the seller pursuant to the acquisition agreement the seller has agreed to sell and drax smart generation has agreed to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of spgen for 702 million subject to certain customary adjustments in respect of cash debt and working capital drax group holdings limited has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of drax smart generation under the acquisition agreement scottish power uk plc has agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of the seller under the acquisition agreement conditions to completion the acquisition is conditional on the approval of the acquisition by drax shareholders which is required as the acquisition constitutes a class 1 transaction under the listing rules the shareholder approval condition and the cma having indicated that it has no further questions at that stage in response to precompletion engagement by drax or the cma having provided a decision that the acquisition will not be subject to a reference under the uk merger control regime completion is currently expected to occur on 31 december 2018 assuming that the conditions are satisfied by that date termination for material reduction in available generation capacity drax smart generation has the right to terminate the acquisition agreement upon the occurrence of a material reduction in available generation capacity at any of the cruachan galloway and lanark or damhead creek facilities which subsists or is reasonably likely to subsist for a continuous period of three months the right of drax smart generation to terminate in these circumstances is subject to the sellers right to defer completion if the relevant material reduction in available generation capacity can be resolved by end of the month following the anticipated date of completion break fee a break fee of 146 million equal to 1 of draxs market capitalisation at close of business on the day before announcement is payable if the shareholder approval condition is not met save where this is as a result of a material reduction in available generation capacity as described above precompletion covenants the seller has given certain customary covenants in relation to the period between signing of the acquisition agreement and completion including to carry on the spgen business in the ordinary and usual course the seller will carry out certain reorganisation steps prior to completion pension liabilities drax smart generation has agreed to assume the accrued defined benefit pension liabilities associated with the employees of the spgen group as at the date of signing the acquisition agreement following completion the spgen group will continue to participate in the sellers group defined benefit pension scheme known as the scottishpower pension scheme spps for an interim period of 12 months unless agreed otherwise the interim period while a new pension scheme is set up by the spgen group for the benefit of its employees the new scheme at the end of the interim period the spps trustees will be requested to transfer from the spps to the new scheme an amount of liabilities and corresponding share of assets agreed between the seller and drax smart generation or failing agreement an amount determined by an independent actuary in respect of the past service liabilities relating to the spgen group employees if the amount of assets transferred to the new scheme does not match the amount agreed or independently determined there will be a trueup between the seller and drax smart generation if the spps trustees do not make any transfer to the new scheme within the period of 18 months following the interim period unless this was caused by a breach of the acquisition agreement by the seller drax smart generation has agreed to pay 16 million plus base rate interest to the seller as compensation for the spps liabilities not taken on by the new scheme sellers warranties indemnities and tax covenant the seller has provided customary warranties in the acquisition agreement the seller also has provided drax smart generation with indemnities in respect of certain specific matters including for any losses associated with the reorganisation referred to above a customary tax covenant is also provided in the acquisition agreement transitional services agreement the seller and spgen will enter into a transitional services agreement effective at completion the specific nature terms and charges relating to the services to be provided will be agreed between the seller and spgen prior to completion the seller will also provide assistance in relation to the extraction and separation of the spgen group from the systems of the seller and integration of the spgen group onto the systems of the drax group appendix 2 profit forecast profit forecast for the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 including bases and assumptions the portfolio is expected based on recent power and commodity prices to generate ebitda in a range of 90110 million profit forecast and gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs pumped storage and hydro activities represent a significant proportion of the earnings associated with the portfolio for the purpose of the profit forecast ebitda is stated before any allocation of group overheads as these will be an allocation of the existing drax group cost base which is not expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the portfolio basis of preparation the profit forecast has been compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and on the basis of the accounting policies of the drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to change the ebitda results of the portfolio it also does not reflect the impact of ifrs16 which would apply in respect of the 2019 annual report and accounts the profit forecast has been prepared with reference to unaudited 2017 financial statements based on the audited financial statements of scottish power generation limited and smw limited adjusted to exclude results of assets that do not form part of the portfolio and restated in accordance with drax accounting policies the audited financial statements of the entities forming the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2017 the unaudited management accounts of the portfolio for the nine months ending 30 september 2018 and on the basis of the projected financial performance of the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 the profit forecast is a best estimate of the ebitda that the portfolio will generate for a future period of a year in respect of assets and operations that are not yet under the control of drax accordingly the degree of uncertainty relating to the assumptions underpinning the profit forecast is inherently greater than would be the case for a profit forecast based on assets and operation under the control of drax andor which covered a shorter future period the profit forecast has been prepared as at today and will be updated in the shareholder circular the forecast cost base reflects the expectations of the drax directors of the operating regime of the portfolio under draxs ownership and the central support it will require principal assumptions the profit forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions assumptions within managements control there is no change in the composition of the portfolio there is no material change to the manner in which these assets are operated there are no material changes to the existing running costs  operating costs of the portfolio there will be no material restrictions on running each of the assets in the portfolio other than those that would be envisaged in the ordinary course no material issues with the migration of services including trading and information technology from scottish power to drax no hedges are transferred as part of the transaction transaction costs and oneoff costs associated with the integration are not included assumptions outside of managements control the acquisition of the portfolio is completed on 31 december 2018 there is no material change to existing prevailing uk macroeconomic and political conditions prior to 31 december 2019 there are no material changes in market conditions in electricity generating market and no change to the uk energy supply

scifi stalwart the blend of familiar vehicle combined with advancedartificial intelligence makes it a perfect symbol of a nottoodistant future which is fast approaching but what a scifi movie is unlikely to show is a selfdriving car pulling over for half an hour to fill its tank or recharge its batteries as autonomous vehicles gradually inch into our everyday life the question of how they will be powered arises as does whether they will be capable of refuelling or recharging without a helping human hand with governments around the world setting ambitious targets for the phasing out of diesel and petrol car sales its safe to assume the driverless vehicles of the future will be electric but will they be able to charge themselves more than that how would a large influx of these cars coming onto our roads affect our national electricity demand and emissions  how will driverless cars charge themselves development is already well underway to bring humanfree charging to the auto world with a variety of approaches being trialled robotic charging points the most straightforward way to enable selfdriving electric vehicles evs to charge themselves is through updating existing infrastructure adding on robotic limbs to standard charge points would be one way of removing the need for human hands tesla previously demonstrated a porotype of a snakelike arm that plugs into its vehicles charge points that does exactly this undercar charging easier than flailing robotic arms is the idea of charging cars from underneath a parked car unsurprisingly tesla has patented a version of the technology too while building the technology into the ground adds complications it could potentially allow cars to be charged while moving  which is exactly what one road in sweden is doing  the two kilometre stretch outside stockholm features a metal track that an arm under evs can connect to  much like a scalextric track the route is divided into 50metre sections which are electrified separately as vehicles travel over them sweden is now planning to roll the concept out nationally wireless charging a step up from undercar charging wireless technology uses inductive charging rather than physically connecting with the car  and can be installed into parking spaces or be set into the tarmac the problem with this is its not as fast as directly connecting with the car however implemented at scale entire roads could constantly charge vehicles when they need a top up it would mean that rather than taking evs home and plugging them in the city and roads themselves would charge it but even the idea of keeping a car at home might fade as cars become increasingly autonomous rethinking vehicle ownership as more of the worlds population move to cities and they grow increasingly congested car ownership is declining  a trend being further fueled by ridesharing services like uber lyft and didi chuxing in china and as services such as these continue to grow in popularity it could point to a future where rather than owning selfdriving cars they will be shared among urban populations lyft strategist raj kapoor suggested the reduced cost of maintenance of shared evs would make rides cheap enough for the average person to ride in every day  this could result in fewer cars on the roads as intelligent systems allow them to coordinate sharing across the population which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for charging however the more intense computing power needed in selfdriving vehicles means they will each use more electricity than a standard ev  powering these sufficiently will depend on technology and coordination rather than producing significantly more electricity smarter cars smarter cities smarter electricity changes in car ownership could mean the total reshaping of cities if cars dont need to park for long periods of times on central roadsides and in garages vehicles could instead be stored on the outskirts of cities when demand for transport is low and make their way into towns as people begin commuting this vision of cars seemingly independently rolling around cities to exactly where theyre needed depends not on a single car reacting to a single command but to a network of data points connected to almost every aspect of a city more than this theres even potential these cars could provide power as well as use it vehicletogird v2g technology means they can essentially act as batteries and return electricity to the grid when needed a fully connected network of autonomous cars linked to buildings cities and entire electricity networks could be used to help meet demand on a local or national scale helping avoid fossil fuel usage at times of stress while increasing ev usage will likely contribute to an increase in electricity demand selfdriving smarter vehicles will ensure power is used at efficiently as possible and reduce the number of cars drawing electricity from the grid it ultimately means global investment in the charging infrastructure that will create a more connected and economical transport system which will make widespread ev and autonomous cars a reality tags battery energy storage  electric vehicles evs  electricity  energy storage the power systems super subs 5 february 2018 power generation every day we flick on lights load dishwashers and boil kettles but few of us pause and think of the stress this can cause for the electricity system we certainly dont call national grid in advance to let them know when we plan to do laundry but when any number of the 258 million households in great britain turn on a washing machine the grid needs to be ready for it fortunately these spikes in demand are often predictable we are creatures of habit says ian foy drax head of ancillary services we all tend to come home from work at the same time and turn on similar appliances and this keeps the shape of daily electricity demand much the same national grid the operator of great britains high voltage power transmission system uses this consistent demand to plan when and how much electricity will be needed for the coming days and agrees contracts with generators to meet it however there are times when the unexpected can happen  an unseasonable cold spell or a power station breakdown  causing sudden imbalances in supply and demand to plan for this the grid carries reserve power which is used to fill these shortterm gaps delivering this doesnt just mean keeping additional power stations running to deliver last minute electricity instead it involves a range of services coming from different types of providers technologies and timescales in great britain there are four primary ways this is delivered frequency response the fastest form of reserve is frequency response it is an automatic change in either electricity generation or demand in response to the system frequency deviating from the target 50hz  generation and demand must be kept balanced within tight limits second by second failure to do so could lead to the whole system becoming unstable leading to the risk of blackouts this is why every second of the day national grid has power generators operating in frequency response mode these power stations effectively connect their steam governor or fuel valves to a frequency signal if frequency falls generation increases if frequency rises generation is reduced an issue which has arisen over the past few years is a reduction in system inertia  the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension some small power generation technologies along with some demand are sensitive to the rate of change of frequency  too high a rate can cause it to disconnect from the system and this unplanned activity can lead to system instability some forms of generation such as wind and solar along with high voltage direct current hvdc interconnectors between great britain and the rest of europe do not provide inertia as these electricity sources grow on the system the system operator must find ways to accommodate them reducing the size of the largest credible loss eg reducing interconnector load buying faster frequency response or running conventional generation out of merit are the usual approaches spinning reserve the next quickest and most common reserve source spinning reserve can jump into action and start delivering electricity in just two minutes this reserve both positive and negative is carried on multiple generating units often running at a part load position for example if draxs biomass unit 3 is running at 350 mw of a possible 645 mw typical delivery rates are 10 to 20 mw per minute this type of reserve responds to unexpected shortterm changes in power demand or changes in power generation either in size or timing for example during a major tv event or if a generator changes output unexpectedly during television ad breaks the millions of people watching may switch on kettles or flick on lights sending demand soaring  if a programme or sporting event does not end at the scheduled time national grid has to quickly change the generation schedule by sending an electronic dispatch to a generator who responds by quickly ramping up or down thermal power stations such as drax along with hydro and pumped storage which can increase or decrease output on demand  are the most common providers of this form of reserve but newer technologies such as batteries will also be able to offer the speed required  short term operating reserve stor a slightly slower cousin to spinning reserve stor is contracted months in advance by national grid it is designed to be available within 20 minutes notice around 2 gigawatts gw of capacity can provide reserves against exceptionally large losses or demand spikes stor capacity tends to be plant which cannot make a living in the energy market because it has a high marginal cost traditionally stor has been supplied by low efficiency aeroderivative turbines or diesel engines but a wider variety of technologies from batteries to demand reduction are increasingly being contracted demand turn up managing reserve power isnt just about finding extra generation to meet demand sometimes its about quickly addressing too much generation high levels of generation coming onto the grid without an equally high demand can overload power lines and networks  causing instability and frequency imbalances  which can lead to blackouts this might happen in the summer months when the weather allows for lots of intermittent renewable generation such as wind and solar but low levels of demand due to factors like warmer weather and longer daylight hours to restore balance the grid is beginning to ask intensive commercial or industrial electricity users to increase consumption or turn off any of their own generation in favour of gridprovided power in the case of generating units at drax power station  the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation to help slow the rate of frequency change and minimises large frequency swings reserve in a changing energy system planning for the unexpected has long been a staple of the electricity system but as the shape of that system changes  reserve and response delivery is having to change too carrying reserve is easier on conventional plants because you know what the plant is capable of generating says foy wind and solar are subject to the weather which changes over time the certainty you get with conventional generation you dont necessarily get with the intermittency of weatherdependant renewables add to that the way we use electricity everything from high efficiency lighting electric vehicles through to smart appliances and we can see the challenges will grow as more variable renewables hits the system storage technologies will become more important in providing a fastacting source of short term reserve and response smart appliance technology too will play a bigger role in spreading demand across the day and reducing the size of demand peaks and troughs which require rapid changes in generation industry has a role to play too some of the biggest users of electricity are expected to play an increasingly important role in support of the system operator

power station ocgt with planning permission until these technologies and market mechanisms are widespread and implemented at scale across the grid however it will fall to thermal power stations such as biomass  gas turbines such as the planned progress power in suffolk and on occasion coal to ensure there is the required reserve power available this short story is adapted from a series on the

power generation the world is generating and using more renewable electricity than ever before but in many cases it is being generated by intermittent  weather dependent  sources like solar and wind while these are imperative to a decarbonised future they cant generate power all the time and this can cause gaps in electricity supply one possible solution is storage if we can store renewable electricity from intermittent sources when they are able to generate it could then be utilised at times when theyre not however the problem is the technology capable of storing electricity at a scale large enough to power a city doesnt existyet the race to develop it is well under way and several companies are working on building ever bigger more efficient electricity storage methods from pumping water up mountains to turning air into liquid here are the emerging storage technologies and some incumbent ones shaping the storage landscape pumped hydropower what if we could power cities with something as simple as gravity and a mountain pumped hydropower storage uses excess electricity to pump water from a lower reservoir up to a higher one for example up a mountain or hill where it is stored when electricity is needed the water is released from the higher reservoir and runs down the natural incline passing through a typical hydropower turbine to generate electricity pumped hydro is one of the largestcapacity forms of grid power storage and currently accounts for 99 of all bulk storage globally  the bath county pumped storage station in virginia usa is often referred to as the worlds biggest battery and boasts a generation capacity of more than 3 gigawatts gw  which is almost as much as the power output of drax power station or hinkley point c so whats the catch while pumpedhydro storage is efficient and capable of holding huge capacity its major drawback is it requires a suitable mountain or hill to be converted into a giant battery unsurprisingly not every landscape offers one great britain has limited potential  but has a number of pumped storage facilities including the impressive dinorwig in the snowdonia region of wales known as the electric mountain which like drax doubles up as a tourist attraction in december 2018 drax bought cruachan power station the second biggest pumpedhydro storage power station in great britain visit cruachan  the hollow mountain  flywheels and supercapacitors some of the mostrapidly responding forms of energy storage flywheel and supercapacitor storage can both discharge and recharge faster than most conventional forms of batteries the first works by spinning a rotor or flywheel to very high speeds using electrical energy this process creates kinetic energy which is effectively stored within the spinning rotor until its required at which point the kinetic energy is converted back into electricity supercapacitors take a similar approach but store power electrically with the combined properties of a battery and a capacitor they store energy as a static charge but unlike conventional batteries there is no chemical reaction during charging or discharging lithiumion batteries lithiumion batteries are already the goto power source for most home electronics thanks to their highenergy density and low selfdischarge rates but companies are looking to extend their usage by rapidly advancing the technology to take on bigger and better uses most notably electric vehicles evs and providing security of supply to national and regional electricity networks in south australia tesla has just finished installing the worlds biggest lithiumion battery facility  at 100 megawatts mw it will be able to supply 30000 homes for an hour such as when the wind drops and the turbines of the wind farm it is connected to are not producing much power lithiumion batteries are now the most widely used in evs but manufacturers are still facing the challenge of lowering the cost of their manufacture to a point at which to make evs widely accessible tesla has made achieving this a priority establishing its massive gigafactory in nevada to help ramp up production and drop the batteries price a true breakthrough on this point is yet to be reached however solid state batteries the primary complaint for most domestic batteries today be they in smartphones or evs is they just dont last long enough this is where solidstate batteries have a serious advantage using solid electrodes and electrolytes rather than liquid electrolytes used in most commercial batteries solidstate models are smaller cheaper and have a greater energy density than lithiumion batteries they can also be recharged much faster and emit less heat in an ev this can lead to better efficiency lower costs and safer operation the only trouble is the technology isnt quite viable at scale yet dyson and toyota are both putting serious money behind the technology and believe it will be on the market in 2020 hydrogen fuel cells hydrogen is one of the mostabundant elements on earth so its an attractive fuel for any powergeneration technology the latest to emerge is hydrogen fuel cells which are quickly growing in popularity in the automotive space the fuel cells work similarly to batteries with two electrodes separated by an electrolyte however rather than running down and needing recharging hydrogen fuel cells can continue to produce electricity so long as a constant supply of hydrogen and an oxidizer are pumped through it this means a regular supply of hydrogen needs to be fed in to continue to generate power  prompting the rise of fuelling stations where hydrogenpowered cars can be filled up with hydrogen when their batteries have run dry beyond powering cars hydrogen fuel cells have also been used to power buildings and nasa satellites  vehicletogrid systems but what if beyond simply using electricity evs could themselves act as energy storage systems between journeys all cars spend long periods of time stationary vehicletogrid v2g systems can take advantage of this and give evs the ability to discharge their stored electricity for distribution across the grid helping meet demand during peak times in effect cars can become mini power plants nissan and italian energy provider enel have already advanced plans for this sort of system and aim to install around one hundred cartogrid charging points across the uk  evs plugged into these sites will be able to both charge their batteries and feed stored energy back to the national grid when necessary drax too is involved in this space funding research into v2g systems at sheffield university  smart charging systems will help to automate this giveandtake of electricity further and allow evs to further help reduce overall carbon emissions  compressed air energy compressed air energy storage works similarly to pumped hydropower but instead of pushing water uphill excess electricity is used to compress and store energy underground when electricity is needed the pressurised air is heated which causes it to expand and released driving a turbine behind pumped hydroenergy compressed air is the secondlargest form of energy storage  and is continuously being developed to become more efficient and less dependent on fossil fuels to heat air and similarly to pumped hydro its a sitespecific means of storage compressed air is normally best stored in existing geological formations such as disused hard rock or old salt mines leadacid batteries their technology might be a century and a half old but leadacid batteries are still used today for the simple reason that they still work many decades of development mean leadacid batteries are cheap to produce and highly reliable compared to new innovations in the space today they are most commonly used as car batteries but they have also long served as offgrid storage for solar arrays  their drawbacks include the toxic nature of the chemicals involved and the short lifespan of 300 to 500 cycles however recycling programmes around these leadacid batteries have been so effective that 99 of the batteries in the us were recycled between 2009 and 2013  while moreefficient longer lasting faster charging and lighter batteries are in development leadacid models remain the cheap triedandtested standard for smallscale storage redox flow batteries specifically focusing on renewable energy storage flow batteries are significantly cheaper than lithiumion gridscale storage and offer a longer lifecycle flow batteries consist of two tanks of liquids that are pumped into a reactor where they generate a charge the capacity of the storage facility is therefore determined by the size of the tanks holding their respective liquids which can mean they are bulky and space intensive compared to other gridscale storage systems however flow batteries are more economical suffer lower vulnerabilities and could hold potential to store large amounts of energy for long periods of time  one of the reasons why drax is funding a phd in the area liquid oxygen plant tanks and heat exchange coils the background a factory liquefied air what more abundant resource to use for energy storage than the air around us by cooling air down to 196 o c it is turned into a compressed liquid which can be stored when ambient air is exposed to this liquid it regasifies and expands in volume rapidly rotating a turbine in the process one of the main advantages of this form of storage is its potentially high capacity  an impressive 700 litres of ambient air can be reduced to just one litre of liquid air more than this there is potential for it to become even more efficient by using waste heat and cold from industrial process such as thermal generation plants steel milling or the creation of liquefied natural gas lng uk company highview power storage is currently trialling the technology at the piliswoth landfill gas generation facility where it will provide energy storage as well as convert lowgrade waste heat to power want to find out more keep an eye on the drax repower project which includes plans for up to 200 mw of storage  and imperial

carbon economy how we plug the gaps left by intermittent renewables is among the greatest challenges faced by the energy sector sources like wind and solar are intermittent  they cant generate electricity all the time when the sun doesnt shine or the wind doesnt blow they lack the fuel needed to generate power and cant feed into the grid this leaves a gap in the uks electricity supply that needs to be filled today thats done by sources like coal gas and biomass which can be dialled up and down to accommodate for the dips and peaks in generation created by changes in demand and the weather one alternative being touted as a possible solution is storage and in particular battery technology however creating batteries on a scale big enough to meet our incredible demand is a considerable challenge its a challenge that will be met in a future where giant affordable batteries are able to store solar power captured in the summer months for use in the winter but costs would have to come down at an even faster rate than they have done in recent years the challenge of building bigger batteries to demonstrate the size of this challenge consider the biomass storage domes at drax power station these effectively operate as giant energy stores with the flexible ability to quickly feed renewable fuel to the power station which generates electricity on demand our biomass domes can hold 300000 tonnes of sustainablysourced compressed wood pellets  the equivalent of 600 gwh worth of electricity currently batteries cost 350 per kwh meaning at present prices it would cost 210 billion to replace the capacity of all four of our biomass domes using battery power even if battery technology advances dramatically over the next few years that figure is only likely to fall to around 60 billion then there is the question of the ancillary services that thermal power stations provide the batteries of the future may be able to provide these vital services such as synthetic inertia shortterm reserve and reactive power but for now providing these via battery power is prohibitively expensive and in some cases best left to biomass and gas power stations we should not underestimate the challenges ahead the uks everchanging power system will need to balance more electricity generated via wind and solar with affordable solutions that are also reliable flexible and lower carbon than coal  this is why drax is developing four rapidresponse gas power stations in addition to continuing its investment in biomass generation and supply tags drax power station  energy
