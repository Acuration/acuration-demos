power station cost of turning off uk wind farms reached record high in 2021 the cost of turning off wind farms in the uk has reached record levels according to a new report 8 june 2022 investing in more long duration electricity storage such as expanding draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro plant in scotland would mean more excess renewable power could be stored and made available when required cutting costs and carbon emissions the cost of turning off uk wind farms to manage the electricity system rose from almost 300m during 2020 to over 500m in 2021 contributing to higher energy bills and carbon emissions according to a new report costs increased substantially because the system relied on expensive gas power to manage periods when wind power was curtailed as not enough electricity storage was available to prevent the excess renewable power from wind farms going to waste the independent report by lane clark  peacock lcp commissioned by renewable energy leader drax found that over the last two years curtailing wind power added 806m to energy bills in britain rising gas prices made the practice more expensive as gas power stations were increasingly used to support the system when wind power was curtailed click to viewdownload despite the growing need for more homegrown renewable power generation from wind farms to support energy security enough renewable power to supply 800000 uk homes went to waste in 2020 and 2021 as wind farms were routinely asked to switch off by the electricity system operator click to viewdownload this happened as a result of constraints in the transmission system and a lack of longduration storage capacity which is needed to manage periods when renewable power generation outstrips demand britain is a world leader in wind power with capacity increasing from 54gw in 2010 to 257gw in 2021  wind turbines now have the capacity to provide enough renewable power for almost 20 million homes but without any new longduration storage projects built for almost 40 years in the uk the only way to manage the imbalance when generation outstrips demand and prevent damage to the electricity grid is to curtail wind power  a practice which could be significantly reduced if more energy storage was available and with gas power stations overwhelmingly called upon to plug the gaps in supply when wind was constrained due to transmission issues there was an environmental cost an extra two million tonnes of co 2 was emitted during 2020 and 2021 as a result of gas being used to replace curtailed wind power equivalent to putting almost half a million more cars on britains roads chris matson from lcp said increasing the output from wind power is essential for the uk to achieve its climate targets and ensure energy security and yet because investment in the infrastructure needed to support this expansion has not kept pace wind curtailment is costing the consumer and the environment every pound spent on curtailing wind power is a pound wasted find out more about cruachan 2 here  drax has recently submitted an application to construct and operate a new underground pumped storage hydro power station at its existing cruachan facility in scotland the 600 mw plant will be located in one of the most constrained transmission areas and will play a crucial role in supporting more wind power to come online to reduce energy bills and carbon emissions penny small draxs group generation director said penny small drax group generation director this report underlines the need for a new regulatory framework to encourage private investment in longduration storage technologies the uk is a worldleader in offshore wind but for the countrys green energy ambitions to be realised we need the right energy storage infrastructure to support this vital technology make the system secure and reduce costs draxs plan to expand cruachan will strengthen uk energy security by enabling more homegrown renewable electricity to power british homes and businesses reducing system costs and cutting carbon emissions longduration storage projects have been left in limbo in recent years without an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the lack of a framework for these technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes a copy of the  renewable curtailment and the role of long duration storage report can be found here  the report defines consumer costs of curtailing wind as the cost of turning wind plant down bid costs the consumer benefit arising from the nonpayment of lowcarbon support payments to curtailed wind plant and the cost of paying generation to turnup offer costs to replace the lost wind generation of the 806m cost to consumers from wind curtailment in 2020 and 2021 82 663m was from curtailing wind in scotland  underlining the need for flexible technologies in scotland specifically in may drax applied for consent to build a new 600mw pumped storage hydro plant at its existing cruachan facility in argyll scotland the new power station could be operation in 2030 with construction work getting underway in 2024 it will be a major infrastructure project which will remove of around 2 million tonnes of rock from inside the mountain to create a cavern and tunnels with around 900 jobs created during its construction and across the supply chain longduration electricity storage can be defined as technologies that are able to respond to supply and demand variations caused by daily peaks weather events and seasonal patterns providing power for more than four hours at their full capacity the uk governments 2021 smart systems and flexibility plan recognised longduration storage as essential for achieving net zero the government held a call for evidence to hear the industrys views on derisking investment at the end of 2021 and aims to evaluate options and respond this year about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4mt of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 17 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate capacity of 46mt which will increase to c5mt once developments are complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 30 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses
