foreword executive summary  the industrial challenge of climate change chapters chapter 1 foreword executive summary  the industrial challenge of climate change chapter 2 carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen can decarbonise industry chapter 3 the uk is competing to be a global leader in industrial decarbonisation chapter 4 creating a zero carbon humber share capture for growth a roadmap for the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster protecting and creating jobs fighting climate change competing on the world stage 5 november 2019 chapter 1 foreword executive summary  the industrial challenge of climate change foreword the uk is a leader in the global effort to tackle climate change it has shown the rest of the world that protecting the environment and creating economic growth can go hand in hand the evidence is visible across the uk economy as businesses have stepped up to the challenge uk emissions have fallen by over 40 since 1990 while gdp has grown by two thirds clean growth is at the heart of this success story almost 100bn has been invested in renewables in the uk over the past decade creating and sustaining hundreds of thousands of jobs now the uk is the first major economy to establish in law that we will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 this creates a significant opportunity to put the uk at the leading edge of innovation to meet its climate change commitments the humber and the surrounding region is uniquely placed to lead this transition the region is home to britains biggest industrial economy employing 55000 people it has a rich heritage of industry skills and trade with the right support the humber can retake its place on the world stage as a major global centre of industry and innovation this can only happen if we act now other regions around the world are planning and investing in low carbon infrastructure by creating the conditions to become global leaders in clean industry they are seeking to win global investment and preserve and create new jobs if nothing changes the humber  and uk as a whole  will lose more major industries putting jobs skills and opportunities at risk today and for future generations in 2019 the zero carbon humber partnership was established by a group of leading energy businesses and organisations committed to transforming the region into the uks first net zero carbon industrial cluster by 2040 this report sets out a roadmap for achieving this through the use of carbon capture and storage technology and hydrogen these groundbreaking technologies would enable industry to grow in the humber while helping to meet the uks ambitious climate targets it would also enable us to produce low carbon hydrogen at the scale needed to decarbonise industry power heat transport and maritime across the north of england we can help britain maintain its status as a world leader in low carbon technologies and achieve clean growth  creating new jobs and rebalancing the economy in the process several businesses industry groups and representatives from civil society are already behind this vision to decarbonise the humber the case is clear  we need to act now the humber can become the first zero carbon industrial cluster in the world it can thrive again as a british industrial powerhouse zero carbon humber partnership will gardiner chief executive officer drax group irene rummelhoff executive vice president equinor jon butterworth chief operating officer national grid ventures lord haskins of selby chair humber local enterprise partnership david talbot chief executive officer catch executive summary this report considers how the uk can decarbonise its major industrial hubs and explains why the humber is the natural place for this to start it acknowledges the challenges many heavy industries face linked to climate change and highlights the technologies that will be needed to decarbonise it then examines how the zero carbon humber partnership will work with others to harness these technologies to decarbonise the uks largest industrial cluster and act as a catalyst for other regions across the north of england to thrive into the future click image to viewdownload the pdf report including references the roadmap to the humber becoming carbon neutral would include developing a hydrogen demonstrator and test facility in the humber installing carbon capture technology at drax power station to create the worlds first carbon negative power station building a carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage system across the region that industry can connect to safely storing co 2 deep under the seabed in the southern north sea unlocking a cuttingedge hydrogen economy  providing a low carbon fuel to decarbonise industry power heat transport and maritime across the north of england creating the conditions for new industries which use the ccus pipeline or low carbon hydrogen to develop in the region  creating new jobs and opportunities locally and across the country chapter one sets out the industrial challenge of climate change the uks heavy industries have been in decline for decades the journey to a net zero carbon economy represents both a challenge and an opportunity the humber contributes 18bn a year to gross value added gva it is home to the uks largest industrial cluster it is also the uks most carbon intensive region if businesses across the humber fail to decarbonise based on central hm treasury forecasts they could face carbon taxes of up to 29bn a year by 2040  putting their future at risk transitioning away from high carbon emissions to a more sustainable economy would allow the humber to make a significant contribution to the uk meeting its climate goals chapter two highlights the technologies that will decarbonise industry there is a broad consensus that ccus and hydrogen will play a key role in ensuring the uk meets its climate goals the committee on climate change ccc says that ccus is a necessity not an option for reaching net zero emissions bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere the ccc has advised government it will play a crucial role in offsetting emissions from hardtodecarbonise sectors in the future hydrogen will have a crucial role to play in decarbonising industry power heat and transport carbon capture technology would allow hydrogen to be produced at scale from natural gas with a low carbon footprint chapter three outlines the global race to help industries decarbonise while the uk has been ranked in the top five countries for readiness to deploy ccus other countries are moving ahead with ambitious decarbonisation projects and are investing in clean infrastructure norways northern lights project is aiming to develop the worlds first storage facility that can receive co2 from other countries the porthos initiative in the port of rotterdam would see the establishment of a ccus industrial hub with co2 stored in depleted gas fields offshore the netherlands is also developing the worlds first facility to generate 100 carbon free power using hydrogen as fuel north america dominates the ccus market and has the biggest number of largescale ccus facilities in the world  the majority of which are used to support enhanced oil recovery chapter four outlines the zero carbon humber project and the benefits it will deliver which include delivering the uks first low carbon cluster and the worlds first net zero carbon industrial cluster by 2040 accelerating progress to tackle climate change by capturing up to 53mtco 2 a year  thats almost a third of the carbon savings which ccs needs to deliver for the uk to reach net zero by 2050 helping protect 55000 jobs saving industrial businesses across the humber 275bn in carbon taxes by 2040 and helping the region compete for investment and export opportunities around the world extending lives by improving air quality saving 148mn in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 by reducing industrial emissions across the humber acting as a catalyst to accelerate the decarbonisation of other parts of the north of england chapter 1 the industrial challenge of climate change the uk has set an ambitious target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100 by 2050 in doing so it has led the world to take action to combat catastrophic climate change the challenge of meeting this target has been acknowledged by government and businesses but the opportunities have not been fully explored the collective response to climate change cannot be one that makes us poorer and more divided achieving net zero should not be seen as a challenge to the way our country runs but as an opportunity to build a more prosperous country supported by strong industries that sustain highly skilled and wellpaid jobs for the uks industrial heartlands the journey to net zero represents both an opportunity and a threat regions that have a longterm strategy to decarbonise stand to benefit from new jobs and investment those who do not risk missing out on the benefits of clean growth and seeing businesses offshore to low carbon hubs overseas this report focuses on the opportunity it considers the technologies that can unlock a cleaner future for our major industries and outlines an ambitious plan in the humber which will transform the fortunes of the region set the foundations for other industrial clusters to build on and make a major contribution to the uks 2050 net zero target this ambition already enjoys broad political support nearly 70 of the british public are overwhelmingly in support of urgent political action to tackle climate change uk businesses also recognise that their success depends on how quickly they can transition to green technologies but other countries are also transitioning away from high carbon emissions and building more sustainable economies the uk cannot be complacent and risk falling behind as other countries benefit from the technologies of the future we have an opportunity to act there is consensus from the public politicians and business that the status quo is unsustainable and that a failure to reduce our carbon emissions will have catastrophic effects for future generations on 12 june 2019 the uk government laid the draft climate change act 2008 2050 target amendment order 2019 to amend the climate change act 2008 by introducing a target for at least a 100 reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels in the uk by 2050 this is otherwise known as net zero this ambition already enjoys broad political support nearly 70 of the british public are overwhelmingly in support of urgent political action to tackle climate change uk businesses also recognise that their success depends on how quickly they can transition to green technologies but other countries are also transitioning away from high carbon emissions and building more sustainable economies the uk cannot be complacent and risk falling behind as other countries benefit from the technologies of the future we have an opportunity to act there is consensus from the public politicians and business that the status quo is unsustainable and that a failure to reduce our carbon emissions will have catastrophic effects for future generations we need to refocus the lens through which we see net zero rather than treating it as a trial we need to see it as an opportunity we should seize the chance to carve out a niche for britain and exploit our existing advantages to become a world leader in cuttingedge environmental technology sir john armitt chair of the national infrastructure commission july 2019 11 uk industry is in decline the uks manufacturing industry is still the ninth largest in the world despite the decline since the 1970s when the sector contributed 25 of gdp today it employs 27 million people produces 10 of national economic output and delivers 45 of uk exports totalling 273bn manufacturing remains central to the success of the uk economy for every 1mn that the manufacturing sector contributes to uk gdp itself a further 15mn is supported across the wider economy through indirect and induced macroeconomic effects however uk manufacturing faces several challenges not least increasing international competition since 2000 manufacturing has fallen faster as a proportion of the total uk economy than it has in any other developed economy the uk has one of the smallest foundation industry sectors relative to gdp in the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd since 2000 its share of gdp has shrunk by 43 compared to an average decline across the oecd of 21 institute for public policy research strong foundation industries 2016 energy intensive industries in particular have faced many pressures since the 2008 financial crisis in steel production the fragility of the industry has been brought into focus by the situation facing british steel in scunthorpe which is increasingly facing stiff international competition ambitious climate targets also mean that without any investment in decarbonisation technology regions that are reliant on heavy industry risk being hit the hardest this is not a time to be too cautious as uk steelmakers face an uncertain business environment the government needs to move swiftly to secure a bright future for the sector while addressing the elements which undermine our competitiveness gareth stace uk steel director general 2019 this decline of heavy industry matters without a diverse range of sectors in the economy the uk is at risk of overexposure to downturns in certain industries the level of exports  measured in volume or value terms  is an indicator of a countrys ability to remain globally competitive in the period between may 2018 and may 2019 exports of goods produced by the manufacturing sector in the uk totalled 273bn accounting for 44 of total uk exports it is clear that industry remains of critical importance to uk exports the uks global competitiveness and standing as one of the worlds largest economies is ultimately at risk if the decline continues a continued decline in uk industry will have significant implications for highly skilled well paid and secure employment directly through manufacturing companies and indirectly through their supply chains many jobs in heavy industry command higher than average salaries and more secure terms and conditions which are increasingly rare as the proportion of those in selfemployment andor insecure work increases trade unions stand ready to do our part workers who are at the forefront of dealing with the challenges of climate change must have a central voice in plans a quick and successful transition will need agreements with unions to retrain people with jobs at risk for new work in low carbon industry with good pay and conditions frances o grady general secretary tuc any decline in manufacturing also risks deepening inequality between the north and south of england the concentration of manufacturing industries in the north opposed to service sector industries in the south means that the north is at the mercy of lower levels of growth in manufacturing for example while the manufacturing industries were only expected to grow by 1 between 2017 and 2020 the communications and professional services sector was expected to grow by over 3 a lack of investment in manufacturing in the north and a decline in the sector would exacerbate regional inequality 12 the humber  the uks largest industrial region energy intensive industries make a significant contribution to the uk economy together these industries and their supply chains are worth 52bn support 600000 jobs and account for 4 of the uks gva they produce products that are essential to the uks low carbon economy from steel and lightweight composites for wind turbines and electric cars to glass ceramics and advanced insulating materials for lowenergy housing the humber has a rich industrial heritage hosting the steel industry oil refineries cement manufacturers petrochemical producers and chemical manufacturers it contributes 18bn each year to uk gva  a quarter of which is related to manufacturing  and heavy industry provides the mainstay of employment in the region with 55000 working in the manufacturing sector alone but uk industry also accounts for around 25 of all greenhouse gas emissions in the uk two thirds of these emissions come from energy intensive industries which are often located next to each other in clusters in the humber the high concentration of heavy industry means that 6 of englands industrial and commercial energy use is by businesses in the region the humbers industrial cluster currently emits more co2 than any other uk cluster 30 more than south wales the next largestxviii and is the most energy intensive region in the uk 13 the cost of failing to decarbonise carbon pricing is designed to encourage businesses to reduce carbon emissions and fund decarbonisation programmes by taxing fossil fuels it is regarded as one of most effective ways for countries to reduce their emissions and has been instrumental in phasing britains coal fired power stations off the system the uk government expects carbon pricing to increase significantly over the coming decades based on current forecasts industrial businesses across the humber could face a carbon tax bill of between 14bn and 43bn in 2040 if they fail to decarbonise this would inevitably place greater pressure on businesses in the humber  putting jobs and supply chains at risk and eroding the regions ability to attract new businesses and increasing the risk of carbon leakage where carbon emissions are simply moved offshore rather than reduced as a result there is increasing urgency for action from both industry and government to safeguard these clusters with the right regulatory framework energy intensive industries could start to harness new technologies to ensure they have a sustainable and prosperous future help fight climate change and enable them to compete on the world stage carbon capture usage and storage and hydrogen are two technologies that will play a crucial role in this transition chapter 2 carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen can decarbonise industry 21 ccus is a critical part of protecting the future for uk industry the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has highlighted that achieving the ambitions of the paris agreement to limit future temperature increases to 15 degrees will require more than just increased efforts to reduce emissions it will also require the deployment of technologies to actually remove carbon from the atmosphere ccus is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions created by energy and industry which are then either permanently stored or used in industry it prevents co2 from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming possible storage sites include saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs putting carbon emissions back in the ground deploying ccus is essential for decarbonising existing energy and industrial processes new industries are also expected to emerge which will be able to use the captured carbon creating other options to keep it out of the atmosphere no single technology alone can manage the adverse effects of climate change yet there is broad international consensus that ccus technologies will play a critical role in meeting the uks  and the worlds  energy and climate goals the vital role of ccus was reaffirmed by the committee on climate change ccc net zero the uks contribution to stopping global warming report ccs is a necessity not an option for reaching net zero ghg greenhouse gas emissions by helping to decarbonise industry generate low carbon power and enable the production of hydrogen at scale ccus offers significant new opportunities for the uk  on a national and international scale it will also help the uk become a global leader in tackling climate change ccus can also deliver considerable socio economic benefits by helping to create new jobs improve quality of life reduce energy costs for families and businesses and support the economic viability of the uks most heavily industrial clusters for these reasons the momentum behind ccus in the uk is building in 2018 the government committed to having the first ccus facility up and running by the mid2020s the ccc and business energy and industrial strategy select committee a crossparty grouping of mps have argued we should be developing ccus in multiple industrial clusters across the country 22 bioenergy with ccus creates the opportunity to remove carbon from the atmosphere there are different types of carbon capture technologies bioenergy with carbon capture usage and storage beccs is recognised as one of the most important because it doesnt simply prevent carbon emissions being produced  it also removes carbon from the atmosphere the cccs net zero report identified beccs as one of the required key nearterm actions that are on a critical path towards the uk achieving net zero emissions by 2050 the governments clean growth strategy references beccs as one of several greenhouse gas removal technologies that could remove emissions from the atmosphere and help achieve long term decarbonisation a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society has estimated that beccs could enable the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of co 2 per year by 2050  removing almost half of the emissions predicted to remain in the economy 23 hydrogen can help decarbonise power industry homes businesses and transport while the power sector has enjoyed significant growth in renewables in recent years decarbonising industry transport and agriculture remains a challenge hydrogen will be part of the solution it can be burned to deliver heat in industrial processes to heat buildings and to fuel heavy transport it can also be used in power and can be stored like natural gas the ccc states that to reach net zero emissions by 2050 the uk will need new hydrogen production capacity that is comparable to the uks current fleet of gasfired power stations however creating hydrogen from natural gas generates carbon emissions that is why large scale production of hydrogen will need to be combined with ccus technology in the future when available surplus renewable energy should also be harnessed to create green hydrogen via electrolysis of water which can share the same infrastructure as hydrogen from natural gas ccus has the potential to kick start new hydrogen technology and help create new industries jobs and the opportunity to decarbonise industry power heat transport and maritime across the north of england other countries are also looking at this technology in the international energy agency iea report the future of hydrogen seizing todays opportunities  launched at the g20 meeting in june 2019 energy and environment ministers offered several recommendations to help governments companies and other stakeholders to scale up hydrogen projects around the world its recommendations included four specific areas where immediate action could help lay the foundations for the growth of a global clean hydrogen industry make industrial ports the nerve centres for scaling up the use of clean hydrogen build on existing infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines expand the use of hydrogen in transport by using it to power cars trucks and buses that run on key routes launch the hydrogen trades first international shipping routes hydrogen is today enjoying unprecedented momentum driven by governments that both import and export energy as well as the renewables industry electricity and gas utilities automakers oil and gas companies major technology firms and big cities the world should not miss this unique chance to make hydrogen an important part of our clean and secure energy future dr faith birol executive director at the iea chapter 3 the uk is competing to be a global leader in industrial decarbonisation governments around the world are investing in clean infrastructure to attract businesses and allow them to operate without damaging the environment or peoples health  saving money and making their operations sustainable over the longterm this includes efforts to prepare to deploy ccus carbon capture usage and storage and hydrogen infrastructure in a global assessment of countries which are leaders in the creation of an enabling environment for the commercial deployment of ccs the global ccs institute rated the uk as one of the five top scoring nations for readiness alongside australia canada norway and the united states this is attributed to the supportive policy frameworks comprehensive regulatory and legal frameworks and detailed storage assessments although the assessment is encouraging for the uks goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 the report found that no nation  including the top five  has established the necessary conditions to drive ccus deployment at the rate required to meet current climate ambitions the global competition for capitalising on investment for emissions reductions jobs and the trickledown economic benefits for regions and nations should not and must not be taken as a given for the uk while the foundations are strong for the uk to utilise its strategic comparative advantage in industry other countries such as norway the netherlands and the united states are also investing significant amounts in developing ccus technology the next phase of ccus calls for a strong commitment and action between government industry and business other countries are preparing to deploy ccus at scale and the uk must not be left behind 31 norway looking to the northern lights in norway the northern lights a ccus project initiated by equinor with partners shell and total aims to develop the worlds first storage facility capable of receiving co 2 from various industrial sources the project consists of a co 2 receiving terminal an offshore pipeline injection and co 2 storage the first phase of this co 2 project could reach a capacity of approximately 15 mtco 2 per year the project will be designed to accommodate additional co 2 volumes aiming to stimulate new commercial carbon capture projects in norway europe and across the world in this way the project has the potential to be the first storage project site in the world receiving co 2 from industrial sources in several countries an investment decision for the norwegian full scale carbon capture and storage project is expected in 20202021 the idea is to capture co2 from significant emission sources on land transport it by ship to a terminal northwest of bergen transport it by pipeline out to the north sea and then inject it 3000 metres beneath the seabed where it will be stored this is a solution for many industries wanting to reduce emissions but who have no way of storing their co2  this will truly be fullscale ccs sverre overå project director northern lights equinor rotterdam netherlands city and harbour 32 the netherlands ccus  hydrogen port of rotterdam ccus backbone initiative porthos the netherlands has set clear climate targets by 2030 it plans to have reduced its greenhouse emissions by 49 compared to 1990 levels and 95 by 2050 the focus for industrial decarbonisation centres on plans for ccus from the port of rotterdam a consortium comprising of the port of rotterdam authority nederlandse gasunie gasunie and energie beheer nederland ebn is developing the business case for the deployment of ccus infrastructure for the establishment of an industrial ccus hub connecting industry via the port to offshore depleted gas fields in the north sea a feasibility study on the largescale deployment of ccus in the port of rotterdam found that co 2 capture transport and storage under the north sea is technically feasible and a costeffective measure for radically reducing carbon emissions the concept is based on a collective pipeline of approximately 33km that runs through rotterdams port area the pipeline will serve as a basic infrastructure for various industrial parties to connect to in order to dispose of co 2 captured at their facilities the business partnership is working towards investment decisions in 2020 the ambition is to store 2 million tonnes of co 2 per year from 2020 to a capacity that will run up to 5 million tonnes per year by 2030 hydrogen conversion at nuon magnum power plant eemshaven a hydrogen conversion project led by a consortium between nuon gasunie and equinor is currently underway at nuon magnum power plant to convert one of its units to run on hydrogen by 2023 if successful the plant would be the worlds first power station to use 100 hydrogen as a fuel equinor is responsible for hydrogen production by converting the norwegian natural gas into hydrogen and co 2  while gasunie is engaged in research for the transportation and storage of hydrogen at the power station the co 2 released during the hydrogen production process is planned to be stored in underground facilities off the norwegian coast nuons longterm vision is to locally produce hydrogen through the electrolysis process by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen the electricity required for the electrolysis will be sourced from renewable sources 33 the united states 1 carbon capture secures bipartisan backing according to the global ccs institute the united states has and continues to dominate the ccus market at the global level crossparty support secured federal legislation the future act 2018 that paved the way for tax credits for capture and storage of emissionsxliv at state level california texas north dakota and montana are all taking steps to secure a policy and regulatory environment that is conducive to securing investment the policy landscape goes some way to understanding how and why the united states hosts the highest number of largescale ccus facilities in the world of the 18 facilities operating worldwide 10 are in the united states where the cumulative carbon capture and storage for operational facilities equates to 150 million tonnes it is fair to say that the us continues to dominate the ccs space and over the past year deployment and policy have picked up pace together us facilities can capture about 25 million tonnes per annum  the equivalent of taking almost 54 million cars off the road for one year the global status of ccs report global ccs institute 2018 34 the united states 2 ccus driving tech innovation in texas net power a us energy company is behind a project to produce lowcost electricity from natural gas with zero emissions released into the atmosphere the company partlyowned by exelon generation has built a 150mn commercial scale 50 mwth power plant and test facility in texas the plant uses an innovative technology called the allam cycle to burn fossil fuels with oxygen instead of air to generate electricity without emitting any co 2  this process allows much of the co 2 released during combustion to be reused if successful the co 2 produced will create a pipeline ready product which will be permanently sequestered or can be sold for use in other industrial purposes net powers aim is the global deployment of 300 mw eclass commercialscale plants beginning as early as 2021 chapter 4 creating a zero carbon humber our plan will help the uk achieve net zero by providing almost a third of the carbon savings that ccus needs to deliver by 2050 help protect 55000 jobs by saving industrial businesses across the humber 275bn in carbon taxes by 2040 extend lives by improving air quality across the region saving 148m in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 make the humber region a world leader by attracting new investment industries and jobs support the decarbonisation of west yorkshire teesside and the wider north of england our mission established in summer 2019 the zero carbon humber partnership shares the same objective to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster by 2040  to achieve this we will work together to deliver a number of pioneering decarbonisation projects that will protect jobs help the region compete for investment in clean technologies and accelerate progress towards the uks 2050 climate targets it will also improve air quality and the local environment this plan has the backing of some of the worlds biggest industrial businesses and would safeguard the regions role at the heart of the uk economy for decades to come demonstrating climate action and growing the economy go hand in hand in building momentum behind global action on carbon the uk is a leader in both cutting our emissions by more than 40 while growing our economy by two thirds but to sustain this track record we need to tackle emissions from energy intensive sectors and bring clean growth to our great industrial centres claire perry cop26 president and former energy and clean growth minister 2018 42 our plan the partnership is based around three strategic pillars which together will deliver the uks first net zero carbon industrial cluster unlocking a cuttingedge hydrogen building a hydrogen demonstrator and test facility in the humber by the mid2020s would create the foundation for unlocking a new hydrogen economy in the region over time this facility could be scaled up to produce a low carbon fuel that could be used to decarbonise industry power heat transport and maritime across the north of england creating negative emissions at scale installing carbon capture technology on drax power stations biomass units could turn it into the worlds first carbon negative power station by 2027 generating clean electricity and negative emissions at the same time over time drax power stations negative emissions could help to offset the emissions of other industries in the region who fail to decarbonise establishing a regional carbon dioxide transport and storage network with the right infrastructure in place businesses across the region could safely transport and store their emissions under the southern north sea instead of releasing them into the atmosphere this would help the battle against climate change and establish the humber industrial cluster as a world leader creating new jobs and investment opportunities in the region 43 the humber as a catalyst for wider decarbonisation power stations and industrial processes in the humber region the humber is the natural place to deploy ccus and hydrogen technology it is one of the most important industrial economies in the country it is also the most carbon intensive which means that decarbonising the region will make a significant contribution to meeting the governments climate targets the location of the humber means it can also unlock other decarbonisation projects planned in the north of england off the coast of the humber is a number of large geological storage sites  either saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields  in the southern north sea that could be used to safely store co 2 under the ground for hundreds of years for example from 2011 to 2015 tens of millions of pounds of public and private money was spent exploring how carbon dioxide could be stored in a saline aquifer known as endurance these storage sites could be used not only to store co 2 from the humber but also support other industrial clusters such as teesside which is also developing its own ccus plans having multiple clusters share the same offshore co 2 infrastructure would help accelerate construction produce economies of scale and bring down costs for all users meanwhile to the west of the humber is a number of city regions such as york leeds and bradford represented by the west yorkshire combined authority a significant amount of work has already been undertaken by northern gas networks through the h21 north of england project to explore how 37 million uk homes and businesses could switch from natural gas to low carbon hydrogen developing hydrogen production capability in the humber would not only enable the decarbonisation of power heat industry and transport in the humber itself  it could also supply the hydrogen required to make the h21 project a reality case study making saltend chemicals park ccusready industrial businesses across the humber are already thinking about ccus and hydrogen saltend chemicals park is home to a cluster of worldclass chemicals and energy businesses including air products bp ineos and nippon gohsei the site was acquired in 2018 by px group which have since invested several millions to develop and extend the park the businesses operating on the 370acre site share infrastructure and a range of services including feedstocks and utilities as a result the park is an optimal location for the deployment of carbon capture usage and storage technology we have already had significant interest from prospective tenants in our plans to become ccus ready if industry and government could work together to bring ccus technology to saltend chemicals park it would reinforce its status as an international destination for manufacturing and chemical industries and bring new businesses into the humber jay brooks site director of industrial parks at px group case study decarbonising jet fuel production velocys is a sustainable fuels technology company and project developer supported by british airways and shell the company has submitted a planning application for europes first wastetojet fuel plant in immingham the proposed plant will take hundreds of thousands of tonnes of household and commercial solid black bag waste and turn it into cleaner burning sustainable aviation fuel reducing net greenhouse gases by 70 compared to the fossil fuel equivalent following a recently announced agreement with us oil company oxy their us wastetofuels facility will capture co 2 emitted from the process and securely store it underground meaning it will produce negative emission fuels we dont just want to deal with waste materials and produce cleaner burning fuels  we want the process that produces the clean fuels to be as sustainable as possible as well our carbon negative solution could be replicated at our proposed uk facility in immingham subject to uk government support for ccus deployment and the availability of transportation and storage infrastructure in the humber region henrik wareborn chief executive of velocys 44 the benefits of a zero carbon humber cutting carbon emissions the roadmap outlined by the zero carbon humber partnership will make a major contribution to cutting carbon emissions in the uks largest industrial cluster new research commissioned by the zero carbon humber partnership has for the first time identified the scale of the emissions reductions that it will deliver the analysis by element energy is based on the development of new hydrogen production facilities in the humber starting with a hydrogen demonstrator in the 2020s and scaling up in subsequent years the installation of ccus technology on all four of drax power stations biomass units turning it into the worlds first carbon negative power station the creation of largescale co 2 transport and storage infrastructure in the humber used by industrial businesses in the region the widespread use of hydrogen in the region in a number of different sectors including power heating industry and transport the projections show that by 2040 the project has the potential to capture up to 44 mtco 2 per year to put that into context thats around 15 of the uks current annual co 2 emissions its also 30 of the total co 2 that the committee on climate change says needs to be removed by ccus by 2050 if the uk is meet the net zero target how the emissions stack up the analysis assumes that between 2027 and 2035 each of draxs biomass units will be fitted with ccus technology those four units will provide 24gws of clean electricity capacity on the system as well as generating up to 16 million tonnes of negative emissions ever year it also considers that the availability of infrastructure to transport co 2 offshore will encourage the decarbonisation of other power stations in the region with at least one gasfired plant fitted with ccus technology in element energys analysis at least 10 industries switch to hydrogen as their main fuel supply but certain industrial sites due to their large emissions outputs and difficulty to decarbonise will require direct capturing of emissions by connecting to the co 2 transport and storage infrastructure over 9 mtco 2 from at least four industrial sectors will be captured and stored in 2040 based on scenarios as follows decarbonising the cement and lime industry in the yorkshire and humber region with a total of 65 mtco 2 per year being captured in 2040 ccus will enable humber area refineries to abate 36 mtco 2 per year annually by iron and steel sectors from the humber area are decarbonised using ccus with 2 mtco 2 per year being captured in 2040 chemicals are manufactured by various highheat processes including the cracking of hydrocarbons and usually require burning fossil fuels due to the difficulty of separating carbon emissions from other gases in the exhaust ccus is considered a feasible decarbonisation approach the humber industrial sites will be able to capture 13 mtco 2 per year in 2040 representing 245 of the total 44 mtco 2 per year captured from the whole area in 2040 cost savings carbon taxation has played a key role in the decline of fossil fuel power generation and the rise of renewables but the polluter pays principle has also proved challenging for many industries which suffer from low margins and volatile energy prices industry accounts for around a quarter of all uk greenhouse gas emissions with more than two thirds of these emissions coming from a small number of energy intensive industries ccus technology provides a route to curtailing carbon emissions and avoiding the cost of carbon pricing there will be billions of pounds worth of savings for the firms who utilise the transport and storage infrastructure  savings which will have major implications for their competitiveness in the decades to come based on hm treasurys central forecast for future carbon pricing we can estimate the additional cost that businesses in the region would be facing without the zero carbon humber roadmap by 2040 firms in the region could have saved 29bn per annum by capturing and storing rather than releasing their a total of 275bn since the infrastructure for transporting and storing co 2 came into effect that annual figure could reach 42bn per year by 2050 those cost savings are just a part of the wider economic benefits that the project will bring to the region this includes as many as 55000 manufacturing jobs secured across sectors from cement steel refineries and chemicals it will also put the region on the global stage and open up opportunities for inward investment and for exports of green technology air quality the new hydrogen production facility will be a catalyst for the growth of a new hydrogen economy a pipeline will transport the carbon emissions from the facility along with those from draxs biomass units to be stored safely offshore hydrogen is expected to play an important role in decarbonising heat and fuelling flexible power generation it could also make a significant contribution to improving air quality by shifting consumers from transport using higher emission fuels to hydrogen and other ultralow emission alternatives the uptake of hydrogen mobility with over one million hydrogen vehicles deployed by 2050 could lead to a reduction in hazardous emissions including nitrogen oxides nox and particulate matter pm which are linked to several longterm medical conditions and premature deaths their impacts are often quantified in terms of social damage costs the analysis by element energy found that in total 148mn in public health costs could be saved between 2040 and 2050 reducing the burden on public health services it also estimates that by 2050 2 mtco 2 emissions would be avoided by the uptake of hydrogen transport in the region 2100 tonnes of nox and 11 tonnes of pm estimated as 34 and 3 respectively of the regions 2050 road transport emissions could also be avoided estimates based on combined avoided carbon taxation payments for industrial and power sectors in the humber using central carbon pricing forecast in hm treasurys green book figures do not include payments to co 2 transport and storage operator conclusion the governments 2050 net zero target may seem a long way in the future but if we are to achieve our climate goals the time to act is now decarbonisation doesnt have to be a choice between saving our industries and saving the planet with this plan we can do both with the right engagement and support from government we can ensure that the uks most important industrial region continues to thrive we can safeguard 55000 manufacturing jobs we can create a new hydrogenbased economy that will clean up the vehicles that we drive and the air that we breath we can become a world leader in the use of sustainable bioenergy to create negative emissions the humber is uniquely placed to seize this opportunity to become the first zero carbon economy in the world it can be a catalyst for other industrial regions too and it will help the uk take the lead in
