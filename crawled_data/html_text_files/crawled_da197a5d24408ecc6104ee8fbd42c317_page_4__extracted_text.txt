tackle the climate crisis global unity and collaboration are needed this was in part the thinking behind the paris agreement it set a clear collective target negotiated at the 2015 united nations climate change conference and signed the following year to keep the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in november 2021 cop26 will see many of the countries who first signed the paris agreement come together in glasgow for the first global stocktake of their environmental progress since its creation cop26 will take place at the sec in glasgow already delayed for a year as a result of the pandemic covid19 and its effects on emissions is likely to be a key talking point so too will progress towards not just the paris agreement goals but those of individual countries known as national determined contributions ndcs these sit under the umbrella of the paris agreement goals and set out individual targets for individual countries with many countries still reeling from the effects of covid19 the question is which countries are actually on track to meet them what are the goals the ndcs of each country represent its efforts and goals to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change these incorporate various targets from decarbonisation and forestry to coastal preservation and financial aims while all countries need to reduce emissions to meet the paris agreement targets not all have an equally sized task the principle of differentiated responsibility acknowledges that countries have varying levels of emissions capabilities and economic conditions the universal ecological fund outlined the emissions breakdown of the top four emitters showing that combined they account for 56 of global greenhouse gas emissions china is the largest emitter responsible for 268 followed by the us which contributes 131 the european union and its 28 member states account for nine per cent while india is responsible for seven per cent of all emissions these nations have ambitious emissions goals but are they on track to meet them china traffic jams in the rush hour in shanghai downtown contribute to high emissions in china by 2030 china pledged to reach peak carbon dioxide co 2   increase its nonfossil fuel share of energy supply to 20 and reduce the carbon intensity  the ratio between emissions of co 2 to the output of the economy  by 60 to 65 below 2005 levels covid19 has increased the uncertainty of the course of chinas emissions some projections show that emissions are likely to grow in the short term before peaking and levelling out sometime between 2021 and 2025 however according to the climate action tracker it is also possible that chinas emissions have already peaked  specifically in 2019 china is expected to meet its nonfossil energy supply and carbon intensity pledges united states the forecast for the second largest emitter the us has also been affected by the pandemic economic firm rhodium group has predicted that the us could see its emissions drop between 20 and 27 by 2025 meeting its target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 below 2005 levels however president trumps rolling back of obamaera climate policies and regulations his support of fossil fuels and withdrawal from the paris agreement effective from as early as 4 november 2020 suggest any achievement may not be longlasting the united states coronavirus aid relief and economic security act known as the cares act does not include any direct support to clean energy development  something that could also change in 2021 european union carl clayton head of beccs at drax inspects pipework in the ccus area of drax power station the european union and its member states then including the uk pledged to reduce emissions by at least 40 below 1990 levels by 2030  a target the climate action tracker estimates will be achieved in fact the eu is on track to cut emissions by 58 by 2030 this progress is in part a result of a large package of measures adopted in 2018 these accelerated the emissions reductions including national coal phaseout plans increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency the package also introduced legally binding annual emission limits for each member state within which they can set individual targets to meet the common goal the uk has not yet released an updated independent ndc however it has announced a 350 million package designed to cut emissions in heavy industry and drive economic recovery from covid19 this includes 139 million

technologies today our organisations have launched a new coalition with a shared vision to build back better as part of a sustainable and resilient recovery from covid19 by developing pioneering projects that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  and other pollutants from the atmosphere together we represent hundreds of thousands of workers across some of the uks most critical industries including aviation energy and farming each of which contribute billions of pounds each year to the economy a growing number of independent experts including the committee on climate change royal society and royal academy of engineering and the electricity system operator have recognised the crucial role of negative emissions or greenhouse gas removal technologies in fighting the climate crisis whilst we should seek to decarbonise sectors such as aviation heavy industry and agriculture as far as practically possible due to technical or commercial barriers it is unlikely we will eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions completely negative emissions technologies are critical therefore to balancing out these residual emissions and ensuring we achieve net zero in a credible cost effective and sustainable way as well as benefiting the environment negative emissions technologies and projects can build back a cleaner greener economy in the wake of covid19 the foundations for this are already being laid by our coalitions members today for example the national farmers union has set out a net zero vision for the agricultural sector whereby uk farmers harness the ability to capture carbon to create new income streams the aviation industry through the sustainable aviation initiative has identified negative emissions projects alongside other measures as sustainable jet fuel as being crucial to greening the industry in north yorkshire drax is developing plans to combine sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology beccs to create the worlds first carbon negative power station  supporting thousands of jobs in the process in north east lincolnshire velocys with the support of british airways is developing the altalto wastetojet fuel project that could produce negativeemission jet fuel once the humber industrial clusters carbon capture and storage infrastructure is established finally carbon engineering has announced a partnership with pale blue dot energy to deploy commercialscale direct air capture projects in the uk that would remove significant volumes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with cop26 fast approaching there is a real and compelling opportunity for the uk government to demonstrate to the world it is taking a leadership position on negative emissions conversely if the uk does not act quickly it could jeopardise the delivery of projects in the 2020s that can support innovation learning by doing and the scaleup of negative emissions in the 2030s it also risks britain falling behind in the race to scale and commercialise these technologies with a view to exporting them to other countries around the world to support their own decarbonisation efforts we therefore call on this government supported by your departments to pursue the following low regrets interventions to support this critical emerging industry adopt a clear unambiguous commitment to supporting negative emissions in the 2020s and beyond the last significant reference to negative emissions by government was in the 2017 clean growth strategy between now and the end of the year there is a window of opportunity for the government to go further reflecting the changed reality of a net zero world and the growing consensus on the need for negative emissions a clear signal of intent would also give greater confidence to investors and developers in negative emissions projects in the absence of a longterm strategy develop targeted policies to support viable negative emissions projects in the 2020s  in order to scale up in the 2030s at a pace compatible with the uks climate commitments it is essential that government works with industry to bring forward early projects in the 2020s that are viable and represent value for money however there is no marketplace or regulatory regime in the uk today that incentivises or rewards negative emissions making financing projects extremely challenging dedicated policy frameworks and business models for solutions such as afforestation beccs and direct air capture are therefore urgently needed seize the opportunity to make negative emissions a point of emphasis at cop26  the uk has already led the way at a global level by adopting net zero as a legally binding target at cop26 the uk can showcase its further commitment to continuous innovation around the decarbonisation agenda by signposting the early actions it has taken to deploy negative emissions  which other countries will also need to meet their own zero carbon ambitions this statement would be particularly powerful as it can be credibly supported by several pioneering projects already being undertaken by british businesses and research organisations in this space we would welcome the opportunity to meet with each of you to

 investors  negative emissions what is carbon dioxide 18 september 2020 carbon capture what is co 2  carbon dioxide or co 2  is a colourless and odourless naturally occurring gas in the earths atmosphere which is made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms  as a greenhouse gas ghg it traps heat making sure the planet isnt uninhabitably cold however fast rising levels of co 2 and other longlasting ghgs in the atmosphere are currently causing global warming to occur at an alarmingly rapid rate what is the carbon cycle carbon is the basis of all life on earth  it is a key ingredient in almost everything on the planet as the earth has a closed atmosphere there has always been the same amount of carbon on the earth but it is in a constant state of change transitioning from gas to solid to liquid and moving between the atmosphere and the earth this process is called the carbon cycle  and it is key to ensuring the earth is capable of sustaining life co 2 forms one part of this process and makes up the largest available source of carbon on earth how is co 2 made carbon is stored in oceans soil and living things and is released from this storage into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together through a number of processes including the decay of organic matter the combustion of materials such as wood coal and natural gas through the breathing of humans and animals and from events such as volcanic eruptions how does co 2 affect the planet an abundance of co 2 in the earths atmosphere means more heat gets trapped which in turn contributes to a rise in global temperatures and climate change  this acceleration in carbon entering the atmosphere began during the industrial revolution around the 1800s when fossil fuels were mined and burned to create energy which released longstored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  from the beginning of the industrial revolution until today the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per million to 387 parts per million which constitutes a 39 increase  today co 2 levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together when organic materials containing carbon are burned wood coal and natural gas how can countries reduce co 2 in the atmosphere according to the paris climate agreement  nations must work to limit warming of the globe to be well under two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in the first half of 2015 the earth registered a one degree celsius rise in global temperatures above preindustrial levels which means drastic and meaningful action must be taken to decarbonise within the next few years there are many ways to reduce the earths carbon footprint including reforestation and using alternative ways to generate energy that dont rely on fossil fuels for example wind  solar  biomass and hydro can all provide sustainable carbonneutral and low carbon sources of electricity technology such as carbon capture and storage ccs can capture carbon permanently storing co 2 from industries in which some co 2 emissions remain by combining ccus with biomass energy bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs it is even possible to generate negative emissions where more co 2 is removed from the atmosphere than is emitted  co 2 fast facts in the 1960s the growth of co 2 occurred at 06 parts per million per year in the last 10 years the rate has been 23 parts per million per year the average human breathes out 93 kilograms of co 2 per year  however our breathing only contributes 065 billion tonnes of carbon returned to the atmosphere which is 001 of the amount released by fossil fuels each year trees absorb co 2 in the atmosphere and release it in the form of oxygen making them vitally important in the worlds fight against climate change in the us alone forests absorb 13 of the nations carbon output there are many ways to reduce the earths carbon footprint including using alternative ways to generate power go deeper where drax and biomass fit into the carbon cycle renewable energy sources are only a part of the solution to cutting co 2 emissions draxs strategy to reducing co2 emissions captured co 2 could create a whole new market for products measuring co 2 and

opinion reduced demand boosted renewables and the neartotal abandonment of coal pushed last quarters carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes emissions are at their lowest in modern times having fallen by threequarters compared to the same period ten years ago the average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kwh of electricity consumed over the quarter the carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just 18 gkwh in the middle of the spring bank holiday  clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix together nuclear and renewables produced 90 of britains electricity leaving just 28 gw to come from fossil fuels the generation mix over the spring bank holiday weekend highlighting the mix on the sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record national grid and other gridmonitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 gkwh at that time that was still a record low but very different from the electric insights numbers so why the discrepancy these sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation  as opposed to consumption  not all the electricity we consume is generated in britain and not all the electricity generated in britain is consumed here should the emissions from power stations in the netherlands count towards our carbon footprint if they are generating power consumed in our homes earths atmosphere would say yes as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities co 2 has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced on that bank holiday afternoon britain was importing 2 gw of electricity from france and belgium which are mostly powered by lowcarbon nuclear we were exporting threequarters of this 15 gw to the netherlands and ireland while they do have sizeable shares of renewables they also rely on coal power britains exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources so the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders we estimate that 1190 tonnes of co 2 were produced here 165 were emitted in producing our imports and 730 avoided through our exports in the longterm it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out over the whole quarter carbon emissions would be 153gkwh with our measure or 151 gkwh with productionbased accounting but it does matter on the hourly timescale consumption based accounting swings more widely imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24 th  but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 gkwh when renewable output is high in britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it and this helps to clean their power systems when renewables are low britain will import if power from ireland and the continent is lower cost but it may well be higher carbon two measures for the carbon intensity of british electricity over the bank holiday weekend and surrounding days this speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy should we use production or consumption based accounting with production by far the most common measure  the uk is doing very well and overall emissions are down 32 so far this century with consumptionbased accounting its a very different story and theyre only down 13   this is because we import more from abroad everything from manufactured goods to food to data when streaming music and films online either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions on the one hand productionbased accounting  britain could be producing 100 clean power but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand  that should not be classed as zero carbon as its pushing the problem elsewhere on the other hand consumptionbased accounting  it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running if we got to 96 low carbon 1300 mw of gas running we would be down at 25 gkwh then if we imported fully from france and sent it to the netherlands and ireland wed get down to 0 gkwh regardless of how you measure carbon intensity it is important to recognise that britains electricity is cleaner than ever the hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception by continuing to expand renewable generation preparing the grid for their integration and introducing negative emissions technologies such as beccs  bioenergy with carbon capture

policy  national grid could hydrogen power stations offer flexible electricity for a net zero future 26 august 2020 power generation were familiar with using natural gas every day in heating homes powering boilers and igniting stove tops but this same natural gas  predominantly methane  is also one of the most important sources of electricity to the uk in 2019 gas generation accounted for 39 of great britains electricity mix  but that could soon be changing hydrogen the super simple super light element can be a zerocarbon emissions source of fuel while were used to seeing it in everyday in water h 2 o as a gas it has been tested as an alternative to methane in homes and as a fuel for vehicles  could it also replace natural gas in power stations and help keep the lights on the need for a new gas hydrogen fuel station natural gas has been the largest single source of electricity in great britain since around 2000 aside from the period 2012 14 when coal made a resurgence due to high gas prices the dominance of gas over coal is in part thanks to the abundant supply of it in the north sea along with carbon pricing  domestic supply makes gas much cheaper than coal and much cleaner emitting as much as 60 less co 2 than the solid fossil fuel added to this is the ability of gas power stations to start up change their output and shut down very quickly to meet sudden shifts in electricity demand this flexibility is helpful to support the growth of weatherdependant renewable sources of power such as wind or solar the stability gas brings has helped the country decarbonise its power supply rapidly hydrogen on the other hand can be an even cleaner fuel as it only releases water vapour and nitrous oxide when combusted in large gas turbines this means it could offer a low or zerocarbon flexible alternative to natural gas that makes use of great britains existing gas infrastructure but its not as simple as just switching fuels switching gases some thermal power stations work by combusting a fuel such as biomass or coal in a boiler to generate intense heat that turns water into highpressure steam which then spins a turbine gas turbines however are different engineer works on a turbine at drax power station instead of heating water into steam a simple gas turbine blasts a mix of gas plus air from the surrounding atmosphere at high pressure into a combustion chamber where a chemical reaction takes place  oxygen from the air continuously feeding a gaspowered flame the highpressure and hot gasses then spin a turbine the reaction that takes place inside the combustion chamber is dependent on the chemical mix that enters it natural gas turbines have been tailored and optimised for their working conditions explains richard armstrong drax lead engineer hydrogen is a gas that burns in the same way as natural gas but it burns at different temperatures at different speeds and it requires different ratios of oxygen to get the most efficient combustion switching a power station from natural gas to hydrogen would take significant testing and refining to optimise every aspect of the process and ensure everything is safe this would no doubt continue over years subtly developing the engines over time to improve efficiency in a similar way to how natural gas combustion has evolved but its certainly possible what may be trickier though is providing the supply of hydrogen necessary to power and balance the countrys electricity system  making hydrogen hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but its very rare to find it on its own because its so atomically simple its highly reactive and almost always found naturally bonded to other elements water is the prime example its made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom making it h 2 o hydrogens tendency to bond with everything means a pure stream of it as would be needed in a power station has to be produced rather than extracted from underground like natural gas hydrogen as a gas at standard temperature and pressure is known by the symbol h 2  a power station would also need a lot more hydrogen than natural gas by volume it would take three times as much hydrogen to produce the same amount of energy as would be needed with natural gas however because it is so light the hydrogen would still have a lower mass a very large supply of hydrogen would be needed which doesnt exist in the uk at the moment says rachel grima research  innovation engineer at drax so at the same time as converting a power plant to hydrogen youd need to build a facility to produce it alongside it one of the most established ways to produce hydrogen is through a process known as steam methane reforming this applies high temperatures and pressure to natural gas to break down the methane which makes up the majority of natural gas into hydrogen and carbon dioxide co 2  the obvious problem with the process is it still emits co 2  meaning carbon capture and storage ccs systems are needed if it is to be carbon neutral source zero carbon humber its almost like capturing the co 2 from natural gas before its combusted rather than postcombustion explains grima one of the advantages of this is that the co 2 is at a much higher concentration which makes it much easier to capture than in flue gas when it is diluted with a lot of nitrogen using natural gas in the process produces whats known as grey hydrogen adding carbon capture to make the process carbon neutral is known as blue hydrogen  but there are ways to make it with renewable energy sources too electrolysis is already an established technology where an electrical current is used to break water down into hydrogen and oxygen this green hydrogen cuts out the co 2 emissions that come from using natural gas however like charging an electric vehicle the process is only carbonneutral if the electricity powering it comes from zero carbon sources such as nuclear wind and solar its also possible to produce hydrogen from biomass by putting biomass under high temperatures and adding a limited amount of oxygen to prevent the biomass combusting the biomass can be gasified meaning it is turned into a mix of hydrogen and co 2  by using a sustainable biomass supply chain where forests absorb the equivalent of the co 2 emitted but where some fossil fuels are used within the supply chain the process becomes low carbon carbon capture use and storage ccus incubation area drax power station ccs can then be added to make it carbon negative overall meaning more co 2 is captured and stored at forest level and in belowground carbon storage than is emitted throughout its lifecycle this form of green hydrogen is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen or negative emissions hydrogen there are plenty of options for making hydrogen but doing it at the scale needed for power generation and ensuring its an affordable fuel is the real challenge then there is the issue of transporting and working with hydrogen the difficulty is less in converting the uks gas power stations and turbines themselves thats a hurdle but most turbine manufacturers already in the process of developing solutions for this says armstrong the challenge is establishing a stable and consistent supply of hydrogen and the transmission network to get it to site working with the lightest known element today hydrogen is mainly transported by truck as either a gas or cooled down to minus253 degrees celsius at which point it becomes a liquid lh 2  however there is plenty of infrastructure already in place around the uk that could make transporting hydrogen significantly more efficient the uk has a very advanced and comprehensive gas grid a conversion to hydrogen would be more economic if you could repurpose the existing gas infrastructure says hannah steedman innovation engineer at drax the most feasible way to feed a power station is through pipelines and a lot of work is underway to determine if the current natural gas network could be used for hydrogen hydrogen is different to natural gas in that it is a very small and highly reactive molecule therefore it needs to be treated differently for example parts of the existing gas network are made of steel a metal which hydrogen reacts with causing whats known as hydrogen embrittlement which can lead to cracks and failures that could potentially allow gas to escape there are also factors around safety and efficiency to consider like natural gas hydrogen is also odourless meaning it would need to have an odourant added to it experimentation is underway to find out if mercaptan the odourant added to natural gas to give it a sulphuric smell is also compatible with hydrogen but for all the challenges that might come with switching to hydrogen there are huge advantages the uks gas network  both power generation and domestic  must move away from fossil fuels if it is to stop emitting co 2 into the atmosphere and for the country to reach net zero by 2050 while the process will not be as simple as switching gases it creates an opportunity to upgrade the uks gas infrastructure  for power in homes and even as a vehicle fuel  source zero carbon humber it wont happen overnight but hydrogen is a proven energy fuel source while it may take time to ramp up production to a scale which can meet demand at a reasonable cost transitioning to hydrogen is a chance to futureproof the gas systems that contributes so heavily to the uks stable power system  tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation

laid out in the paris agreement there is a need to not only reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases into the air but actively work to remove the excess carbon dioxide co 2  currently in the atmosphere and the co 2 that will continue to be emitted as economies work to decarbonise the process of greenhouse gas removal ggr or co 2 removal cdr from the atmosphere is possible through negative emissions  where more co 2 is taken out than is being put into the atmosphere negative emissions can be achieved through a range of naturebased solutions or through manmade technologies designed to remove co 2 at scale what naturebased solutions exist to remove co 2 from the atmosphere one millenniaold way of achieving negative emissions is forests  trees absorb carbon when they grow either converting this to energy and releasing oxygen or storing it over their lifetime this makes forests important tools in limiting and potentially reducing the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere planting new forests and regenerating forests has a positive effect on the health of the world as a result however this can also go beyond forests on land vegetation underwater has the ability to absorb and store co 2  and seagrasses can in fact store up to twice as much carbon as forests on land  an approach to negative emissions called blue carbon did you know bhutan is the only carbon negative country in the world  its thick forests absorb three times the amount of co 2 the small country emits what manmade technologies can deliver negative emissions many scientists and experts agree one of the most promising technologies to achieve negative emissions is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this approach uses biomass  sourced from sustainably managed forests  to generate electricity as the forests used to create biomass absorb co 2 while growing the co 2 released when it is used as fuel is already accounted for  making the whole process low carbon by then capturing and storing any co 2 emitted often in safe underground deposits the process of electricity generation becomes carbon negative  as more carbon has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added direct air carbon capture and storage daccs is an alternative technological solution in which co 2 is captured directly from the air and then transported to be stored or used while this could hold huge potential the technology is currently in its infancy and requires substantial investment to make it a more widespread practice the process of removing co 2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions because more co 2 is being taken out of the atmosphere than added into it how much negative emissions are needed according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change  negative emissions technologies could be required to capture 20 billion tonnes of carbon annually to help prevent catastrophic changes in the climate between now and 2050 negative emissions fast facts humans are currently moving carbon from the lithosphere the crust of the earth to the biosphere where we live at 100 times the rate of the natural carbon cycle there is enough sustainable biomass available to the uk to support beccs to remove 51 megatonnes of co 2 every year by 2050 according to the committee on climate change more companies are beginning to invest in negative emissions technologies with apple conserving

storage  decarbonisation  faqs frequently asked questions  negative emissions  technology what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture and storage ccs is the process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a largescale source  for example a power station or factory  and then permanently storing them carbon capture usage and storage ccus is where captured carbon dioxide co 2  may be used rather than stored in other industrial processes or even in the manufacture of consumer products  how is carbon captured carbon can be captured either precombustion  where it is removed from fuels that emit carbon before the fuel is used or postcombustion  where carbon is captured directly from the gases emitted once a fuel is burned precombustion carbon capture involves solid fossil fuels being converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide under heat pressure the separated co 2 is captured and transported to be stored or used postcombustion carbon capture uses the addition of other materials such as solvents to separate the carbon from flue gases produced as a result of the fuel being burned the isolated carbon is then transported normally via pipeline to be stored permanently  usually deep underground  or used for other purposes carbon capture and storage traps and removes carbon dioxide from large sources and most of that co 2 is not released into the atmosphere what can the carbon be used for once carbon is captured it can be stored permanently or used in a variety of different ways for example material including carbon nanofibres and bioplastics can be produced from captured carbon and used in products such as airplanes and bicycles while several startups are developing methods of turning captured co 2 into animal feed captured carbon can even assist in the largescale production of hydrogen  which could be used as a carbonneutral source of transport fuel or as an alternative to natural gas in power generation where can carbon be stored carbon can be stored in geological reserves  commonly naturally occurring underground rock formations such as unused natural gas reservoirs saline aquifers or unmineable coal beds the process of storage is referred to as sequestration the underground storage process means that the carbon can integrate into the earth through mineral storage  where the gas chemically reacts with the minerals in the rock formations and forms new solid minerals that ensure it is permanently and safely stored carbon injected into a saline aquifer dissolves into the water and descends to the bottom of the aquifer in a process called dissolution storage according to the global ccs institute  over 25 million tonnes of carbon captured from the power and industrial sectors was successfully and permanently stored in 2019 across sites in the usa norway and brazil what are the benefits of carbon storage co 2 is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in our atmosphere and therefore contributes to global warming by capturing and storing carbon it is being taken out of the atmosphere which reduces greenhouse gas levels and helps mitigate the effects of climate change carbon capture fast facts ccus is an affordable way to lower co 2 emissions  fighting climate change would cost 70 more without carbon capture technologies the largest carbon capture facility in the world is the petra nova plant in texas which has captured a total of 5 million tonnes of co 2  since opening in 2016 drax power station is trialling europes biggest bioenergy carbon capture usage and storage project beccs which could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year by the mid 2030s delivering a huge amount of the negative emissions the uk

negative emissions  sustainability  technology what is climate change sustainable business what is climate change climate change refers to the change in weather patterns and global temperature of the earth over long periods of time in a modern context climate change describes the rise of global temperatures that has been occurring since the industrial revolution in the 1800s what causes climate change while there have been natural fluctuations in the earths climate over previous millennia scientists have found that currentday temperatures are rising quicker than ever due to the excessive amount of carbon dioxide co 2  and other greenhouse gasses being released into the atmosphere an excess of co 2 in the atmosphere accentuates something called the greenhouse effect  as co 2 traps heat in the earths atmosphere it warms the planet and causes a rise in average global temperature international efforts such as the paris climate accords are dedicated to ensuring temperatures do not rise 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels which could lead to catastrophic conditions on the planet  in the modern context climate change describes the rise of global temperatures occurring since the industrial revolution in the 1800s how do humans contribute to climate change industries such as transport agriculture energy and manufacturing have traditionally relied on the use of coal oil and other fossil fuels these fuels when combusted or used emit large amounts of co 2 into the atmosphere further advancing the greenhouse effect and contributing to climate change human reliance and consumption of these products mean today co 2 levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  why are rising temperatures harmful to the planet our planet has a history of experiencing periods of extreme weather conditions  for example the last ice age  which finished 12000 years ago however the rapid rise in temperatures seen today is harmful because a hotter planet completely affects our natural environment  a steep rise in global temperature can melt ice sheets and cause higher sea levels which can in turn contribute to more extreme storms and even threaten entire islands and coastal communities  as the planet warms extreme weather events such as bushfires could become more common which can destroy homes impact agriculture and degrade air quality while entire ecosystems habitats and animal and insect species could also be threatened by climate change  what can be done to mitigate the effects of climate change reducing co 2 emissions is a key way of slowing down the pace of climate change to do so industries across the global economy must decarbonise to become less dependent on fossil fuels such as coal and petrol and adopt new lower carbon energy sources decarbonisation will rely on a number of factors including a technological response that sees the development and implementation of carbon neutral and carbon negative ways of creating heat electricity and fuels including the use of innovations such as carbon capture and storage ccs there is also a need for a policy and governmental response that promotes investment in new cleaner technologies and disincentivises dirtier industries through mechanisms like the carbon tax  countries and economies will need to work collaboratively to achieve common climateoriented goals that will also enable smaller scale action to be taken by individuals around the world go deeper five learnings from the international panel on climate change report climate change is the biggest challenge of our time our

countries reach their climate targets tags climate change  decarbonisation  faqs frequently asked questions  sustainability what is decarbonisation carbon capture what is decarbonisation decarbonisation is the term used for the process of removing or reducing the carbon dioxide co 2  output of a countrys economy this is usually done by decreasing the amount of co 2 emitted across the active industries within that economy why is decarbonisation important currently a wide range of sectors  industrial residential and transport  run largely on fossil fuels  which means that their energy comes from the combustion of fuels like coal oil or gas the co 2 emitted from using these fuels acts as a greenhouse gas trapping in heat and contributing to global warming by using alternative sources of energy industries can reduce the amount of co 2 emitted into the atmosphere and can help to slow the effects of climate change why target carbon dioxide there are numerous greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming however co 2 is the most prevalent as of 2018 carbon levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  the paris agreement was created to hold nations accountable in their efforts to decrease carbon emissions with the central goal of ensuring that temperatures dont rise 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial level with 195 current signatories  economies have begun to factor in the need for less investment in carbon with the uk leading the g20 nations in decarbonising its economy in the 21 st century how is decarbonisation carried out there are numerous energy technologies that aim to reduce emissions from industries as well as those that work towards reducing carbon emissions from the atmosphere decarbonisation has had the most progress in electricity generation because of the growth of renewable sources of power such as wind turbines solar panels and coalto biomass upgrades  meaning that homes and businesses dont have to rely on fossil fuels other innovations such as using batteries and allowing homes to generate and share their own power can also lead to higher rates of decarbonisation as the electricity itself is made cleaner it therefore assists electricity users themselves to become cleaner in the process other approaches such as reforestation or carbon capture and storage  help to pull existing carbon from the air to neutralise carbon output  or in some cases help to make electricity generation  and even entire nations  carbon negative alternative power options means that homes and businesses dont have to rely on traditional carbon fuels what is the future of decarbonisation for decarbonisation to be more widely adopted as a method for combating climate change there needs to be structural economical change  according to deloitte access economics creating more room for decarbonisation through investing in alternative energies means that there are a multitude of jobrich shovelready stimulus opportunities that also unlock longterm value decarbonisation fast facts a study by carbon brief in 2019 found that the uks carbon emissions have decreased by 38 since 1990 which is faster than any other major developed nation the uk has committed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by enshrining this goal as law  and announcing a 3 billion investment in low carbon technologies in 2019 currently heavy industry cement steel and chemicals and heavyduty transport mainly shipping and aviation account for 30 of co 2 emissions  worldwide energy consumption over a large range of sectors  including transport heating construction and production  is the biggest source of humancaused greenhouse gas emissions providing 73 of global carbon output iceland is the only nation to currently have 100 of
