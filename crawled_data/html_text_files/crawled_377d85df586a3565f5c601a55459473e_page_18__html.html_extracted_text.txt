How sustainable biomass crosses the Atlantic to power the nation
21 June 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

In the UK, we’re so accustomed to
using electricity
we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug.
In fact, electricity must travel across a network of cables, wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it
to the homes and businesses using it
. At Drax Power Station, which supplies 16% of Great Britain’s renewable power, there’s another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station.
This journey – the journey of
more than half
of the compressed wood pellet fuel Drax uses to generate electricity – has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern USA.
From forest to fuel
The journey starts in the huge,
working forests of the southern states of the USA
where low value wood – such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests’ growing cycle – is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets, which Drax Power Station uses to produce
more than 60%
of its electricity.
Drax Group’s own pellet manufacturer,
Drax Biomass
, produces around 15% of the power station’s renewable fuel. After
pelletisation locally at its Amite
and Morehouse facilities, located in Louisiana and Mississippi respectively, the biomass is transported to
Drax Transit
at the Port of Greater Baton Rouge, on the Mississippi River. From Morehouse, trains made up of closed-top grain cars, each capable of carrying 120 tonnes, transport the pellets 221 miles to Baton Rouge. At Amite, just 60 miles from Baton Rouge, fuel-efficient trucks carry 25-tonne loads between plant and port.
Once at the port, the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes – each holding 40,000 tonnes of biomass – before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey.
From port to port
Drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8,000-mile journey to the UK, ranging from big ‘Coastal’ ships, capable of hauling 20,000 tonnes, to truly massive Panamax ships, more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80,000 tonnes.
The ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, around Florida, and into the Atlantic. From here, it’s a 19-day voyage to reach ports in the UK. To put that into perspective, it took Columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the Atlantic.
The ships pull into ports in Tyne, Hull, Immingham and Liverpool, where they are unloaded. At the bespoke
biomass port facility at Peel Ports in Liverpool
an Archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ship’s holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt, which loads them onto trains. These four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year, combined.
From port to power station
Like the stateside journey, Drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant. The difference on the UK side, however, is that the
UK trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets
. Clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite UK rail restrictions.
These trains carry the pellets across the country (and even over the Pennines for trains coming from Liverpool) to Drax Power Station in Selby, North Yorkshire. Roughly
14 trains arrive at the plant every
day and collectively unload about 20,000 tonnes of pellets every day, from Monday to Saturday. A system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of Drax’s four
giant biomass storage domes
, each capable of housing about 80,000 tonnes of pellets.
Then, when needed, the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey: into the furnace. The pellets are combusted, which boils water to create steam, which turns a turbine connected to a generator, which then feeds electricity to the national grid. The electricity
travels across miles of cables, and wires
, through substations and transformers, and finally into your power socket.
Long journey, low emissions
Despite the number of miles travelled, the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the Drax Power Station supply chain is as
low-carbon as possible
. The result is that, even with all supply chain emissions considered, the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80% lower than coal.
It might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island – but it’s not the only one to travel thousands of miles. The journey of biomass to England joins liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipped from the Middle East, coal from Colombia and solar panels manufactured in China – imports that ensure we have readily available access to power on our shores.

Capital Markets Event and Trading Update
15 June 2017
Investors

RNS Number : 1264I
Drax Group PLC
(Symbol: DRX)
Capital markets event
Drax is today hosting a capital markets event for investors and analysts.
The event will provide an update on the Group’s strategy, outlining a plan for 2025 EBITDA in excess of £425
(1)
million – more than a third of which is expected to come from Retail (>£80 million) and Biomass Supply (>£75 million) operations. This will be delivered by maximising the opportunities from the existing portfolio of assets and targeted value creative investment in long-term growth opportunities, underpinned by a robust financial model and capital allocation plan.
The event will provide further insight into the Group’s three areas of operation and how these support the strategy:
Retail
– an annuity-like income stream with profitable SME
(2)
and I&C
(3)
businesses;

Generation
– visible biomass earnings, flexible operations, the development of options for rapid response gas and long-term opportunities to repurpose coal assets; and
Biomass Supply
– lower cost, good quality pellets, with visible earnings and the capacity to provide at least 30 per cent of the Group’s fuel requirements.
These activities are underpinned by safety, sustainability, operational excellence and expertise in our markets
. Drax is committed to using research and innovation to help reduce supply chain costs, identify new long-term opportunities and to maximise value across the Group.
The event will be led by Dorothy Thompson, Group CEO, supported by the senior management team from across the business.
Dividend policy and capital allocation
Following discussion with shareholders, Drax today announces a new dividend policy.
Drax expects to pay a growing dividend consistent with maintaining its credit rating and investing in its business.
Drax expects to recommend a dividend of £50m with regards to the 2017 financial year. The Board is confident that this dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow from this level as the implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flow. In determining the rate of growth in dividends the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the Group’s commodity-based businesses.
If there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.
Dorothy Thompson said:
“Britain’s energy market is changing. Drax has embraced these changes with a strategy which will help change the way energy is generated, supplied and used for a better future.
“Through our operations in retail, generation and biomass supply we expect to deliver a significant increase in high quality, visible, contracted earnings for the Group.
“With the optimisation of our existing asset portfolio combined with acquisitions across our markets the strategy is already delivering, allowing the Group to create long-term opportunities in all areas of the business.
“We are confident in the strategy and our ability to deliver high quality earnings, growth and value for shareholders, supported by a strong financial model and clear capital allocation policy, including a sustainable dividend that we expect to grow from a level of £50m in 2017.”

Trading and Operational Performance
Since publishing our full year results on 16 February 2017, trading conditions in the markets in which we operate have remained unchanged and operational performance has been good.
These factors underpin our expectations for full year EBITDA
(4)
, which remain unchanged.
Capital markets webcast and presentation material
The event will be webcast from 9.30am and the material made available on the Group website at the same time. Joining instructions for the webcast and presentation are included in the links below.

What does the internet of things mean for energy?
2 June 2017
Electrification

Internet of things (IoT) technology, which connects everyday appliances to one another allowing them to collect data and become ‘smart’, presents an exciting view of the modern home or workspace.
The future IoT-enabled office or household is one with autonomous appliances, remote-operated thermostats, and fridges that monitor their contents and reorder supplies when they run low. You may never go hungry again.
There’s arguably an even brighter future for the IoT’s potential in industry – it can bring about value through applications like predictive maintenance and performance optimisation.
On paper these two scenarios – that of industrial optimisation and convenience throughout our daily lives – might seem worlds away. But James Robbins, Chief Information Officer at Drax, is thinking about how to bring them together – particularly when it comes to energy use.
Central to the approach is a question: could a better understanding of how households and
businesses use energy
change how it’s generated and provided?
The importance of data
At its heart, the IoT is about data. What data you collect and how you use it determines what value you can create, says Robbins. He explains: “Whether you’re talking about the IoT, big data, artificial intelligence [AI] or robotics – they’re all the modernisation of information collection and use.”
And nowhere is this more applicable than at a
large-scale power station
. “At Drax we’re used to managing what’s basically our own private IoT in the station,” he explains. “The real-time control systems we have for the generators and the Grid are essentially a bunch of sensors tied to a central network.” These sensors collect data from the power station, which then help optimise it for better performance.
The same approach to data collection can have benefits for bill payers, too.
Tracking energy use in the workspace and home
Connected devices like
smart meters
can bring a precise level of insight into energy usage in the home and places of work, which can benefit both end users and suppliers of heat and power. Electricity generators and heating fuel suppliers can use this data to better manage their output by being able to predict how and when it will be required. For end users, it can help them and their energy suppliers more accurately track what they use, where they use it and how they could use it more efficiently.
For example, using IoT technology a gas or
wood pellet for heat supplier may be able to identify that a home can make substantial cost savings
just by turning down their heating by one degree. “Sensors and smart technology can give us that insight,” says Robbins.
This level of optimisation is already possible to a degree using existing tools, but Robbins sees a future with greater possibilities. For example, with comprehensive datasets, suppliers can compare business owners’ energy use with others in the same sector and region to highlight efficiencies.
“The whole thing is about making it easier for us to serve the customer,” says Robbins. And the better the dataset, the more exotic the services could be.
“Just looking at meters means we can only really talk to the bill payer. But who else in the home or workplace could we engage with to get them to conserve energy? For instance, we could develop a game for child in the house that’s linked to energy use, where they get points for turning off lights or turning down heating,” he explains.
The gamification of energy use is – at this stage – just an idea, Robbins says, but it is exactly the kind of thing that better data allows energy suppliers and generators to think about.
A challenging journey, but an exciting one
The IoT approach to energy generation and use won’t be without its challenges – security being one major concern. But there will also be substantial technical and standardisation issues any provider keen to leverage IoT must tackle to make it a truly effective technology.
“In the 80s, you couldn’t play a VHS cassette in a Betamax player,” Robbins explains. “The compatibility issue with IoT could be an even bigger problem – all these gadgets need to be built into an architecture that can handle them and make them work together.”
Consider the so-called smart meter that provides data for a customer’s itemised bill. The bill payer is told that a tumble dryer in their home is using a significant proportion of the power they are paying for. The problem is that their appliances and devices have not been meshed together in a way that gives the system sufficient context about the customer’s situation. In the worst-case scenario, the customer asks for a refund and switches supplier because they don’t actually have a tumble dryer.
Robbins and his team are working with Drax suppliers to make sure that compatibility and context don’t become a problem. He aims to ensure that unintended consequences in the Group’s use of IoT are only of the positive variety. By investing in back-office infrastructure that can use big data processing to ingest and analyse meter data down to the 10-second level, Drax can take advantage of smart tech when it arrives in earnest.
It’s an exciting period of technological advancement – but as Robbins is keen to point out, it’s only the start.
“It’ll probably only be over the next few years that we actually begin to really understand how to leverage IoT data, when we pass the tipping point of user adoption. When that happens, we’ll be starting a very exciting journey with a clearer purpose – to spot and solve meaningful problems faced by people and businesses, in context, in real-time.”

Batteries as big as biomass domes?
24 May 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Renewables are playing a bigger part of our electricity mix as the UK moves towards a low carbon economy. How we ‘plug the gaps’ left by intermittent renewables is among the greatest challenges faced by the energy sector.
Sources like wind and solar are intermittent – they can’t generate electricity all the time. When the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow they lack the fuel needed to generate power and can’t feed into the grid.
This leaves a gap in the UK’s electricity supply that needs to be filled. Today that’s done by sources like coal, gas and biomass which can be dialled up and down to accommodate for the dips and peaks in generation created by changes in demand and the weather.
One alternative being touted as a possible solution is
storage
and in particular, battery technology. However, creating batteries on a scale big enough to meet our incredible demand is a considerable challenge. It’s a challenge that will be met in a future where giant, affordable batteries are able to store solar power captured in the summer months for use in the winter. But costs would have to come down at an even faster rate than they have done in recent years.
The challenge of building bigger batteries
To demonstrate the size of this challenge, consider the
biomass storage domes
at Drax Power Station. These effectively operate as giant energy stores with the flexible ability to quickly feed renewable fuel to the power station, which generates electricity on demand.
Our biomass domes can hold 300,000 tonnes of sustainably-sourced
compressed wood pellets
, the equivalent of 600 GWh worth of electricity. Currently, batteries cost £350 per kWh, meaning at present prices it would cost £210 billion to replace the capacity of all four of our biomass domes using battery power.
Even if battery technology advances dramatically over the next few years that figure is only likely to fall to around £60 billion. Then there is the question of the
ancillary services
that thermal power stations provide. The batteries of the future may be able to provide these vital services (such as synthetic inertia, short-term reserve and reactive power), but for now, providing these via battery power is prohibitively expensive and in some cases best left to biomass and gas power stations.
We should not underestimate the challenges ahead. The UK’s ever-changing power system will need to balance more electricity generated via wind and solar with affordable solutions that are also reliable,
flexible and lower carbon than coal
. This is why Drax is
developing four rapid-response gas power stations
in addition to continuing its investment in biomass generation and supply.

Everything you ever wanted to know about cooling towers
17 May 2017
Power generation

Cooling towers aren’t beautiful buildings in the traditional sense, but it’s undeniable they are icons of 20
th
century architecture. They’re a ubiquitous part of our landscape – each one a reminder of our industrial heritage.
Yet despite the familiarity we have with them, knowledge about what a cooling tower actually does remains limited. A common misconception is that they release pollution. In fact, what they actually release is water vapour – similar to, but nowhere near as hot, as the steam coming out of your kettle every morning. And this probably isn’t the only thing you never knew about cooling towers.

What does a cooling tower do?
As the name suggests, a cooling tower’s primary function is to lower temperatures – specifically of water, or ‘cooling water’ as it’s known at Drax.
Power stations utilise a substantial amount of water in the generation of electricity. At a thermal power plant, such as Drax, fuel is used to heat demineralised water to turn it to high pressure steam. This steam is used to spin turbines and generate electricity before being cooled by the cooling water, which flows through two condensers on either side of each of the steam turbines, and then returning to the boiler. It is this process that the cooling towers support – and it plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of electricity generation at Drax’s North Yorkshire site.
To optimise water utilisation, some power stations cycle it. To do this, they have cooling towers, of which at Drax there are 12. These large towers recover the warmed water, which then continues to be circulated where chemistry is permitting.
The warmed water (about 40°C) is pumped into the tower and sprayed out of a set of sprinklers onto a large volume of plastic packing, where it is cooled by the air naturally drawn through the tower. The plastic packing provides a large surface area to help cool the water, which then falls in to the large flat area at the bottom of the massive structure called the cooling tower pond.
As the water cools down, some of it (
approximately 2%
) escapes the top of the tower as water vapour. This water vapour, which is commonly mistakenly referred to as steam, may be the most visible part of the process but it’s only a by-product of the cooling process.
The majority of the water utilised by Drax Power Station is returned back to the environment, either as vapour from the top of the towers or safely discharged back to the River Ouse. Each year, about half of the water removed from the river is returned there. In effect, it is a huge amount of water recycling and in
environmental terms
, it is not a consumptive process.
How do you build a cooling tower?
The history of cooling towers as we know them today dates back to the beginning of the 20
th
century, when
two Dutch engineers were the first
to build a tower using a ‘hyperboloid’ shape. Very wide on the bottom, curved in the centre and flared at the top, the structure meant fewer materials were required to construct each tower, it was naturally more robust,
and
it helped draw in air and aid its flow upwards. It quickly became the de facto design for towers across the world.
The Dutch engineers’ tower measured 34 metres, which at the time was a substantial achievement, but as engineering and construction abilities progressed, so too did the size of cooling towers.
Today, each of 12 towers measures
115 metres tall
– big enough to fit the dome of St Paul’s Cathedral or the whole of the Statue of Liberty, with room to spare. If scaled down to the size of an egg, the concrete of each cooling tower would be the same thinness as egg shell.
The structures at Drax are dwarfed by the cooling towers at the Kalisindh power plant in Rajasthan, India, the tallest in the world. Each stands an impressive 202 metres tall – twice the height of the tower housing Big Ben and just a touch taller than the UK’s joint fifth tallest skyscraper, the HSBC Tower at 8 Canada Square in London’s Canary Wharf.
The industrial icon of the future
Today’s energy mix is not what is used to be. The increased use of renewables means we’re no longer as reliant on fossil fuels, and this has an effect on cooling towers. Already a large proportion of the UK’s most prominent towers have been demolished, going the same way as the coal they were once in service to. But this doesn’t mean cooling towers will disappear completely.
Power stations such as Drax, which has
upgraded four of its boilers
to super-heat water with sustainably-sourced compressed
wood pellets
instead of coal, the dwindling coal fleet, and some gas facilities still rely on cooling towers. As they continue to be part of our energy mix, the cooling tower will remain an icon of electricity generation for the time being. But it’ll be a mantle it shares with biomass domes, gigantic offshore wind turbines and field-upon-field of solar panels – the icons of today’s diverse energy mix.

How space tech helps forests
20 April 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Can you count the number of trees in the world? Accurately, no – there are just too many, spread out over too vast an area. But if we could, what would we gain? For one, we would get a clearer picture of what’s happening in our planet’s forests.
They’re a hugely important part of our lives – not only for the resource they provide, but for their role in
absorbing carbon
dioxide (CO
2
). So properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them – whether increasing or decreasing – and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important.
The trouble is, they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally haven’t been able to accurately monitor them en masse. Thanks to space technologies, that’s changing.
The view from up there
As far back as World War II, aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment. In addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground, infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets.
As satellite and
remote sensing technology
developed through the 20
th
century, so too did our understanding of our planet. Satellites were used to map the weather, monitor the sea, and to create topological maps of the earth, but they weren’t used to track the Earth’s forests in any real detail.
But in 2021 the European Space Agency (ESA) will launch
Biomass
, a satellite that will map the world’s forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever P-band radar to be placed in Earth orbit. This synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches. It won’t just be able to track how much land a forest covers, but how much wood exists in it. In short, the Biomass will be able to ‘weigh’ the world’s forests.
Over the course of its five-year mission, it will produce 3D maps every six months, giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles.
The satellite is part of ESA’s
Earth Explorers
programme, which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions. And it’s not the only entity carrying out research of this sort.
California-based firm
Planet
has 149 micro-satellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the Earth, each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day. To put it another way, each satellite photographs about 2.5 million square kilometres of the Earth’s surface on a daily basis.
The aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question: what is changing on Earth? When it comes to forests, this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires, but the overall aim is to create a searchable, expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights.
Keeping the world green
All this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing, it is vital for the development of responsible, sustainable forestry practices.
From 2005 to 2015, the UN rolled out the
REDD programme
(Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), which, among other functions, allows countries to earn the right to offset CO
2
emissions – for example through forestry management practices. Sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries, it can also help them monitor, highlight and encourage responsible forestry.
Satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet. But more than just a clearer view on what is happening, it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening. And it’s with this information that real differences in our future can be made.

AGM Statement
13 April 2017
Investors

RNS Number : 4477C
Drax Group PLC
(Symbol: DRX)
Drax holds its Annual General Meeting at 11:30am today at The Grand Hotel and Spa, Station Rise, York.  At this meeting Philip Cox, Chairman of Drax, will make the following comments:
“The Annual Report and Accounts were published on 10 March and therefore I hope that you’ve had time to review them. By way of a reminder, our principal performance indicators and operational achievements for 2016 are summarised on the screen.
2016 was a pivotal year for Drax, marking the completion of the biomass transformation project which commenced in 2012, and the announcement of a new strategy to deliver long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.
Our underlying earnings for 2016 at £140 million was in line with our guidance, although £29 million below 2015. This reflects the continuation of challenging commodity markets and the removal of Climate Change Levy (CCL) exemptions. However, we were pleased to be able to partly offset the impact of these factors with a focus on flexible system support, the prompt and balancing markets, ancillary services and improving retail margins, all of which are important parts of our strategy to develop broader, non-commodity exposed earnings.

Against a background of low wholesale electricity prices, the Group has again delivered strong operational performance. This is not something we take for granted and it remains at the core of our strategy.
Following a comprehensive review, initiated in 2015, the Group’s new strategy has been defined and is based on creating a more diversified earnings base that will produce higher-quality returns in the long term.
Central to this strategy, Drax aims to play an increasing role in the way energy is generated, supplied and used for a better future. We announced our new strategy to the market in December. Evidence of delivering on the new strategy can already be seen in the acquisition of Opus Energy and four projects to develop rapid-response Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) generation plants and most recently we have made progress in our plans to expand our biomass pellet self-supply capability with the provisional acquisition of a new biomass pellet plant in Louisiana.
Sustainably sourced biomass generation remains at the heart of your business and we were delighted to be able to complete the full conversion of our third biomass generating unit, resulting in Drax delivering 16 per cent of the UK’s renewable electricity.

Biomass is the most cost-effective large scale renewable and with the right policy frameworks we could become 100% renewable through the full conversion of our three remaining coal units and we could do this well before 2025, supporting the Government’s objective to remove unabated coal from the system.
Through our strategy your Board remain focused on optimising the value of the Group as well as remaining alert to opportunities for growth.
The sustainable biomass we use to provide energy is at the heart of our business. Because this must be sustainable we always strive to ensure all our pellets comply with our policy. We are well aware of the obligations we have to society, and specifically the communities in which we are located, as well as the wider environment.
We take these obligations very seriously.
And, I’d like to remind you our shareholders of our guiding principles:
We never work in countries that lack proper regulation.
We never cause deforestation or forest decline.
We never source from areas that are officially protected or where our activities would harm endangered species.
We only take wood from working forests that grow back and stay as forests.
We require all our suppliers to pass tough screening and sustainability audits, conducted by independent auditors.
We only source wood from countries that already have huge working forests where we provide another market for low grade material that solid-wood industries, such as construction and furniture manufacture, aren’t using.
This year there are a larger number of resolutions than usual as a result of the submission of a new Remuneration Policy for consideration by shareholders and a number of other resolutions as set out in the Notice of Meeting.  Following comments by shareholder advisory bodies and discussions with major shareholders, I want to be clear that all payments and awards made to directors are in line with our remuneration policy, although I acknowledge that some elements of remuneration structure could have been better explained in the previous year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.”
