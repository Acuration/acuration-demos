customers in a crisis people come first will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 14 may 2020 opinion this crisis will be remembered for many things many are not positive but some are inspiring around the world weve seen tremendous acts of kindness and witnessed remarkable resilience from people continuing to live work and to support one another the actions we are all taking as individuals businesses and communities will not only help us get through this crisis they will shape how we emerge from it at drax we are proud of the ongoing role were playing in supporting the uk and its essential services continuing to generate and supply the electricity needed to keep people healthy and the economy running it is what we have always done and it is what we will continue to do this is possible because our people have continued to carry out their important work in these uncertain times safely and responsibly my leadership team in the uk and us must continue to support them and we must also support the communities they are a part of employees drax power station show their support and appreciation for the heroic efforts of those within the nhs by turning one of its cooling towers blue at 8pm each thursday our communities are at the core of what we do and who we are they support our business globally and enable us to supply energy to the country we have a responsibility to do what we can to help them through this crisis to do this we have put together a covid19 support package totalling more than three quarters of a million pounds that goes beyond just financing to make a positive impact id like to highlight a few of these supporting communities in great britain and the us the robinson family collect their laptop at selby community primary school the closures of schools and the need to turn homes into classrooms has been one of the biggest changes for many families with children now depending on technology and the internet for schooling theres a very real chance those without access may fall behind with a long term negative impact on their education we want to ensure no child is left out so we have donated 250000 to buy 853 new laptops each with three months of prepaid internet access and delivered them to schools and colleges local to our sites across the uk  this has been implemented by drax working closely with headteachers as one of our local heads ian clennan told us schools dont just provide education  theyre a whole support system having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and classmates more easily too  which is also incredibly important at the moment in the us were donating 30000 to support hardship funds for the communities where we operate  our colleagues in louisiana are playing an active role in the community and in amite county mississippi they have helped provide ppe to first responders as well as supporting charities for the families worse affected helping businesses starting with the most vulnerable as an energy supplier to small and medium sized businesses smes we must act with compassion and be ready to help those who are most economically exposed to the crisis to do this we are launching a number of initiatives to support businesses starting with some of the most vulnerable its clear that care homes require extra support at this time we are offering energy bill relief for more than 170 small care homes situated near our uk operations for the next two months allowing them to divert funds to their other priorities such as ppe food or carer accommodation but it is also important we understand how difficult a period this is for small businesses of all kinds many of our customers are facing financial pressure that was impossible to forecast to help relieve this we have agreed deferred payment plans with some of our customers who are unable to pay in full we have also extended current energy prices for three months for 4000 customers of opus energy who have not been able to secure a new contract during this period the impact of this crisis will be long term so we made a significant twoyear charitable donation to business debtline  a dedicated phoneline and webpage will be provided to our small businesses customers offering free debt advice and helping them to recover for the future an engineer looks up at flue gas

the future recovery while there is still uncertainty around how the uk the us and the world will emerge from the pandemic it is the responsibility of the whole energy industry to show compassion for its customers and to take the actions needed to soften the economic blow that covid19 is having across the globe the disruption to normal life caused by the pandemic has changed how the country uses electricity overnight in the coming weeks we will be publishing a more indepth view from electric insights showing exactly what effect this has had and what it might reveal for the future of energy no matter what that future holds however we will remain committed to enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future this will mean not only supporting our people our communities and our countries

 covid19  customers  haven power  investors  supply chain building a sustainable business will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 21 march 2018 opinion the uk energy sector is changing rapidly the boundaries between users suppliers and generators are blurring as energy users are choosing to generate their own energy and are managing their energy use more proactively while conversely generators are increasingly seeing users as potential sources of generation and providers of demand management the uk is undergoing an unprecedented energy revolution with electricity at its heart  a transition to a lowcarbon society requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy in that context our groups purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future this means that sustainability in its broadest sense must be at the very core of what we do successful delivery of our purpose depends on all our people across all our businesses doing the right thing every day with the right products and services we can go even further and help our customers make the right sustainable energy choices as our businesses transform and we embrace a larger customer base different generation technologies and operate internationally the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and becoming more complex at the same time the range of stakeholders looking to drax for responsible leadership on sustainability is increasing the need for transparency is greater than ever so our websites sustainability section provides a comprehensive insight into the groups environmental social and governance management and performance during 2017 some of the highlights include carbon reduction  i am pleased that in 2017 the proportion of our energy generation from renewable sources remained high 65 of our generation during the year came from sustainable biomass and accounted for 15 of the countrys overall renewable generation we maintained our rigorous and robust approach to ensure that we only ever use biomass that is sustainably produced and legally sourced people  another key achievement was the roll out of our people strategy to 2020  one drax  which focuses on talent to deliver on our strategic and operational objectives safety  the health and safety of all our employees and contractors is of paramount importance to drax while the groups safety incident rate remained on target in 2017 the fire at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did cause an outage with disruption lasting into 2018 it highlighted once again that the risks of generating using biomass must be mitigated through robust safety procedures and a riskbased plant investment and maintenance programme safety therefore remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are determined to do even better customers  our business to business b2b energy supply business received recognition for their dedication to
