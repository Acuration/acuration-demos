together to explore how a largescale carbon capture usage and storage ccus network and a hydrogen production facility could be constructed in the humber in the mid2020s 27 may 2019 drax group equinor and national grid ventures announce new zero carbon partnership commitment marks first significant response from industry following committee on climate changes net zero report plan could deliver the uks first zero carbon cluster and help position great britain at the heart of the global energy revolution this is the first significant action from industry since the uk committee on climate change ccc recently published its net zero report which found that ccus and hydrogen technology developed in regional industrial clusters is essential if great britain is going to achieve a net zero carbon economy by 2050 the partnership could lead to the humber becoming the worlds first net zero carbon region and home to a new world leading hydrogen economy viewdownload graphic with grey background or white background commenting on the partnership will gardiner drax group ceo said the committee on climate change was clear  the uk needs both bioenergy with ccs and hydrogen production at scale by 2030 to achieve a net zero carbon economy this partnership is committed to meeting this challenge putting great britain at the heart of the global energy revolution with draxs carbon negative power station the humber region could lead the world in new technologies that can deliver for the climate and the economy helping to create a cleaner environment for future generations whilst creating new jobs and export opportunities for british businesses were excited to be working with national grid ventures and equinor on this project  for decades the humber has been a strategically important industrial cluster for the uk  it has the skills industrial capability as well as offshore storage to transform itself into a cuttingedge low carbon hub drax power station north yorkshire click to viewdownload irene rummelhoff equinors executive vice president for marketing midstream and processing said as a global leader in ccs and a major gas supplier to the uk for many decades we are committed to helping shape sustainable solutions for a low carbon future we are pleased to be partnering with drax and national grid ventures in looking at how the humber region can be a launch pad for wider decarbonisation in the uk economy and be an example for others to learn from globally we must see substantial decarbonisation of industry and energy in the years ahead and we believe ccs and hydrogen must play a significant role in this equinors snøhvit offshore development in the barents sea click to viewdownload jon butterworth chief operating officer global transmission for national grid ventures said we all agree that we must act now to start delivering a netzero carbon economy thats why were delighted to be working together with equinor and drax this is a project of great potential for the uk and the humber region and we look forward to leveraging our skills and expertise to enable this transition we have seen rapid progress in decarbonising energy through established technologies such as wind power solar and electricity interconnectors ccus and hydrogen create a new pathway to greater decarbonisation of the energy system and provide a platform for decarbonising other areas of our economy which will be to the benefit of current and future generations national grid pipelines click to viewdownload the three companies will work together to explore the opportunity to scaleup the innovative bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project at the drax power station in order to create the worlds first carbon negative power station in the 2020s explore the potential development of a largescale hydrogen demonstrator within the drax site by as early as the mid2020s  in line with the cccs recommendation that hydrogen should be produced at scale in at least one industrial cluster by 2030 explore the strategic opportunities in developing a cuttingedge hydrogen economy in the region equinors tjeldbergodden industrial facility at nordmøre norway has a methanol plant a gas receiving terminal and an air separation plant click to viewdownload drax power station in north yorkshire is already capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from its innovative bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project if it is scaled up it could serve as the anchor for a regional ccus network capturing millions of tonnes of carbon each year from nearby industrial emitters energy and clean growth minister claire perry visited the drax power station beccs pilot project in november 2018 click to viewdownload the consortium has the collective expertise and credibility to deliver on the ccc recommendation for largescale trials of hydrogen development of ccs transport and storage infrastructure and the deployment of beccs at scale a study outlining the technical economic and societal opportunities for ccus and hydrogen in the humber region will be published by the partners later this year ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head

1926 653962 editors notes the consortium will work with partners in the public and private sectors to harness the humbers key strengths and capabilities and help it become the worlds first netzero carbon industrial cluster these include its position as the largest industrial cluster in the uk by emissions its proximity to drax power station which could become the single largest source of negative emissions in the uk through its beccs project the extensive engineering design work previously undertaken to develop a largescale carbon transportation and storage network in the region as part of the white rose ccs project its proximity to the endurance and bunter aquifer in the north sea a large natural co 2 store which could be used by the humber and other nearby industrial clusters to permanently store their carbon emissions drax announced in february that is has started to capture carbon dioxide from its beccs pilot project using technology developed by leeds university spinout company ccapture this is the firsttime carbon dioxide has been captured from the combustion of a 100 biomass feedstock anywhere in the world since starting its innovative beccs pilot project drax has been talking to several industries about using its co 2 in their processes this could be to produce concrete within the food and drinks industry or creating synthetic fuels to use in hardtodecarbonise sectors like aviation it has set up a dedicated incubation area at the power station that will give other technology companies the opportunity to test their processes on its carbon dioxide drax power station is already the largest decarbonisation project in europe having converted two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal if the beccs pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions drax power station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warming from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced the committee on climate changes net zero report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 mt co2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero today drax is capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from its pilot  once scaled up it would be capturing 40000 tonnes of carbon a day from its four biomass generating units thats at a 90 capture rate the cccs net zero report also identified that at least one of the uks ccus regional clusters should involve substantial production of lowcarbon hydrogen by 2030 to stay on track for net zero it also recommends that infrastructure development for ccus should start as early as possible in all regional clusters with large industrial emissions the recently published h21 north of england study has also shown that up to 37 million homes as well as other industrial processes could be converted from natural gas to hydrogen to meet the uks climate change targets about drax drax
