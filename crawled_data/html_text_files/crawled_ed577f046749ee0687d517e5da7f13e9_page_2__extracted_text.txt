drax power station standing together against climate change will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 27 january 2021 opinion tackling climate change requires global collaboration as a ukus sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated collaborative energy system the technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions such as the us south where our american communities operate carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help drax to be carbon negative by 2030  an ambition i announced at cop25  just over a year ago in madrid will gardiner announcing draxs carbon negative ambition at cop25 in madrid december 2019 our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but are also a vital economic force as the world begins to recover from the effects of covid19 engineer inside the turbine hall of drax power station we all want the uks recovery to be a green recovery  one which benefits the north along with the whole of the country government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station  for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south  we are also partnered with 11 other organisations in the uks humber region to develop a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200000 jobs around the uk in 2039 the expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for ccus and biomass sustainability  clear longterm policies are essential here not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment these are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact co 2 emissions and lives of people engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station at drax we directly employ almost 3000 people in the us and uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cuttingedge carbon capture and removal technology we can then share our expertise with the united states and the rest of the world  a world

capture tags economic impact  drax power station  investors  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  stem science technology engineering and mathematics the uk needs negative emissions from beccs to reach net zero  heres why 7 april 2020 carbon capture reaching the uks target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 means every aspect of the economy from shops to super computers must reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate agreement beccs has the potential to play a vital role in power generation creating a hydrogen economy and offsetting other emissions as it continues to progress it is becoming increasingly effective

business different people do things different ways says sam stocks an apprentice engineer at drax power station its a sentiment echoed by corporate administration apprentice chloe carpenter at opus energy asked to describe her role she says its a very different kind of job chloe and sam are just two of a number of apprentices at drax group who are working across the uk and while theyre proud to do things differently they do have something in common  theyre all handson practical people who would rather get stuck in on a project than sit still and hear about it in the classroom i chose an apprenticeship over higher education because im more of a doing person says molly fensome a corporate administration apprentice sam agrees i like to be handson he says i dont like being sat in a classroom they are doing things their way  engineering their own futures while growing personally and professionally and ensuring the future of our energy supply in the process finding a strong sense of identity for sam working at drax wasnt just a sensible career move it was also following in his familys footsteps my grandad worked in the power station industry all his life my family know exactly what im like and they knew what type of place this was to work draxs transformation from a coalpowered plant to a modern sustainable electricity company means sams work is building a power framework for future generations while also paying homage to his grandads career jake dawson an electrical engineer apprentice followed a similar path into the power industry being born and bred in the area drax power station has always been a part of his geography because im such a local lad it was perfect for me he says in his role jake can play a key part in the region where he grew up a recent oxford economics report shows that drax contributes 431 million to yorkshire and the humber economy and supports over 3200 jobs a role in a team drax is a large organisation but for chloe finding role models within her team she can look up to and take guidance from has been easy mentoring sessions are relaxed and you build a special bond with that person she says you can talk to them about work outside of work  anything theyll always be there for you corporate administration apprentice matt donnelly has had a similar experience adding that hes seen his confidence grow and feels he has made lifelong friends in his role ultimately its not just that they are given the right support but that apprentices are integrated as a part of the company from day one my favourite part of my apprenticeship so far is being part of the team says chloe because you feel like youre not just an apprentice but youre also one of them  being part of something bigger sam remembers his first day at drax power station it was overwhelming you dont actually realise how big it is and realise how many people work here its just normal now if i go anywhere else im thinking thats not as big as at work its not just its size that makes the uks biggest single site renewable power station stand out but the potential for career development there its this that jake had on his mind when he first made the decision to become an apprentice he was working in an unskilled job with little opportunity but he knew he had it in him to find something bigger his outlook today as a drax apprentice is very different my aim after the four years is to carry on growing as a person increasing all my skills that i have and maybe eventually becoming a supervisor or an engineer who knows this mindset of striving for better is evident across apprentices its what drove them to join the programme in the first place instead of going somewhere like uni and then possibly coming out without a job youve got a job and youre actually learning as youre doing it says sam the skill set that ive learnt now  ill probably go anywhere in the world with it find out more about apprenticeships at drax tags drax power station
