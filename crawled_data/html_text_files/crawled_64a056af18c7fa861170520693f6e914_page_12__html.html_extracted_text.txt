Schoolchildren rise to Drax’s recycled robots challenge
21 February 2022
Press releases

The Visitor Centre Team at Drax Power Station has developed the STEM box project, an engaging activity for students to take part in relating to the subject areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths.
Students aged between seven and eleven at Camblesforth Community Primary Academy and Selby Community Primary School, were provided with individual activity boxes containing a range of learning materials, games and resources they will need to build their robots, the focus of which is on recycling and forms part of their school curriculum.
The robots are made from recyclable materials that can be found around the house such as bottles, tin cans and cardboard and have been designed to carry out recycling tasks such as having magnetic hands to pick up metal, or built-in compartments to store paper.
To launch the project, students received a presentation from visitor centre guides on recycling and the role everyone plays ensuring the correct waste items enter recycling schemes.
Drax Director of Sustainability, Alan Knight, said:
“By providing schools with these resources we hope to further students’ understanding of the importance of recycling and hopefully fire up their imaginations and inspire them to study STEM subjects by showing them the wide range of career options that are available.”

Camblesforth Community Primary Academy teacher Georgia Wynn said:
“The students had a great time taking part in the STEM box programme, learning about Drax, and building the recycling robots. Activities like these are so important as it really brings the subject to life and encourages students to start thinking about careers they might enjoy in the future.”
Selby Community Primary School teacher Louisa Currie said:
“Creating their amazing robots really sparked the children’s enthusiasm for STEM and drew their focus to the importance of recycling. We look forward to continuing to work with Drax on projects such as this.”
Drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the next generation of engineers by encouraging interest in STEM subjects. The renewable energy company offers a number of other initiatives to support STEM education and skills including

North American sustainable biomass pellet producers Pinnacle and Drax Biomass rebrand to Drax
9 February 2022
Press releases

Drax Group acquired Pinnacle, which has operations across British Columbia and Alberta in Canada and Alabama in the US, last year. Drax’s existing operations in the US South were known as Drax Biomass.
Drax Group has 17 pellet plants and developments in the US and Canada, which use byproducts from sustainably managed working forests, such as sawmill and forestry residues, for pellet feedstock. The pellets are used at Drax Power Station in England to generate renewable electricity for millions of UK homes and businesses or are sold to customers in Europe and Asia seeking to decarbonise their power sectors to meet their climate commitments.
Staff at the Drax Meadowbank site
Drax is also developing a pioneering negative emissions technology – bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) which permanently removes millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The world’s leading climate scientists at the UN’s IPCC say BECCS is critical to addressing the climate emergency.
Matt White, Executive Vice President, Pellet Operations
Drax’s Executive Vice President of Pellet Operations Matt White said:
“Last year’s acquisition of Pinnacle advanced Drax’s strategy to increase sustainable biomass production capacity and reduce costs, creating the world’s leading biomass generation and supply business that is well placed to play a critical role in helping countries to meet net zero.
“We have made good progress integrating Pinnacle and this rebrand will provide a firm foundation for the business to meet the expected growth in global demand for sustainable biomass and our negative emissions technology BECCS.”
Drax plans to increase its annual pellet production capacity to 8 million tonnes by 2030 from around 4 million tonnes currently and is doubling global pellet sales to 4Mt by 2030 to meet an expected increase in global demand for the low-carbon fuel.
Drax is the UK’s largest source of renewable power by output, and the UK’s largest supplier of renewable electricity to businesses. The conversion of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal was Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and reduced the company’s generation emissions by over 90% in under a decade.

Editor’s Notes
Drax’s compressed wood pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests.
In 2020, around 43% of the material used to produce the pellets used to generate renewable power at Drax Power Station in the UK came from sawmill residues (sawdust and other byproducts).
The rest came from low-grade forestry residuals and byproducts such as treetops, limbs and misshapen and diseased trees not suitable for other use and thinnings – small trees removed to maximise the growth of the forest.
Drax is rebranding the pellet mills it fully owns and is working with joint-venture partners at the six pellet mills it has interests in to ensure they are also branded appropriately.
Drax has interests in Canadian plants in Houston, Smithers, High Level and Lavington and US plants Aliceville and Demopolis in Alabama.

Drax celebrates National Apprenticeship Week with masterclass for students and teachers
1 February 2022
Press releases

Drax is partnering with local schools during National Apprenticeship Week (7
th
-11
th
February) as part of its commitment to helping young people kickstart their careers.
The energy company is offering interactive sessions for students and teachers in years 11-13 to raise awareness of the apprenticeships that Drax and other businesses have to offer.
The sessions will include an overview of everything related to apprenticeships and the opportunities that are available, tips for the application process and a Q&A session with some of Drax’s own apprentices. Students will also receive a writing guide to help them develop or polish up their CVs.
Karen McKeever, Drax’s Chief HR Officer, said: “National Apprenticeship Week is a great opportunity to demonstrate the value of apprenticeships and highlight them as a potential career pathway.
This year’s theme for National Apprenticeship Week of ‘Build the Future’ is especially important to Drax as we strive to equip our region’s workforce with the education and skills needed to work on climate-saving technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture (BECCS).”
Sarah Mulholland, Head of Policy at the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said: “Net zero has the potential to unlock massive economic benefits across the north, particularly in the Humber – but we can only unlock that opportunity through investment in skills.
Businesses like Drax are leading the charge in this area and this initiative will help create a pipeline of workers for green jobs such as in BECCS and other new technologies.
Ultimately, levelling up boils down to creating well-paid jobs across all northern towns and cities, while giving local people the education, skills and transport they need to reach those jobs.”
Last year, Drax announced its Mobilising a Million initiative, which aims to increase social mobility by creating opportunities to support education and improve employability, ensuring the country has the skilled workforce needed to support a post-covid, green economic recovery.
These workshops build on this campaign by encouraging young people to consider the career options available to them, answer any questions they may have and give them the opportunity to hear first-hand from current apprentices.
The ‘
Apprenticeships at Drax: What You Need to Know’
sessions will take place on Wednesday 9
th
February. Teachers and students can register to take part
online
.
Drax’s long-running apprenticeship scheme is part of its commitment to developing new talent as well as upskilling the workforce across the region. Drax has 52 apprentices as well as 50 existing employees working towards apprenticeship qualifications within the business.
Drax also recently transferred some of its
apprenticeship levy
to allow smaller local businesses to hire apprentices as part of its commitment to supporting the communities near to its operations.

Drax partners with local businesses to increase career opportunities for young people
18 January 2022
Press releases

Renewable energy company Drax has partnered with businesses local to its operations to help them hire new talent as part of the company’s commitment to supporting education and upskilling.
To help smaller businesses take on apprentices and increase opportunities for young people, Drax has transferred a proportion of its apprenticeship levy to two smaller businesses, construction and equipment company The Bennie Group, based in Northampton, and Hull based EN: Able Futures CIC, which connects young people with apprenticeship opportunities in the construction sector.
Karen McKeever, Drax’s Chief HR Officer, said: “Drax is committed to championing and supporting people in their early careers. Hiring and developing a talented workforce of the future is essential for businesses like ours and we’re pleased to be able to support companies with similar values to us, as well as helping young people in the areas local to our operations to kickstart their careers. We hope this will be a great opportunity for both the company and the apprentices starting out in the industry.”
Matthew Ayres, Group MD of The Bennie Group said: “We are thrilled to have partnered with Drax to deliver two new apprenticeship roles within our equipment solutions business, Bennie Equipment. We would like to thank Drax for their support, which has enabled us to take on additional apprentices and further spread the net of opportunity for these young people.
“We are proud to share the same passion in supporting the next young generation of UK workers in learning a trade, developing practical skills, and kick-starting a career. We are both focused on boosting highly skilled workers across the UK and inspiring the next generation of the UK workforce.”
Keith Holiday, age 19 and Harvey Dobson, age 16 from Hull have started Civil Engineering apprenticeships at Alan Wood & Partners, facilitated by EN: Able Futures as a result of the levy transfer.
Keith said: “My apprenticeship is going really well. At Alan Wood & Partners I’ve been involved in a variety of projects already and I’m learning something new every day. I’ve always been interested in design and I think this apprenticeship will open up a lot of different options for me.”
Julie Deeley, Director of Operations at EN:Able Futures said: “It’s fantastic that Drax has shared its apprenticeship levy with EN:Able Futures, without it Keith and Harvey would not have been able to start their apprenticeships which could have meant them following a completely different career path, one which they may not have enjoyed as much as they are enjoying working at Alan Wood & Partners.
“Nationally the number of apprenticeship starts are falling and EN:Able Futures is working hard to create as many new apprenticeships in construction, housing and civil engineering as possible, helping to generate new career opportunities that help people achieve their aspirations.”
Drax’s long-running apprenticeship scheme is part of its commitment to developing new talent as well as upskilling the workforce across the region. Drax has 52 apprentices as well as 50 existing employees working towards apprenticeship qualifications within the business.

Employees at Britain’s biggest renewable power station have donated over £10,000 to the charity Shelter, which aims to end homelessness and poor housing in Britain.
Drax’s Christmas parties did not go ahead this year, in order to reduce Covid risks, and instead employees were offered a festive hamper or to donate the equivalent value to the charity Shelter.
As a result of the generosity of employees, Drax raised more than £10,000 for the charity, which provides support to thousands of people in the UK who face homelessness and unsafe housing.
Alan Knight, Drax’s Director of Sustainability, said: “I hope the generosity of Drax’s employees will help Shelter to deliver the vital services to those most in need of safe housing this winter.
“Drax has a long history of supporting charities and it is important that we continue to do so especially at the moment, as their ability to fundraise and provide services to vulnerable people has been impacted by the pandemic.”
Drax is committed to supporting the communities local to its operations. It has invested more than £840,000 to support its customers and local communities since the start of the Covid-19 crisis.

Potential solution to unlock investment in climate-critical storage technologies
10 January 2022
Press releases

With no new long-duration energy storage projects built in the UK since the 1980s, enough wind power to supply more than a million homes was wasted in 2020 as excess renewable power could not be stored anywhere.
New report identifies suitable revenue stabilisation mechanism to help unlock private investment in new generation of storage technologies to help stabilise the power grid and enable more renewables to come online – cutting costs and reducing emissions.
Drax plans to build UK’s first new pumped storage hydro plant in a generation at its iconic Cruachan facility in Scotland, helping the country meet its climate targets whilst supporting hundreds of jobs.
A new report by KPMG, commissioned by Drax Group, has looked at different revenue stabilisation mechanisms which could be deployed to unlock private investment in these vital storage technologies.
No new long duration storage infrastructure, such as pumped hydro storage power stations, have been built in the UK for more than 30 years. However, KPMG’s analysis has found that an existing mechanism could be part of the solution to attract a wave of new investment in large-scale electricity storage infrastructure projects.
Possible solutions were assessed through a rigorous framework to find which stabilisation regime would not only incentivise investment but would also address system needs and provide best value for money for consumers.
The report found that a cap and floor mechanism, like the regime used to incentivise investment in cross-border interconnectors, is the standout solution to overcome the hurdles currently blocking investment in long duration storage technologies.
This model would reduce risks for investors while at the same time encouraging operators of the new storage facilities to respond to system needs, helping the Electricity System Operator to maintain secure supplies on an increasingly volatile grid.
Penny Small, Drax Group Generation Director, said:
“The UK has decarbonised its electricity system at a faster rate than any other country as a result of the successful deployment of renewables including wind, solar, hydro and sustainable biomass.
“With more long-duration storage, the system would operate more effectively in terms of reducing emissions, cutting costs and maintaining secure supplies. This report sets out a clear pathway to unlock private investment in a new generation of pumped hydro power stations in the UK, and which also gives value for money for consumers.
“Innovative technologies like pumped storage hydro are key to achieving the UK’s net zero target, because they help stop excess renewable power from wind farms going to waste by storing it and making it available at lightning speed when the country needs it.”
Cruachan Power Station
Drax is moving forward with ambitious plans to build a new underground pumped storage hydro plant at its existing Cruachan facility in Argyll, Scotland. The new 600MW station would be built within a new, hollowed-out cavern that would be large enough to fit Big Ben on its side.
Supporting around 900 jobs during its construction, the new facility would bring the site’s total generating capacity to 1.04GW – enough to power more than a million homes – capacity which could be available by 2030 with a suitable investment framework.
Developments such as Cruachan 2 are critical to realising the UK’s climate targets. In 2020 enough wind power to supply a million homes went to waste in the UK because there wasn’t enough capacity to store this excess renewable power.
There are many prospective long duration energy storage projects in the UK, but none have shovels in the ground as businesses require more certainty from the government before giving the green light to development.

Editor’s Notes
An executive summary of the KPMG report can be found
here
on the Drax website.
The report considered external factors such as the UK’s target to significantly expand offshore wind power to 40GW by 2030 and the rise in power demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps through to 2050.
Four investment mechanisms were examined: Contracts for Difference, Regulated Asset Base model, Cap and Floor regime and a reformed Capacity Market.
A Cap and Floor regime was found to be the optimal solution against an 11-area assessment framework.
The same support regime has been transformational in unlocking private investment in cross-border interconnectors since its launch in 2014. This is because investors can see the project’s annual maximum and minimum revenues over a 25-year period, which reduces risks.
Nine interconnector projects with a combined flow capacity of 10.5GW have been awarded agreements during the first two application windows, securing enough capacity to keep the lights on for around 29 million homes if all projects are developed.
Separate independent
analysis
by Lane, Clark and Peacock (LCP) found the UK curtailed 3.6TWh of wind power in 2020, enough renewable electricity to supply around a million homes.
Despite their benefits to the grid, attracting private investment in long duration storage technologies has been difficult due to their build times often being longer than the timeframes offered by existing mechanisms designed to incentivise investment in energy infrastructure projects, such as the Capacity Market.

Greenest Christmas: fossil fuels fall to all-time low on Britain’s power grid
30 December 2021
Press releases

Just before midnight yesterday (Wednesday), fossil fuels generated 1.7 GW of electricity – just 6% of the power on Britain’s electricity grid at the time.
Instead of coal and gas supplying most of the country’s electricity like in years gone by, renewable sources such as biomass, wind and hydro were keeping Britain’s lights on.
Renewables generated 24.19 GW – 65% of the country’s entire electricity needs – while fossil fuels were at a new record low.
Power from renewables at 23:45, 29 December 2021:
Biomass – 2.34 GW (8.27%)
Hydro – 0.3 GW (1.05%)
Solar – 0 GW (0%)
Wind – 15.62 GW (55.32%)
The new record is a further example of the renewables revolution that has transformed Britain’s power grid in recent years.  A decade ago, at the same time on 30 December 2011, fossil fuels generated 18.78 GW, totalling 58.79% of the country’s power needs.
The carbon intensity of the power system fell to just 125g/KWh during the seven days from Christmas Eve – almost 75% lower than a decade earlier when in 2012 the carbon intensity over the same period was 464g/KWh.
A
report
by Drax Electric Insights last year found that the UK had decarbonised its power grid over the previous decade faster than any other major economy.
