drax power station staff is vital to the work we do to help thousands of people affected by cancer and their families across yorkshire very year congratulations to all the runners and thanks also to everyone who baked and bought cakes during the coffee morning i hope all the runners treated themselves to an extra large slice of cake afterwards  they certainly earned it drax group ceo will gardiner who participated in the 5k run said congratulations to all the staff involved today  it was great to see such a fantastic turn out for a worthy cause the run has been such a success we hope to make it an annual event drax power ceo andy koss who completed the 10k course added the run was a lot of fun  the run up barlow mound was a little challenging but worth it for the views from the top the work of macmillan in supporting cancer patients and their families is vital  most of us have been affected by cancer at some point in our lives so perhaps its no surprise that so many of our staff got involved and showed their support the runners and bakers were brilliant  but the team which organised the event was also fantastic well done all ends media contacts ali lewis drax group
