of drax reports energy and climate policy forests and biomass transport contact us building a sustainable business the boundaries between users suppliers and generators are blurring writes ceo will gardiner will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 21 march 2018 opinion the uk energy sector is changing rapidly the boundaries between users suppliers and generators are blurring as energy users are choosing to generate their own energy and are managing their energy use more proactively while conversely generators are increasingly seeing users as potential sources of generation and providers of demand management the uk is undergoing an unprecedented energy revolution with electricity at its heart  a transition to a lowcarbon society requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy in that context our groups purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future this means that sustainability in its broadest sense must be at the very core of what we do successful delivery of our purpose depends on all our people across all our businesses doing the right thing every day with the right products and services we can go even further and help our customers make the right sustainable energy choices as our businesses transform and we embrace a larger customer base different generation technologies and operate internationally the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and becoming more complex at the same time the range of stakeholders looking to drax for responsible leadership on sustainability is increasing the need for transparency is greater than ever so our websites sustainability section provides a comprehensive insight into the groups environmental social and governance management and performance during 2017 some of the highlights include carbon reduction  i am pleased that in 2017 the proportion of our energy generation from renewable sources remained high 65 of our generation during the year came from sustainable biomass and accounted for 15 of the countrys overall renewable generation we maintained our rigorous and robust approach to ensure that we only ever use biomass that is sustainably produced and legally sourced people  another key achievement was the roll out of our people strategy to 2020  one drax  which focuses on talent to deliver on our strategic and operational objectives safety  the health and safety of all our employees and contractors is of paramount importance to drax while the groups safety incident rate remained on target in 2017 the fire at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did cause an outage with disruption lasting into 2018 it highlighted once again that the risks of generating using biomass must be mitigated through robust safety procedures and a riskbased plant investment and maintenance programme safety therefore remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are determined to do even better customers  our business to business b2b energy supply business received recognition for their dedication to customer service opus energy won utilities provider of the year at the british small business awards 2017 we initiated a process which would allow us to participate in the united nations global compact ungc we are committed to the initiative and its ten principles which align with our culture of doing the right thing our websites sustainability section also sets out our commitment to achieving the united nations sustainable development goals through our operations the services we deliver to our customers and in partnership with others global ambitions and goals are important but so too are our ambitions for our local and regional communities as such we have played a key role in the uk northern powerhouse partnership  initiatives such as powerful women and a comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement  sustainability in its broadest sense must be at the very core of what we do finally i do not believe any organisation however well intentioned can get its commitment to sustainability perfect on its own and i am very keen for drax to learn from people reading our websites sustainability section  it sets out what we see as our achievements and aspects in which we believe we need to do better i would like to invite any stakeholder with an
