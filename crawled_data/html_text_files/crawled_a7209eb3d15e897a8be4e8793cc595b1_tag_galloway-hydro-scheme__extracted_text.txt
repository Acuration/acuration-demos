river dee in southwest scotland flows from its source in loch dee through the galloway hills firstly to clatteringshaws loch then into loch ken where it joins the water of ken as in much of scotland salmon populations here have struggled with rod catches at an alltime low climate change leading to warmer rivers and seas commercial farming and changes in food supply have all been blamed flyfishing on the river tweed with the iconic kelso bridge at the background kelso scottish borders scotland in 2019 drax group pledged 100000 over four years to support community initiatives in the galloway glens region as part of its efforts to support those living in the areas in which it operates one of these projects is the blackwater of dee restoration project which aims to boost salmon stocks by moving natural river sediments past large impoundments such as dams  the first time in scotland that targeted support has been provided to recreate the natural movement of aggregate along the length of the river the project is situated downstream of clatteringshaw dam which facilitates electricity generation at draxs galloway hydroelectric scheme  clatteringshaw dam human beings have always had an extensive relationship with rivers for thousands of years they have provided food hydration and highways ancient people worshipped rivers the word dee is derived from the word deva one of the oldest written words in the english language dating back to 150ad a celtic word for goddess as civilisations developed rivers became sources of wealth rivers  like coal  powered the industrial revolution with watermills driving many forms of industry the harnessing of the blackwater of dee as a power source in the 1930s was a major feat of human ingenuity which provided power for the country as part of this project galloway fisheries trust has been training an army of volunteers to look after the dee these volunteers collect data on the river habitats the fish and invertebrate populations they have planted native trees and removed nonnative invasive plant species it is hoped that the project will signal a genuine kickstart to rebuilding scotlands salmon population in the long term drax is proud to support the galloway glens scheme in the effort to restore salmon stocks says stuart ferns draxs galloway hydro scheme operations manager ferns noted the initiative also provides innovative and exciting learning opportunities for young people across the south of scotland mcnabb laurie galloway glens team leader believes the scheme is a great example of the private sector working with the notforprofit sector this is the first project of this type in scotland another first for galloway we need to pursue every avenue we can to support salmon and other species in

hydro scheme how riverpowered hydro schemes work 21 february 2020 power generation hydro power is one of the most widespread sources of electricity generation in the world  it is also one of the biggest nine of the worlds ten largest power stations are hydro powered  facilities such as the three gorges dam on chinas yangtze river and the itaipu dam pictured below on the brazilparaguay border are capable of generating massive amounts of electricity  itaipu dam hydroelectric power station on the brazilparaguay border but hydropower can also be very effective at a smaller more local level using relatively small rivers these smaller hydro facilities can bring renewable electricity to remote areas and serve local needs all they need is an abundance of flowing water to spin their turbines in scotland two schemes are making use of the countrys plentiful water sources to help the local community the economy and the surrounding environment turning river waterflow into power the lanark and galloway hydropower schemes are both located in rural scotland and have been generating power for nearly a century despite being more than 95 kilometres apart they operate in very similar ways lanark which includes two power stations  bonnington with a capacity of 11 mw and stonebyres with a capacity of 6 mw sits on the river clyde and began generating power in 1926 making it one of the oldest hydroelectric plants in great britain galloway soon followed coming online in the mid1930s it includes a total of six power stations  glenlee tongland kendoon drumjohn earlstoun and carsfad  eight dams and a network of tunnels and pipelines giving it a capacity of 109 mw kendoon power station turbine hall there was always potential for hydro in the galloway hills but there wasnt demand for 100 mw of power explains stuart ferns operations and maintenance manager on the lanark and galloway hydro schemes however when the national grid was established in the 1920s it enabled surplus power to be transmitted beyond the local area to glasgow and further afield unlike lanark which is situated about halfway down the river clyde the galloway scheme spans the entirety of its river system from loch doon in the north to tongland in the south both however cover a similarly sized catchment area of roughly 1000 square kilometres where they do differ is in the type of hydropower they generate and the needs they serve for their regions and the wider electricity grid tongland dam lanarks power stations generate electricity through whats called runoftheriver hydropower which describes a scheme where there is no dam to stop and store water along the river instead water from a flowing river is diverted into a power station situated alongside the river here the water is used to spin a turbine connected to a generator before being returned back to the river lanarks two power stations are both positioned alongside naturally occurring waterfalls which allow them to take advantage of the natural gravitational pressure the lanark stations run constantly says om manager stuart ferns they will run as long as there is water in the river and generally there is always some water available the galloway system is different it only generates power when there are peaks in electricity demand to do this it operates a conventional storage hydro scheme where dams situated along the river are used to create small reservoirs when demand for electricity peaks  typically between 5pm and 7pm  water is released from these reservoirs and used to spin turbines and generate electricity during the day both schemes are monitored and controlled from glenlee power station halfway down the galloway route as night falls responsibility instead falls to the control room at cruachan power station  more than 200 kilometres away aroundtheclock monitoring in this way is important as the uncertainty of scotlands weather can have effects on the schemes and on their surrounding environment penstocks leading to glenlee power station working with the landscape dumfries  galloway and lanarkshire are regions defined and dominated by their river systems as such extreme weather can lead to occasional natural flooding the lanark and galloway schemes not only have to be diligent in working with extreme weather but they can actually play a role in monitoring and managing it the galloway reservoirs help to alleviate flooding because they can store water and help to alleviate flooding downstream says ferns staff at the scheme work closely with local authorities landowners and the scottish environment protection agency sepa sharing their weather forecasting and reservoir level data to help them predict which areas will be affected and when roads might need to be closed or even villages evacuated the team takes a similar approach to monitoring and protecting the local wildlife fish such as north atlantic salmon and trout migrate upstream from the ocean through the galloway rivers using manmade fish passes also known as fish ladders which allow fish to bypass dams along the scheme waterfalls on the clyde at lanark lanarks natural waterfalls mean it is not a route taken by migratory fish however ensuring there is always enough water in the rivers to protect fish and plant life factors into how both schemes operate with the landscape working with the wildlife weather and surrounding environment of the two rivers have always been a part of running the lanark and galloway schemes their continued role in the regions electricity system highlights the relevancy of

hydropower 1 october 2019 power generation over the last century scottish hydro power has played a major part in the countrys energy make up while today it might trail behind wind solar and biomass as a source of renewable electricity in great britain it played a vital role in connecting vast swathes of rural scotland to the power grid  some of which had no electricity as late as the 1960s and all by making use of two plentiful scottish resources water and mountains but the road to hydro adoption has been varied and difficult travelled on by brave deathdefying construction workers ingenious engineers and the inspirational leadership of a scottish politician to trace where the history of scottish hydropower began we need to go back to the end of the 19 th century and to the banks of loch ness loch ness scottish highlands from abbeys to aluminium it was on the shores of loch ness that one of the first known hydroelectric schemes was built at the fort augustus benedictine abbey the scheme provided power to the monks living there as well as 800 village residents  though legend has it that their lights went dim every time the monks played their organ however it was the british aluminium company formed in 1894 that first realised the huge potential of scotlands steep mountains lochs and reliably heavy rainfall to generate substantial amounts of hydro power in need of a reliable source of electricity to help turn raw bauxite into aluminium the firm established a hydroelectric plant and smelting works at foyers and loch ness several similar schemes to support the aluminium industry soon appeared around the country but it took another 20 years for the first major hydropower project to supply electricity to the public to emerge in 1926 the clyde valley electrical power co opened the lanark hydro electric scheme  which used energy from the river clydes flow to create power now owned by drax it still has a generation capacity of 17 mw  enough to supply more than 15000 homes  river clyde lanark it was quickly followed by power stations at rannoch and tummel in the grampian mountains and in 1935 by what became a highly influential scheme in the history of scottish hydro power at galloway drawing enough energy from local rivers to support five generating power stations the project was the largest runoftheriver scheme ever created architecturally it also set the tone for later projects with stylised dams and modernist turbine halls a fairer share of power for the highlands the galloway scheme supplied energy to a wide area too including parts of the central highlands scottish labour mp tom johnston a staunch socialist and scottish patriot saw how this new power source could provide massive benefits to northern communities in the early 1940s only an estimated one in six scottish farms and one in a hundred small land crofts had electricity in 1941 johnston became scotlands minister for state with a vision as he put it to create largescale reforms that might mean scotia resurgent expanding hydro power was a priority tom johnston mp two years later he formed the north of scotland hydroelectric board nsheb its aim was to create several new schemes including at tummel and loch sloy that would supply the national grid and bring electricity to more rural scottish areas the projects were met with fierce opposition from landowners and local pressure groups who feared new dams and power stations would ruin the countryside and bring unwelcome industrialisation public enquiries followed but the boards promises that the developments would be sensitive to the environment and bring cheap electricity in areas such as the isle of skye and loch ewe eventually won the day thousands of local men as well as german and italian former prisoners of war  were drafted in to work on the projects among the most courageous were workers known as tunnel tigers who blasted away rock using handheld drills and gelignite to create water channels and underground chambers including at draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro station  deaths caused by everything from blast injuries to fires were common the men also had to cope with incessant rain and cold and were housed in bleak militarystyle camps with little to do in their spare time besides drink fights would break out regularly but the financial rewards were enormous with wages up to ten times higher than labourers employed on highland estates could expect glenlee penstocks the future takes shape the boards first small projects were completed in 1948 at morar and nostie bridge supplying electricity to areas including parts of wester ross catherine mackenzie a local widow performed the morar opening ceremony reportedly declaring let light and power come to the crofts bigger schemes were plagued by problems conveyor belts had to be built to transport stone across 175 miles of moor during construction at sloy for instance and there were frequent stone and timber shortages but sloy eventually opened in 1950 the largest conventional hydro electrical power station in great britain with an installed capacity of 128 mw it would be followed by major schemes at glen affric and loch shin by the mid sixties the board had built 54 main power stations and 78 dams northern scotland was now 90 connected to the national grid hydro board shops began popping up on high streets selling appliances and collecting bill payments tom johnston died in 1965 aged 83 the provost of inverness declared no words can say how grateful we are loch awe beside cruachan power station that same year the worlds then largest reversible pumped storage power station opened at cruachan during times of low electricity demand its turbines pump water from loch awe to the reservoir above when demand rises the turbines reverse and water flows down to generate power a similar scheme opened at foyes in 1974 glendoe near loch ness was the mostrecent major hydro scheme to be built opening in 2009 it has a generation capacity of 100 mw there are plans for a pumped storage scheme at coire glas  with a storage capacity of 30 gwh  more than doubling great britains current total pumped storage capacity draxs cruachan power station could also be expanded in recent years however the real growth has been in smaller hydroelectric schemes that may power just one or a handful of properties  with more than 100 mw of such generation capacity installed in the highlands since 2006 boosting the environment and economy scotland now provides 85 of great britains hydroelectric resource with a total generation capacity of 1500 mw improved power supplies have attracted more industry to the highlands without seriously altering its character and access roads created during

world 10 april 2019 power generation if the spectacular roman aqueducts that still dot the landscape of europe tell us anything its that hydraulic engineering is nothing new for thousands of years water power has been used to grind wheat saw wood and even tell the time  craigside in northumberland by the 19th century water was able to go beyond performing rudimentary mechanical tasks and generate electricity directly cragside in northumberland england became the first house powered entirely by hydroelectricity in 1878 by 1881 the whole town of niagara falls on the uscanada border was being powered by the force of its eponymous river and waterfall hydropower has many advantages its predictable consistent often zero or low carbon and it can provide a range of ancillary services to power transmission systems in great britain there is 17 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower and another 28 gw of pumped hydro storage capacity but it remains a small part of the overall electricity mix in the fourth quarter of 2018 the 65 of british hydropower that is connected to the national grid accounted for less than one per cent electricity generation or 545600 megawatt hours mwh by contrast wind accounted for 14 of total generation that quarter almost 95 million mwh while hydropower projects can be expensive to construct operational and maintenance costs are relatively low and they can run for an extremely long time  the lanark hydro electric scheme in scotland which drax recently acquired  has been producing power since 1927 today hydropower installations are found at all scales all around the world but the term hydropower covers many different types of facility these are some of the ways water is used to generate electricity impoundment power plants the simplest and most recognisable form of hydropower impoundment facilities work by creating a reservoir of trapped water behind a dam that is then selectively released the water flows through a turbine spinning it which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity from the hoover dam on the nevadaarizona border to the three gorges dam in china  the worlds largest power station of any type with a generating capacity of 225 gw  impoundment dams are some of the most iconic structures in modern engineering three gorges dam china as well as having the potential to provide large quantities of baseload power they can react extremely quickly to grid demands  just by opening or closing their floodgates as the power system operator requires runofriver generation rather than storing and releasing power from behind a dam runoftheriver generators channel off part of a river and use its natural flow to generate power tongland power station galloway hydro scheme because it doesnt require large dams or reservoirs runofriver can be less environmentally disruptive as there is not always a need for large scale construction and flooding is less common stonebyres power station lanark hydro scheme while runofriver facilities tend to be smaller and less flexible than impoundment they still have significant generating potential  the jirau hydroelectric power plant on the madeira river in brazil has a generating capacity of 37 gw pumped storage water can also be good for storing energy that can then be converted to electricity pumped hydro storage facilities operate by pumping water uphill to a reservoir when electricity is cheap or plentiful then letting it flow back downhill through tunnels to a series of turbines that activate generators to generate electricity in the same way as an impoundment dam when electricity is in high demand dam and reservoir cruachan power station their ability to both produce and absorb electricity makes them a vital part of electricity networks playing the role of energy storage systems  in fact a massive 97 of all global grid storage capacity is in the form of pumped hydro their function as giant batteries will only become more important as intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar become more prevalent in the energy mix outlet and loch cruachan power station so too will their ability to ramp up generation very quickly draxs recently acquired cruachan power station in scotland can go from zero to 100 mw or more in less than 30 seconds when generation is called upon  for example when there is a sudden spike in demand tidal range generation swansea bay the sea is also an enormous source of potential hydropower tidal range generation facilities exploit the movement of water levels between and high and low tide to generate electricity tidal dams trap water in bays or estuaries at high tide creating lagoons the dam then releases the water as the rest of the tide lowers allowing it to pass through turbines generating power there are limitations  like wind and solars dependence on the wind blowing and the level of sunlight operators cant control when tides go in or out but its vast generating potential means that it could be a valuable source of baseload power if it were to be deployed more widely great britain in particular has major opportunities for tidal generation the severn estuary between england and wales has the second highest tidal range in the world 15 metres and a barrage built across the estuary could have a generating capacity of up to 86 gw  enough to meet 6 of the britains total electricity demands some environmental groups worry about the impact such projects could have on wildlife due to the level of public funding required the government rejected that plan in 2010 in favour of pursuing its nuclear policy  a second attempt at securing a governmentbacked investment contract known as a cfd  for a smaller 320 mw pathfinder project in swansea bay was also rejected in 2018 the welsh government is however supportive of the project which already has planning permission tidal stream generation rather than building a dam tidal stream generators work like underwater wind turbines sturdy propellers or hydrofoils winglike blades which oscillate up and down rather than spinning around are positioned underwater to transform the energy of tidal streams into electricity while tidal streams move far slower than wind the high density of water compared to air means that more power is generated even at much lower velocities not reliant on large physical structures tidal stream generators are a relatively cheap form of hydropower to deploy and make a much smaller impact on their environment than tidal barrages wave generation unlike tidal power which is generated by the gravitational effects of the sun and moon on the earths oceans wave power ultimately comes from the winds that whip up the oceans surface there are a number of different methods that turn waves into generation including funnelling waves into a tube floating on the surface of the water that contains electricitygenerating turbines or by using the vertical bobbing movement of a tethered buoy to pull and spin a fixed generator an electricitygenerating buoy awaiting installation in spain wave power has yet to be widely implemented but it has significant potential its estimated that the waves off the coasts of the usa could have provided 66 of the countrys electricity generation needs in 2017 alone effectively commercialising wave power could provide another vital tool in developing a sustainable energy landscape for the coming future tidal and wave power generation are less established generation technologies than their landbased cousins but they hold huge potential
