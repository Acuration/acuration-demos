billion in carbon taxes by 2040 it will also help to secure the future for the humbers traditional heavy industry and related supply chains by enabling decarbonisation and creating opportunities for growth in new technologies it could safeguard 55000 existing jobs in the region whilst creating thousands of new stem roles and developing skills apprenticeships and educational opportunities in the area the zch partnership includes associated british ports british steel centrica storage ltd drax group equinor mitsubishi power national grid ventures px group sse thermal saltend cogeneration company limited uniper and the university of sheffields advanced manufacturing research centre amrc the zch partnership has applied for funding from phase 2 of the industrial decarbonisation challenge which forms part the industrial strategy challenge fund with significant investment also coming from the companies within the zch partnership the bid builds on the humbers successful application for phase one funding which was announced in april the bids anchor project is the equinorled hydrogen to humber h2h saltend project which will establish the worlds largest hydrogen production plant with carbon capture at px groups saltend chemicals park h2h saltend will convert natural gas to hydrogen and capture the carbon dioxide co2 in the first phase this could reduce emissions by circa 900000 tonnes per year as industrial customers switch fuel to lowcarbon hydrogen and triton powers gas power plant blends hydrogen into the fuel supply via its upgraded mitsubishi turbines h2h saltend is expected to grow over time contributing to further emissions reductions from the chemicals park and across the humber a pipeline network developed by national grid ventures will link h2h saltend to energyintensive industrial sites throughout the region enabling further decarbonisation as additional businesses switch to low carbon hydrogen and capture their co2 emissions the co2 will be compressed at centrica storages easington site and stored under the southern north sea using offshore infrastructure shared with the teesside industrial cluster the bid for matched funding covers obtaining land rights development consents and frontend engineering design for h2h saltend and the onshore pipeline infrastructure for co2 and hydrogen enabling the scheme to move towards a final investment decision on construction during 2023 with h2h saltend and associated infrastructure expected to come online around 2026 at selby in north yorkshire drax power station would connect to the completed co2 pipeline network underpinning the zch scheme with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  a vital negative emissions technology that drax is pioneering and which will be essential to decarbonising the humber cluster and helping the uk achieve its legally binding 2050 net zero carbon target the pipeline network will also run via sse thermals keadby site where it is developing keadby 3 this could become the uks first gasfired power station equipped with carbon capture technology by the mid2020s providing decarbonised flexible power to compliment intermittent renewables generation and maintain security of supply the network will also run via immingham where uniper is planning to add to its european hydrogen ambitions by developing clean hydrogen production at its killingholme site in line with unipers pledge to be carbon neutral in europe by 2035 as one of the uks leading steel manufacturers and a significant local employer british steel could benefit from the zch infrastructure as part of its drive to lower emissions abp the major ports and logistics provider for the region will support the global reach of the low carbon products and chemicals produced at scunthorpe and at saltend caption idattachment_826 alignaligncenter width2009 click to viewdownload caption the zch projects are supported by the university of sheffields advanced manufacturing research centre which models the wider economic and supply chain opportunities in the uk provided by these new technologies in addition to the key sites that are part of the zch scheme there is further potential for other future projects to attract inward investment and cement the humbers reputation as the uks energy estuary and a worldleading net zero region these include integrating offshore wind power into hydrogen production decarbonising the regional gas grid supplying hydrogen transport fuelling hubs providing co2 storage services to other industrial clusters and

british steel said we have ambitious plans to invest in a range of technologies to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations with solutions that are globally recognised and acceptable to customers the development of the zch project with the proposed installation of a dual ccs and hydrogen supply pipeline will afford us the opportunity to utilise a range of techniques to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations this project complements the longterm decarbonising technology roadmap of british steel greg mckenna ceo of centrica storage said at centrica storage we own and operate the easington terminal which processes gas from the southern north sea before being injected into the national transmission system we are a partner in the zero carbon humber bid as we believe this project represents a vital opportunity for the uk to decarbonise its industrial sectors with the humber representing the largest co 2 emitting cluster in the country our business is experienced in delivering large infrastructure projects in the easington area having managed multiple thirdparty pipeline landings including the construction and operation of langeled gas receiving facility which meets 20 of the uks gas demand we look forward to supporting this project and the opportunity this provides for the uk to meet its net zero obligations by 2050 will gardiner drax ceo said advancing the zero carbon humber plan is a major opportunity to decarbonise the uks most carbonintensive industrial region  protecting jobs tackling climate change and helping this uniquely wellplaced area to deliver clean growth after covid draxs pioneering work developing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could deliver 16 million tonnes of negative emissions a year  critical for the humbers efforts to reach net zero and also positioning the uk as a world leader in a vital carbon removals technology that will be needed globally to meet climate targets beccs is the most costeffective negative emissions technology available now and uniquely  it also produces flexible renewable electricity  demand for which will grow as the economy further decarbonises al cook executive vice president and
