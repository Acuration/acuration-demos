power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station do electric vehicles actually reduce carbon emissions electric vehicles reduce air pollution but they also increase demand for electricity so just how green are they 19 august 2017 electrification electric vehicles evs are often seen as a key driver towards a greener future indeed transport accounts for roughly a quarter of the uks greenhouse gas emissions and seriously affects air quality in major cities to tackle pollution problems governments around the world are implementing ambitious policies to promote the electrification of transport and phase out ice internal combustion engine vehicles the uk and france both plan to ban the sale of petrol and dieselonly cars by 2040 while india is setting an even more ambitious end date of 2030  added to this are evs growing popularity with drivers there are now almost 110000 electric cars and vans on uk roads spurred on by lowering battery costs and a growing range of models including plugin hybrid vehicles evs now account for 2 of new registrations switching to evs is an obvious way to massively cut pollution in areas of dense traffic but the question remains  how clean are evs on the broader scale when you look at the electricity used to charge them electric vehicles are getting cleaner evs dont give off the same exhaust emissions as engines but the power in their batteries has to come from somewhere follow the flow back from the car through the charging point all the way back to the power station and its likely some of that electricity is coming from fossil fuels and that means emissions they werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell a researcher at imperial college london and author of electric insights  a study commissioned by drax that analyses electricity generation data in britain now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk evs are delivering much better results he continues in fact yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to greener electricity generation today they are twice as efficient as conventional cars take the tesla model s in the winter of 2012 producing the electricity for a full charge created 124g of carbon emissions per km driven roughly the same as a 2l range rover evoque now the carbon intensity of charging a tesla has nearly halved to 74gkm in winter and 41 gkm in summer as the uk continues to break its own renewable energy records for smaller evs the results are even better the nissan leaf and bmw i3 can now be charged for less than half the co 2 of even the cleanest nonplugin ev the toyota prius hybrid so the current outlook for evs is hugely positive  but as their numbers continue to increase will the demand they add to the grid put their clean credentials at risk will evs accelerate electricity demand the national grid suggests there could be as many as nine million evs on uk roads by 2030 which could lead to an additional 410 gw of demand on the system at peak times  this in some cases could lead to a rise in emissions electricity demand in britain typically peaks between 6pm and 10pm when people arrive home and switch on lights and appliances if you were to charge your ev between those evening hours the emissions would be 8 higher than reported in the chart above if you charged between midnight and 6am they would be 10 lower today this demand is met by the existing mix of power stations which last quarter included more than 50 renewable and lowcarbon sources  but when there are sudden spikes in demand above this typical usage the national grid must call in the help of carbonintensive reserve generators such as coalpowered stations polluting diesel generators are also on standby around the uk ready to turn on and feed into regional distribution grids at a moments notice to meet the challenge of peaktime ev charging less carbon intensive power generation storage and smart power management systems are needed these include rapid response gas power stations such as the four drax ocgts planned to come online in the early 2020s as well as gridscale batteries homebased batteries and demandside response schemes as the share of intermittent renewable capacity on the grid increases more backup power needs to be available for when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine keeping our future fuels clean a future increasingly relying on backup generators is far from inevitable especially if the use of smart technology and smart meters increases by analysing electricity costs and countrywide demand smart meters have the potential to ensure evs only charge outside peak times unless absolutely necessary when electricity is more likely to come from renewable or lowcarbon and cheaper sources if the grid continues to decarbonise through advances in renewable technologies and lowercost coaltobiomass conversions the potential of evs electricity coming with associated emissions is diminished even further there is no doubt that evs will make up a significant part in the future of our mobility that they will also play a part in the future of cleaning up that mobility is as good as assured but on this journey its imperative we keep our eyes on the road commissioned by drax electric insights is
