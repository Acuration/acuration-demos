further investment in white rose carbon capture  storage project 25 september 2015 uncategorized selby yorkshire drax today announced it remained committed to fulfilling its current work on a carbon capture  storage ccs feasibility and technology development project feed but once completed would not be investing further and will withdraw as a partner of capture power ltd the developer of the white rose ccs project the two year project is being taken forward by the capture power partnership  made up of drax alstom and boc and is looking at the potential to capture up to 90 of carbon emissions from a new coal fired power station and safely store them beneath the north sea the project is due to conclude during the next 612 months drax has also confirmed that while at that point it would cease to commit further investment it will continue to make the site owned by drax along with the infrastructure at the power plant available for the project to be built drax group operations director and capture power board director pete emery said we remain fully committed to completing what weve signed up to  the completion of a study into the feasibility and development of world leading technology that could result in dramatic reductions in carbon emissions produced by power stations and heavy industry we are confident the technology we have developed has real potential but have reluctantly taken a decision not to invest any further in the development of this project the decision is based purely on a drastically different financial and regulatory environment and we must put the interests of the business and our shareholders first we will focus our resources on the areas which we can deliver best value particularly working with government to explore the potential for converting a fourth generating unit to run on sustainable biomass drax still believes this project has great potential and we have announced that the site at the drax power plant along with our existing infrastructure remain available for the project to be built ends contacts paul hodgson head of media relations 44 1757 612 026 44 7525 590 271 email protected andrew brown director of

crafts schools at drax power station this week to brush up on their artistic abilities and creative talent the free events held over three days were run by david anderson a fellow of the royal society of arts david who is a skilled artist designer and illustrator created the activities for the three days as well as giving advice and demonstrations in drawing and painting techniques the children aged 7 to 10 learnt how to transfer their designs on to a variety of items including porcelain mugs and linen bags as well as moulding scenes from airdry clay and personalising their own apron a master class for 11 to 14 yearolds helped them learn simple yet effective drawing and painting techniques resulting in their very own watercolour masterpiece david anderson said its fantastic to see the enthusiasm imagination and creativity displayed over the three days both age groups were keen to try out different ideas and worked hard to improve their skills techniques and knowledge the summer art schools are now in their eighth year and are organised by drax to build on its art in the community scheme to encourage and develop art appreciation as part of the companys support for education

wood pellets for sustainable heating in the uk nearly a third would pay more to go green but value for money is key 24 july 2015 uncategorized new research commissioned by drax has revealed 31 of people are willing to pay nearly 10 more on average to support green energy they are clear this would be on top of the amount already paid through their energy bills to encourage the shift to lowcarbon energy sources the comres survey shows there is very little understanding of the proportion of an energy bill that goes towards green energy with the majority saying they dont know and 17 saying its more than 100 when the actual average amount on a bill was revealed to the respondents  62  a surprising number said they were prepared to pay more while the average was nearly an extra 10 one in five said theyd be willing to contribute more than an extra 20 but this willingness is conditional in return bill payers want to see renewables investment go into reliable technologies that are affordable and offer value for money the survey showed that 35 of britons ranked value for money or affordability for customers highest out of a range of options the government should prioritise including impact on the landscape impact on the local economy and ability to safeguard jobs reliability of supply had the third highest level of support with 15 ranking it in first place this research is published as the new conservative government reaffirms its commitment to going green and tackling climate change but is clearly emphasising this must be done in the most affordable way possible drax group ceo dorothy thompson said its clear a significant number of people are prepared to pay more to boost green energy in the fight to tackle climate change however its also clear they are not prepared to write a blank cheque and want guarantees that anything extra must be spent on green energy generation that is affordable and reliable at drax were leading europes largest decarbonisation

planning permission  new gas fired power station approved by government 23 july 2015 press releases hirwaun power ltd has secured consent from the department of energy  climate change for its 200m gasfired power station project near aberdare in south wales subject to raising the necessary finance it will enter commercial operation in 2019 it will operate as a peaking plant providing backup to intermittent renewable generation and create 150 construction jobs and up to 15 permanent and skilled jobs to be located on part of the hirwaun industrial estate which lies adjacent to the a465 heads of the valleys dual carriageway between swansea and abergavenny the hirwaun power project will produce up to 299 megawatts mw of electricity the equivalent of supplying 400000 homes it represents a significant investment into the local economy and will give rise to multimillion pound construction and supply chain contracts support 150 jobs over the two year construction and commissioning period and up to 15 fulltime jobs when operational amber rudd secretary of state for the department of energy  climate change granted planning permission to the hirwaun project after a 2½ year public consultation and examination process norman campbell project director at hirwaun power said securing the goverrnments approval for the project is very good news for the hirwaun team and the local economy we would expect our 200m scheme to provide a catalyst for further investment in the area importantly the project also helps to meet the governments policy objectives of security of energy supple and affordability and supports the countrys transition to a low carbon economy the input that we received from the rhondda cynon taff council and the local community during the projects public consultation process was very helpful and we will liaise closely with the council and other local interests during the projects construction and eventual operation however despite the widespread acceptance that new generation plant is required and the considerable investment we have made so far we must still secure the money to get the project built we expect to know whether or not we are successful in doing that by the middle of next year 2016 new milestone reached in biomass supply chain 9 july 2015 uncategorized a three year partnership between lloyds register rail uk manufacturer wh davis and drax has reached a significant milestone as drax takes delivery of its 200th specially designed biomass rail freight wagon the partnership which has pushed the boundaries of rail engineering and lead to the design and manufacturing of the largest ever rail freight wagons in the uk has played a major role in ongoing developments in draxs supply chain as part of its conversion to burning sustainable biomass in place of coal  a process which has seen drax transform from the uks largest emitter of co2 to europes largest decarbonisation project since entering operations in 2013 the wagons designed by lloyds register rail and manufactured by wh davis have collectively travelled over 12 million miles between the ports of tyne hull and immingham and drax over the course of these journeys they have transported around 45 million tonnes of sustainable biomass  enough to power 25 million homes with low carbon affordable and reliable renewable electricity the wagons are 30 per cent larger than any other rail freight wagon currently used in the uk and are able to carry a biomass load weighing 716 tonnes peter emery group operations director of drax group plc said this milestone demonstrates the sheer scale of our decarbonisation project as we replace coal with sustainable biomass providing a reliable and affordable source of electricity lloyds register rail and wh davis have been important partners in the development of our biomass operations the delivery of our 200th wagon marks a major stage in a process which has been a huge success both in terms of modifications to draxs supply chain and for uk engineering as a whole mark jackson managing director of w h davis said were proud of what weve achieved for drax providing uk manufactured wagons which

energy will be generated from sustainable affordable biomass haven power the specialist electricity supplier to uk businesses and part of drax group plc has signed a deal with thames water to supply their electricity requirements in a deal worth more than 500m over five years there is an option for two further fiveyear renewals which could increase the overall value of the contract to more than 15bn over 15 years haven power is the uks largest independent electricity supplier to businesses and sources its power from the drax power plant in selby yorkshire which as a result of its world leading biomass transformation is now the uks single largest supplier of renewable energy the deal will enable thames water which already sources about 20 of its electricity through selfgenerated renewables such as solar wind hydro and biogas to meet all of its electricity needs from renewables drax group chief executive dorothy thompson said im delighted that drax and haven will play such an important part in helping to deliver thames renewable objectives as the uk looks to decarbonise in an affordable and pragmatic way it is pioneering companies like thames that are leading the way thames water energy manager angus berry said our energy and carbon strategy centres around reducing costs for customers and minimising our impact on the environment this deal with haven puts downward pressure on bills and means we will now be using 100 renewable electricity we look forward to growing our relationship with haven to exploit further opportunities to minimise energy costs and emissions as well as continuing to work towards our ambitious target of selfgenerating 30 of our own electricity by 2020 drax is undergoing a major transformation programme to convert its 4gw power station  which supplies around 8 of the uks power  from coal to sustainable biomass two out of six units have now been converted and plans are advanced to modify a third unit to highbiomass later this year the estimated 12 million tonnes of carbon saved once three units are fully converted is equivalent to taking 10 of the uks total vehicle fleet off the roads and makes drax the single largest
