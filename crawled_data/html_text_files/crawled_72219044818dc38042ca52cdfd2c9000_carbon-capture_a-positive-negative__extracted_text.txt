cruachan power station visit drax power station a positive negative for decades its been accepted that generating electricity emits carbon dioxide which contributes towards climate change what if theres a way to do the exact opposite 18 january 2017 carbon capture this story was updated in june 2018 following the announcement of draxs pilot beccs project is there a way to generate electricity not only with no emissions but with negative emissions its an idea that after decades of being reliant on coal had seemed almost impossible but as drax has shown by announcing a pilot of the first bioenergy carbon capture storage beccs project of its kind in europe  it might not be impossible for much longer a few years on from the historic paris agreement  which sets a target of keeping global temperature rise below two degrees celsius  innovative solutions for reducing emissions are critical among these few are more promising than beccs it sounds like a straightforward solution  capture carbon emissions and lock them up hundreds of metres underground or turn the carbon into useful products  but the result could be gamechanging generating electricity with negative emissions capturing carbon carbon capture and storage ccs technology works by trapping the carbon dioxide co 2  emitted after a fuel source has been used and moving it to safe storage  often in depleted oil and gas reservoirs underground there are a number of ccs technologies available but one of the simplest is oxyfuel combustion fuel such as coal gas or biomass is burnt in a high oxygen environment and co 2  rather than carbon c or carbon monoxide co  is produced other impurities are removed and the resulting pure co 2 is compressed to form a liquid this co 2 can then be transported via pipeline to its designated storage space normally hundreds of metres underground the uk is wellplaced to benefit from the technology thanks to the north sea  which has enough space to store the eus carbon emissions for the next 100 years its a technology that can drastically reduce the emissions from fossil fuel use but how can it be used to produce negative emissions two technologies working as one biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured as part of its life in the forest is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases a report published by the energy technology institute eti looking at the uk has suggested that by the 2050s beccs could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year  approximately half the nations emissions target its not the only body heralding it as a necessary step for the future the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc stated in a 2014 report that keeping global warming below two degrees celsius would be difficult if beccs had limited deployment support is widespread but for it to lead to a practical future beccs needs suitable support and investment mills such as morehouse bioenergy manufacture compressed wood pellets  a sustainablysourced fuel for beccs power plants of the future positive support for negative emissions there are only a handful of ccs projects in operation or under construction across the world and many simply reuse rather than capture the co 2  part of the reason is cost its estimated that optimal ccs technology can cost about as much as the power station itself to install and running it can consume up to 20 of a stations power output this means more fuel is needed to produce the same amount of power compared to a conventional power plant of similar efficiency without government support it remains a prohibitively expensive solution for many power generators with government support in the form of multidecade contracts large ccs or beccs plants could leverage economies of scale they could deliver energy companies and their shareholders a return on the investments in the longterm drax research and development past plans by drax could have put the company on a timeline towards becoming the worlds first large scale negative emitter of co 2  it would have achieved it firstly with the construction of a ccs power station at its selby north yorkshire site the 428 mw white rose power station was to be fuelled by a mixture of coal and biomass and once in operation could have paved the way for similar facilities elsewhere as carbon capture technology improved and costs came down but unfortunately the project never went ahead  there are some positive signs that carbon capture technologies are developing around the world the first clean coal power station became operational in the us earlier this month  and a second ccs plant is on the way a ukbacked carbon capture and use ccu project in india recently opened at a chemicals factory involving the capture of emissions for use in the manufacturing process  back in the uk where the government outlined plans to end coalfired power generation by 2025  carbon capture power stations must become financially competitive if they are to become a major part of the countrys low carbon future but if the world is to achieve the targets agreed in paris and pursue a cleaner future negative emissions are a must and beccs remains a leading technology to help achieve it share related stories electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero press releases drax group ceo will
