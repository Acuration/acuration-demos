is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are vital carbon sinks absorbing around 76 million tonnes of co 2

forestry and forest management and arboriculture  sustainability carbon markets will be essential in reaching net zero  we must ensure they support high standards 9 november 2022 carbon capture angela hepworth commercial director drax in brief the voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage dacs at scale the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is developing a set of core carbon principles ccps drax support proposed principals if theyre applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals standards around additionality and the permeance of carbon removals may apply very differently to naturebased and engineered removals something that needs to be addressed explicitly theres growing recognition in governments and environmental organisations of the urgent need to develop highintegrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective parisaligned climate goals bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  and direct air carbon capture and storage  dacs  are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely the technology is proven developers are bringing forward projects and the most forwardthinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from beccs and dacs developers yet theres a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals drax is a worldleader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of highintegrity permanent co 2 removals by 2030 from its beccs projects in the uk and the us we support the development of rigorous standards for co 2 removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the co 2 removals theyre buying such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to however the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits rather than removals to create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale rethinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency core carbon principles the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is in the process of developing a set of core carbon principles ccps and assessment framework af intended to set new threshold standards for highquality carbon credits at drax we welcome and support the principals proposed by the integrity council however its crucial theyre applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals and support rather than prevent their development many ccps are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies among the most important principals include those stating removals must be robustly quantified with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity while safeguarding commercially sensitive information removal credits should be subject to robust independent thirdparty validation and verification credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits registries must be subject to appropriate governance to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability taking account of impacts on nature the climate and society there should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates or between countries bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel and that the article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldnt trigger corresponding adjustments to countries carbon inventories however as pioneers in the field we believe that two of the core carbon principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals supporting additionality and development incentives the ccps state the greenhouse gas ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional ie they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues engineered carbon removal credits such as beccs and dacs are by their nature additional they are developed for the specific purpose of removing co 2 from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere they also rely on revenue from carbon markets  largely the voluntary market at present but potentially compliance markets such as the uk and eu ets in the future however most early projects are likely to have some form of government support eg 45q in the us or contracts for difference in the uk from outside carbon credit revenues but that support isnt intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment  project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets engineered carbon removals have high upfront capital costs and its clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable additionality assessments should be riskbased if its clear that a technologytype is additional a technologylevel assessment should be sufficient this should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects compensating against nonpermanent storage on the topic of permeance that ccps state the ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent or if they have a risk of reversal any reversals shall be fully compensated a key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small  the risk of reversal for naturebased credits by contrast is much greater schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for naturebased credits are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool potentially as much as 10 are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a wellmanged geological store they also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators similarly where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with co 2 storage risk which place liabilities on storage owners operators or governments the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers at drax we believe the ccps provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals if applied pragmatically they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product theyre buying and provide a clear framework for project developers they can ensure that standards support rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as beccs and dacs which are essential to achieving our global climate goals tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  technology why and how is carbon dioxide transported 11 april 2022 carbon capture what is carbon transportation carbon transportation is the movement of carbon from one place to another in nature carbon moves through the carbon cycle  in industries like energy however carbon transportation refers to the physical transfer of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from the point of capture to the point of usage or storage why does carbon need to be transported anthropogenic manmade co 2 released in processes like power generation leads to the direct increase of co 2 in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming  however these emissions can be captured as part of carbon capture and storage ccs  the co 2 is then transported for safe and permanent storage in geological formations deep underground capturing and storing co 2 prevents it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming processes that can deliver negative emissions  such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage dacs  aim to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere through ccs in ccs carbon must be transported from the site where its captured to a site where it can be permanently stored this means it needs to travel from a power station or factory to a geological formation like a saline aquifer or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as of september 2021 there were 27 operational ccs facilities around the world with the combined capacity to capture around 40 million tonnes per annum mtpa of co 2  its estimated that the uk alone has 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space in sandstone rock formations under the north sea how is carbon transported co 2 can be transported via trucks or ships but the most common and efficient method is by pipeline moving gases of any kind through pipelines is based on pressure gases travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure compressing gas to a high pressure allows it to flow to other locations gas pipelines are common all around the world including those transporting co 2  in the us there are for instance more than 50 co 2 pipelines  covering around 6500 km and transporting approximately 68 million tonnes of co 2 a year  gas takes up less volume when its compressed and even less when it is liquefied solidified or hydrated therefore before being transported captured co 2 is often compressed and liquefied until it becomes a supercritical fluid  in a supercritical state co 2 has the density of a liquid but the viscosity thickness of a gas and is therefore easier to transport through pipelines its also 5080 less dense than water with a viscosity that is 100 times lower than liquid this means it can be loaded onto ships in greater quantities and that there is less friction when its moving through pipes and subsequently into geological storage sites how safe is it to transport carbon its no riskier to transport co 2 via pipeline or ship than it is to transport oil and natural gas  and existing oil and natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to transport co 2  to enable the safe use of co 2 pipelines ccs projects must ensure captured co 2 complies with strict purity and temperature specifications as well as making sure co 2 is dry and free from impurities that could impact pipelines operations whilst there are a growing number of ccs transport systems around the world ccs is still is a relatively new field but research is underway to identify best practises materials and technologies to optimise the process this includes research around potential risks and techniques for leak mitigation and remediation in the uk the health and safety executive regulates health safety and integrity issues for all natural gas pipelines which are covered by legislation the legislation ensures the safety of pipelines pressure systems and offshore installations and can serve as a strong foundation for co 2 transport regulation fast facts globally ccs projects have been operational since the 1980s with more than 260 million tonnes of co 2 being captured and stored over 40 years the global capacity of ccs projects in development in september 2021 was 111 million tonnes per year  this was a 48 increase compared to the end of 2020 the uks existing gas transmission network is made up of some 7660 km of highpressure gas pipelines the price of reusing offshore oil and gas pipelines to transport co 2 could be just 1 to 10 of the cost of building a new pipeline go deeper catch up on how a range of carbon capture transport and storage projects around the world are progressing here are the details of five proposed carbon capture projects in the uk read the full story of how carbon is captured transported and stored how governments can implement the policies needed to enable ccs at scale  tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  engineering  negative emissions  technology how is carbon stored 13 january 2022 carbon capture carbon storage is the process of capturing and trapping that co 2  this can occur naturally in the form of carbon sinks like forests oceans and soils that store carbon however it can also be manually carried out through technology one of the most wellestablished ways of storing carbon through the use of technology is by injecting co 2 into naturally occurring geological formations that can lock in or sequester the molecule on a permanent basis carbon storage is the final phase of the carbon capture usage and storage ccus process why do we need to store carbon global bodies like the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as well as the uks own climate change committee emphasise carbon capture and storage as crucial to achieving net zero emissions and meeting the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to within 15 o c this includes supporting forest growth through afforestation and reforestation  and other naturebased solutions to store carbon alongside ccus technology  the european commission also highlights ccuss role in balancing increased energy demand and continued fossil fuel use in the future with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent them entering the atmosphere how is carbon captured and transported to storage in naturally occurring examples forests and ocean fauna absorb carbon through photosynthesis when the vegetation eventually decomposes the carbon is sequestered into soil and seabeds carbon can also be captured from emissions sources such as factories or power plants the carbon is captured either precombustion where it is removed from the fuel source or postcombustion where it is removed from exhaust fumes in the form of co 2  the co 2 is then converted into a supercritical state where it has the viscosity of a gas but the density of a liquid meaning it can travel more easily through pipelines it can also be transported via trucks and ships but pipelines are the most efficient where can carbon be stored natural carbon sinks differ all over the world from peatlands in scotland to pacific coral reefs to the massive forests that cover countries like russia canada and brazil wooden buildings also act as carbon storage as they maintain the carbon within the wood for long time periods the co 2 captured by manmade technologies can also be stored in different types of geological formation unused natural gas reserves saline aquifers and unminable coal mines the north sea with its expansive layers of porous sandstone also offers the uk alone an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  if negative emissions technologies which actively remove emissions from the atmosphere were to capture and store the equivalent amount of co 2 as the 258 million tonnes expected to remain in the uk economy in 2050 it would take up just 036 of the available storage space years of research by the oil and gas industries mean many such geological structures have been mapped and are well understood all around the world carbon storage fast facts the international energy agency iea estimates that an accumulative 100 billion tonnes or 100 gigatonnes of co 2 must be stored by 2060 to limit global warming to a 2 o c increase globally peatland soils contain more than 600 gigatonnes of carbon  exceeding the carbon stored in all other vegetation types including the worlds forests the united states geological survey estimates the country has a mean storage potential of 3000 gigatonnes of co 2 more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years over 25 million tonnes of captured carbon was permanently stored in sites across brazil norway and the united states in 2019 how is the carbon kept in place in naturebased carbon sinks the carbon does not always remain in one location in a forest for example trees and plants will hold carbon until the end of their lifetime after which they decompose releasing some co 2 into the atmosphere while some is sequestered into soil when co 2 captured through ccus is stored several things can happen to it in a geological storage site it can be caught in the minute intervening spaces within the rock through capillary action or trapped by a layer of impermeable caprock which prevents it from moving upwards co 2 may also dissolve in the water and then sinks as it is heavier than normal water the carbonated water reacts with basaltic rocks which cover most of the ocean floor the reaction releases elements like calcium magnesium and iron into the water stream over time these elements combine with the dissolved co 2 to form stable carbonate minerals that permanently fill pores within the rock how does co 2 enter the storage sites the co 2 is injected into the porous rocks of depleted or unused natural gas or oil reserves as well as saline aquifers  geologic strata filled with brine or saline water porous rock is filled with holes and gaps between the grains that make up the rock when co 2 is injected into these structures the co 2 floods the pores displacing the brine or remnants of oil and gas it then spreads out and is trapped in the domelike structures of the rock strata called anticlines how long can co 2 be stored appropriately selected and maintained geological reservoirs are very likely to retain 99 of sequestered carbon for more than 100 years and are likely to retain 99 of sequestered carbon for more than 1000 years according to the 2005 special report on ccs by the ipcc another study by nature found that more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years in natural carbon sinks the length of time that carbon is stored varies and depends on environments being preserved peatland for example builds up over thousands of years storing carbon however as peatlands degrade from attempts to drain them to create arable land as well as peat extraction for fuel they begin to emit co 2  the lifecycle of a tree by contrast is relatively short before it decomposes and releases some co 2 back into the atmosphere the ability for geological storage to contain co 2 for millennia means it can truly remove and permanently store emissions go deeper the history of carbon and how its removal

british isles what are the challenges of storing co 2 in geological formations tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  engineering  technology expanding cruachan an epic energy storage project to help unlock a renewable future 12 january 2022 power generation at the beginning of march 2021 britain experienced its longest wind drought in a decade for eleven days wind output averaged just 11 of the uk electricity mix  less than a quarter of the average output in the month before and the month after the power system was able to cope as gas power stations made up most of the shortfall but keeping the lights on will become increasingly challenging as electricity generation shifts from carbonintensive coal and gas towards weatherdependent wind and solar technologies where supply is variable and intermittent one solution to maintain a stable resilient power supply as the electricity system decarbonises is increasing the amount of longduration energy storage that can plug gaps and balance the gird  pumped hydro storage  a tried and tested solution the largestcapacity form of electricity storage by far  pumped storage hydro plays a key role in the energy mix and stabilising the grid which is why following a feasibility study drax has kickstarted plans to extend our pumped hydro storage power station at cruachan in the scottish highlands by drilling a second cavern inside ben cruachan cruachan 2  to the east of the original power station will add up to 600 mw in generating capacity more than doubling the sites total capacity to more than 1gw its an epic project and one that could provide power for around a million homes the original cruachan facility has been supplying and absorbing excess power to the grid since 1965 acting as a green battery it stores lowcarbon energy when there is over supply and releases it when demand is high designed at a time when the grid was powered by nuclear or coalfired plants that could only adjust output slowly cruachans technology is still cutting edge and has proved equally successful at balancing more volatile supply and demand as power generation has shifted towards renewables and lowcarbon sources cruachan plays a critical role in the uk energy system today because it provides a unique range of services for a single asset  it can both generate electricity at 440 mw but it can also pump which means it takes that power off the system so in effect you can deploy greater renewable resources and if theres too much wind in the system rather than curtail wind farms you can pump to take 482 mw off the system says steve marshall development manager at cruachan 2 pumped storage hydro psh at cruachan power station click to viewdownload enabling more renewables on the system as marshall points out too much wind can be as problematic as too little with the governments ambition to quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030 to 40 gigawatts gw the grid will have to manage significantly more windgenerated power and consequently much greater fluctuations in supply currently the demand left to be met by renewable generation ranges from 10 gw to 30 gw throughout the year but modelling by imperial college london suggests that with 40 gw of offshore wind this range could expand from 30 gw right down to minus 30 gw in other words renewables would produce significantly more than national demand without longterm storage capacity this energy will be wasted forcing the grid to pay wind farms to stop generating theres a lot of offshore wind coming online in scotland that has to be transported through the transmission system to england where the demand is says marshall the transmission system in 2030 could become saturated more than 2030 of the time because theres too much renewable power you have a choice either build more transmission lines or more energy storage that can take that power off the system turbine hall at cruachan power station plugging the inertia gap as well integrating more renewables into the electricity mix the cruachan expansion may also help meet the inertia shortfall  inertia  stored kinetic energy  acts as a shock absorber in the system smoothing out sudden changes in power supply and demand and ensuring that frequency remains stable at 50 hz this is a critical as just 1 variation above or below this standard can damage equipment and infrastructure many renewable technologies such as wind turbines and solar pv panels arent built around spinning turbines that synchronise with the grid and so lack inherent inertia cruachans turbines on the other hand spin at 500600rpm and produce electricity at the grid frequency of 50 hz providing inertia that helps the grid remain stable indeed in 2020 national grid eso contracted a unit at cruachan to provide inertia 247 as part of a 6 year contract the grid calls on cruachan three to four hundred times a month with generation mode changes ranging from hours to very short bursts explains marshall increasing the number of turbines would allow cruachan to respond to a greater range of the grids needs  with more units you have more flexibility says marshall if you start to change the generating unit sizes to 150 mw or 200mw machines you get different levels of inertia that offers more options to the grid building on cruachans legacy while automated drilling processes mean that the rock will no longer need to be excavated by tunnel tigers  the crews that handdrilled blasted and excavated granite from the mountainside cruachan 2 will still create an estimated 300 jobs during peak construction and support around 900 jobs across the country and by bringing around 300 gw a year of renewable energy to the grid and reducing requirement for further transmission lines the expansion has the potential to save consumers more than 350 million in energy costs by 2050 with the increased deployment of renewables there is a need for more assets like cruachan says marshall the ambition is to have cruachan 2 operational by 2030 and work could start as early as 2024 but progress is dependent on the government providing support through a revenue stabilisation mechanism for such a longterm largescale energy storage project a study by kpmg found that a cap and floor regime similar to what has unlocked a wave of investment in crossborder interconnectors could be the best mechanism for longduration storage if this is forthcoming the expansion could play a vital role in stabilising the grid and smoothing the uks transition to a net zero

health and ability to deliver negative emissions has accelerated research from governments and global organisations such as the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc increasingly highlight sustainably sourced biomass and bioenergys role in achieving net zero on a wide scale the european commission has also highlighted biomass potential to provide a solution that delivers both renewable energy and healthy sustainably managed forests frans timmermans the executive vicepresident of the european commission in charge of the european green deal has emphasised its importance in bringing economies to net zero saying without biomass were not going to make it we need biomass in the mix but the right biomass in the mix the role of biomass in a sustainable future moving away from fossil fuels means building an electricity system that is primarily based on renewables supporting wind and solar by providing electricity at times of low sunlight or wind levels will require flexible sources of generation such as biomass as well as other technologies like increased energy storage  in the uk the climate change committees ccc sixth carbon budget report lays out its balanced net zero pathway in this lead scenario the ccc says that bioenergy can reduce fossil emissions across the whole economy by 2 million tonnes of co 2 or equivalent emissions mtco 2 e per year by 2035 increasing to 25 mtco2e in 2045 foresters in working forest mississippi biomass is also expected to play a crucial role in supplying biofuels and hydrogen production for sectors of the global economy that will continue to use fuel rather than electricity such as aviation shipping and industrial processes the cccs balanced net zero pathway suggest that enough lowcarbon hydrogen and bioenergy will be needed to deliver 425 twh of nonelectric power in 2050  compared to the 1000 twh of power fossil fuels currently provide to industries today however bioenergy can only be considered to be good for the climate if the biomass used comes from sustainably managed sources good forest management practises ensure that forests remain sustainable sources of woody biomass and effective carbon sinks a report coauthored by ipcc experts examines the scientific literature around the climate effects principally co 2 abatement of sourcing biomass for bioenergy from forests managed according to sustainable forest management principles and practices the report highlights the dual impact managed forests contribute to climate change mitigation by providing material for forest products including biomass that replace greenhouse gas ghgintensive fossil fuels and by storing carbon in forests and in longlived forest products the role of biomass and bioenergy in decarbonising economies goes beyond just replacing fossil fuels the addition of carbon capture and storage ccs to bioenergy to create bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs enables renewable power generation while removing carbon from the atmosphere and carbon cycle permanently the negative emissions made possible by beccs are now seen as a fundamental part of many scenarios to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels beccs and the path to net zero the ipccs special report on limiting global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels emphasises that even across a wide range of scenarios for energy systems all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy  coupled with effective landuse that prevents it contributing to deforestation the second chapter of the report deals with pathways that can bring emissions down to zero by the midcentury bioenergy use is substantial in 15c pathways with or without ccs due to its multiple roles in decarbonising both electricity generation and other industries that depend on fossil fuels however its the negative emissions made possible by beccs that make biomass instrumental in multiple net zero scenarios the ipcc report highlights beccs alongside the associated afforestation and reforestation ar that comes with sustainable forest management are key components in pathways that limit climate change to 15 o c graphic showing how beccs removes carbon from the atmosphere click to viewdownload there are two key factors that make beccs and other forms of emissions removals so essential the first is their ability to neutralise residual emissions from sources that are not reducing their emissions fast enough and those that are difficult or even impossible to fully decarbonise aviation and agriculture are two sectors vital to the global economy with hardtoabate emissions negative emissions technologies can remove an equivalent amount of co 2 that these industries produce helping balance emissions and progressing economies towards net zero the second reason beccs and other negative emissions technologies will be so important in the future is in the removal of historic co 2 emissions what makes co 2 such an important ghg to reduce and remove is that it lasts much longer in the atmosphere than any other to help reach the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to below 15 o c removing historic emissions from the atmosphere will be essential in the uk the cccs 2018 report  biomass in a lowcarbon economy  also points to beccs as both a crucial source of energy and emissions abatement it suggests that power generation from beccs will increase from 3 twh per year in 2035 to 45 twh per year in 2050 it marks a sharp increase from the 195 twh that biomass without ccs accounted for across 2020 according to electric insights data it also suggests that beccs could sequester 11 tonnes of co 2 for every tonne of biomass used providing clear negative emissions however the report makes clear that unlocking the potential of bioenergy and beccs is only possible when biomass stocks are managed in a sustainable way that as a minimum requirement maintains the carbon stocks in plants and soils over time with increased attention paid to forest management and land use there is a growing body of evidence that points to bioenergy as a winwin solution that can decarbonise power and economies while supporting healthy forests that effectively sequester co 2  how bioenergy ensures sustainable forests biomass used in electricity generation and other industries must come from sustainable sources to offer a renewable climate beneficial or low carbon source of power uk legislation on biomass sourcing states that operators must maintain an adequate inventory of the trees in the area including data on the growth of the trees and on the extraction of wood to ensure that wood is extracted from the area at a rate that does not exceed its longterm capacity to produce wood this is designed to ensure that areas where biomass is sourced from retain their productivity and ability to continue sequestering carbon ensuring that forestland remains productive and protected from landuse changes such as urban creep where vegetated land is converted into urban concreted spaces depends on a healthy market for wood products industries such as construction and furniture offer higher prices for higherquality wood while lowquality waste wood as well as residues from forests and woodindustry byproducts can be bought and used to produce biomass pellets  a report by forest 2 market examined the relationship between demand for wood and forests productivity and ability to sequester carbon in the us south where drax sources about twothirds of its biomass the report found that increased demand for wood did not displace forests in the us south instead it encouraged landowners to invest in productivity improvements that increased the amount of wood fibre and therefore carbon contained in the regions forests a synthesis report  which examines a broad range of research papers published in forest ecology and management in march of 2021 concluded from existing studies that claims of largescale damage to biodiversity from woody biofuel in the south east us are not supported the use of these forest residues as an energy source was also found to lead to net ghg greenhouse emissions savings compared to fossil fuels according to forest research  importantly the research shows that climate risks are not exacerbated because of biomass sourcing in fact the opposite is true with annual wood growth in the us south increasing by 112 between 1953 and 2015  delivering a winwin solution the european commissions jrc science for policy literature review and knowledge synthesis report  the use of woody biomass for energy production in the eu suggests a winwin forest bioenergy pathway is possible that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term while at the same time not damaging or even improving the condition of forest ecosystems however it also makes clear loselose situations is also a possible in which forest ecosystems are damaged without providing carbon emission reductions in policyrelevant timeframes winwin management practices must benefit climate change mitigation and have either a neutral or positive effect on biodiversity a winwin future would see the afforestation of former arable land with diverse and naturally regenerated forests the report also warns of tradeoffs between local biodiversity and mitigating carbon emissions or vice versa these must be carefully navigated to avoid creating a loselose scenario where biodiversity is damaged and natural forests are converted into plantations while beccs fails to deliver the necessary negative emissions in a future that will depend on science working in collaboration with industries to build a net zero future continued research is key to ensuring biomass can deliver the winwin solution of renewable

environmental milestones such as meeting the goals of the paris agreement one of those components is the right workforce large enough and with the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the green energy jobs of a lowcarbon future in 2020 the renewable energy sector employed 115 million people around the world but as the industry continues to expand that workforce will only grow last year a national grid report found that in the uk alone 120000 jobs will need to be filled in the lowcarbon energy sector by 2030  to meet the countrys climate objectives that figure is expected to rise to 400000 by 2050 the uk energy sector as a whole currently supports 738000 jobs and much of this workforce already has the skills needed for a low carbon society  others can be reskilled and retrained helping to bolster the future workforce by supporting employees through the green transition at a global level energy sector jobs are expected to increase from 18 million to 26 million by 2050  jobs that will span the full energy spectrum from researching and advising on lowcarbon solutions to installing and implementing them here are some of the roles that will be key to the lowcarbon energy transformation a wind farm under construction off the english coast wind turbine technicians according to the international energy agency iea wind power is this year set for a 17 increase in global energy generation compared to 2020 the biggest increase of any renewable power source the iea also forecasts that wind power will need to grow tenfold by 2050 if the world is to meet the goals of the paris agreement its not surprising therefore that wind turbine technicians  the professionals who install inspect maintain and repair wind turbines  are in high demand in the us wind turbine technician is the fastestgrowing job in the country  with 68 growth projected over the 20202030 period  to give just one example in the uk many wind turbine technicians have a background in engineering or experience from the wider energy sector although there are wind turbine technician and maintenance courses available they are not a prerequisite and many employers offer apprenticeships and onthejob training  smoothing the path for energy professionals to transition into the role solar panel installers today solar photovoltaic solar pv is the biggest global employer in renewable energy accounting for 38 million jobs  the iea also reported a 23 uptick in solar pv installations around the world in 2020 in the uk there are currently 132 gigawatts gw of installed solar power capacity  trade association solar energy uk predicts this will need to rise to at least 40 gw by 2030 if the uk is to succeed in becoming a net zero economy by 2050 the trade association believes this could see the creation of 13000 new solar energy jobs solar panel installers  who carry out the important job of installing and maintaining solar pv  are essential to a lowcarbon future many solar panel installers in the uk come from a background in electrical installation or have transitioned from engineering while there are training courses specifically designed for solar panel installers they are not a necessity particularly if you already have onthejob experience in a relevant sector this makes a move to becoming a solar panel installer relatively easy for someone already working in energy or with a mind for engineering energy consultants businesses of all kinds must play a role in the transition to net zero organisations must be able to manage their energy use and begin switching to renewable sources as professionals who advise companies on this process renewable energy consultants are a key part of the green energy workforce aspects of the job include identifying how organisations use their electric assets and helping businesses optimise those assets to build responsiveness and flexibility into energyintensive operations the core responsibilities of a renewable energy consultant are to reduce a companys environmental impact while helping the business reduce energy costs and identifying opportunities carbon accountants a growing number of businesses are setting targets for reducing their greenhouse gas ghg emissions but thats only possible if you can first determine what your ghg emissions are and where they come from which is where the relatively young field of carbon accounting comes in through what is known as physical carbon accounting companies can assess the emissions their activities generate and where in the supply chain the emissions are occurring this allows businesses to implement more accurate actions and be realistic in their timelines for reducing emissions on a wider scale accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in certifying emissions reductions or abatement as well as in the distribution of carbon credits or penalties as whole economies push towards net zero battery technology researchers energy storage is essential to a lowcarbon energy future  the ability to store and release energy from intermittent sources such as wind and solar will be crucial in meeting demand and balancing a renewablesdriven grid while many forms of energy storage already exist  developing electric batteries that can be deployed at scale is still a comparatively new and expanding area global patenting activities in the field of batteries and other electricity storage increased at an annual rate of 14  four times faster than the average for technology  between 2005 and 2018 however its estimated that to meet climate objectives the world will need nearly 10000 gw hours of battery and other electricity storage by 2040 this is 50 times the current level and research and innovation will be crucial to delivering bigger and more efficient batteries farmers and foresters how we use and manage land will be important in lowering carbon emissions and creating a sustainable future for people and the planet crops like corn sugarcane and soybean can serve as feedstock for biofuel and bioenergy and farming byproducts such as cow manure can be used in the development of biofuel techniques adopted in the agricultural sector will also be important in optimising soil sequestration capabilities while ensuring it is nutrientrich enough to grow food these techniques include the use of biochar  a solid form of charcoal produced by heating biomass without oxygen research indicates that biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for centuries or longer it also helps soil retain water and could contribute to reducing the use of fertilisers by making the soil more nutrientdense forests meanwhile provide material for industries like construction the byproducts from which can serve as feedstock for woody biomass primarily in the shape of lowgrade wood that would otherwise remain unused sustainably managed forests such as those from which drax sources its biomass have twofold importance they both enable woody biomass for bioenergy and ensure co 2 is removed from the atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle biofuel engineers and scientists farmers and foresters provide feedstock for biofuels but its biofuel scientists and engineers who research develop and enhance them opening the door to alternative fuels for vehicles heating and even jet engines according to the iea production of biofuel that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector grew 6 in 2019 however the organisation forecasts that production will need to increase 10 annually until 2030 to be in line with paris agreement climate targets scientific innovations that can help boost the production of biofuel around the world therefore continues to be vital as is the work of biofuel engineers who assess and improve existing biofuel systems and develop new ones that can replace fossil fuels like petrol and diesel the wealth of knowledge around fuels in the oil and gas industries means there is ample opportunity for scientists and engineers who work with fossil fuels to bring their skills to crucial lowcarbon roles geologists the overriding goal of the paris agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2 and preferably to 15 degrees celsius compared to preindustrial levels this is an objective the iea has said will be  virtually impossible to fulfil without carbon capture and storage ccs technologies ccs entails capturing co 2 and transporting it for safe and permanent underground storage in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas fields coal seams and saline aquifers according to the global ccs institute the world will need a 100fold increase on the 27 ccs project currently in operation by 2050 knowledge and research into rock types formations and reactivity will be important in helping identify sites deep underground that can be used for safe permanent carbon storage and sequestration skills and expertise gained in the oil and gas industries will allow professionals in these sectors to make the switch from careers in fossil fuel to roles that help power a net zero economy employees working at drax power station chemists the role of chemists is also vital to decarbonisation knowledge and research around co 2 is a potent force in the effort to reduce and remove it from the atmosphere technologies like ccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage becss  and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs  are based around such research carbon capture processes are chemical reactions between emissions streams and solvents often based on amines and ghgs understanding and controlling these processes makes chemistry a key component of delivering carbon capture at the scale needed to help meet climate targets chemists role in decarbonisation is far from limited to carbon capture methods from battery technology to reforestation chemists understanding of the elements can help drive action against climate change bringing together disciplines tackling climate change on the scale needed to achieve the aims of the paris agreement depends on collaboration between industries countries and disciplines decarbonisation projects such as the uks east coast cluster which encompasses both zero carbon humber and net zero teesside fuse engineering and construction jobs with scientific and academic work zero carbon humber which brings together 12 organisations including drax is expected to create as many as 47800 jobs in the region by 2027  among these are construction sector jobs for welders pipefitters machine installers and technicians in addition indirect jobs are predicted to be created across supply chains from material manufacturing to the logistics of supporting a workforce meeting climate challenges and delivering projects on the scale of zero carbon humber depends on creating an energy workforce that combines the knowledge of the past with the green energy skills of the future draxs apprenticeships have readied workers for the energy sector for decades and will continue to do so as we build a lowcarbon future options include fouryear technical apprenticeships in mechanical electrical and control and instrumentation engineering getting onthejob training and practical experience apprentices receive a nationally recognised qualification such as a btec or an nvq level 3 at the end of the programme apprentices at drax power station 2021 the workforce needed to make low carbon societies a reality will be a diverse one  stretching from apprentices to experienced professionals with a background in traditional or renewable energy it will also span every aspect of the renewable energy field from the chemists and biofuel scientists who develop key technologies to the solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians who fit and maintain the necessary equipment the skills needed to take on these roles are already plentiful in the uk and around the world overcoming challenges on the road to net zero requires refocussing these existing talents skills and careers towards a new goal tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  careers  communities  decarbonisation  economic impact  engineering  sustainability  technology transporting carbon  how to safely move co2 from the atmosphere to permanent storage 15 october 2021 carbon capture key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture

happens to it when you do tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  drax power station  negative emissions  sustainability  technology  zero carbon humber what is direct air carbon capture and storage dacs 9 july 2021 carbon capture what is direct air carbon capture and storage dacs direct air carbon capture and storage dacs sometimes referred to as dac or daccs is one of the few technologies that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere unlike other carbon removal technologies that capture co 2 emissions during the process of generating electricity or heat dacs can be deployed anywhere in the world it can tap into a supply of electricity co 2 removal is crucial to meeting the international climate goals set by the 2015 paris agreement but its not enough just to cut co 2 emissions to achieve net zero  it will also be necessary to remove the co 2 that two centuries of industrialisation have released into the environment as a technology that removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases  assuming it is powered by green electricity  dacs has the potential to play a key role in this process how does dacs work dacs could be described as a form of industrial photosynthesis just as plants use photosynthesis to convert sunlight and co 2 into sugar dacs systems use electricity to remove co 2 from the atmosphere using fans and filters air is drawn into the dacs system using an industrial scale fan liquid dacs systems pass the air through a chemical solution which removes the co 2 and returns the rest of the air back into the atmosphere solid dacs systems captures co 2 on the surface of a filter covered in a chemical agent where it then forms a compound the new compound is heated releasing the co 2 to be captured and separating it from the chemical agent which can then be recycled the captured co 2 can then be compressed under very high pressure and pumped via pipelines into deep geological formations  this permanent storage process is known as sequestration alternatively the co 2 can be pumped under low pressure for immediate use in commercial processes such as carbonating drinks or cement manufacturing a 2021 study by the coalition for negative emissions shows that dacs could provide at least 1gt of sustainable negative emissions by 2025 dacs fast facts human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of co 2 by 48 above preindustrial levels found in 1850 during prehistoric ice ages co 2 levels were around 200 parts per million ppm the average level in 2020 was more than 417ppm 101 out of 116 of the ipcc scenarios mitigating greenhouse gas emissions depend on using negative emissions technology  including dacs what role can dacs play in decarbonisation co 2 is in the air at the same concentration everywhere in the world this means that dacs plants can be located anywhere unlike carbon capture systems that remove co 2 from industrial processes at source there are 15 dacs plants currently in operation worldwide  climeworks operates three in switzerland iceland and italy together these smallscale plants capture approximately 9000 tonnes of co 2 per annum the first largescale plant  currently being developed in the permian basin texas is expected to capture 1000000 tonnes one megatonne per annum when it becomes operational in 2025 at just 004 the concentration of co 2 in the atmosphere is very dilute which makes removing and storing it a challenge this means that dacs costs significantly more than some other co 2 capture technologies  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne the process also requires large amounts of energy which adds to the demand for electricity however dacs has the potential to become an important piece in the jigsaw of co 2
