climate crisis by becoming the worlds first carbon negative company will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 10 december 2019 opinion thank you very much nick its a pleasure to be here in madrid my name is will gardiner and i am the ceo of the drax group we have been proud members of the powering past coal alliance for a year now but our journey beyond coal began more than a decade ago when we realised that we had a responsibility to our communities our shareholders and our colleagues to be part of the solution to the escalating climate crisis and so at drax we did something that many believed wasnt possible and began to replace coal generation with sustainable renewable biomass  with the right support and commitment from successive uk ministers and through the ingenuity of our people within a decade we transformed into europes largest decarbonisation project and its biggest source of renewable power  generating 12 of the uks renewable electricity last year while reducing our carbon emissions by more than 80 since 2012 we have reduced our emissions we believe more than any other energy company in the world and we have enabled a just transition for thousands of uk workers who began their career in coal but will end it by producing renewable flexible and low carbon power for 13 million british homes but as the climate crisis intensifies and the clock counts down we cant stand still so today i am pleased to share our new ambition to move beyond carbon neutrality to achieve something that nobody has before and become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030  by applying carbon capture and storage technology to our bioenergy generation we can become the first company in the world to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we produce while continuing to produce about 5 of the uks overall electricity needs as the ipcc and uk governments committee on climate change make clear  negative emissions are vital if we are to limit the earths temperature rise to 15 degrees  at drax we can be the first company to produce negative emissions at scale helping to arrest climate change and redefining what is possible in the transition beyond coal if we are to defeat the climate crisis we must do it in a way that unlocks jobs and economic growth unleashes entrepreneurial spirit and leaves nobody behind the uk is unrivalled in decarbonising in this way we are second to none in deploying renewables like offshore wind and bioenergy  which have transformed lives and our postindustrial communities we need to apply a similar framework to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as made offshore wind so successful fundamentally an effective strategic partnership of government and the private sector was critical the government provided support and an effective carbon tax regime with confidence in that regulatory framework many businesses provided investment and innovation as a result offshore wind has grown from less than 600 megawatts mw of installed capacity in 2008 to more than 8000 mw in 2018  an increase of more than 13 times in 10 years to produce 75 of the uks electricity at the same time the cost of that electricity has declined from 114mwh in 2015 to 39mwh in 2019 the latter being a cost that will make offshore wind viable without subsidy with government support and an effective regulatory regime to give the private sector the confidence to invest and innovate bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will trace that same path at the same time investing in this technology will both save lots of existing jobs and create many next generation green technology jobs that is why we have founded along with equinor and national grid zero carbon humber  to work with the government to bring carbon capture and storage infrastructure to the northeast of the uk we can save 55000 existing heavy industry jobs while capturing as much as 30 million tons of co 2 per year at the same time we will create a new industry and also the infrastructure for a new hydrogen economy to take our decarbonisation further by creating the right conditions for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to flourish britain can continue to benefit  socially economically and environmentally from being at the vanguard of the fight against climate change and at the same time it is our ambition at drax to play a major role in that fight by becoming the first carbon negative company thank you read the press release drax sets worldfirst ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 photo caption will
