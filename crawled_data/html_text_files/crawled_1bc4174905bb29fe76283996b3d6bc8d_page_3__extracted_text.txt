sustainable biomass program sbp the sustainable biomass program 21 march 2018 sustainable bioenergy in 2013 drax cofounded the sbp together with six other energy companies sbp builds upon existing forest certification programmes such as the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council fsc and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc these evidence sustainable forest management practices but do not yet encompass regulatory requirements for reporting greenhouse gas ghg emissions  this is a critical gap for biomass generators who are obligated to report ghg emissions to european regulators there is also limited uptake of forestlevel certification schemes in some key forest source areas sbp is working to address these challenges sbp certification provides assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements for the users of biomass for energy production are met the tool is a unique certification scheme designed for woody biomass mostly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips used in industrial largescale energy production sbp certification is achieved via a rigorous assessment of wood pellet and wood chip producers and biomass traders carried out by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee tags biomass energy  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets  forests working with our suppliers sustainable bioenergy pinewells lda is part of grupo visabeira with global interests in the telecommunications construction manufacturing technology real estate and energy sectors constructed in 2009 the biomass plant in portugal is one of the strategic investments of the group in the renewable energy sector the plant has an annual biomass production of 150000 tonnes supplying both the international industrial and the internal domestic biomass markets drax worked closely with pinewells in 2017 to ensure the feedstock used for production is both harvested lawfully and sustainable by meeting the requirements of the drax supplier data return and thirdparty audit working with the forest and quality engineers at pinewells we have supported the company to develop and implement their monitoring and inspection system within their own supply base key features of this system include deskbased research to determine the characterisation of harvesting areas and field audits to approve the felling areas highlight the good forest practice guide and deliver focused training this work has provided a valuable foundation for pinewells to implement the sustainable biomass program sbp within their supply chain working with drax this year has provided us guidance and understanding towards the requirements of sbp certification the encouragement and advice from the drax sustainability team proved both valuable and practical  alexandra pedro pinewells overseas sales director tags sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets 7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass policy 28 november 2017 sustainable bioenergy biomass is playing an important role in moving the uk away from coal at drax power station in the form of compressed wood pellets  biomass is already supplying roughly 17 of great britains renewable power  but more than just being a low carbon replacement for fossil fuel generation it is also crucial in maintaining the stability of the power network among renewable sources of power biomass is unique in being able to provide the same range of ancillary services that can be provided by coal power stations  such as frequency control and inertia  this inherrent flexibility is vital in maintaining stability on britains high voltage transmission system wood pellets can also reliably generate power helping to fill in the gaps left by intermittent renewables when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine and avoiding reliance on diesel coal and gas however for the uk and the wider global environment to reap the maximum benefits from biomass it must be produced sustainably more than this its supply chain must be low in emissions so that clear savings can be made versus power generation with fossil fuels to ensure this the use of biomass is regulated in the uk under eu timber regulations and the renewables obligation ro  but further guidelines are set to be introduced as part of the european parliaments update to the renewable energy directive red which will specify criteria for all biomass there is a clear need for this but for these to be truly successful they need to be based on a set of robust key principles a new report by drax outlines seven of these which can ensure sustainable biomass usage in the future 1 forest biomass for bioenergy should be sourced from sustainable forests the sustainability of the forests from which biomass is sourced is key to ensuring its usage has a positive impact on the environmental social and economic health of that supply region for example a properly managed forest can boost carbon stock as the younger faster growing trees that are replanted after felling absorb more co 2 than older overmature trees thinning operations also increase the growth of the biggest and best trees  ensuring more carbon is stored in longer term solid wood products generators should be able to demonstrate they are avoiding biomass sourced from higherrisk areas where extracting biomass could cause longterm carbon stock decreases in soils or ecosystems as well as other factors such as biodiversity loss soil erosion or depletion of water sources 2 bioenergy from forest biomass should not be produced from highrisk feedstocks feedstocks the raw materials turned into biomass pellets must come from sustainable sources and avoid protected and sensitive sites that could be considered a risk in 2016 around 40 of all feedstock supplied to drax originated as a sawmill residue  processes such as thinning also serve as a source of biomass feedstock while also benefitting the overall health and quality of the forest thinning a semi mature stand of trees allows the forest owner to maximise the production of higher value sawtimber trees storing more carbon and generating more stable revenue streams having a variety of wood products markets from saw logs through to biomass incentivises land owners to maintain healthy forests and reduces the risk of conversion of forest to agriculture or urban development 3 carbon savings and emissions should be properly accounted to understand the effectiveness of biomass sustainability policy carbon savings need to be measured factors such as fossil fuel substitution and the emissions associated with harvesting processing and transporting biomass are relatively straightforward to measure 4 bioenergy should be limited to what can be sustainably supplied unlike coal or oil which will eventually run out more trees can be planted grown and harvested that said there is a natural limit to the amount of biomass available on the planet and so it should not be considered an infinite resource this is why its crucial biomass is sourced from sustainable forests managed following set guidelines in short to ensure biomass truly is sustainable it is essential that working forests are actively managed and maintain or increase productivity  5 support should be given to all technologies that achieve significant carbon savings one of the major advantages of biomass over other renewable sources is its potential to help the uk rapidly adapt to meet the eu target of achieving 27 of final energy consumption from renewables the fastest way for biomass to make an impact to the uks carbon emissions is through converting coal power stations to biomass  as is the case at drax power station this repurposing of existing facilities not only offers rapid adoption of renewable energy but also the ability to provide vital ancillary services other renewable sources cant quickly deploying biomass solutions in this manner will serve to help it become an established part of the energy system as it continues to decarbonise 6 the efficient use of raw materials is supported by encouraging buoyant forest biomass markets globally there are substantial amounts of forest residue and forestry industry byproducts that currently go unused biomass should be sourced from regions where the largest surpluses exist and the forest carbon balance can be maintained to enable this to function effectively on a global scale trade restrictions should be avoided pelletisation offers one of the most efficient ways for this raw material to be used by making it safe costefficient and lowcarbon to transport around the world these principals are tried and tested by drax and known to protect forests and ecosystems  as well as optimise supply chains to ensure carbon emissions are kept to a minimum ultimately draxs experience in sustainably using biomass serve as a guide for other producers and governments to quickly decarbonise energy systems 7 the sustainability of forest biomass should be independently verified one of the best ways to guarantee biomass is sourced sustainably is by introducing thirdparties and official guidelines that generators and suppliers can work with in europe forest level management certification schemes can act as an effective indicator that forests are managed in accordance with the guidelines laid out by forest europe  outside of europe where drax sources most of its biomass  independent third part auditors can ensure the uks stringent criteria are being met on the ground read the full report the 7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass policy  proven to work tags sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets keeping the options open 19 october 2017 sustainable bioenergy roughly 750 million acres of the us is covered in forestland  an area nearly 12 times the size of the uk approximately twothirds of that land is working timberland producing wood used for construction and furniture in short us forestry is a massive industry enviva is the worlds largest wood pellet producer and biggest biomass supplier to drax power station  but in the context of the us forestry industry in which it operates enviva does things differently were leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices says jennifer jenkins vice president and chief sustainability officer at enviva weve created unique tracking systems and we conduct sciencebased sourcing both of which encourage sound forest stewardship specifically enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesnt protecting bottomland forests a bottomland forest is an area of lowlying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species these forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important however theyre also a part of southeastern americas working forest landscape in fact enviva sources 34 of its wood from these areas  but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest for example in some cases harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive more than that harvesting can also help keep forests as forests in the areas where we work one of the biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use  specifically to developed or agricultural land explains dr jenkins our goal is to keep forests as forests we want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use if landowners can gain a steady income from regular harvests theyre likely to keep their land as working forests however this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe any land that doesnt meet envivas set of strict criteria means enviva wont source from it  it can simply walk away the landowners on the other hand dont have that luxury isnt it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest asks dr jenkins maybe they recognize its value maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead in recognition of our responsibility we made a commitment a fund that keeps forests as forests envivas commitment was to partner with the us endowment for forestry  communities to set up the enviva forest conservation fund  a 5 million 10year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the virginianorth carolina coastal plain it works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects more recently in june 2017  the enviva forest conservation fund announced a total of 500000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as ducks unlimited  an organization which  with the grant  plans to acquire more than 6000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public wildlife management area the fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes including a strict supplier assessment process and the companys track  trace tool  a oneofakind publiclyaccessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced it is entirely transparent and is a testament to envivas commitment to sustainability and doing things differently as dr jenkins explains this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004 as a company that makes wood pellets envivas reason for being is to help lower greenhouse gas emissions an emphasis on sustainability has always been a part of envivas dna tags sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets  forests sustainability certified 24 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy of all the changes to drax power station over the last decade perhaps the biggest is one you cant see since converting three of its six generating units from coal to run primarily on compressed wood pellets  drax has reduced those units greenhouse gas ghg emissions by over 80  and while this is a huge improvement it would mean nothing if the biomass with which those reductions are achieved isnt sustainably sourced  for this reason drax works with internationallyrecognised certification programmes that ensure suppliers manage their forests according to environmental social and economic criteria thanks to these certification programmes drax can be confident it is not only reducing ghg emissions but supporting responsible forestry from wherever wood fibre is sourced sustainability certifications the compressed wood pellets used at drax power station come from various locations around the world so drax relies on a number of different forest certification programmes the three main ones being the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council  fsc   1 and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc the programmes share a common goal of demonstrating responsible forest management but adoption rates vary by region european landowners and regulators are most familiar with the fsc and national pefc standards while north american landowners generally prefer sfi and american tree farm system also members of the pefc family in instances in which drax sources wood pellets carrying these certifications or in instances in which drax purchase pellets sourced from certified forests these certifications offer an additional degree of assurance that the pellets are sustainable over 50 of the pellets used at drax power station come from the southern usa  where sfi and american tree farm system are the most widely implemented certification programmes overall adoption levels in this region are relatively modest however the sfi offers an additional level of certification that can be implemented by woodprocuring entities such as sawmills pulp mills and pellet mills this programme is referred to as sfi fiber sourcing and to obtain it participants must demonstrate that the raw material in their supply chains come from legal and responsible sources these sources may or may not include certified forests the programme also includes requirements related to biodiversity water quality landowner outreach and use of forest management and harvesting professionals together these certification systems have long contributed to the improvement of forest management practices in a region that provides drax with a significant proportion of its pellets and since the sfi and atfs programmes are endorsed by pefc north american suppliers have a pathway for their regions sustainable forest management practices to be recognised by european stakeholders these certification programmes have been in use for many years but with recent growth in the market for wood pellets a new certification system has emerged to deal specifically with woody biomass new kid on the block the sustainable biomass program sbp was set up in 2013 as a certification system to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources but rather than replacing any previous forest certification programmes it builds on them for example sbp recognises the evidence of sustainable forest management practices gathered under these other programmes however the pefc sfi and fsc programmes do not include requirements for reporting ghg emissions a critical gap for biomass generators as they are obligated to report these emissions to european regulators sbp fills this gap by creating a framework for suppliers to report their emissions to the generators that purchase their pellets when a new entity such as a wood pellet manufacturer first seeks certification under sbp that entity is required to assess its supply base feedstock which has already been certified by another established certification programme sfi fsc   pefc or pefc approved schemes is considered sbpcompliant all other feedstock must be evaluated against sbp criteria and the wood pellet manufacturer must carry out a risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance against each of the 38 sbp indicators if during the process a specific risk is identified for example to the forest ecosystem the wood pellet manufacturer must put in place mitigation measures to manage the risk such that it can be considered to be effectively controlled or excluded these assessments are audited by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee in conducting the risk assessment the wood pellet manufacturer must consult with a range of stakeholders and provide a public summary of the assessment for transparency purposes sustainable energy for the uk counting major energy companies including dong energy eon and drax as members the sbp has quickly become an authoritative voice in the industry at the end of 2016 the sbp had 74 certificate holders across 14 countries  including draxs pellet manufacturing arm drax biomass  in mississippi and louisiana its a positive step towards providing the right level of certification for woody biomass and together with the existing forestry certifications it provides drax with the assurance that it is powering the uk using biomass from legal and sustainable sources like the fastreducing carbon dioxide emissions of britains power generation sector  its a change you cant see but one that is making a big difference read the drax principles for sustainable sourcing  1 drax power ltd fsc license code fsc  c119787 tags biomass energy  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  energy policy the new renewable energy directive and what it means for biomass 29 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy this story was published the day before the announcement by the european commission please scroll to the bottom of this page for the drax view  when the european union set out its policy for the promotion of renewable energy in the 2009 renewable energy directive red it set a very ambitious target by 2020 renewables should make up 20 of the eus energy consumption each member state was given a specific goal and made to detail exactly how it would hit this the directive was comprehensive in many ways but it didnt include a clear sustainability policy for solid biomass including compressed wood pellets  as one of the largest sources of renewable energy in europe  this left a policy gap that many voices  including drax  have called to be filled its a wish that will now be granted a revised red is set to be published by the eu that will specify clear criteria for all biomass sustainability has always been absolutely central to our biomass strategy but drax has always argued that there is a right way to source biomass and a wrong way dorothy thompson drax group ceo july 2014 importance of sustainable biomass biomass is a wellestablished and essential part of the renewable energy mix it offers a unique mix of reliability flexibility and affordability all while helping to deliver carbon reductions this makes it particularly important as countries like the uk seek to phase out coal generation and hit the targets set out in the paris agreement however in order to secure these carbon benefits biomass needs to be produced sustainably this means that it comes from responsiblymanaged growing forests and that the emissions from the supply chain are measured and minimised in the uk there are already binding sustainability criteria but this isnt the case across the eu biomass use in the uk is regulated under the eu timber regulations and uks own renewable obligation ro biomass sustainability criteria the ro is a form of government support designed to incentivise large scale renewable electricity generation in the uk and to qualify for this energy companies must adhere to sustainability standards such as properly accounting for their greenhouse gas ghg emissions and only sourcing from responsibly managed land and forests  an euwide approach to biomass that follows the uks could see the implementation of a riskbased scheme that asks large energy companies to prove how they mitigate against a set of identified risks  like those in the ro criteria however its important that compliance with these is independently verified  something that could be done by using independent schemes such as the sustainable biomass program sbp the sbp carries out supplybase evaluation of pellet producers to ensure the wood theyre using is qualified as sustainable and theyre meeting the ro criteria programmes like the sbp are already being used by most major biomass power generators in the eu and could act as a blueprint for the future efficiency where effective only a few of the power stations across the eu are suitable for conversion from coal to biomass but those that are like drax can deliver fast significant carbon savings the thermal efficiency of such stations may not be as high as a newly built plant but they do allow governments to quickly move away from coal more than that these plants can continue to provide the critical services  such as voltage control and black start  the grid needs to remain stable and that other renewables cant drax is one of these stations and in the first half of 2016 it was able to deliver around 20 of the uks renewable power thanks to its conversion to biomass it now does this with over 80 carbon reductions relative to coal with the abundance of suitable and sustainablygrown fibre that can be used for biomass electricity generation there is a strong case for the eu to encourage the coal phase out by encouraging others to undergo conversion from coal to biomass but whats also needed is a clear set of sustainability criteria for biomass  the move to define this is a step in the right direction but the final eu proposal needs to be a practical one if the updated red achieves this it will mean a bright future for renewable energy in europe and a clearer path for meeting the continents paris agreement targets  30 november 2016 update  drax welcomes renewable energy directive proposal drax welcomes the publication of the renewable energy directive and bioenergy policy proposal  drax has been at the forefront of calling for standards based on a riskassessment to demonstrate the sustainability of biomass used for energy production matt willey public affairs director of drax power had said that drax has campaigned for a robust pragmatic biomass sustainability policy for the whole eu for many years and today is a step in the right direction it is important that large users of biomass can demonstrate forest regeneration is taking place that areas of high conservation value are protected that soil and water quality is maintained and that harvesting does not exceed the longterm production capacity of the forest we welcome the fact the commission proposes that voluntary national or international schemes including those which use a risk based approach can be used to provide evidence of sustainability the uk already has the toughest sustainability rules in the world so drax can be sure our compressed wood pellets are sustainable but it makes sense to have a common policy across the eu drax power has made huge efforts to demonstrate the sustainability of its biomass  sourcing from regions with large surpluses combined with low wood paying capability drax is able to track and trace every shipment back to low risk areas which assures that biodiversity is protected and promotes sustainable forest management tags sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  energy policy  investors sustainable biomass program  proving biomass is sustainable dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 14 april 2016 opinion i was honoured to be able to accept the excellence in bioenergy award recently not for myself but on behalf of all my colleagues at drax who have worked so hard to make a reality of our shared plan to generate reliable renewable electricity our achievements are truly a team effort in 2015 drax became a predominantly biomassfuelled power station we now generate more electricity at drax power station from compressed lowgrade wood pellets than from coal  between three and four per cent of the uks entire demand every day its a major triumph for all the brilliant engineers involved in converting the plant and everyone who has helped secure the incredibly complex supply chain that keeps it running but we truly believe that this is only the beginning for sustainable biomass sustainable biomass is the ideal fuel to help the world decarbonise in an affordable and reliable way it can support other renewables like wind and solar when the elements are against them and backup power is needed because it can be created by upgrading existing coalfired power stations it can be added to the electricity grid in a fraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost of building new power stations why should the uk only build brandnew gas and nuclear power stations when existing coal power stations can be upgraded to low carbon renewable tech at drax we have shown how engineers working at what once was the biggest coal power station in western europe can use their expertise to work with compressed wood pellet power generation and it can save bill payers billions of pounds when the true costs of bringing other renewables on stream are taken into account the industrys greatest challenge right now is in proving that all the biomass we use is truly sustainable at drax we have proven the sustainability of the biomass we use time and time again but we can and will do more to ensure that standards right across the industry are always equally high we cannot underestimate the importance of sustainability no corners can be cut we must all join together and meet this challenge because without sustainable biomass there will be no industry at all without sustainable biomass in a balanced energy system with other renewables and low carbon technologies the paris climate change summit commitments may not be reached this is why the sustainable biomass program is so important the sbp has developed a certification framework to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources by working with the sbp all of us in the industry alongside hard working families and businesses stand to benefit which is why all of us at drax welcome its inception and look forward to working with the sbp to help build a growing and healthy industry that helps our society transition to the renewable fuels of the future may 2017 update the sbp has
