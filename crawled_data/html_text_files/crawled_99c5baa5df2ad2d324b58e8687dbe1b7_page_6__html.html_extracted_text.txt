Press Release
Unique technology means charging EVs for Drax’s business customers is easier
15 February 2023
Press releases

The two new payment products that Drax now offers will help businesses, whose employees drive company EVs which they charge either at home or on the road, by automatically directing the expenses to the company, thus reducing admin time and ensuring payment accuracy.
When charging at home, Mina Homecharge® accurately pays driver’s charging costs direct to their energy supplier. For business drivers charging on the road, Mina Chargepass® allows them to charge at no cost to the individual and combine the costs in a single monthly invoice sent directly to their employer.
Business drivers will no longer have to pay to charge or claim any expenses, as all costs will be charged back to their employer each month. This helps businesses maximise efficiency as it cuts out the need to manage multiple expense claims, significantly reducing admin time for both the business and driver.
Adam Hall, Director of Energy Services, Drax, said: “We’re always looking for ways to improve our business customers’ experience and offer them access to the services they’ve told us they need. Mina Homecharge and Chargepass are excellent solutions that allow organisations to give their EV drivers flexibility when it comes to where they charge their vehicles.”
For fleet drivers who need to charge on the road, Chargepass offers the fastest dedicated charging network to businesses, with 44% of chargers being either rapid or ultra-rapid. The network currently offers access to over 11,000 public EV chargers across the UK, with plans to grow considerably over the coming months.
Ashley Tate, CEO and Co-Founder, Mina said: “Working with credible partners such as Drax is really important to ensure we’re able to reach more      businesses. Drax offers businesses an extensive range of services for the fleet and workplace charging markets and we’re delighted to be part of that product mix.
“One of the biggest challenges businesses face      is how to pay for their drivers’ EV charging costs fairly and that can be a very complex area to navigate. By offering Mina, Drax can simplify the process for their business customers enabling companies to transition to electric vehicles with ease.”

Powering Britain in 2022: renewables reach record levels, but fossil fuels double power prices
29 December 2022
Press releases

New analysis shows Britain’s power grid had a record-breaking green year, but the spiralling cost of fossil fuels led power prices to almost double.
Renewable power generated more than two-fifths (40%) of the country’s electricity for the first time – helping to cut carbon emissions by 2.7 million tonnes.
Britain exported more power to Europe than ever before, making it a net exporter of electricity for the first time in over a decade.
Academics from Imperial College London for Drax Electric Insights, commissioned via Imperial Consultants, analysed the data which highlights the turbulence that Britain’s electricity system has endured amid an unprecedented year for the energy industry.
Renewable power sources – wind, solar, biomass and hydro – generated 40% of the country’s electricity in 2022 – up from 35% in 2021, helping to cut CO
2
emissions from the power sector by 2.7 million tonnes compared to the previous year. Overall generation from renewables has more than
quadrupled
over the last decade.
At one stage during May, renewables provided
72.8%
of power to the grid whilst wind farms generated a landmark
20GW
of electricity for the first time – the maximum output from wind is now up by a third compared to
four years ago
.
Despite the record supply of cheap renewable electricity, the unprecedented rise in the cost of gas following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent power prices to a new all-time high. The fossil fuel supplied 42% of the country’s power this year, its largest share of the fuel mix since
2016
. Britain is on course to have annual average wholesale price above £200 per MWh for the first time ever in 2022 – up from £113 the year before. This is nearly six times higher than the cost of electricity in 2020 (£34 per MWh).
The price (£/MWh) of fossil fuels over the last three years, relative to their averages from 2010-19
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and lead author of the quarterly Drax Electric Insights report series, said:
“This has been a year like no other for the energy industry. The public are feeling the pain of high gas prices on their energy bills even though renewables are providing the grid with more cheap, green electricity than ever before.
“The lesson from 2022 is that we need to break our addiction to fossil fuels once and for all if we want lower cost and more secure energy supplies. If we had not invested in wind, solar and biomass over the last decade our energy bills would have been even higher, as would the risk of blackouts over winter.
“The energy crisis cannot be solved by increasing our reliance on gas imported from abroad. We need to turbocharge our investment in clean energy technologies to become Europe’s renewable electricity powerhouse, which will cut fuel bills at home and bring money into the economy by exporting power to our neighbouring countries.”
For the first time in more than a decade, Britain is a net exporter of electricity to its European neighbours. Electricity exports quadrupled from last year to 17.2 TWh of electricity – generating around £3.1bn for the UK economy. The country exported a net total of 1.9TWh, representing a dramatic swing in power trading from the previous year when Britain instead imported a net total of 22.9TWh.
Share of British electricity that was imported and exported each quarter
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Drax plays a critical role in supporting the UK energy system, generating more renewable power by output than any other company.
“We can accelerate and strengthen Britain’s long-term energy security by ending our reliance on expensive, imported fossil fuels and instead increase investment in homegrown renewables, and innovative green technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and pumped storage hydro.”
Drax is the UK’s biggest renewable power producer by output, generating enough renewable electricity from biomass and hydro for around 5 million homes – producing as much as 20% of the country’s renewable electricity during times of peak demand in 2022.
Drax plans to invest billions of pounds expanding its pumped hydro storage capacity at its Cruachan power station in Scotland and deploying BECCS at its power station in North Yorkshire, to permanently remove 8million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2030, whilst generating the reliable, renewable power the country needs.

Editor’s Notes
2022 figures are from 1 January to 17 December, with projections used to account for the rest of the year.
The estimation of the value of electricity exports for the UK economy (2022: £3.1bn) is based on the total volume of gross exports if they were sold at day-ahead prices.
Some key records from the data:
Renewable power generated 40% of Britain’s electricity needs (2021: 35%).
New all-time high annual share of power generated from wind (2022: 28%, 2021: 23%).
The power sector produced 50.1 million tonnes of CO
2
, a fall of 2.7 million tonnes from last year (2021: 52.8 million tonnes of CO
2
).
Lowest ever amount of power generated from coal (2022: 4.3TWh, 2021: 5.0TWh).
Output from gas generation rose to 113.8TWh (2021:107.2TWh).
Overall power demand continued its steady decline over the last decade to 269.9TWh (2021: 276.5TWh).
A dramatic 20.9TWh swing in power trading occurred on the Great Britain – France interconnectors with GB net exporting 7.2TWh compared to net imports of 13.7TWh in 2021.

Maintenance regime for Drax’s coal units
15 December 2022
Press releases

A Drax spokesperson said:
“As part of the maintenance regime for Drax’s coal units, the power station will be running one of its units on Friday for a short period. Whilst this will generate power and has been agreed with National Grid ESO, this generation is not an instruction under the terms of the winter contingency contract we have agreed with them.
“The unit is not operating commercially and will not receive direct compensation for this maintenance generation.
“We are proud to be able to provide the extra capacity from our coal units this winter, should it be required, to bolster UK energy security and help keep the lights on for millions of homes and businesses.”
ENDS
Background
At the request of the UK Government, Drax agreed to delay the planned closure of its two coal-fired units and help bolster the UK’s energy security this winter, following Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Under the winter contingency agreement with National Grid ESO, Drax is allowed to seek permission to run parts of the plant for operational reasons for limited time periods.
We have agreed today’s operational run of the unit with National Grid ESO.
Drax remains committed to a coal-free future for the plant as the UK’s long-term energy security depends on investing in innovative green technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which Drax plans to deploy in the 2020s, to permanently remove 8 million tonnes of CO2 each year from the atmosphere by 2030, whilst providing reliable, renewable power to the system.

Europe is cutting gas usage faster than UK
14 December 2022
Press releases

European countries such as Germany are leading the way in slashing their demand for gas, according to Drax Electric Insights.
The UK is showing no signs of changing its gas consumption levels, with an exceptionally mild autumn leading to its modest reductions year-on-year.
Households could save up to £200 by turning down their thermostat by just 1°C, and save the government £3bn in funding the Energy Price Guarantee.
The
independent analysis
by academics from Imperial College London for Drax Electric Insights, commissioned via Imperial Consultants, shows that the UK’s gas reduction year-on-year was outpaced by Germany, France, Italy, and Spain – with demand for gas actually rising in Britain in September compared to previous years.
Change in natural gas consumption versus the previous three years in UK and comparable European countries. Data covers all sectors excluding power generation and are not adjusted for weather differences.
What reduction there was in gas use in the UK was attributable to unseasonably warm weather rather than people adjusting their behaviour. The analysis for Drax Electric Insights showed that from September, through to end of November, Britain’s gas demand was just 0.3% lower than would have been expected pre-energy crisis, when accounting for weather anomalies.
Daily natural gas consumption in UK versus expectations. The blue line shows the seasonal average for all end users except power generation over 10 years to 2020. The yellow line adjusts for weather, showing what demand would be with pre-crisis behaviour. The black line shows actual consumption.
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and lead author of the quarterly Drax Electric Insights report, said:
“The UK is an outlier on the world stage, showing no signs of reducing its appetite for gas during a time of dramatically higher prices.
“If temperatures continue to drop during the festive season, managing the energy crisis will be both more difficult and expensive unless people and businesses break their addiction to gas. Turning the thermostat down by just 1°C would save households up to £200 a year on their energy bills and save the UK from importing 50TWh of natural gas over the winter – cutting the cost of the government’s Energy Price Guarantee by £3bn.”
On the continent, national governments have introduced demand reduction measures alongside information campaigns to inspire the public and businesses to act. In Germany, public buildings have turned down their thermostats to 19°C and outside illuminated advertising must be turned off between 10pm until 6am.
The UK Government has now launched a public information campaign on how people can claim financial support this winter alongside more technical advice on how to reduce energy use while still keeping warm, such as reconfiguring boiler settings. This followed the Chancellor announcing a further £6bn to
insulate homes and upgrade boilers
.
Penny Small, Drax’s Group Generation Director, said:
“As a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine the UK’s energy system is under considerable strain this winter and the combination of rising inflation and gas prices has put most household budgets under pressure.
“Britain’s long-term energy security will be strengthened by ending our reliance on expensive imported fossil fuels such as gas and instead increasing investment in homegrown renewables, and innovative green technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and pumped storage hydro.”
Drax is the UK’s biggest renewable power producer by output, generating enough renewable electricity from biomass and hydro for around 5 million homes.
It plans to invest billions of pounds expanding its pumped hydro storage capacity at its Cruachan power station in Scotland and also deploying BECCS at its power station in North Yorkshire, to permanently remove 8million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2030.

Editor’s Notes
A copy of the Drax Electric Insights Q3 2022 report is available by
clicking here
.
Records broken during Q3 2022 include power exports reaching an all-time instantaneous percentage high of total generation – 20.9%.
Warm weather was central to gas demand reduction in the UK, with October 3°C warmer the average with a record-breaking 30°C recorded on a single-day in Gravesend.
In November, during the first three weeks just one day in the month was colder than average.
Britain’s gas demand is heavily linked to weather, with an additional 160 GWh for every degree that it falls below 15°C.
Average household savings by reducing thermostats by 1°C during the winter period (October to March) would save consumers £1-£1.50 per day.
As well as saving the country money, reducing gas demand by 50 TWh would cut carbon emissions by 10.2 million tonnes – or 3% of the UK’s total CO

Drax supports key workers at sea during the Christmas period
9 December 2022
Press releases

Drax has worked with its partners Associated British Ports, DAN Shipping and Davis Wagon Services to jointly donate £3,500 to the Mission to Seafarers, a charity which supports people working at sea.
Drax volunteers Emma Smith, Colin Bansor and Taslima Ayre on board one of the ships
Volunteers from the charity, as well as from Drax and DAN shipping, packed bags with the donated items and supplies and then distributed to crews on the ships at Immingham port, including those carrying fuel for Drax’s supply chain.
Mark Gibbens, Drax Head of Logistics, said: “We are proud to support the important work that the Mission to Seafarers does to bring support and comfort to the key workers in our supply chain and others during Christmas. I’d also like to thank our partners at ABP, DAN shipping and Davis Wagon Services for their contributions.
“This is a way to thank the people employed throughout our supply chain whose invaluable work helps us to maintain reliable, renewable electricity supplies for millions of homes and businesses. I hope these donations will help the men and women working out at sea enjoy a more festive Christmas even whilst away from loved ones.”
Revd. Tim Linkens, Mission to Seafarers chaplain, said: “As we approach Christmas, seafarers are still out on their ships keeping global trade moving. When you see the news reports of the supply chain challenges that may cause issues getting the presents you want, you will rarely be told about the seafarers themselves. The Mission to Seafarers supports those who are away from home, missing their families and loved ones and it’s thanks to donations and volunteering efforts such as these that we are able to continue this vital work.”
Steve Pullen, Managing Director at DAN Shipping, said: “When Drax approached us with this volunteering opportunity, we were more than happy to contribute and support what is a truly worthwhile initiative. It was great to see the amount of donations and all the volunteers come together at the port to wrap the presents and then to meet some of the key workers. I hope this gesture shows them how much we appreciate the important work they do.”
Drax is committed to supporting the communities local to its operations through various initiatives including fundraising for
local charities
and supporting
education and skills

About Mission to Seafarers
There are 1.5 million seafarers across the world who are responsible for transporting over 90% of the world’s goods and fuels, making them essential key workers who often go unrecognised by the general population.
People working on ships can often spend months at a time far away from their loved ones, with limited internet access which can lead to loneliness and mental health issues.
To compensate for the lack of facilities available, the Mission to Seafarers Centres, spread across 50 countries, aim to provide Seafarers with:
Access to WiFi Internet and SIM cards
A comfortable place to rest and relax
The chance to get food and toiletries
Transport to shops and local amenities
Emotional and spiritual support

Drax breaks ground on exploratory works for historic energy storage expansion project
7 December 2022
Press releases

Exploratory ground investigations are now underway at its existing Cruachan facility in Scotland, where the company plans to build a new 600 MW underground plant. A 70m deep borehole is being drilled to recover rock core which will be analysed in a lab to determine structural and geological stability for elements of the new plant.
The preliminary works are being carried out whilst the project awaits consent from the Scottish Government alongside an updated policy and market support mechanism from the UK Government.

Increasing the UK’s pumped storage hydro capacity is critical to enabling more renewable power to come online, strengthening the country’s energy security whilst helping Britain decarbonise.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director, said:
“This is a significant moment in the expansion of Cruachan. The project team has been working extremely hard to move the development forward, and the start of ground investigation works is the next phase in delivering this vitally important new plant.
“The scale of the proposed development matches Drax’s ambitions when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. More than 2 million tonnes of rock will be excavated to create a new cavern inside the mountain which will be big enough to house Big Ben on its side.
“Expanding Cruachan will strengthen the UK’s energy security by enabling more homegrown renewable electricity to come online to power homes and businesses across the country. This major infrastructure project will support hundreds of jobs and provide a real boost to the Scottish economy.”
The new underground 600 MW plant would be one of the largest infrastructure projects carried out in Scotland for many years, with Drax expecting the plant to come online in 2030 following a six-year period of construction and an investment of around £500m.
The works are a major step forward for the development
Pumped storage hydro plants act like giant water batteries, using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from wind farms and other low carbon technologies when supply outstrips demand. These same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when it is needed.
In order to deploy this critical technology, Drax must secure consent from the Scottish Government alongside an updated policy and market support mechanism from the UK Government.
The existing lack of an appropriate framework for new long-duration, large-scale electricity storage technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects, with no new plants built anywhere in the UK since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation.

We expect a response to the application to be received in Q2 2023.
BEIS has
pledged
to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in large-scale, long-duration storage projects by 2024.
No investment decision has yet been taken by Drax and development remains subject to both development consent and an appropriate regulatory framework.

Drax supports UK energy security by helping businesses use less power
5 December 2022
Press releases

National Grid ESO is running its Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) to financially incentivise businesses to reduce electricity consumption when national demand is at its highest, typically on weekdays between 4pm and 7pm. Between November 2022 and March 2023, the ESO has announced that it will operate a maximum of 12 tests for participants.
Drax Energy Solutions has worked with its customers, including vehicle manufacturer Ford, to reduce their power demand by 30MW during these test periods  – the equivalent amount of electricity needed to power 60,000 UK homes. This additional flexibility helps National Grid ESO balance supply and demand amid the ongoing energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Drax’s customers are paid £3,000 per MWh to reduce their power consumption and with a reduction in demand of 30MW observed during the  test on 22 November , a revenue of £90,000 was achieved for participating customers.
Adam Hall, Drax’s Director of Energy Services said:
“This scheme provides a real opportunity for our supply customers with flexibility in their operations to play their part in strengthening Britain’s energy security this winter whilst cutting their electricity bills. We’re delighted that Drax Energy Solutions has become one of the very first approved providers, enabling our customers to benefit directly from participating in the scheme.
“We’ve been speaking with customers about the benefits the scheme offers their organisations and these conversations have been really positive. We’re delighted that customers including Ford have agreed to be part of the scheme, adjusting their manufacturing processes and offering more flexibility and stability to the grid whilst cutting their energy usage and contributing to their own net zero goals.”
The scheme was recently approved by Ofgem, and Drax is one of the first approved providers for DFS this winter.

Demand Flexibility Scheme
The Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) has been developed to allow the ESO to access additional flexibility when the national demand is at its highest – during peak winter days – which is not currently accessible to the ESO in real time. This new innovative service will allow consumers, as well as some industrial and commercial users (through suppliers/aggregators), to be incentivised for voluntarily flexing the time when they use their electricity.
As part of a range of tools designed to help manage the electricity system this winter, National Grid are collaborating with energy suppliers/aggregators to allow participating consumers and businesses to reduce their bills this winter.
How the service works
DFS began on 1 November 2022.
ESO will run a maximum of 12 tests for participants entering from 1 November 2022, where participants will receive dispatch instructions with the opportunity to receive a Guaranteed Acceptance Price for tests.
Four tests will take place in the first full month parties are signed up, followed by two tests in each subsequent month.
During a DFS tender, once bids from participants are accepted, participants will contact end consumers/asset owners and request that they deliver demand turn down for the specified bid window.
Parties can continue to sign up to the service after 1 November 2022.
Response is required for a minimum of 30 minutes.
Tender submissions are Pay as Bid.
The service will run until March 2023.
