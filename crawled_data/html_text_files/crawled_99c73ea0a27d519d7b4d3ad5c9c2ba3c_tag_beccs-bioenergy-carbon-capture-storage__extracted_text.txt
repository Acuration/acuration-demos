standards 9 november 2022 carbon capture angela hepworth commercial director drax in brief the voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage dacs at scale the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is developing a set of core carbon principles ccps drax support proposed principals if theyre applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals standards around additionality and the permanence of carbon removals may apply very differently to naturebased and engineered removals something that needs to be addressed explicitly theres growing recognition in governments and environmental organisations of the urgent need to develop highintegrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective parisaligned climate goals bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  and direct air carbon capture and storage  dacs  are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely the technology is proven developers are bringing forward projects and the most forwardthinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from beccs and dacs developers yet theres a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals drax is a worldleader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of highintegrity permanent co 2 removals by 2030 from its beccs projects in the uk and the us we support the development of rigorous standards for co 2 removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the co 2 removals theyre buying such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to however the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits rather than removals to create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale rethinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency core carbon principles the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is in the process of developing a set of core carbon principles ccps and assessment framework af intended to set new threshold standards for highquality carbon credits at drax we welcome and support the principals proposed by the integrity council however its crucial theyre applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals and support rather than prevent their development many ccps are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies among the most important principals include those stating removals must be robustly quantified with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity while safeguarding commercially sensitive information removal credits should be subject to robust independent thirdparty validation and verification credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits registries must be subject to appropriate governance to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability taking account of impacts on nature the climate and society there should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates or between countries bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel and that the article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldnt trigger corresponding adjustments to countries carbon inventories however as pioneers in the field we believe that two of the core carbon principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals supporting additionality and development incentives the ccps state the greenhouse gas ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional ie they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues engineered carbon removal credits such as beccs and dacs are by their nature additional they are developed for the specific purpose of removing co 2 from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere they also rely on revenue from carbon markets  largely the voluntary market at present but potentially compliance markets such as the uk and eu ets in the future however most early projects are likely to have some form of government support eg 45q in the us or contracts for difference in the uk from outside carbon credit revenues but that support isnt intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment  project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets engineered carbon removals have high upfront capital costs and its clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable additionality assessments should be riskbased if its clear that a technologytype is additional a technologylevel assessment should be sufficient this should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects compensating against nonpermanent storage on the topic of permanence that ccps state the ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent or if they have a risk of reversal any reversals shall be fully compensated a key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small  the risk of reversal for naturebased credits by contrast is much greater schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for naturebased credits are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool potentially as much as 10 are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a wellmanged geological store they also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators similarly where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with co 2 storage risk which place liabilities on storage owners operators or governments the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers at drax we believe the ccps provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals if applied pragmatically they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product theyre buying and provide a clear framework for project developers they can ensure that standards support rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as beccs and dacs which are essential to achieving our global climate goals tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  technology carbon removals is a global need the us is making it possible 20 october 2022 carbon capture key takeaways removing carbon from the atmosphere is urgent if we are to meet global climate targets the uss commitment to supporting carbon removal technologies creates an opportunity for new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs power stations the market for carbon credits is gaining increasing credibility and verification making it a source of financing for ambitious decarbonization projects carbon markets are needed now to make investment into vital removals projects possible in the us and globally after a summer of soaring temperatures across the northern hemisphere the global nature of climate change is more obvious than ever forest fires around the world in 2021 resulted in double the loss of tree cover than in 2001 while today more than 23 billion people face water stress from drought its clear that the action we take to help tackle the global climate emergency must be international too we believe that carbon dioxide co 2  removals will be crucial in addressing this global challenge experts and governments agree that in addition to economywide decarbonization removing carbon from the atmosphere is critical to meeting the goal of net zero co 2 emissions by midcentury the ipcc says 10 billion tons per year of removals will be needed in 2050 for the world to get to net zero thats a huge step up from the 40 million tons captured globally in 2021 but also a significant investment opportunity our ambition is to remove 4 million tons of co 2 through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs outside the uk per year while generating renewable baseload electricity and supporting healthy sustainable forests the likely contender for our first location the united states we already operate in communities across the us south employing more than 1200 people in our sustainable biomass pellet production  now we are preparing to build a new beccs power station in the region its clear to us that the us is an ideal market for beccs with its longrunning sustainable forest industry and range of suitable sites for permanent co 2 storage we see the countrys efforts to retire coal by 2030 and commitment to innovation as an opportunity to build one of the largest carbon removal projects in the us our first plant could be capable of permanently removing 2 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year while also generating 2terawatt hours of 247 renewable power the uss newly legislated commitment to tackling climate change through the inflation reduction act as well as the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent scenario planning for 100 clean electricity system are establishing it as the leading market to deploy new environmental technologies and a new frontier for permanent highquality emissions removals the need for high quality permanent emissions removals a net zero future is only possible through the widespread implementation of highintegrity carbon removals beccs offers this by combining low carbon renewable biomass power generation with carbon capture technology and secure permanent carbon sequestration beccs works by generating renewable electricity using biomass sourced from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 as they grow co 2 released in the generation process is captured and stored permanently and safely in geological rock formations the overall process removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it emits resulting in negative emissions this allows us to offer decarbonizing industries highquality carbon removals credits given the scale of co 2 that must be removed from the atmosphere and the importance for countries and companies around the world to reach net zero i believe this market for verified co 2 removal credits is a trilliondollar opportunity voluntary carbon markets have historically suffered from a lack of sustained and reliable investment due to fluctuating market prices and varying quality of the carbon credits they contain however increased oversight from investors ngos and independent bodies is encouraging credibility and integrity prompting sustained adoption by businesses drax group ceo will gardiner click to viewdownload weve demonstrated the growing appetite for carbon removals by signing the worlds largest carbon removals deal to date at new york climate week the agreement with respira an impactdriven carbon finance business  will allow it to purchase 400000 metric tons of co 2 removals cdrs a year from our north american operations this would enable other corporations and financial institutions to achieve their own co 2 emissions reduction targets by purchasing cdrs from respira deals like these make voluntary carbon markets a more effective means of reducing net co 2 emissions by securing commitments and driving investment in projects that deliver independently verified highquality emissions reductions as the global economy works towards its net zero targets co 2 removals will be crucial in reducing the still dangerously high levels of carbon in our atmosphere today beccs stands to be a powerful tool in a net zero future as the only technology capable of delivering both high quality permanent carbon removals while also delivering baseload renewable power the ability to generate power with negative emissions will be crucial for increasingly electrified economies as they move away from fossil fuels the potential for the us driven by a dynamic mix of markets investors and engaged consumers some of the most prominent us companies are pledging to reach net zero investing in 247 renewable power and other means to do so technology companies like alphabet apple and microsoft have laid out ambitious plans to decarbonize operations supply chains and even remove historic emissions other organizations like the first movers coalition include us companies from a range of sectors committing corporate purchasing power to solving difficult decarbonization challenges  this industry readiness is increasingly backed up by legislative policy action the recent inflation reduction act substantially increases the availability of the 45q tax credit for carbon capture and storage projects increasing their value from 50 a ton of carbon removals to 85 per ton helping to further support the business case needed to deploy technologies like beccs we believe the us is on the right track to create a market in which beccs can thrive the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent 100 clean electricity system report includes beccs in three of the four possible scenarios explored it forecasts the us will need between 714gw of installed beccs capacity by 2035 to achieve an electricity system with net zero co 2 emissions that equates to removals of approximately 55120 mt co 2 per year by 2035 the uss established forestry commercial industry with its credible commitment to sustainable management offers ample lowgrade wood and wood industry residues to power beccs the countrys longrunning exploration of co 2 capture and transport and history of industrial innovations means there are the skills supply chains and regulatory environment to undertake ambitious new infrastructure projects beccs is a proven technology and one that can scale up sooner than any other technology but action is needed now to make these markets that can deliver large scale carbon removals projects a reality action is needed now for responsible businesses with the desire to go further faster or for sectors still developing viable decarbonization routes carbon removals from beccs deliver real verifiable and permanent progress towards net zero and beyond to net negative its encouraging to see the us pass legislation that can facilitate investment into carbon removal technologies and develop the carbon credit market however carbon markets must have standards that are credible both in the business community and in the environmental and civil society collaboration between governments corporations and ngos will be critical to ensure we create systems that can tackle the climate emergency we cant afford to contemplate theoretical net zero futures buying and selling highquality permanent removals is the action we need today now is the time to capture the opportunity and be part of the solution together tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  technology  united states an introduction to carbon accounting 12 may 2022 sustainable business key takeaways tracking reporting and calculating carbon emissions are a key part of progressing countries industries and companies towards net zero goals as a newly established discipline carbon accounting still lacks standardisation and frameworks in how emissions are tracked reduced and mitigated the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol which lays out three scopes businesses should report and act upon carbon accounting evolves from reporting in the use of goals and timeframes in which targets are met timeframes are crucial in the deployment of technologies like carbon capture removals and achieving net zero how can countries and companies find a route to net zero emissions many organisations countries and industries have pledged to balance their emissions before midcentury they intend to do this through a combination of cutting emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere tracking and quantifying emissions understanding output reducing them and setting tangible targets that can be worked towards are all central to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  especially when it comes to carbon dioxide co 2  emissions and energy consumption reporting is already common practice and compulsory for businesses over a certain size in the uk however carbon accounting takes this a step further carbon reporting is a statement of physical greenhouse gas emissions that occur over a given period explains michael goldsworthy head of climate change and carbon strategy at drax carbon accounting relates to how those emissions are then processed and counted towards specific targets the methodologies for calculating emissions and determining contributions against targets may then have differing rules depending on which framework or standard is being reported against carbon accounting tools can help companies and counties understand their carbon footprint  how much carbon is being emitted as part of their operations who is responsible for them and how they can be effectively mitigated like how financial accounting may seek to balance a companys books and calculate potential profit carbon accounting seeks to do the same with emissions tracking what an entity emits and what it reduces removes or mitigates carbon accounting is therefore crucial in understanding how countries and companies can contribute to reaching net zero a new space how different organisations countries and industries approach carbon accounting is still an evolving process its as complex as financial accounting but with financial accounting theres a long standing industry that relies on wellestablished practices and principles carbon accounting by contrast is such a new space explains goldsworthy regardless of its infancy businesses and countries are already implementing standardised approaches to carbon accounting regulations such as emissions trading schemes and reporting systems such as streamlined energy and carbon reporting secr and the taskforce on climate related financial disclosure tcfd are beginning to deliver some degree of consistency in businesses carbon reporting other standards such as the ghg protocol have sought to provide a standardised basis for corporate reporting and accounting elsewhere voluntary carbon markets eg carbon offsets have also evolved to allow transferral of carbon reductions or removals between businesses providing flexibility to companies in delivering their climate commitments the challenge is in aligning these frameworks so that they work together for example emissions within a corporate inventory or offset programme must be accounted for in a way that is consistent with a national inventory to date these accounting systems have evolved independently with different rules and methodologies beginning to implement detailed carbon accounting upon which emissions reductions and removals can be based requires standardised understanding of what they are and where they come from reporting and tackling scope one two and three emissions the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol  this voluntary carbon reporting standard can be used by countries and cities as well as individual companies globally the ghg protocol categorises emissions in three different scopes called scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 understanding measuring and reporting these is a key factor in carbon accounting and can drive meaningful emissions reduction and mitigation scope one  direct emissions scope one emissions are those that come as a direct result of a company or countrys activities these can include fuel combustion at a factorys facilities for example or emissions from a fleet of vehicles scope one emissions are the most straightforward for an organisation to measure and report and easier for organisations to directly act on scope two  indirect energy emissions scope two emissions are those which come from the generation of energy an organisation uses these can include emissions form electricity steam heating and cooling a business may buy electricity for example from an electricity supplier which acquires power from a generator if that generator is a fossilfuelled power station the energy consumers scope two emissions will be greater than if it buys power from a renewable electricity supplier or generates its own renewable power the ability to change energy suppliers makes scope two relatively straightforward for organisations to act on assuming renewable energy sources are available in the area scope three  all other indirect emissions scope three is much broader it covers upstream and downstream lifecycle emissions of products used or produced by a company as well as other indirect emissions such as employee commuting and business travel emissions identifying and reducing these emissions across supply and value chains can be difficult for businesses with complex supply lines and global distribution networks they are also hard for companies to directly influence add in factors like emissions mitigations or offsetting and the carbon accounting can quickly become much more complex than simply reporting and reducing emissions that occur directly from a companys activities nevertheless these fullsystem overviews and wholeproduct lifecycle accounting are crucial to understanding the true impact of operations and organisations and to reach climate goals working to timelines setting goals with defined timelines and the development of rules that ensure consistent accounting is also crucial to implementing effective climate change mitigation frameworks throughout the global economy consider the uks aim to be net zero by 2050 or draxs ambition to be net negative by 2030 as goals with set timelines for many technologies the time scales over which targets are set have added relevance there are often upfront emissions to account for and operational emissions that may change over time take for example an electric vehicle the climate benefit will be determined by emissions from construction and the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power it a timeline of beccs at drax click to viewdownload looking at a brief snapshot at the beginning of its life say the first couple of years might not show any climate benefit compared to a vehicle using an internal combustion engine over the lifetime of the vehicle however meaningful emissions savings may become clear  especially if the electricity powering the vehicle continues to decarbonise over time this provides a challenge when setting carbon emissions targets targets set too far in the future potentially risk inaction in the short term while targets set over short periods risk disincentivising technologies that have substantial longterm mitigation potential delivering net zero some greenhouse gas emissions will be impossible to fully abate such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture while other sectors like aviation will be incredibly difficult to fully decarbonise this makes carbon removal technologies all the more critical to ensuring net zero is achieved technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  which combines lowcarbon biomassfuelled renewable power generation with carbon capture and storage ccs to permanently remove emissions from the atmosphere  are already under development however it is imperative that such technologies are accounted for using robust approaches to carbon accounting ensuring all emission and removals flows across the value chain are accurately calculated in accordance with best scientific practice in the case of beccs its vital that not only are emissions from processing and transporting biomass considered but also its potential impact on the land sector forests from which biomass is sourced will be managed for a variety of reasons such as mitigating natural disturbance delivering commercial returns and preserving ecosystems accurate accounting of these impacts is therefore key to ensuring such technologies deliver meaningful reductions in atmospheric co 2 within timeframes guided by science accounting for net zero while carbon accounting is crucial to reaching a true level of net zero in the uk and globally where residual emissions are balanced against removals the practice should not be used exclusively to deliver numerical carbon goals to deliver net zero its vital we have robust carbon accounting systems and targets in place ensuring we reduce fossil emissions as far as possible while also incentivising carbon removal solutions says goldsworthy however many removal solutions rely on the natural world and so it is critical that ecosystems are not only valued on a carbon basis but consider other environmental factors such as biodiversity as well tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture  decarbonisation  sustainability what is the carbon cycle 25 march 2022 carbon capture what is the carbon cycle all living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are vital carbon sinks absorbing around 76 million tonnes of co 2

transition to net zero emissions will require collaboration between science and industry new technologies and decarbonisation methods must be rooted in scientific research and testing drax has almost a decade of experience in using biomass as a renewable source of power  over that time our understanding around the effectiveness of bioenergy its role in improving forest health and ability to deliver negative emissions has accelerated research from governments and global organisations such as the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc increasingly highlight sustainably sourced biomass and bioenergys role in achieving net zero on a wide scale the european commission has also highlighted biomass potential to provide a solution that delivers both renewable energy and healthy sustainably managed forests frans timmermans the executive vicepresident of the european commission in charge of the european green deal has emphasised its importance in bringing economies to net zero saying without biomass were not going to make it we need biomass in the mix but the right biomass in the mix the role of biomass in a sustainable future moving away from fossil fuels means building an electricity system that is primarily based on renewables supporting wind and solar by providing electricity at times of low sunlight or wind levels will require flexible sources of generation such as biomass as well as other technologies like increased energy storage  in the uk the climate change committees ccc sixth carbon budget report lays out its balanced net zero pathway in this lead scenario the ccc says that bioenergy can reduce fossil emissions across the whole economy by 2 million tonnes of co 2 or equivalent emissions mtco 2 e per year by 2035 increasing to 25 mtco2e in 2045 foresters in working forest mississippi biomass is also expected to play a crucial role in supplying biofuels and hydrogen production for sectors of the global economy that will continue to use fuel rather than electricity such as aviation shipping and industrial processes the cccs balanced net zero pathway suggest that enough lowcarbon hydrogen and bioenergy will be needed to deliver 425 twh of nonelectric power in 2050  compared to the 1000 twh of power fossil fuels currently provide to industries today however bioenergy can only be considered to be good for the climate if the biomass used comes from sustainably managed sources good forest management practises ensure that forests remain sustainable sources of woody biomass and effective carbon sinks a report coauthored by ipcc experts examines the scientific literature around the climate effects principally co 2 abatement of sourcing biomass for bioenergy from forests managed according to sustainable forest management principles and practices the report highlights the dual impact managed forests contribute to climate change mitigation by providing material for forest products including biomass that replace greenhouse gas ghgintensive fossil fuels and by storing carbon in forests and in longlived forest products the role of biomass and bioenergy in decarbonising economies goes beyond just replacing fossil fuels the addition of carbon capture and storage ccs to bioenergy to create bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs enables renewable power generation while removing carbon from the atmosphere and carbon cycle permanently the negative emissions made possible by beccs are now seen as a fundamental part of many scenarios to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels beccs and the path to net zero the ipccs special report on limiting global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels emphasises that even across a wide range of scenarios for energy systems all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy  coupled with effective landuse that prevents it contributing to deforestation the second chapter of the report deals with pathways that can bring emissions down to zero by the midcentury bioenergy use is substantial in 15c pathways with or without ccs due to its multiple roles in decarbonising both electricity generation and other industries that depend on fossil fuels however its the negative emissions made possible by beccs that make biomass instrumental in multiple net zero scenarios the ipcc report highlights beccs alongside the associated afforestation and reforestation ar that comes with sustainable forest management are key components in pathways that limit climate change to 15 o c graphic showing how beccs removes carbon from the atmosphere click to viewdownload there are two key factors that make beccs and other forms of emissions removals so essential the first is their ability to neutralise residual emissions from sources that are not reducing their emissions fast enough and those that are difficult or even impossible to fully decarbonise aviation and agriculture are two sectors vital to the global economy with hardtoabate emissions negative emissions technologies can remove an equivalent amount of co 2 that these industries produce helping balance emissions and progressing economies towards net zero the second reason beccs and other negative emissions technologies will be so important in the future is in the removal of historic co 2 emissions what makes co 2 such an important ghg to reduce and remove is that it lasts much longer in the atmosphere than any other to help reach the paris agreements goal of limiting temperature rises to below 15 o c removing historic emissions from the atmosphere will be essential in the uk the cccs 2018 report  biomass in a lowcarbon economy  also points to beccs as both a crucial source of energy and emissions abatement it suggests that power generation from beccs will increase from 3 twh per year in 2035 to 45 twh per year in 2050 it marks a sharp increase from the 195 twh that biomass without ccs accounted for across 2020 according to electric insights data it also suggests that beccs could sequester 11 tonnes of co 2 for every tonne of biomass used providing clear negative emissions however the report makes clear that unlocking the potential of bioenergy and beccs is only possible when biomass stocks are managed in a sustainable way that as a minimum requirement maintains the carbon stocks in plants and soils over time with increased attention paid to forest management and land use there is a growing body of evidence that points to bioenergy as a winwin solution that can decarbonise power and economies while supporting healthy forests that effectively sequester co 2  how bioenergy ensures sustainable forests biomass used in electricity generation and other industries must come from sustainable sources to offer a renewable climate beneficial or low carbon source of power uk legislation on biomass sourcing states that operators must maintain an adequate inventory of the trees in the area including data on the growth of the trees and on the extraction of wood to ensure that wood is extracted from the area at a rate that does not exceed its longterm capacity to produce wood this is designed to ensure that areas where biomass is sourced from retain their productivity and ability to continue sequestering carbon ensuring that forestland remains productive and protected from landuse changes such as urban creep where vegetated land is converted into urban concreted spaces depends on a healthy market for wood products industries such as construction and furniture offer higher prices for higherquality wood while lowquality waste wood as well as residues from forests and woodindustry byproducts can be bought and used to produce biomass pellets  a report by forest 2 market examined the relationship between demand for wood and forests productivity and ability to sequester carbon in the us south where drax sources about twothirds of its biomass the report found that increased demand for wood did not displace forests in the us south instead it encouraged landowners to invest in productivity improvements that increased the amount of wood fibre and therefore carbon contained in the regions forests a synthesis report  which examines a broad range of research papers published in forest ecology and management in march of 2021 concluded from existing studies that claims of largescale damage to biodiversity from woody biofuel in the south east us are not supported the use of these forest residues as an energy source was also found to lead to net ghg greenhouse emissions savings compared to fossil fuels according to forest research  importantly the research shows that climate risks are not exacerbated because of biomass sourcing in fact the opposite is true with annual wood growth in the us south increasing by 112 between 1953 and 2015  delivering a winwin solution the european commissions jrc science for policy literature review and knowledge synthesis report  the use of woody biomass for energy production in the eu suggests a winwin forest bioenergy pathway is possible that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term while at the same time not damaging or even improving the condition of forest ecosystems however it also makes clear loselose situations is also a possible in which forest ecosystems are damaged without providing carbon emission reductions in policyrelevant timeframes winwin management practices must benefit climate change mitigation and have either a neutral or positive effect on biodiversity a winwin future would see the afforestation of former arable land with diverse and naturally regenerated forests the report also warns of tradeoffs between local biodiversity and mitigating carbon emissions or vice versa these must be carefully navigated to avoid creating a loselose scenario where biodiversity is damaged and natural forests are converted into plantations while beccs fails to deliver the necessary negative emissions in a future that will depend on science

selected to be one of the uks two priority ccs projects and were now setting out a strategy to take the business forward enabling drax to make an even greater contribution to global efforts to reach net zero we believe drax can deliver growth and become a global leader in sustainable biomass and negative emissions and a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation we aim to double our sustainable biomass production capacity by 2030  creating opportunities to double our sales to asia and europe where demand for biomass is increasing as countries transition away from coal as a global leader in negative emissions were going to scale up our ambitions internationally drax is now targeting 12 million tonnes of carbon removals each year by 2030 by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this includes the negative emissions we can deliver at drax power station in the uk and through potential newbuild beccs projects in north america and europe supporting a new sector of the economy which will create jobs clean growth and exciting export opportunities capital markets day drax is today hosting a capital markets day for investors and analysts will gardiner and members of his leadership team will update on the groups strategy market opportunities and development projects the day will outline the significant opportunities drax sees to grow its biomass supply chain biomass sales and beccs as well as longterm dispatchable generation from biomass and pumped storage purpose and ambition the groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030 the group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars which are closely aligned with global energy policies which increasingly recognise the unique role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change strategic pillars to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets to be a global leader in negative emissions to be a leader in uk dispatchable renewable generation the development of these pillars remains underpinned by the groups continued focus on safety sustainability and biomass cost reduction a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets drax believes that the global market for sustainable biomass will grow significantly creating opportunities for sales to third parties in asia and europe beccs generation and other longterm uses of biomass delivery of these opportunities is supported by the expansion of the groups biomass pellet production capacity the group has 13 operational pellet plants with nameplate capacity of c4mt plus a further two plants currently commissioning and other developmentsexpansions which will increase this to c5mt once complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity to deliver this additional capacity drax is developing a pipeline of organic projects principally focused on north america drax expects to take a final investment decision on 051mt of new capacity in 2022 targeting returns significantly in excess of the groups cost

creation of new business development teams in tokyo and london drax is a major producer supplier and user of biomass active in all areas of the supply chain with longterm relationships and almost 20 years of experience in biomass operations the groups innovation in coaltobiomass engineering supply chain management and leadership in negative emissions can be deployed alongside its large reliable and sustainable supply chain to support customer decarbonisation journeys with longterm partnerships drax expects to sell all the biomass it produces based on an appropriate market price typically with longterm indexlinked contracts continued focus on cost reduction in 2018 the groups biomass production cost was 166t 2  at the h1 2021 results through a combination of fibre sourcing operational improvements and capacity expansion including the acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc the production cost had reduced to 141t 2  draxs aims to use the combined expertise of drax and pinnacle

5 and the coalition for negative emissions 6 have both outlined a clear role for beccs in delivering the negative emissions required to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels and to achieve net zero by 2050 identifying a requirement of between 2bn and 7bn tonnes of negative emissions globally from beccs separately the uk government has recently published its net zero strategy and biomass policy statement reaffirming the established international scientific consensus that sustainable biomass is renewable and that it will play a critical role in helping the uk achieve its climate targets it also signposted an ambition for at least 5mt pa of negative emissions from beccs and direct air capture by 2030 23mt pa by 2035 and up to 81mt pa by 2050 the reports commit the government to the development during 2022 of a financial model to support beccs to meet these requirements subject to the right regulatory environment drax plans to transform drax power station into the worlds biggest carbon capture project using beccs to permanently remove 8mt of co 2 emissions from the atmosphere each year by 2030 the project is well developed the technology is proven and an investment decision could be taken in 2024 with the first beccs unit operational in 2027 and a second in 2030 subject to the right investment framework the group aims to build on this innovation with a new target to deliver 4mt of negative co 2 emissions pa from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation the uks plans to achieve net zero by 2050 will require the electrification of heating and transport systems resulting in a significant increase in demand for electricity drax believes that over 80 of this could be met by intermittent renewable and inflexible lowcarbon energy sources  wind solar and nuclear however this will only be possible if the remaining power sources can provide the dispatchable power and nongeneration system support services the power system requires to ensure security of supply and to limit the cost to the consumer longterm biomass generation and pumped storage hydro can provide these increasingly important services drax power station is the uks largest source of renewable power by output and the largest dispatchable plant the group is continuing to develop a lower cost operating model for this asset supported by a reduction in fixed costs associated with the end of coal operations drax is also developing an option for new pumped storage  cruachan ii  which could take a final investment decision in 2024 and be operational by 2030 providing an additional 600mw of dispatchable longduration storage to the power system in its smart systems and flexibility plan july 2021 the uk government described longduration storage technologies as essential for achieving net zero and has committed to take actions to derisk investment for largescale and longduration storage capital allocation and dividend strategic capital investment 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity beccs at drax power station and cruachan ii is expected to be in the region of 3bn between 2022 and 2030 backed by longterm contracted cashflows and targeting high singledigit returns and above no final investment decision has been taken on any of these projects and both beccs and cruachan ii remain subject to further clarity on regulatory and funding mechanisms the group believes these investments can be selffunded through strong cash generation over the period with net debt to adjusted ebitda significantly below 2x at the end of 2030 providing flexibility to support further investment such as newbuild beccs as these options develop drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017 noting that average annual dividend growth was around 10 in the last 5years webcast

safely move co2 from the atmosphere to permanent storage 15 october 2021 carbon capture key points carbon capture usage and storage ccus offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the uks emissions and help the country reach its climate goals carbon dioxide co 2  can be stored in geological reservoirs under the north sea but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe co 2 transportation network the uk already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating cooking and power generation this provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport co 2  across the length of the uk is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground these pipes arent carrying water or broadband but gas natural gas is a cornerstone of the uks energy powering our heating cooking and electricity generation but like the countrys energy network the need to reduce emissions and meet the uks target of net zero emissions by 2050 is set to change this today this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the north sea bed and distributes it around the uk to be burned  producing emissions a similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions such as co 2  away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations locking them away underground permanently and safely  conveyer system at drax power station transporting sustainable wood pellets the rise of ccus technology is the driving force behind co 2 transportation the process captures co 2 from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs takes this a step further beccs uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity this biomass comes from sources such as forest residues or agricultural waste products which remove co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow atmospheric co 2 released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations across the whole beccs process co 2 has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere and delivering whats known as negative emissions  beccs is a crucial technology for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 but how can we ensure the co 2 is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites moving gases around safely moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure by compressing gas to a high pressure it allows it to flow to other locations compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks the greater the pressure difference between two points the faster gases will flow in the case of co 2  high absolute pressures also cause it to become whats known as a supercritical fluid this means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines since 1967 when north sea natural gas first arrived in the uk our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably and is today made up of almost 290000 km of pipelines that run the length of the country along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of wellenforced regulations monitoring their operation while moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new the idea of co 2 transportation through pipelines is but its not unprecedented as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across north america in contrast to beccs which would transport co 2 to remove and permanently store emissions most of the co 2 transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery  a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells however the principle of moving co 2 safely over long distances remains relevant  there are already 2500 km of pipelines in the western usa transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of co 2 a year people might worry when there is something new moving around in the country but the science community doesnt have sleepless nights about co 2 pipelines says dr hannah chalmers from the university of edinburgh it wouldnt explode like natural gas might thats just not how the molecule works if its properly installed and regulated theres no reason to be concerned co 2 is not the same as the methanebased natural gas that people use every day for one it is a much more stable inert molecule meaning it does not react with other molecules and it doesnt fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would co 2 has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make ccus and beccs a catalyst in reducing the uks emissions and futureproofing its economy working with co 2 across the uk working with co 2 while it is in a supercritical state mean its not just easier to move around pipes in this state co 2 can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas or saltdense water reserves decades of extracting fossil fuels from the north sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood the expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the uk an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space  something a number of industrial clusters on the uks east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload drax is already running a pilot beccs project at its power station in north yorkshire as part of the zero carbon humber partnership and wider east coast cluster drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the north sea that can serve the humber and teesside industrial clusters as drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 transporting co 2 safely at scale is a key focus much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project explains richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax transporting and storing co2 captured by the beccs projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the yorkshire region this also includes research and development into pipes of different materials carrying co 2 at different pressures and temperatures as well as fracture and safety testing the potential for the uk to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable however for it to fully manifest it will need commitment at a national level to building the additional infrastructure required the results of such a commitment could be far reaching in the humber alone 20 of economic value comes from energy and emissionsintensive industries and as many as 360000 jobs are supported by industries like refining petrochemicals manufacturing and power generation putting in place the technology and infrastructure to capture transport and store emissions will protect those industries while helping the uk reach its climate goals its just a matter of

bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is the process of capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide co 2  from biomass organic matter energy generation why is beccs important for decarbonisation when sustainable bioenergy is paired with carbon capture and storage it becomes a source of negative emissions as co 2 is permanently removed from the carbon cycle experts believe that negative emissions technologies nets are crucial to helping countries meet the longterm goals set out in the paris climate agreement as beccs is the most scalable of these technologies this decade it has a key role to play in combating climate change how is the bioenergy for beccs generated most bioenergy is produced by combusting biomass as a fuel in boilers or furnaces to produce highpressure steam that drives electricitygenerating turbines  alternatively bioenergy generation can use a wide range of organic materials including crops specifically planted and grown for the purpose as well as residues from agriculture forestry and wood products industries energydense forms of biomass such as compressed wood pellets  enable bioenergy to be generated on a much larger scale fuels like wood pellets can also be used as a substitute for coal in existing power stations  how is the carbon captured beccs uses a postcombustion carbon capture process  where solvents isolate co 2 from the flue gases produced when the biomass is combusted the captured co 2 is pressurised and turned into a liquidlike substance so it can then be transported by pipeline  how is the carbon stored captured co 2 can be safely and permanently injected into naturally occurring porous rock formations for example unused natural gas reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers water permeable rocks saturated with salt water this process is known as sequestration  over time the sequestered co 2 may react with the minerals locking it chemically into the surrounding rock through a process called mineral storage beccs fast facts two 600 megawatt mw biomass units upgraded with carbon capture technology could deliver 40 of the negative emissions the climate change committee indicates will be needed from beccs for the uk to reach netzero by 2050 beccs has the potential to remove 2070 million tonnes of co 2 per year in the uk by 2050 all national grids net zero future energy scenarios fes deploy beccs by 2028 and see a rapid increase in capacity in the 2030s there are 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space around the uk according to the british geological survey is beccs sustainable bioenergy can be generated from a range of biomass sources ranging from agricultural byproducts to forestry residues to organic municipal waste during their lifetime plants absorb co 2 from the atmosphere this balances out the co 2 that is released when the biomass is combusted whats crucial is that the biomass is sustainably sourced  be it from agriculture or forest waste responsibly managed sources of biomass are those which naturally regenerate or are replanted and regrown where theres a increase of carbon stored in the land and where the natural environment is protected from harm biomass wood pellets used as bioenergy in the uk for example are only sustainable when the forests they are sourced from continue to grow sourcing decisions must be based on science and not adversely affect the longterm potential of forests to store and sequester carbon biomass pellets can also create a sustainable market for forestry products which serves to encourage reforestation and afforestation  leading to even more co 2 being absorbed from the atmosphere go deeper the triple benefits for the environment and economy of deploying beccs in the uk how beccs can

twopart business model for beccs of carbon payment and power cfd offers a clear path to technology neutral and subsidy free ggrs the uks electricity system is based on a market of buying and selling power and other services  for this to work electricity must be affordable to consumers but the parties providing power must be able to cover the costs of generating electricity emitting carbon dioxide co 2  and getting electricity to where it needs to be this process has thrived and proved adaptable enough to rapidly decarbonise the electricity system in the space of a decade with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation  the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is one of the key technologies needed at scale for the uk to reach net zero yet there is no market for the negative emissions beccs can deliver in contrast to other energy system services  beccs has been repeatedly flagged as vital for the uk to reach its climate goals owing to its ability to deliver negative emissions  the climate change committee has demonstrated that negative emissions  also known as greenhouse gas removals ggrs or carbon removals  will be needed at scale to achieve net zero to offset residual emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and agriculture but there is no economic mechanism to reward negative emissions in the energy market for decarbonisation technologies like beccs in power to develop to the scale and within the timeframe needed the government must implement the necessary policies to incentivise investment and allow them to thrive as part of the energy and carbon markets beccs is essential to bringing the whole economy to net zero the primary benefit of beccs in power is its ability to deliver negative emissions by removing co 2 from the atmosphere through responsibly managed forests  energy crops or agricultural residues then storing the same amount of co 2 underground while producing reliable renewable electricity looking down above units one through five within drax power station a new report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary cornerstone of uk decarbonisation and its wider impacts on a net zero economy developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would have positive spillover effects that contribute to wider decarbonisation green growth and the uks ability to meet its legallybinding climate commitments by 2050 drax has a unique opportunity to fit carbon capture and storage ccs equipment to its existing biomass generation units to turn its north yorkshire site into what could be the worlds first carbon negative power station plans are underway to build a co 2 pipeline in the yorkshire and humber region which would move carbon captured from at drax out to a safe longterm storage site deep below the north sea this infrastructure would be shared with other ccs projects in the zero carbon humber partnership  enabling the uks most carbonintensive region to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing beccs can also have spillover benefits for other emerging industries lessons that come from developing and operating the first beccs power stations as well as transport and storage infrastructure will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects hydrogen production for example is regarded as a key to providing low zero or carbon negative alternatives to natural gas in power industry transport and heating learnings from increased bioenergy usage in beccs can help develop biomass gasification as a means of hydrogen production as well as applying ccs to other production methods the economic value of these positive spillovers from beccs can be far reaching but they will not be felt unless beccs can achieve a robust business model in the immediate future with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation designing a beccs business model the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis outlined several key factors to consider in assessing how to make carbon capture usage and storage ccus economically viable these are also valid for beccs development engineers working within the turbine hall drax power station one of the primary needs for a beccs business model is to instil confidence in investors  by creating a policy framework that encourages investors to back innovative new technologies reduces risk and inspires new entrants into the space the cost of developing a beccs project should also be fairly distributed among contributing parties ensuring that costs to consumerstaxpayers are minimised building from these principles there are three potential business models that can enable beccs to be developed at the scale and in the timeframe needed to bring the uk to net zero emissions in 2050 power contract for difference cfd by protecting consumers from price spikes and beccs generators and investors from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power this approach offers security to invest in new technology the strike price could also be adjusted to take into account negative emissions delivered and spillover benefits as well as the cost of power generation carbon payment another approach is contractual fixed carbon payments that would offer a beccs power station a set payment per tonne of negative emissions which would cover the operational and capital costs of installing carbon capture technology on the power station this would be a new form of support and unfamiliar to investors who are already versed in cfds the advantage of introducing a policy such as fixed carbon payment is its flexibility and it could be used to support other methods of ggr or ccs the same scheme could be adjusted to reward for example co 2 captured through ccs in industry or direct air carbon capture and storage daccs it could even be used to remunerate measurable spillover benefits from frontrunning beccs projects carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two above the frontier report says it would be the most effective business model for supporting a beccs in power project carbon payments would act as an incentive for negative emissions and spillovers while cfds would then cover the costs of power generation cost and revenue profiles of alternative support options based on assuming a constant level of output over time way to go hybrid why does the hybrid business model of power cfd with carbon payment come out on top frontier considered how easy or difficult it would be to transition each of the options to a technology neutral business model for future projects and then to a subsidy free business model by looking ahead to tech neutrality the business model would not unduly favour negative emissions technologies  such as beccs at drax  that are available to deploy at scale in the 2020s over those that might come online later plus the whole point of subsidies is to help to get essential fledgling technologies and business models off to a flying start until the point they can stand on their own two feet the report concluded ease of transition to technology neutrality  all three options are unlikely to have any technology neutral elements in the shortterm although they could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral and ease of transition to subsidy free  while all of the options can transition to a subsidy free system the power cfd does not create any policy learnings around treatment of negative emissions that contribute to this transition the other two options do create learnings around a carbon payment for negative emissions that can eventually be broadened to other ggrs and then captured within an efficient co 2 market overall we conclude that the twopart business model performs best on this criterion the other two options perform less well with the power cfd performing worst as it does not deliver learnings around remunerating negative emissions assessment of business model options green indicates that the criteria is largely met yellow indicates that it is partially met and red indicates that it is not met transition to a net zero future engineer inspects carbon capture pilot plant at drax power station crucial to the implementation of beccs is the feasibility of these business models in terms of their practicality in being understood by investors how quickly they can be put into action and how they will evolve or be replaced in the longterm as technologies mature and costs go down this can be improved by using models that are comparable with existing policies these business models can only deliver beccs in power as well as other negative emissions technologies at scale and enable the uk to reach its 2050 net zero target if they are implemented now every year of stalling delays the impact positive spillovers and negative emissions can have on global co 2 levels the uk government must provide the private sector with the confidence to deliver beccs and other net zero technologies in the time frame needed go deeper explore the
