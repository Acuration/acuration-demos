august 2020 opinion reduced demand boosted renewables and the neartotal abandonment of coal pushed last quarters carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes emissions are at their lowest in modern times having fallen by threequarters compared to the same period ten years ago the average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kwh of electricity consumed over the quarter the carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just 18 gkwh in the middle of the spring bank holiday  clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix together nuclear and renewables produced 90 of britains electricity leaving just 28 gw to come from fossil fuels the generation mix over the spring bank holiday weekend highlighting the mix on the sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record national grid and other gridmonitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 gkwh at that time that was still a record low but very different from the electric insights numbers so why the discrepancy these sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation  as opposed to consumption  not all the electricity we consume is generated in britain and not all the electricity generated in britain is consumed here should the emissions from power stations in the netherlands count towards our carbon footprint if they are generating power consumed in our homes earths atmosphere would say yes as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities co 2 has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced on that bank holiday afternoon britain was importing 2 gw of electricity from france and belgium which are mostly powered by lowcarbon nuclear we were exporting threequarters of this 15 gw to the netherlands and ireland while they do have sizeable shares of renewables they also rely on coal power britains exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources so the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders we estimate that 1190 tonnes of co 2 were produced here 165 were emitted in producing our imports and 730 avoided through our exports in the longterm it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out over the whole quarter carbon emissions would be 153gkwh with our measure or 151 gkwh with productionbased accounting but it does matter on the hourly timescale consumption based accounting swings more widely imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24 th  but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 gkwh when renewable output is high in britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it and this helps to clean their power systems when renewables are low britain will import if power from ireland and the continent is lower cost but it may well be higher carbon two measures for the carbon intensity of british electricity over the bank holiday weekend and surrounding days this speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy should we use production or consumption based accounting with production by far the most common measure  the uk is doing very well and overall emissions are down 32 so far this century with consumptionbased accounting its a very different story and theyre only down 13   this is because we import more from abroad everything from manufactured goods to food to data when streaming music and films online either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions on the one hand productionbased accounting  britain could be producing 100 clean power but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand  that should not be classed as zero carbon as its pushing the problem elsewhere on the other hand consumptionbased accounting  it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running if we got to 96 low carbon 1300 mw of gas running we would be down at 25 gkwh then if we imported fully from france and sent it to the netherlands and ireland wed get down to 0 gkwh regardless of how you measure carbon intensity it is important to recognise that britains electricity is cleaner than ever the hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception by continuing to expand renewable generation preparing the grid for their integration and introducing negative emissions technologies such as beccs  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  read full report pdf  read full report  read press release electric insights q2 2020 report click to viewdownload tags national grid  energy policy  electric insights  decarbonisation  electricity generation the cost of staying in control iain staffell imperial college london opinion the cost of keeping britains power system stable has soared and now adds 20 onto the cost of generating electricity the actions that national grid takes to manage the power system have typically amounted to 5 of generation costs over the last decade but this share has quadrupled over the last two years in the first half of 2020 the cost of these actions averaged 100 million per month supplying electricity to our homes and workplaces needs more than just power stations generating electricity supply and demand must be kept perfectly in balance  and flows of electricity around the country must be actively managed to keep all the interconnected components stable and prevent blackouts national grids costs for taking these actions have been on the rise as we reported over the previous two summers  but recently they have skyrocketed at the start of the decade balancing added about 1mwh to the cost of electricity but last quarter it surpassed 5mwh for the first time see below balancing prices have risen in step with the share of variable renewables the dashed line below shows that for every extra percent of electricity supplied by wind and solar adds 10 pence per mwh to the balancing price last quarter really bucks this trend though and balancing prices have risen 35 above the level expected from this trend the uk energy research centre predicted that wind and solar would add up to 5mwh to the cost of electricity due to their intermittency  and britain has now reached this point albeit a few years earlier than expected this is partly because keeping the power system stable is requiring more interventions than ever before with low demand and high renewable generation national grid is having to order more wind farms to reduce their output at a cost of around 20 million per month they even had to take out a 50 million contract to reduce the output from the sizewell b nuclear reactor at times of system stress left the quarterlyaverage cost of balancing the power system expressed as a percentage of the cost of generation right balancing price shown against share of variable renewables with dots showing the average over each quarter a second reason for the price rise is that national grids costs of balancing are passed on to generators and consumers who pay per mwh as demand has fallen by a sixth since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic the increased costs are being shared out among a smaller base  ofgem has stepped in to cap the balancing service charges at a maximum of 10mwh until late october their covid support scheme will defer up to 100 million of charges until the following year for a quarter of a century the electricity demand in gb ranged from 19 to 58 gw   historically demand minus the intermittent output of wind and solar farms never fell below 14 gw however in each month from april to june this year this net demand fell below 7 gw just as a mclaren sports car is happier going at 70 than 20 mph the national grid is now being forced to operate well outside its comfort zone this highlights the importance of the work that national grid must do towards their ambition to be ready for a zerocarbon system by 2025 the fact we are hitting these limits now rather than in a few years time is a direct result of covid running the system right at its limits is having a shortterm financial impact and is teaching us lessons for the longterm about how to run a leaner and highlyrenewable power

lockdown every day is a sunday iain staffell imperial college london 21 may 2020 opinion on march 23rd the uk took an unprecedented move to tackle the coronavirus most business that had not already closed moved online with millions of people now working from home this had a huge impact on electricity demand consumption on weekdays fell by 13 to its lowest levels since 1982  a time when there were 10 million fewer people in the country and gdp was a third lower than today other regions have seen a similar collapse in electricity demand spain italy and france have all seen electricity demand fall by 1015 according to analysis by ember  across the atlantic new york city has seen similar reductions demand has fallen for a simple reason with schools and workplaces now closed or running with a greatly reduced staff  machinery computers lights and heaters are not drawing power electric rail tram and tube systems are also running a reduced service on the contrary with more people at home household electricity consumption has increased octopus energy estimate that during social distancing before the stricter lockdown came into effect homes were consuming up to a third more electricity adding 20 per month to the typical bill the impact of lockdown on britains electricity demand is much like living through a month of sundays  the average profile for a march weekend day in previous years looks very similar to the daily profile for weekdays since lockdown begun  both in the amount of electricity consumed and the structure postlockdown weekends have even lower demand tracking 11 below weekday demand people no longer have to get up at the crack of dawn for work on a typical weekday morning demand would rise by 10 gw over two hours from 530 to 730 am now it takes more than twice as long  until midday  for this rise to occur at the other end of the day there would normally be a small peak in demand around 8 pm from people gathering in pubs and restaurants up and down the country both on weekdays and weekends demand begins falling earlier in the evening as the sofa has become the only available social venue with lower demand comes lower power prices wholesale electricity prices are typically 7 lower on sundays than on weekdays for this reason march saw the lowest monthlyaverage power price in 12 years down onethird on this month last year prices were already heading downwards because of the falling price of gas but the lockdown has amplified this and negative prices have become commonplace during the middle of the day there was not a visible impact on carbon emissions during the first quarter of the year as only the last week of march was affected however as lockdown continued into april and may emissions from power production in britain have fallen by 35 on the same period last year the effect is slightly stronger across europe with carbon emissions falling almost 40 as dirtier coal and lignite power stations are being turned down will some of these effects persist after lockdown restrictions are eased it is too early to tell as it depends on what longlasting economic and behavioural changes occur electricity demand is linked with the countrys gdp which is set to face the largest downturn in three centuries  whether the economy bounces back or is afflicted with a lasting depression will be key to future electricity demand it will also depend on behavioural shifts people are of course craving their lost freedoms many may appreciate not going back to a lengthy daily commute  and the rise of video conferencing and collaboration apps has shown that remote working may finally have come of age with even a small share of the population continuing to work from home on some days there could be a lasting impact on

what makes a countrys electricity system stable 23 december 2019 power generation how reliable is great britains electricity system across the country electricity is accessible and safe to use for just about everyone every day widescale blackouts are very rare but they do happen on 9 august 2019 a power cut saw more than 1 million people and services lose power for just under an hour it was the first largescale blackout since 2013 although this proves the network is not infallible the fact it was such an outlier in the normal performance of the grid highlights its otherwise exemplary stability and reliability but what is it exactly that makes an electricity system stable and reliable at its core system stability comes down to two key factors a country or regions ability to generate enough electricity and its ability to then transport it through a transmission system to where its needed when everything is running smoothly an electricity system is described as being balanced  in this state supply meets demand exactly and all necessary conditions  such as voltage and frequency  are right for the safe and efficient transport of electricity any slight deviation or mismatch across any of these factors can cause power stations or infrastructure to trip and cut off power a recent report by electric insights identified the countries around the world with most reliable power systems in which the uk was fourth it offers an insight into what factors contribute to building a stable system as well as those that hold some countries back generation and reliable infrastructure according to the report france has the most reliable electricity system of any country with a population of more than five million people having gone a decade without a power outage one reason for this is the countrys fleet of 58 statecontrolled nuclear power stations which generate huge amounts of consistent baseload power in 2017 nuclear power made up more than 70 of frances electricity generation while hydropower accounted for another 10 of the 475 terawatt hours twh consumed across the county that year penly nuclear power station near dieppe france now as its nuclear stations age france is increasing its renewable power generation as these sources are often weather dependent imports from and exports to its neighbours are expected to become a more important part of keeping the french network stable at times when there is little sunlight or wind  or too much importing and exporting electricity is also key to switzerlands power system third most reliable network on the list with 41 bordercrossing power lines allowing the country to serve as a crossroads for power flowing between italy and germany it means its total imports and exports can often exceed electricity production within the country electricity pylons in switzerland switzerlands mountainous landscape also means ensuring a reliable electricity system requires a carefully maintained transmissions system the swiss grid is 6700 kilometres long and uses 40000 hitech metering points along it to record and process around 10000 data points in seconds  the key to the stability of south korea  the second most stable network on the list  is also its imports but rather than actual megawatts it comes in the form of oil gas and coal the country is the worlds fourth biggest coal importer and its coal power stations account for 42 of its total generation seoul south korea however in the face of urban smog issues and global decarbonisation goals it is pursuing a switch to renewables this can come with repercussions to stability so south korea is also investing in transmission infrastructure including a new interconnector from the east of the country to seoul its main source of electricity consumption it highlights that if decarbonisation is going to accelerate at the pace needed to meet paris agreement targets then many of the worlds most stable and reliable electricity systems need to go through significant change balance will be needed between meeting decarbonisation targets with overall system stability however there are many countries around the world that focus less on ensuring consistent stability through decarbonisation and are instead more focused on how to achieve stability in the first place stalling generation the democratic republic of congo is the eleventhlargest country on earth it is rich with minerals and resources yet it is the least electrified nation just 9 of people have access to power in rural areas that number drops to just 1 and the country suffers blackouts more than once a month as a result of load shedding when there isnt enough power to meet demand so parts of the grid are deliberately shut down to prevent the entire system failing currently the country has just 27 gw of installed electricity capacity 25 gw of which comes from hydropower  the countrys inga dam facility on the congo river has the potential to generate more electricity than any other single source of power on the planet its thought the proposed grand inga site could produce as much as 40 gw  twice that of chinas three gorges dam and provide electricity to a massive part of southern africa a legacy of political instability in the country however has so far made securing financing difficult congo river democratic republic of congo nigeria is one of the worlds fastest growing economies and with that comes rapidly rising demand for electricity however just 45 of the country is currently electrified and of these areas many still suffer outages at least once a month the country has 125 gw of installed capacity most of which comes from thermal gas stations but technical problems in power stations and infrastructure mean it is often only capable of generating as much as 5 gw to transmit on to end consumers this limited production capability means it often fails to meet demand resulting in outages the problem has been prolonged by struggling utility companies that are unable to make the investments needed to stabilise electricity supply keen to resolve what it has referenced as an energy supply crisis the nigerian government recently secured a 1 billion credit line from the world bank to improve access to electricity across the country the investment will focus in part on securing the transmission system from theft thus allowing the private utility companies to generate the revenue needed to improve generation transmission holding back emerging systems balancing transmissions systems is a crucial part of stable electricity networks maintaining a steady frequency that delivers safe usable electricity into homes and businesses is at the crux of reliability even countries that can generate enough electricity are held back if they cant efficiently get the electricity to where it is needed brazil has an abundance of hydropower installed its 97 gw of hydro accounts for more than 70 of the countrys electricity mix  however the countrys dams are largely concentrated around the amazon basin in the north west whereas demand comes from cities in the south and eastern coastline transporting electricity across long distances between generator and consumer makes it difficult to maintain the correct voltage and frequency needed to keep a stable and reliable flow of electricity as a result brazil suffers a blackout every onetothree months hydropower plant henry borden in the serra do mar brazil the country is tackling its transmissions problems by diversifying its electricity mix to include greater levels of solar and wind off its east coast  closer to many of its major cities the country has also looked to new technology for solutions at the start of the decade as much as 8 of all electricity being generated in brazil was being stolen  reaching as high as 40 in some areas these illegal hookups both damage infrastructure making it less reliable as well as blur the true demand making grid management challenging brazil has since deployed smart meters to measure electricitys journey from power stations to end users more accurately allowing operators to spot anomalies sooner electricity theft is a major problem in many developing regions with as much as 10 billion worth of power lost each year in india which suffers blackouts as often as brazil it highlights that even when there is generation to meet demand maintaining stability at a large scale requires constant attention and innovation as new challenges arise this looks different around the world some countries might face challenges in shifting from stable thermalbased systems to renewables others are attempting to build stability into newly connected networks but no matter where in the world electricity is being used ensuring reliability is an everongoing task electric insights is commissioned by drax and delivered by a team of independent academics from imperial college london

staffell imperial college london 29 august 2019 opinion electric vehicles are fast becoming mainstream there are now well over 200000 on britains roads and this number is growing by 30 per year 1 in 40 cars sold in britain is now electric around one third of which are pure battery models and two thirds are plugin hybrid 1 this radical shift is just beginning though britains electric vehicle fleet is expected to expand tenfold over the next five to ten years in more optimistic scenarios half of all vehicles on the road could be electric just fifteen years from now 2 while many see evs as the cleanest way to drive they are still the subject of much speculation recent criticisms range from a uk government report saying they wont end air pollution 3 to a string of studies often debunked claiming they emit more co 2 than diesel equivalents 4 the arguments are simple how can it be cleaner to swap a petrol car for electric if it is recharged using electricity from dirty coal or gas secondly how can electric vehicles repay the energy needed for mining lithium and to assemble the huge batteries that power them we review academic studies of battery manufacture and use data from electric insights to answer these questions on average britains evs emit just one quarter the co 2 of conventional petrol and diesel vehicles if the carbon emitted in making their battery is included this rises to only half the co 2 of a conventional vehicle electric vehicles bought today could be emitting just a tenth that of a petrol car in five years time as the electricity system is widely expected to continue moving towards lowcarbon sources manufacturing each kwh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol 5 electric vehicles typically have a battery capacity ranging from 30 kwh for small city hatchbacks up to 100 kwh for topend models  manufacturing the latter emits as much carbon as three roundtheworld flights more co 2 is emitted in building the battery for premium ev model than from the recharging it over a 15year lifetime 6 however the most efficient ev models could need just two to three years of driving to save the amount of carbon emitted in producing their batteries smaller evs with modest battery sizes are better for the environment whereas the largest luxury ev models could need three times longer to pay back their carbon cost hatchbacks small hatchbacks are the bestselling type of electric vehicles led by the nissan leaf they are also the cleanest to drive as they are small and light electric models currently emit around 33 grams of co 2 per km driven which is one quarter that of the most popular conventional vehicle a 2019 ford fiesta volkwagen eup electric car showcased at the frankfurt iaa motor show 2017 these electric models typically come with a 3045 kwh battery which pushes their lifetime emissions up around 60 gkm this is still less than half the emissions of a petrol or diesel car with the projected changes to the grid mix this will fall to less than one third of a standard car in just five years time ev models nissan leaf renault zoe volkswagen egolf and eup hyundai kona and bmw i3

4572 gkm including battery emissions with 2025 grid mix 1220 gkm from recharging 2852 gkm including battery luxury luxury saloons and suv models include the iconic tesla models s and x and the new jaguar ipace these are much larger and need more energy to move meaning they have higher emissions than hatchbacks at 4454 gkm this is still just a quarter of the emissions from a comparable conventional car a top of the range mercedes sclass jaguar i pace ev the lifetime emissions of these luxury evs are notably higher though pushed up by the enormous 90100 kwh batteries they use to provide a driving range of over 250 miles these batteries are responsible for more co 2 emissions than driving the car over its entire lifetime models considered jaguar ipace tesla model s and model x

performance is comparable to small hatchbacks and they also currently emit around a quarter of the co2 of the most popular conventional van with around 40 gkm a white nissan env200 electric van makes deliveries in london with their 3040 kwh battery pack included this rises to just below half the co 2 of a small ford transit models considered nissan env200 and renault kangoo battery size 37 kwh on

emissions with 2025 grid mix 1523 gkm from recharging  3252 gkm including battery payback time a typical driver filling their car up once a month and driving around 7500 miles per year will produce one and a half tonnes of co 2 per year in a modern petrol or diesel hatchback an electric vehicle doing the same mileage would take 4 years to produce this amount with a conventional vehicle there is no scope for reducing emissions over its lifetime as petrol and diesel fuels cannot become carbonfree on the contrary national grid expect the carbon content of britains electricity to continue falling so that an electric vehicle bought now will be emitting half as much co 2 in 2025 as it does today it is inconceivable that an electric vehicle in the uk could be more polluting than its conventional equivalent this would require electricity to have a carbon intensity of around 850950 gkwh values not seen since the 1960s 7 electric vehicles can be thought of as having an upfront carbon cost for manufacturing the battery which can then be repaid through lower emissions as they are driven with britains current grid electricity producing 205 gkwh smaller electric cars and vans will take between 2 and 4 years to have saved the amount of co 2 than was emitted in making their batteries for the larger luxury models it will take more like 56 years of driving to pay back that carbon with each passing year as the electricity mix gets cleaner this payback time will continue to fall and the environmental credentials of electric vehicles will keep growing stronger about this study the fuel economy and climate impact of vehicles are measured by the government through the amount of co 2 they release for every kilometre driven the uks most popular car the ford fiesta emits around 120 gkm in its cleanest models and 160 gkm in the sportier versions 9 electric vehicles dont emit any co 2 while driving but the power system does when producing the electricity needed to recharge them britains power system has changed dramatically over the last five years with carbon emissions halving and the share of coal generation falling from 36 to just 3 one kwh of electricity in britain is now contains 204 grams10 of co 2  less than the carbon released from burning one kwh of petrol an electric vehicle can drive up to four times further on 1 kwh than a petrol or diesel car could because electric motors are so much more efficient the charts above look at three categories of vehicle  small hatchbacks luxury saloons and suvs and small commercial vans each chart shows how the carbon emissions from an electric vehicle have fallen over the past decade and how they are expected to continue falling in the years to come the charts consider changes to the electricity generation mix used for recharging 11 and a gradual reduction in emissions from battery manufacture as the electricity mix changes in other countries 12 the range in direct emissions from recharging the dark blue bands covers the main ev models currently on sale in each segment and variants on each model available the top of each band highest emissions shows the least efficient ev model the bottom of each band lowest emissions shows the most efficient in the forecast these bands also include the range of emissions factors for electricity production coming from national grids scenarios there is a larger range in the estimated wholelifecycle emissions the lighter blue bands due to the additional uncertainty in the emissions caused by manufacturing 1 kwh of battery capacity and the range of battery sizes seen across ev models studies have estimated a wide range of emissions depending on the type of battery type its design where it is manufactured and how old the study is current estimates range from 40 up to 200 kg of co 2 emitted per kwh of battery capacity 13 we take the average across eight studies and assume 75125 kgco 2 per kwh the true value may be less than this as endoflife batteries could be recycled 14 or could be repurposed as a secondlife home or grid storage batteries it will also reduce in future as the electricity used to make batteries is decarbonised

fossil fuels going below 100 grams 100 grams of co 2 per kwh is an important number two years ago the committee on climate change recommended it as the target for 2030 that would mean our electricity system is in line with the national commitment to decarbonise britains electricity has dipped below 100 grams for single hours at a time but until now it had never done so for a full day june 30 th was a sunny sunday with a good breeze that brought a 33c heatwave to an end electricity demand was among the lowest seen all year while wind output was at a threemonth high the carbon intensity of electricity sat below 100 gkwh for half of the day falling to a minimum of just 73 gkwh in the midafternoon carbon emissions averaged over the day were 97 gkwh beating the previous record of 104 gkwh set a year ago fig 1  britains generation mix during june 30th that delivered electricity for less than 100g of carbon per kwh click to viewdownload going above 50 renewables june 30 th was a recordbreaker in a second way wind solar biomass and hydro supplied 55 of electricity demand over the day  smashing the previous daily record of 49 set last summer for the first day in the national grids history more electricity came from renewables than any other source that day britains wind farms produced twice as much electricity as all fossil fuels combined a quarter of the countrys electricity demand was met by onshore wind farms and 15 from offshore 4 despite several reactors being offline for maintenance nuclear power provided nearly a fifth of electricity again more than was supplied by all fossil fuels heading towards fossilfree electricity the rise of renewable energy has been a major factor in decarbonising britains electricity complemented by the incredible fall in coal generation every single coal plant in britain has sat idle for at least two days a week since the start of spring it has been three years since britains first zerocoal hour a year later came the first full day and earlier this year we saw the longest coalfree run in history  lasting 18 days this summer could see the first full month of no coal output if this trend continues fig 2  number of hours per week with zero generation from britains coal power stations click to viewdownload attention must now shift from zero coal to fossil free unabated natural gas without carbon capture and storage needs to be removed from the grid mix by 2050 to tackle the climate crisis and ensure the uk hits netzero emissions across the whole economy at the start of this decade britains power system had never operated with less than half of electricity coming from fossil fuels as renewables were rolled out across the country the share of fossil fuels has fallen dramatically by 2014 the grid was able to operate with less than onethird from fossil fuels and by 2016 it had gone below onefifth on may 26 th  the share of fossil fuels in britains electricity fell below 10 for the first time ever fig 3  the record minimum share of fossil fuels in britains electricity mix over the last decade with projections of the current trend to 2025 click to viewdownload this record could have gone further though during the afternoon 600 mw of wind power was shed  enough to power half a million homes national grid had to turn off a tenth of scotlands wind farms to keep the system stable and secure this wind power had to be replaced by gas biomass and hydro plants elsewhere in the country as these were located closer to demand centres and could be fully controlled at short notice this turndown coincides with ten straight hours where power prices were zero or negative going down to a minimum of 71mwh in the afternoon national grids bill for balancing the system that day alone came to 66m if the power system could have coped with all the renewable energy being generated fossil fuels would have been pushed down to just 8 of the generation mix this highlights the challenges that national grid face in their ambition to run a zero carbon power system by 2025  and the tangible benefits that could already be realised today if the trend of the last decade continues britain could be on course for its first fossilfree hour as early as 2023 this will only be possible if the technical issues around voltage and inertia at times of high wind output can be tackled with new lowcarbon technologies other countries are grappling with questions about whether renewables can be relied on to replace coal and gas britain is proof that renewables can achieve things that werent imaginable just a decade ago zero carbon electricity is  the job that cant wait  britain only has a few more years to wait before the first fossilfree hours become a reality 1 over the last decade the carbon intensity of electricity generation in britain has fallen faster than in any other major economy source energy revolution global outlook  2 in the 12 months to july 2019 carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation totalled 605 million tonnes in the 12 months to july 2013 these emissions were 1602 million tonnes both figures include emissions from imported electricity and from producing and transporting biomass see electric insights and our peerreviewed methodology paper for details of the calculation 3 in 2017 the uks cars emitted 70 million tonnes of co2 and lightduty vehicles emitted 19 million tonnes source beis final greenhouse gas emissions statistics  4 electric insights now provides data on the split between onshore and offshore wind farms typically around 23 of the
