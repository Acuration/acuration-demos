power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station leeds mp visits groundbreaking carbon capture company the yorkshire company developing innovative carbon capture technology which could enable drax power station to become carbon negative has welcomed the business and energy select committee chair to its laboratories 8 october 2018 during the visit to ccaptures premises rachel reeves mp heard how a bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project is expected to get underway at drax power station this autumn which will be the first of its kind in europe the chemistry being used in the pilot project has been developed by ccapture  a leeds university spinout during her visit to the companys facilities rachel reeves who is mp for leeds west got to see some of the equipment which will be installed at drax power station for the pilot rachel reeves said this beccs project between ccapture and drax is groundbreaking if it works it could put yorkshire and the uk at the forefront of the race to develop the beccs technology which is essential to tackling climate change its very exciting and i look forward to hearing more as the pilot progresses beccs is vital to global efforts to combat climate change because the technology will mean the gases that cause global warning can be removed from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced this means power generation would no longer contribute to climate change but would start to reduce the carbon accumulating in the atmosphere drax the biggest power station in the uk near selby in north yorkshire is investing 400000 in the beccs pilot project with ccapture since it converted two thirds of the power station to use biomass instead of coal it has become the biggest single site renewable power generator in the country and the largest decarbonisation project in europe andy koss drax power ceo said this beccs pilot has the potential to make the renewable electricity produced at drax power station carbon negative if were serious about meeting our climate targets then negative emissions are a must  and beccs is whats going to get us there chris rayner founder of ccapture and professor of organic chemistry at the university of leeds added during the six month pilot at drax we aim to use our chemistry to capture a tonne of carbon a day and in the process demonstrate that if the project was scaled up we could achieve one of the holy grails of co 2 emissions strategies  negative emissions in power production thats where we believe the potential co 2 emissions reductions are likely to be the greatest ccapture is a spinout from the department of chemistry at the university of leeds established through funding from ip group plc ends media contacts ali lewis drax group interim head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 07712677177 editors notes drax power station is the single largest user of sustainable biomass for power in the world  65 of the electricity it produced in 2017 was renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases a report by the energy technology institute in 2016 has suggested that by the 2050s beccs could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year in the uk  approximately half the nations emissions target the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 ccapture is a spin out from the chemistry department at leeds university and has attracted support from ip group the department for business energy and industrial strategys energy entrepreneurs fund and the co 2 capture project for co 2 capture technology which has potential in a range of areas including biogas upgrading natural gas sweetening and hydrogen production about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax power ltd which operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe haven power  based in ipswich supplies electricity to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses drax biomass  is based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests supplying fuel used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more information visit wwwdraxcomuk share name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter to
