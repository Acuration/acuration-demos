electric vehicle ev proposition to make switching to evs simple and easy for businesses 29 april 2019 draxs first ev customer ses water has invested in 16 new charging points and is initially replacing 10 of its 120 strong fleet of diesel vans with electric vehicles the switch will result in a carbon saving of 43 tonnes of co 2 per year and is another significant step forward in ses waters environmental commitments which last year saw the company switch to 100 per cent renewable electricity the comprehensive service provided to ses water by haven power part of drax group includes charging infrastructure and operating software the leasing of evs supporting devices such as vehicle telematics and the renewable electricity needed to power the vehicles drax which is the biggest supplier of renewable electricity to businesses in the uk will also supply ses water with telematic systems to allow usage data from the trial to be monitored paving the way for a broader roll out plan and potential vehicle to grid trials at ses water henrietta stock energy and carbon manager at ses water said every day we use enough energy to power 13000 homes so we are always looking at ways to balance the environmental impact of our essential activities and support the investment in renewable generation in the uk we have already significantly reduced our carbon emissions over the last year and working with drax has enabled us to create a bespoke ev solution so we can understand exactly how to save the most energy further lowering both our carbon emissions and our costs the service drax is providing includes expert advice to determine what kind of vehicles and systems will work best for customers analysis of different charging methods to minimise fleet downtime as well as data to help companies use their fleet efficiently jonathan kini drax retail ceo said we know from supplying energy to our customers that no two businesses are alike so a one size fits all approach wont deliver what they all need instead we are working with customers like ses water as an energy partner to offer each of them a solution tailored to their specific needs giving them the optimal ev package will result in lower carbon emissions and costs helping them to grow better businesses jonathan kini drax retail ceo high resolution image above download according to research from arval so far in the uk just 14 of businesses have switched at least one vehicle to electric however this is set to increase to 42 within 3 years jonathan kini added evs are still a relatively new technology and making the switch can be daunting we can take the stress out of the process so customers have confidence that the decisions theyre making will be good for the environment as well as their business as the uk power system continues to decarbonise evs are better than ever for reducing carbon emissions making a greater contribution to global efforts to tackle climate change ends main image caption
