latvia latvia catchment area analysis 19 june 2020 sustainable bioenergy latvia is a heavily forested small country about half the size of england with 52 forest cover totalling 354 million ha 27 times bigger than the forest area in england and 11 bigger than the entire uk in its catchment area analysis report of the baltic country consultancy indufor found best management practice is driven by the stateowned sector with an increasing proportion of corporate owners improving management standards in the private sector markets are dominated by domestic sawtimber demand and pulpwood exports to neighbouring scandinavia fuelwood pellets and biomass are substantial and critical markets for lowgrade fibre increasing forest area carbon stored and no deforestation there has been an increase of around 400000 hectares ha of forest in latvia since 2000 this is due to natural afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands and also to an improvement in forest inventory analysis in 2009 which provided a more accurate assessment of land use and forestry data since 2010 the forest area has increased by 55000 ha there is no evidence of deforestation primary land use latvia there has also been a substantial increase in forest carbon or growing stock this increased by 106 million cubic metres m 3  since 2000 75 hardwood and by 33 million m 3 since 2010 57 hardwood increase in forest carbon limited hardwood markets a proportion of the increase in hardwood volume in 2009 was due to the improvement of forest inventory calculations but also due to increased natural regeneration on unutilised land the hardwood forest in latvia and the baltic region is quite different to that of the us south  in the baltics there is prolific hardwood regeneration birch alder and aspen which grows quite rapidly there are limited markets for structural timber therefore hardwoods produce a lot of lowgrade wood fibre there are no domestic pulp markets in latvia and only limited markets for panel board therefore much of the lowgrade wood fibre can only be used for firewood and biomass the chart below shows a minor change in species composition from planted pine to naturally regenerated spruce and aspen  the most prolific regenerators in this region varied species mix planting and regeneration state owned forests have a higher proportion of planted forest areas compared to the private sector where natural regeneration is preferred due to lower costs planting allows the owner to control the species mix quality and growth whereas regeneration can be more of a lottery for both quality and species mix as more corporate owners emerge planting with improved stock may increase restocking practice by ownership category how the financial crisis impacted latvian forests harvesting levels have been consistently below net annual increment since 2000 there have been some fluctuations in the annual allowable cut in state forests particularly following the global financial crisis in 2008 harvesting in the private sector declined due to falling prices and sawnwood production dropped by 42 in 2009 compared to 2006 during that period stateowned forest increased harvesting in order to support the industry in the absence of strong markets and private sector supply postrecession the harvesting balance returned and demand for wood products increased the current surplus of growth compared to removals is around 55 million m 3 pa or a growth drain ratio of 16 surplus of growth compared to removals biomass and pulp prices increasing wood pellet exports have had limited impact on wood prices the feedstock for this market fuelwood  forest chip has limited competition and therefore remains fairly stable pulpwood markets are driven by export demand to scandinavia and can be volatile as this market fluctuates 2018 saw a substantial spike in pulpwood prices due to increased export demand as a response to a global increase in pulp and paper prices boosting scandinavian production this had a minor knock on effect on the domestic fuelwood markets variation of lowgrade wood prices with changing demand an important part of this analysis is to look for evidence to evaluate draxs performance against its new forest commitments  some of which relate directly to these trends and data sets pine forest in latvia below the consultant summarises the evidence of biomass impacts against key metrics in the forest industry of latvia is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes in  forest area  forest cover no impact both forest area and forest cover have increased during the last two decades the main driver of the growing forest area has been the natural regeneration of agricultural lands that were left uncultivated during the soviet regime forest growing stock no impact forest growing stock has steadily increased throughout the observation period the main driver for harvesting level is the roundwood demand from sawmills panel mills and export woodbased bioenergy demand may increase thinnings and residue collection but it is not as significant a driver for total harvests as the aforementioned exported pellets have accounted for approximately 1014 of the total volume of annual harvests in recent years depending on the assumed average dry densities of the harvested wood and pellets harvesting levels no impact  slight increasing impact the national felling volume is only about 65 of the national forest increment the total harvesting area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings and increased share of clearcuts a decline in both area and volume of fellings can be seen between 20022008 and 20102016 the main drivers of harvesting levels are sawmill industry panel industry and export demand however wood demand for energy purposes can still improve the overall income for the forest owner and therefore increase the total harvesting levels in private forests harvesting residue collection increasing impact most of the collected residues originate from clearcuts in state forests most produced harvesting residues are left in situ and they are not overexploited collection of wood residues from harvesting operations has been increasing for the last 15 years as a result of increased capacities and demand from heat and chp plants latvia is increasingly relying on woody biomass for energy generation forest growth  carbon sequestration potential no apparent impact the total forest area and growing stock have grown in the last decade according to latvias national forestry accounting plan 20212025 the forests are decreasing their ghg sequestration capacity even a low sequestration rate increases carbon storage which explains the increases in forest growing stock and area the decrease in ghg sequestration capacity is due to forest ageing emissions from soils and the increased share of broadleaved forests which have lower carbon accumulation capacity than conifers removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are an input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes to forest management practices  rotation lengths no impact the law on forests regulates minimum forest age and diameter for clearcuts the lvm and largescale forest owners often conduct clearcuts at minimum diameter whereas smallholders tend to wait until roundwood prices are high due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations thinnings increasing impact in naturally afforested former agricultural lands no impacts on thinnings overall the total harvested area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings due to existing forest age structure and increased share of clearcuts most of the harvesting residues are collected from clearcuts there is an increased demand for small diameter wood and harvestingprocessing residues overall the increased demand for smalldiameter hardwood has increased harvesting in previously unmanaged afforested agricultural lands which usually overgrow with broadleaved trees these kinds of lands are usually otherwise not significant for forest management conversion from hardwood to softwood no impact no indication of hardwood conversion to softwood was found instead pine forests are decreasing due to the favouring of natural regeneration which usually results in spruce or broadleaved forests in nutrientrich andor wet soils is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has impacted solid wood products markets  diversion from other wood product markets no apparent impact production of sawnwood and woodbased panels have increased or remained steady ie no evidence of diversion several interviews confirmed that sawlogs are not processed for other products besides sawnwood and woodbased panels wood prices no apparent impact prices of all wood assortments increased in 20172018 most notably the prices of pulpwood this was due to difficult harvesting conditions and increased demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden because of high market pulp prices pulpwood prices returned to presurge levels in 2019 fuelwood prices also increased temporarily but at a much more moderate rate the main driver for fuelwood price increases was the surge of pulpwood prices read the full report catchment area analysis in latvia  a 2017 interview with raul kirjanen ceo of graanul invest a wood pellet supplier of drax operating in latvia can be
