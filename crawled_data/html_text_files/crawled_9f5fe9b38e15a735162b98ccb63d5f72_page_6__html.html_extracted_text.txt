New ESG RCF and Financing Update
19 November 2020
Investors

RNS Number: 8002F
Drax Group PLC (Symbol: DRX)
Drax is pleased to announce that it has completed the refinancing of its revolving credit facility.
The new £300 million facility (“the Facility”) matures in 2025, with an option to extend by one year
(1)
. The Facility replaces the current RCF which matures in 2021 and provides increased liquidity, enabling the full facility to be drawn as cash (the previous facility restricted cash drawn to support liquidity to £165 million). The Facility is currently undrawn for cash.
The Facility has a customary margin grid referenced over LIBOR, which reflects a small reduction in cost versus the current RCF and includes an embedded ESG component which adjusts the margin based on Drax’s carbon intensity measured against an annual benchmark.
Drax has also agreed a change to the Group’s £35 million term-loan facility, maturing in 2022, in order to simplify its capital structure. This facility will now rank as senior, previously super senior.
Drawing of previously agreed infrastructure facility
On 14 September 2020, Drax confirmed that it had agreed a new infrastructure term-loan agreement (the “Agreement”) that provided committed facilities of approximately £160 million with a range of maturities between 2024 and 2030
(2)
. These facilities extended the Group’s maturity profile while also reducing the cost of debt. Drax has now drawn £28 million
(2)
, with the balance to be drawn by February 2021.
The Agreement also included an option for a further £75 million. Under this option Drax has now agreed £53 million maturing in 2028, which will be drawn in December 2020.
Proceeds from Euro denominated bond issue and utilisation
On 4 November 2020, Drax issued €250 million of Euro denominated senior secured notes which mature in 2025. The effective Sterling-equivalent interest rate is 3.24% per annum.
The proceeds from this issuance, along with existing cash flows, are being used to redeem the Group’s £350 million 2022 Sterling bond and £125 million ESG term-loan facility.
The notes extend the Group’s debt maturity profile and reduce the overall cost of debt to approximately 3.7%.

Building back better by supporting negative emissions technologies
12 October 2020
Carbon capture

Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP, Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy
Rt Hon George Eustice MP, Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs
Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, Secretary of State for Transport
Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster
Dear Chancellor, Secretaries of State,
Building back better by supporting negative emissions technologies
Today our organisations have launched a new coalition with a shared vision: to build back better as part of a sustainable and resilient recovery from Covid-19, by developing pioneering projects that can remove carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and other pollutants from the atmosphere. Together, we represent hundreds of thousands of workers across some of the UK’s most critical industries, including aviation, energy and farming, each of which contribute billions of pounds each year to the economy.
A growing number of independent experts, including the Committee on Climate Change, Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering and the Electricity System Operator, have recognised the crucial role of ‘negative emissions’ or ‘greenhouse gas removal’ technologies in fighting the climate crisis. Whilst we should seek to decarbonise sectors such as aviation, heavy industry and agriculture as far as practically possible, due to technical or commercial barriers it is unlikely we will eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions completely. Negative emissions technologies are critical therefore to balancing out these residual emissions and ensuring we achieve Net Zero in a credible, cost effective and sustainable way.
As well as benefiting the environment, negative emissions technologies and projects can build back a cleaner, greener economy in the wake of Covid-19. The foundations for this are already being laid by our coalition’s members today.
For example:
The National Farmers Union has set out a Net Zero vision for the agricultural sector whereby UK farmers harness the ability to capture carbon to create new income streams.
The aviation industry through the Sustainable Aviation initiative has identified negative emissions projects, alongside other measures as sustainable jet fuel, as being crucial to greening the industry.
In North Yorkshire, Drax is developing plans to combine sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology (BECCS) to create the world’s first carbon negative power station – supporting thousands of jobs in the process.
In North East Lincolnshire, Velocys with the support of British Airways is developing the Altalto waste-to-jet fuel project that could produce negative-emission jet fuel once the Humber industrial cluster’s carbon capture and storage infrastructure is established.
Finally, Carbon Engineering has announced a partnership with Pale Blue Dot Energy to deploy commercial-scale Direct Air Capture projects in the UK that would remove significant volumes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
With COP26 fast approaching, there is a real and compelling opportunity for the UK Government to demonstrate to the world it is taking a leadership position on negative emissions. Conversely if the UK does not act quickly, it could jeopardise the delivery of projects in the 2020s that can support innovation, learning by doing and the scale-up of negative emissions in the 2030s. It also risks Britain falling behind in the race to scale and commercialise these technologies, with a view to exporting them to other countries around the world to support their own decarbonisation efforts.
We therefore call on this Government, supported by your departments, to pursue the following ‘low regrets’ interventions to support this critical emerging industry:
Adopt a clear, unambiguous commitment to supporting negative emissions in the 2020s and beyond.
The last significant reference to negative emissions by Government was in the 2017 Clean Growth Strategy. Between now and the end of the year there is a window of opportunity for the Government to go further, reflecting the changed reality of a Net Zero world and the growing consensus on the need for negative emissions. A clear signal of intent would also give greater confidence to investors and developers in negative emissions projects, in the absence of a long-term strategy.
Develop targeted policies to support viable negative emissions projects in the 2020s
. In order to scale up in the 2030s at a pace compatible with the UK’s climate commitments, it is essential that Government works with industry to bring forward early projects in the 2020s that are viable and represent value for money. However, there is no marketplace or regulatory regime in the UK today that incentivises or rewards negative emissions, making financing projects extremely challenging. Dedicated policy frameworks and business models for solutions such as afforestation, BECCS and Direct Air Capture are therefore urgently needed.
Seize the opportunity to make negative emissions a point of emphasis at COP26
. The UK has already led the way at a global level by adopting Net Zero as a legally binding target. At COP26, the UK can showcase its further commitment to continuous innovation around the decarbonisation agenda by signposting the early actions it has taken to deploy negative emissions – which other countries will also need to meet their own zero carbon ambitions. This statement would be particularly powerful as it can be credibly supported by several pioneering projects already being undertaken by British businesses and research organisations in this space.
We would welcome the opportunity to meet with each of you to discuss these points in further detail.
Yours,
The Coalition for Negative Emissions
