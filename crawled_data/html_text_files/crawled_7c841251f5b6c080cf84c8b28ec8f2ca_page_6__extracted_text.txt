considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways tags decarbonisation  engineering  supply chain  sustainability  technology  transport what makes a mountain right for energy storage 22 may 2019 power generation electricity generation is often tied to a countrys geography climate and geology  as an island great britains long coastline makes offshore wind a key part of its renewable electricity while iceland can rely on its geothermal activity as a source of power and heat one of the most geographicallyinfluenced sources of electricity is hydropower a site needs a great enough volume of water flowing through it and the right kind of terrain to construct a dam to harness it even more dependent on the landscape is pumped hydro storage pumped storage works by pumping water from one source up a mountain to a higher reservoir and storing it when the water is released it rushes down the same shafts it was pumped up spinning a turbine to generate electricity the advantage of this is being able to store the potential energy of the water and rapidly deliver electricity to plug any gaps in generation  for example when the wind suddenly dropsor when great britain instantly requires a lot more power  this specific type of electricity generation can only function in a specific type of landscape and the scottish highlands offers a location that ticks all the boxes the perfect spot for pumped storage cruachan power station  a pumped hydro facility capable of providing 440 megawatts mw of electricity sits on the banks of loch awe in the highlands ready to deliver power in just 30 seconds here there is a minimum distance between the two water sources with a maximum drop says gordon pirie civil engineer at cruachan power station it is an ideal site for pumped storage the challenge in constructing pumped storage is finding a location where two bodies of water are in close proximity but at severely different altitudes from the lochside the landscape rises at a dramatic angle to reach 1126 metres 3694 feet above sea level at the summit of ben cruachan the highest peak in the argyll the crest of cruachan dam sits 4008 metres 1315 feet up the slopes creating a reservoir in a rocky corrie between ridges the four 100 mw turbines which also act as pumps lie a kilometre inside the mountains rock the horizontal distance and the vertical distance between water sources is whats called the pipetolength ratio explains pirie its what determines whether or not the site is economically viable for pumped storage the higher water is stored the more potential energy it holds that can be converted into electricity however if the distance between the water sources is too great the amount of electricity consumed pumping water up the mountain becomes too great and too expensive the distance between the reservoir and the turbines is also reduced by cruachan power stations defining feature the turbine hall cavern one kilometre inside the mountain carving a power station out of rock the access tunnel cavern and the networks of passageways and chambers that make up the power station were all blasted and drilled by a workforce of 1300 men in the late 1950s to early 1960s  affectionately known as the tunnel tigers this was dangerous work however the rock type of the mountainside was another geographic advantage of the region its the diorite and phyllite rock essentially granite so its a hard rock but its actually a softer type of granite and thats also why cruachan was chosen as the location says pirie the right landscape and geology was essential for establishing a pumped storage station at cruachan however the west highlands also offer another essential factor for hydropower an abundance of water turning water to power the west highlands are one of the wettest parts of europe with some areas seeing average annual rain fall of 3500 millimetres compared to 500 millimetres in some of the driest parts of the uk this abundance of water from rainfall as well as lochs and rivers also contributes to making cruachan so wellsuited to pumped storage the cruachan reservoir can contain more than 10 million cubic metres of water most of this is pumped up from loch awe which at 385 square kilometres is the third largest freshwater loch in scotland loch awe is so big that if cruachan reservoir was fully released into the loch it would only increase the water level by 20 centimetres however the reservoir also makes use of the aqueduct system made up of 19 kilometres of tunnels and pipes that covers 23 square kilometres of the surrounding landscape diverting rainwater and streams into the reservoir calculating quite how much of the reservoirs water comes from the surrounding area is difficult but estimates put it at around a quarter there are 75 concrete intakes dotted around the hills to gather water and carry it through the aqueducts to the reservoir says pirie the smallest intake is about the size of a street drain in the corner of a field and the largest one is about the size of a threebedroom house pumped storage stations offer the electricity system a source of extra power quickly but it takes the right combination of geographical features to make it work ben cruachan just so happens to be one of the spots where the landscape makes it possible tags cruachan power station  electricity generation  energy storage  engineering  hydroelectric power  power station  sustainability  technology the different ways water powers the world 10 april 2019 power generation if the spectacular roman aqueducts that still dot the landscape of europe tell us anything its that hydraulic engineering is nothing new for thousands of years water power has been used to grind wheat saw wood and even tell the time  craigside in northumberland by the 19th century water was able to go beyond performing rudimentary mechanical tasks and generate electricity directly cragside in northumberland england became the first house powered entirely by hydroelectricity in 1878 by 1881 the whole town of niagara falls on the uscanada border was being powered by the force of its eponymous river and waterfall hydropower has many advantages its predictable consistent often zero or low carbon and it can provide a range of ancillary services to power transmission systems in great britain there is 17 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower and another 28 gw of pumped hydro storage capacity but it remains a small part of the overall electricity mix in the fourth quarter of 2018 the 65 of british hydropower that is connected to the national grid accounted for less than one per cent electricity generation or 545600 megawatt hours mwh by contrast wind accounted for 14 of total generation that quarter almost 95 million mwh while hydropower projects can be expensive to construct operational and maintenance costs are relatively low and they can run for an extremely long time  the lanark hydro electric scheme in scotland which drax recently acquired  has been producing power since 1927 today hydropower installations are found at all scales all around the world but the term hydropower covers many different types of facility these are some of the ways water is used to generate electricity impoundment power plants the simplest and most recognisable form of hydropower impoundment facilities work by creating a reservoir of trapped water behind a dam that is then selectively released the water flows through a turbine spinning it which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity from the hoover dam on the nevadaarizona border to the three gorges dam in china  the worlds largest power station of any type with a generating capacity of 225 gw  impoundment dams are some of the most iconic structures in modern engineering three gorges dam china as well as having the potential to provide large quantities of baseload power they can react extremely quickly to grid demands  just by opening or closing their floodgates as the power system operator requires runofriver generation rather than storing and releasing power from behind a dam runoftheriver generators channel off part of a river and use its natural flow to generate power tongland power station galloway hydro scheme because it doesnt require large dams or reservoirs runofriver can be less environmentally disruptive as there is not always a need for large scale construction and flooding is less common stonebyres power station lanark hydro scheme while runofriver facilities tend to be smaller and less flexible than impoundment they still have significant generating potential  the jirau hydroelectric power plant on the madeira river in brazil has a generating capacity of 37 gw pumped storage water can also be good for storing energy that can then be converted to electricity pumped hydro storage facilities operate by pumping water uphill to a reservoir when electricity is cheap or plentiful then letting it flow back downhill through tunnels to a series of turbines that activate generators to generate electricity in the same way as an impoundment dam when electricity is in high demand dam and reservoir cruachan power station their ability to both produce and absorb electricity makes them a vital part of electricity networks playing the role of energy storage systems  in fact a massive 97 of all global grid storage capacity is in the form of pumped hydro their function as giant batteries will only become more important as intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar become more prevalent in the energy mix outlet and loch cruachan power station so too will their ability to ramp up generation very quickly draxs recently acquired cruachan power station in scotland can go from zero to 100 mw or more in less than 30 seconds when generation is called upon  for example when there is a sudden spike in demand tidal range generation swansea bay the sea is also an enormous source of potential hydropower tidal range generation facilities exploit the movement of water levels between and high and low tide to generate electricity tidal dams trap water in bays or estuaries at high tide creating lagoons the dam then releases the water as the rest of the tide lowers allowing it to pass through turbines generating power there are limitations  like wind and solars dependence on the wind blowing and the level of sunlight operators cant control when tides go in or out but its vast generating potential means that it could be a valuable source of baseload power if it were to be deployed more widely great britain in particular has major opportunities for tidal generation the severn estuary between england and wales has the second highest tidal range in the world 15 metres and a barrage built across the estuary could have a generating capacity of up to 86 gw  enough to meet 6 of the britains total electricity demands some environmental groups worry about the impact such projects could have on wildlife due to the level of public funding required the government rejected that plan in 2010 in favour of pursuing its nuclear policy  a second attempt at securing a governmentbacked investment contract known as a cfd  for a smaller 320 mw pathfinder project in swansea bay was also rejected in 2018 the welsh government is however supportive of the project which already has planning permission tidal stream generation rather than building a dam tidal stream generators work like underwater wind turbines sturdy propellers or hydrofoils winglike blades which oscillate up and down rather than spinning around are positioned underwater to transform the energy of tidal streams into electricity while tidal streams move far slower than wind the high density of water compared to air means that more power is generated even at much lower velocities not reliant on large physical structures tidal stream generators are a relatively cheap form of hydropower to deploy and make a much smaller impact on their environment than tidal barrages wave generation unlike tidal power which is generated by the gravitational effects of the sun and moon on the earths oceans wave power ultimately comes from the winds that whip up the oceans surface there are a number of different methods that turn waves into generation including funnelling waves into a tube floating on the surface of the water that contains electricitygenerating turbines or by using the vertical bobbing movement of a tethered buoy to pull and spin a fixed generator an electricitygenerating buoy awaiting installation in spain wave power has yet to be widely implemented but it has significant potential its estimated that the waves off the coasts of the usa could have provided 66 of the countrys electricity generation needs in 2017 alone effectively commercialising wave power could provide another vital tool in developing a sustainable energy landscape for the coming future tidal and wave power generation are less established generation technologies than their landbased cousins but they hold huge potential in delivering more sources of reliable zero emissions electricity for energy systems in coastal locations around the world tags

2019 opinion think of the phrase 3d and may people instantly think of video games television or cinema along with the special glasses you needed to watch it but another form of 3d is i believe going to be at the heart of the energy revolution which is rapidly gathering place the three ds in this case are data diversification and decarbonisation together they will transform the way businesses buy use and sell their energy help companies take control of their energy use and save money and also play a key part in our journey towards a zero carbon lower cost energy future were already seeing some real innovations in the energy sector our trial of a storage battery with a customer of opus energy is an example offering a farming business in northampton the chance to sell stored energy generated by solar panels back to the grid at times of peak demand  a potential new revenue stream but other innovations and advances will maintain the pace of change and data will be at the core of this now the new generation of smart meters are being installed in businesses  revolutionising customer relationships with their energy suppliers the data from the new meters will finally give customers insight into where and when they use energy suppliers will have to work much more closely with customers to help them access new opportunities for cost savings access to new markets and even new revenue streams an example would be a restaurant with the data smart meters will provide the restaurants supplier will be able to tell the owners how their energy use compares to the local competition and where improvements can be made the detail could go as far as identifying whether the restaurants equipment is older and less efficient whether rivals have installed newer kit or whether other businesses are switching off their equipment earlier or using it at different cheaper times using energy during the peak weekday morning and early evening hours is often the most expensive time to do so data will give businesses the insight into how they can use energy more efficiently and when they use it offering them the chance to avoid buying at peak times whenever possible and driving efficiencies this is why haven powers trading team is now working closely with gridbeyond  the partnership allows our customers to trade the power they produce as well as optimise their operations to help balance the grid at times of peak demand the really smart thing is that in doing so customers are reducing their energy costs and making their operations more sustainable trading desks at haven powers ipswich hq the way demand changes and is managed by businesses and consumers on a diversified power system will also be key the business energy sector is already diversifying as many customers are able to generate and store their own power but the next step is for more customers to be paid to reduce their usage at peak times think of a busy time for the national grid  half time in the fa cup final or after the results in strictly come dancing previously the grid would have to pay a power station to ramp up generation to meet demand but these days customers are paid to reduce demand for 30 minutes or so  in effect becoming a huge virtual power station  this has happened for some time of course with larger industrial customers but now smaller companies can benefit from this too thanks to the data and insight they will have from their smart meters this empowers customers and puts them not the energy companies in control of the key decisions about their energy a close advisory relationship between energy suppliers and their customers will become ever more important to make sure business can choose to avoid the high demand periods and maximises use during the lower cheaper times in fact i can see a time when customers will end up paying more for insight and advice than they do for the power they buy  and theyll save money overall in doing so and if we get all this right it will help drive one of the most important of the three ds  decarbonisation sustainability is increasingly becoming a primary focus for businesses and demand for renewable energy is growing because it is now costeffective that will help us in our drive towards a zero carbon future as more and more renewable energy comes onstream though the uk will continue to need power generated from more flexible assets as well so there are huge opportunities out there to transform our energy landscape but they have to be viewed positively the smart metering programme can be viewed as a regulatory burden or it can be seen as an opportunity we take the positive view likewise batteries were once the preserve of massive companies only but now as technology develops they are becoming available for smaller firms too the more we can innovative on a larger scale the more the technology will work its way into smaller markets too adding momentum to the energy revolution the opportunities are huge if we get it right so too will be the benefits to one of the biggest priorities of all  the work to decarbonise the uk and create the lower carbon future we all want tags customers  electricity  energy policy  national grid  smart grid  sustainability  technology the small devices that use lots of power and the big buildings that dont 23 january 2019 electrification when texas instruments set about attempting to create the worlds first handheld calculator in the early sixties it estimated that such a complicated device might require a battery as big and powerful as a cars  with some innovative thinking the team were eventually able to power the device with just a fivevolt battery turning the calculator into a truly handheld device and kickstarting an electronics efficiency revolution continuous advances in the space mean that todays superpowered smartphones run on more efficient powerful  and smaller  sources than ever before but as more of our devices become smart and grow in usage their electricity demand is also increasing on the other hand many bigger objects that traditionally have used a lot of power are becoming more efficient and consuming less electricity than before the small devices eating up electricity think of the most electricityintensive appliance in a home something constantly running like a fridgefreezer might come to mind  or something intensive that operates in short blasts like a hairdryer or kettle however a surprising drain of electricity in homes is tv settop boxes and consoles which as recently as 2016 were reported to account for as much as half of all electricity usage by domestic electronics  this is because of how often they are left in standby mode which means they are constantly using a small amount of electricity in 1999 the international energy agency iea introduced the one watt initiative which led to the electricity consumption of many devices on standby falling from around five watts to below one watt and while this has helped reduce standby or vampire power multiplied across the country  the electricity consumption becomes significant  in the uk there are an estimated 27 million tvs this is not just a tvspecific problem however it is symptomatic of many of the modern devices increasingly found in our homes  from smart lightbulbs to amazons alexa these are constantly using small amounts of electricity listening and connecting to the cloud even when not being directly used in 2014 the iea estimated that by 2020 these networkeddevices could result in 120 billion in wasted electricity  adding to this is the increasing demand of the cloud and data storage which has been estimated could account for 20 of the worlds electricity consumption by 2025  previous alarm bells surrounding the bitcoin networks electricity usage highlights that its not just physical connected objects that will put increasing pressure on electricity supply but also entirely digital products yet even as little things become smarter and require more electricity some big things that have previously consumed huge amounts of electricity are becoming more efficient the big things becoming more efficient buildings are a big source of electricity demand globally office blocks full of lights and blasting heating and airconditioning units are among the main offenders but poorly insulated homes that leak heat also have a significant impact efforts are constantly being undertaken to reduce this via technological means such as companies generating their own electricity onsite from installed renewables  but cutting interstitial demand to a minimum doesnt always have to be hitech the bullitt centre in seattle is a 50000 ft 2 office aiming to be the greenest commercial building in the world this is achieved in part through a rooftop solar array that allows the building to generate more electricity than it consumes but is complimented by more straightforward steps such as maximising natural light and ventilation collecting rainwater and the use of geothermal heat pumps on average the building consumes 230000 kilowatthours kwhyear compared to the average of 1077000 kwhyear for seattle offices retrofitting can also make notable reductions to energy usage and new york artdeco icon the empire state building has been updated to consume 40 less electricity  this is largely thanks to straightforward renovations such as ensuring windows open properly and temperatures can be easily controlled energy efficiency is even extending beyond the confines of the planet the international space station only consumes about 90 kw to run which comes from a solar array stretching more than 2400m 2  when its solar panels are operational about 60 of their generation is used to refill batteries for when the station is in the earths shadow the mars desert research station mdrs in utah technology like this will be essential if humans are going to put buildings on other planets where we will not have vast electricity generation and transmission systems we enjoy on earth and if that is the ambition continuously striving for ever more efficient devices on a smarter power grid is

inventors that apples famous 90s tv ad claimed think different and in doing so set about changing the world the renewable electricity sources we take for granted today all started with such people who for one reason or another tried something new these are the stories of the people behind five sources of renewable electricity whose inventions and ideas could help power the world towards a zerocarbon future the magicians hydro house water wheel by the side of the trail to the power house at cragside rothbury northumberland using rushing rivers as a source of power dates back centuries as a mechanised way of grinding grains for flour the first reference to a watermill dates from all the way back to the third century bce  however hydropower also played a big role in the early history of electricity generation  the first hydroelectric scheme first came into action in 1878 six years before the invention of the modern steam turbine  what important device did this early source of emissionsfree electricity power a single lamp in the northumberland home of victorian inventor william armstrong this wasnt the only feature that made the house ahead of its time water pressure also helped power a hydraulic lift and a rotating spit in the kitchen  while the house also featured hot and cold running water and an early dishwasher one contemporary visitor dubbed the house a palace of a modern magician the first commercial hydropower power plant however opened on vulcan street in appleton wisconsin in 1882 to provide electricity to two local paper mills as well as the mill owner hj rogers home after a false start on 27 september the vulcan street plant kicked into life in earnest on 30 september generating about 125 kilowatts kw of electricity it was very nearly americas first ever commercial power plant but was beaten to the accolade by thomas edisons pearl street plant in new york which opened a little less than a month earlier the switch to silicon that made solar possible when the international space station is in sunlight about 60 the electricity its solar arrays generate is used to charge the stations batteries the batteries power the station when it is not in the sun for much of the 20 th century solar photovoltaic power generation didnt appear in many more places than on calculators and satellites but now with more largescale and rooftop arrays popping up solar is expected to generate a significant portion of the worlds future energy its been a long journey for solar power from its origins back in 1839 when 19year old aspiring physicist edmond becquerel first noticed the photovoltaic effect the frenchman found that shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution created an electric current  he did not however have any explanation for why this happened american inventor charles fritts was the first to take solar seriously as a source of largescale generation  he hoped to compete with thomas edisons coal powered plants in 1883 when he made the first recognisable solar panel using the element selenium however they were only about 1 efficient and never deployed at scale it would not be until 1953 when scientists calvin fuller gerald pearson and daryl chapin working at bell labs cracked the switch from selenium to silicon that the modern solar panel was created bell labs unveiled the breakthrough invention to the world the following year using it to power a small toy ferris wheel and a radio transmitter fuller pearson and chapins solar panel was only 6 efficient a big step forward for the time but today panels can convert more than 40 of the suns light into electricity  the wind pioneers who believed in selfgeneration offshore wind farm near øresund bridge between sweden and denmark like

electricitygenerating windmill was used to power the mansion of ohiobased inventor charles brush the 60foot 183 metres wooden tower featured 144 blades and supplied about 12 kw of electricity to the house charles brushs wind turbine charged a dozen batteries each with 34 cells the turbine was erected in 1888 and powered the house for two decades brush wasnt just a wind power pioneer either and in the basement of the mansion sat 12 batteries that could be recharged and act as electricity sources small turbines generating between 5 kw and 25 kw were important at the turn of the 19 th into the 20 th century in the us when they helped bring electricity to remote rural areas however over in denmark scientist and teacher poul la cour had his own grander vision for wind power  la cours breakthroughs included using a regulator to maintain a steady stream of power and discovering that a turbine with fewer blades spinning quickly is more efficient than one with many blades turning slowly he was also a strong advocate for what might now be recognised as decentralisation  he believed wind turbines provided an important social purpose in supplying small communities and farms with a cheap dependable source of electricity away from corporate influence in 2017 denmark had more than 53 gigawatts gw of installed wind capacity  accounting for 44 of the countrys power generation the prince and the power plant larderello italy italian princes arent a regular sight in the history books of renewable energy but at the turn of the last century on a tuscan hillside piero ginori conti prince of trevignano set about harnessing natural geysers to generate electricity in 1904 he had become head of a boric acid extraction firm founded by his wifes greatgrandfather his plan for the business included improving the quality of products increasing production and lowering prices but to do this he needed a steady stream of cheap electricity in 1905 he harnessed the dry steam which lacks moisture preventing corrosion of turbine blades from the geographically active area near larderello in southern tuscany to drive a turbine and power five light bulbs  encouraged by this conti expanded the operation into a prototype power plant capable of powering larderellos main industrial plants and residential buildings it evolved into the worlds first commercial geothermal power plant in 1913 supplying 250 kw of electricity to villages around the region by the end of 1943 there was 132 megawatts mw of installed capacity in the area but as the main source of electricity for central italys entire rail network it was bombed heavily in world war two following reconstruction and expansion the region has grown to reach current capacity of more than 800 mw globally there is now more than 83 gw of installed geothermal capacity  the engineer who took on an oil crisis with wood compressed wood pellet storage domes at baton rouge transit drax biomass port facility on the mississippi river while sawmills had experimented with waste products as a power sources and compressed sawdust sold as domestic fuel  it wasnt until the energy crisis of the 1970s that the term biomass was coined and wood pellets became a serious alternative to fossil fuels as a response to the 1973 yom kippur war the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries opec placed oil embargoes against several nations including the uk and us the result was a global price increase from 3 in october 1973 to 12 in march 1974 with prices even higher in the us where the countrys dependence on imported fossil fuels was acutely exposed  one of the most vulnerable sectors to booms in oil prices was the aviation industry to tackle the growing scarcity of petroleumbased fuels boeing looked to fuelefficiency engineer jerry whitfield  his task was to find an alternative fuel for industries such as manufacturing which were hit particularly hard by the oil shortage and subsequent recession this would in turn leave more oil for planes wood pellets from morehouse bioenergy a drax biomass pellet plant in northern louisiana being unloaded at baton rouge transit for storage and onward travel by ship to england whitfield teamed up with ken tucker who  inspired by pelletised animal feed  was experimenting with fuel pellets for industrial furnaces the pelletisation approach combined with whitfields knowledge of forcedair furnace technology opened a market beyond just industrial power sources and whitfield eventually left boeing to focus on domestic heating stoves and pellet production one of the lasting effects of the oil crisis was a realisation in many western countries of the need to diversify electricity generation  prompting expansion of renewable sources and experiments with biomass cofiring since then biomass pellet technology has built on its legacy as an abundant source of lowcarbon renewable energy with largescale pellet production beginning in sweden in 1992 production has continued to grow as more countries decarbonise electricity generation and move away from fossil fuels since those original pioneers first harnessed earths renewable sources for electricity generation the cost of doing so has dropped dramatically and efficiency skyrocketed the challenge now is in implementing the capacity and technology to build a safe stable and lowcarbon electricity system tags electricity  electricity generation  sustainability  technology better forest management 5 june 2018 sustainable bioenergy one of the most interesting outcomes of the recent analysis from the uks forest research fr agency on the carbon impact of biomass cib is the call for regulation to ensure better forest management and appropriate utilisation of materials the research was commissioned by the european climate foundation ecf to follow up frs mighty tome from 2015 of the same name this new piece of work essentially aims to clarify the findings of the initial research with supplementary analysis to address 3 key areas a comparison of scenarios that may give relatively higher or lower ghg reductions  in simple terms providing examples of both good and bad biomass based on the above the report provides a statement of the risks associated with eu bioenergy policy both with and without specific measures to ensure sustainable supply it then goes on to provide a practical set of sustainability criteria to ensure that those bio feedstocks used to meet eu bioenergy goals deliver ghg reductions not surprisingly the report finds that unconstrained and unregulated use of biomass could lead to poor ghg emission results even net emissions rather than removals this again is a nobrainer no reasonably minded person even the most ardent bioenergy advocate would suggest that biomass use should be unconstrained and unregulated there are plenty of obvious scenarios where biomass use would be bad but that doesnt mean that any use of biomass is bad thankfully this analysis takes a balanced view and identifies a number of scenarios where the use of biomass delivers substantial ghg emission reductions the report identifies the use of forest and industrial residues and smallearly thinnings as delivering a significant decrease in ghg emissions this is characterised as good biomass  around 75 of draxs 2017 feedstock falls into these feedstock categories including some waste materials the remainder of draxs 2017 feedstock was made up of low grade roundwood produced as a biproduct of harvesting for sawtimber production this feedstock was not specifically modelled in the analysis but the report concludes that biomass users should strongly favour the supply of forest bioenergy as a byproduct of wood harvesting for the supply of longlived material wood products the low grade roundwood used by drax falls into this category among the more obvious suggested requirements are that biomass should not cause deforestation and that biomass associated with appropriate afforestation should be favoured agreed another interesting recommendation is that biomass should be associated with supply regions where the forest growing stock is being preserved or increased improving growth rates and productivity drax absolutely supports this view and we have talked for some time about the importance of healthy market demand to generate investment in forest management encourage thinning and tree improvement timber markets in the us south have lead to a doubling of the forest inventory over the last 70 years these markets also provide jobs and help communities and ensure that forests stay as forest rather than being converted to other land uses the importance of thinning as a silvicultural tool to improve the quality of the final crop and increase sawtimber production is recognised by forest research this is an import step in accepting that some biomass in the form of small whole trees can be very beneficial for the forest and carbon stock but also in displacing fossil fuel emissions the forest resource of the us south is massive it stretches for more than a thousand miles from the coast of the carolinas to the edge of west texas a forest area of 83 million ha thats more than 3 times the size of the uk given that a wood processing mill typically has a catchment area of around a 4050mile radius imagine the number of markets required for low grade material to service that entire forest resource so what happens when there isnt a market near your forest or the markets close over the last 20 years more than 30 million tonnes of annual demand for low grade timber  thinnings and pulpwood  has been lost from the market in the us south as the paper and board mills struggled after the recession what happens to the forest owner they stop harvesting stop thinning stop managing their forest and that reduces the rate of growth reduces carbon sequestration and reduces the quantity of sawtimber that can be produced in the future recognising that biomass has provided essential markets for forest owners of the us south and directly contributed to better forest management is a really important step the cib report talks about different types of biomass feedstock like stumps which drax does not use conversely the report also identifies good sources of biomass which should be used such as postconsumer waste which drax agrees would be better utilised for energy where possible rather than land fill it also shows that industrial processing residues that would otherwise be wasted and forest residues that would be burnt on site or left to rot would deliver carbon savings when used by facilities like drax all of these criteria are similar to those outlined in the 7 principles of sustainable biomass that drax has suggested should be followed among the other recommendations which echo draxs thinking are that biomass should not use sawtimber or displace material wood markets the scale should be appropriate to the long term sustainable yield potential of the forest  it should be noted that harvesting levels in the us south are currently only at around 57 of the total annual growth counterfactual modelling like that used in this report cannot take account of all realworld variables and must be based on generic assumptions so should not be used in isolation but this report makes a very useful contribution to a complex debate it is possible to broadly define good and bad biomass and to look at fibre baskets like the us south and see a substantial surplus of sustainable wood fibre being harvested a rate far below the sustainable yield potential drax is currently working with the authors of this report and others in the academic world to develop the thinking on forest carbon issues and to ensure that all biomass use is sustainable and achieves genuine ghg emission reductions discover the steps we take to ensure our wood pellet supply chain is better for our forests our planet
