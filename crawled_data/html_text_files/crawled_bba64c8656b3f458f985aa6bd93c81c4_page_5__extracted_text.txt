transport contact us tag sustainability is biomass demand out of control 13 april 2018 sustainable bioenergy electricity systems around the world are decarbonising and increasingly switching to renewable power sources while intermittent sources such as solar and wind are the fastest growing types of renewables being installed globally the reliability and flexibility of biomass and its ability to offer grid stabilisation services such as frequency control and inertia make it an increasingly necessary source of renewable power according to the international energy agency biomass generation is forecast to expand as planned projects come online a versatile resource biomass comes in many different forms when looking to assess future demand and use it is important to recognise benefits that different types of biomass bring compressed wood pellets are just one small part of the biomass spectrum which includes many forms of agricultural and livestock residues waste and biproducts  much of which is currently discarded or underutilised maximising the use of these wastes and residues provides plenty of scope for expansion of the biomass energy sector around the world the global installed capacity for biomass generation is expected to reach close to 140 gigawatts gw by 2026  which will be fuelled primarily by expansion in asia using residues from food production and the forestry processing industry however the use of woody biomass can also provide many benefits too such as supplying a market for thinnings providing a use for harvesting residues encouraging better forest management practices and generating increased revenue for forest owners how much surplus exists in areas like the us south traditional markets for forest products have declined whilst forest growth has significantly increased according to the usda forest inventory and analysis fia data there is an average annual surplus of growth in the us south of more than 176 million cubic metres compared to removals  thats enough to make around 84 million tonnes of wood pellets a year from just one supply region of course not all of this surplus growth could or should be used for bioenergy much of it is suitable for high value markets like sawtimber or construction and some of it is located on inaccessible or protected sites however new and additional markets are essential to maintain the health of the forest resource and to encourage forest owners to retain and maintain their forest assets in the current wood pellet supply regions for europe p√∂yry management consulting has calculated that there is a surplus of low grade wood fibre and residues that could make an additional 140 million tonnes of wood pellets each year  wood pellets in context compressed wood pellets on a conveyor belt it is also necessary to look at the global production of all wood products to put wood pellet production into context in 2016 the global production of industrial roundwood the raw material used for construction furniture paper and other wood products was 187 billion cubic metres while the global production of wood fuel used for domestic heating and cooking was 186 billion cubic metres 1  only around 16 of this feedstock was used to make wood pellets both for industrial energy and residential heat the total production of wood pellets in 2016 was 284 million tonnes of which only 45 was used for industrial energy 2  while forestry consulting and research firm forisk predicts demand for industrial wood pellets those used in electricity generation rather than residential heating will grow globally at an annual rate of 15 for the next five years reaching 275 megatonnes mt by 2023 they are also clear that this growth in context will not impact forest volumes or other markets the wood pellet industry in the us south is not exploding it is a tiny component of the overall market forest volumes in the south in total will continue to grow for decades no matter what bioenergy markets or housing markets do the wood pellet sector simply and unequivocally cannot compete economically with us pulp and paper mills 80 of pulpwood demand in south for raw material on a headtohead basis 3  so while demand for wood pellets is likely to increase over the next 10 years this increase will be well within the scope of existing surplus fibre the question therefore is can suppliers keep up with this demand and can they do this while ensuring it remains sustainable reliable and renewable whats driving demand in the shortterm intelligence firm hawkins wright estimates global demand will increase by almost 30 during 2018 to reach 204 mt while forisk predicts a smaller jump an almost 5 mt increase compared to 2017 most of this will continue to come from europe 73 of global demand by 2021 more than 80 in 2018 where projects such as lynemouth power station s conversion from coal to biomass as well as five cofiring units in the netherlands are all set to come online very soon while smaller in number asia is also developing a growing appetite for biomass and in 2018 demand is forecast to grow by 198 mt these estimates might paint a picture of a continually soaring demand but forisks forecast actually expect this growth to plateau levelling off around 2023 at 275 mt hawkins wright expects a similar slow down forecasting manageable growth of under 15 between 2023 and 2026 a forestry specialist at drax group believes this plateau could come even sooner current and future forecasts in industrial wood pellet demand are based on a series of planned conversions and projects coming online he explains but once these projects are active demand in europe will likely plateau around 2021 and then gradually reduce as various eu support schemes for industrial biomass come to an end any long term use of biomass is likely to be based on agricultural residues and wastes but even with this expected slowdown the biomass demand of the near future will be substantially higher than it is right now so the question remains can suppliers meet the need for biomass pellets responding to todays growing demand meeting this growing demand depends on two factors sufficient raw materials and the production capabilities to turn those materials into biomass pellets in todays market theres no shortage of raw materials and low grade fibre instead what could cause challenges is the production of pellets hawkins wright reports the capacity for global industrial pellet production was roughly 214 mt a year at the end of 2017 and will increase by a further 3 mt by 2019 as facilities currently under construction reach completion it means that to meet even forisks conservative 275 mt prediction by 2023 pellet production needs to increase however draxs forestry specialist points to the three to four years needed to complete pellet facilities and the relatively short period of time financial support programmes will remain in place as something that could lead to a slowdown in new plants coming online instead he says expansions of existing plants and the increased use of smallscale facilities will become crucial to increasing overall production however the biomass market changes and develops it remains critical that proper regulation is in place  efficiencies are found and that technological innovation continues within the forestry industry so forests are grown and managed sustainably as we move into a lowcarbon future we know that biomass demand will increase but for this to be truly beneficial and sustainable we need to ensure we are not only meeting the demand of today but also of tomorrow the day after tomorrow and beyond discover the steps we take to ensure our wood pellet supply chain is better for our forests our planet and our future

sustainability  wood pellets building a sustainable business will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 21 march 2018 opinion the uk energy sector is changing rapidly the boundaries between users suppliers and generators are blurring as energy users are choosing to generate their own energy and are managing their energy use more proactively while conversely generators are increasingly seeing users as potential sources of generation and providers of demand management the uk is undergoing an unprecedented energy revolution with electricity at its heart  a transition to a lowcarbon society requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy in that context our groups purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future this means that sustainability in its broadest sense must be at the very core of what we do successful delivery of our purpose depends on all our people across all our businesses doing the right thing every day with the right products and services we can go even further and help our customers make the right sustainable energy choices as our businesses transform and we embrace a larger customer base different generation technologies and operate internationally the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and becoming more complex at the same time the range of stakeholders looking to drax for responsible leadership on sustainability is increasing the need for transparency is greater than ever so our websites sustainability section provides a comprehensive insight into the groups environmental social and governance management and performance during 2017 some of the highlights include carbon reduction  i am pleased that in 2017 the proportion of our energy generation from renewable sources remained high 65 of our generation during the year came from sustainable biomass and accounted for 15 of the countrys overall renewable generation we maintained our rigorous and robust approach to ensure that we only ever use biomass that is sustainably produced and legally sourced people  another key achievement was the roll out of our people strategy to 2020  one drax  which focuses on talent to deliver on our strategic and operational objectives safety  the health and safety of all our employees and contractors is of paramount importance to drax while the groups safety incident rate remained on target in 2017 the fire at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did cause an outage with disruption lasting into 2018 it highlighted once again that the risks of generating using biomass must be mitigated through robust safety procedures and a riskbased plant investment and maintenance programme safety therefore remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are determined to do even better customers  our business to business b2b energy supply business received recognition for their dedication to customer

efficiencies sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton rouge a significant carbon saving compared to trucks will be achieved when lasalle reaches its capacity of 450000 tonnes per year moving pellets by rail should start in the next year tags decarbonisation  investors  supply chain  sustainability  united states  wood pellets collaborating for biodiversity

that would facilitate a rapid risk assessment for all inwoods fibre this operational risk assessment procedure combined with formal conservation commitments such as the atchafalaya basin keeper agreement reflect a comprehensive strategy to protect biodiversity drax biomass is looking forward to actively contributing to regional conservation enhancement efforts in 2018 and beyond a partnership formed with the american forest foundation aff in 2017 is paving the way the aff is a publicly supported notforprofit organization established to conduct charitable educational research and scientific programmes aimed at the responsible use and conservation of renewable resources our partnership with the aff is aimed at improving habitat for atrisk southern wildlife species through active forest management  with opencanopy pine habitat identified as a conservation need the market that drax biomass provides for smalldiameter forest thinning material can directly benefit the regional biodiversity in addition to efforts around our own facilities drax biomass employees have been contributing to a collaborative effort run by the sustainable biomass program sbp to provide better information on how to assess whether or not there are forests with high conservation values in a catchment and what to do about them sbp expects to publish the guidance from this workgroup in

which drax biomass operates there is a system of local taxation called severance tax this is a tax raised on each tonne of timber felled in a state and is usually paid by the landowner drax biomass has elected to pay this tax directly on behalf of the supplier on all roundwood received at each pellet plant in mississippi alone over a 12month period severance tax in excess of 80000 was paid the monies raised are used for local schools roads and other public services tags sustainability american tree farm sustainable bioenergy the majority of forestlands in the southern us are privately owned 86 and twothirds of these forests are owned by families and individuals the american tree farm system atfs administered by the american forest foundation was established over 75 years ago to provide support and recognition to these noncorporate landowners who play a key role in forest sustainability today the 74000 tree farmers across the us manage approximately 205 million acres of forestland the programme has evolved into an internationally recognised third partyverified certification standard endorsed by the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc standards the atfs now provides a means by which family tree farmers can be recognised and rewarded in the marketplace for meeting rigorous sustainability standards analogous to large corporate owners certified to
