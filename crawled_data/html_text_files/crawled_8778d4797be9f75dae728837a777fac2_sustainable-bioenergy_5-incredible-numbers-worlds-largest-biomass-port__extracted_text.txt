power station 5 incredible numbers from the worlds largest biomass port how the uks largest port keeps the biomass rolling in 26 january 2018 sustainable bioenergy since its origins the port of immingham has held close links with the uks rail and energy networks it was the humber commercial railway and dock company along with the great central railway that first established the dock completing it in 1912 to serve its primary purpose of exporting the most important fuel of the time coal today immingham is the uks largest port by tonnage  and while these transport connections endure theyve changed with the times the port is now connected to modern rail infrastructure and helps run a renewable energy system immingham is one of a number of uk ports that receives shipments of wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity at drax power station in yorkshire with 20000 tonnes of wood pellets arriving at drax every day here are the numbers that tell the story of how the port of immingham keeps more biomass coming in than any other in the world  135 million revamping for renewables the port began to get serious about renewable energy in 2013 when an investment of around 135m kickstarted the creation of the immingham renewable fuels terminal  the largest biomass handling facility in the world developed by the associated british ports as part of a 15year deal with drax the revamp of the former coal port saw an update of its unloading storage rail and road facilities to make it biomassready getting those 60000 tonnes of biomass pellets from ship to train to drax requires tight supply chain systems designed especially for this task 2300 tonnes of biomass unloaded every hour a key component of immingham is its continuous ship unloaders replacing the ports grab cranes in 2013 these two structures use a combination of suction and an archimedes screw to discharge 2300 tonnes of biomass an hour from docking ships the continuous unloaders are bespoke for immingham and designed to keep operating at a constant rate as the humbers tide rises and falls biomass is drawn up through the unloaders to a conveyer that then takes it all the way from the jetty to one of the ports eight silos 120 olympicsized swimming pools of storage unlike coal which can be stored in the open air biomass must be kept dry  immingham stores wood pellets in eight silos each capable of holding 25000 tonnes of biomass with the port doubling its storage space from four silos in early 2016 the sites total capacity now comes in at 336000m 3  the equivalent of more than 120 olympicsized swimming pools  here the biomass can be stored for any time between a couple of days and a couple of months depending on draxs demand 72 trains heading to britains biggest power station every week the next leg of the journey for the wood pellets sees them moved along the conveyer to board draxs specifically designed trains  imminghams rail facilities and draxs train wagons were developed to automate the loading process for maximum efficiency trains slow down to half a mile per hour as they enter the loading bay where sensors and magnets open the hatch doors of the wagons and close them when theyre full the automation of this process allows a 25wagon train to be filled in just 37 minutes in total 12 trains can pass through each day meaning the port can send 72 trains to drax every week with each hoppers full load at 716 tonnes of compressed wood pellets each train can carry between 1700 and 1800 tonnes it takes the total biomass reaching the power station from immingham to a maximum of 130000 tonnes each week 400 million added to the local economy draxs contribution to the yorkshire and humber region includes 3650 jobs and a 4192 million economic impact  this is primarily the result of the impact made by drax power station to the region however its support of other businesses along its supply chains means its economic contribution is felt far beyond its selby site in 2016 drax indirectly supported 1800 jobs in yorkshire and the humber region at facilities such as immingham its indirect economic contribution came to 117 million as the regions biomass industry became increasingly important find out about another major uk port that has been transformed thanks to renewable energy how does biomass get shipped to the
