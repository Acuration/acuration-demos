showing what the development will include as well as an environmental impact report will also be available 11 january 2018 httpsrepowerdraxcomwpcontentuploads201801draxrepowerproject3dmodelnologo1mp4 more events are being held to ensure local people have their say about drax power stations plans to repower up to two of its remaining coalfired electricity generating units with gas and install what could be amongst the largest batteries in the world draxs project team will be on hand at the events to discuss the plans with local people and listen to their views new images and interactive displays showing what the development will include as well as an environmental impact report will also be available if the plans go ahead in their entirety the development would include two combinedcycle gas turbines ccgts which would also be capable of operating as rapid response gas power plants in opencycle mode with a combined capacity of up to 3600 megawatts mw of electricity as well as battery storage of up to 200mw the exhibitions follow on from similar events held in november and are part of the statutory consultation process required ahead of submitting an application for a development consent order andy koss chief executive of drax power said holding public events to share our ideas with local people is a great way to hear their views its really important to us that we support and work with our local communities  we want people who live and work in the area near the power station to play a part in shaping our thinking for the future we look forward to sharing our ideas and hearing thoughts the options were exploring could reuse some of the existing infrastructure from the remaining coal assets at drax and extend their operation as gas plant into the 2030s the repower project could secure the future of the power station beyond 2025 when the government says coal must come off the system drax power station is a national asset and a significant driver of economic growth in the north of england generating more than 12bn for the northern economy and supporting 6000 jobs drax is already the uks largest single site renewable power generator having converted three coal generating units to use sustainable wood pellets more than two thirds of the power produced is now renewable providing 17 of the uks renewable electricity  enough for four million homes mr koss explained that by upgrading its existing infrastructure to use gas it would provide more capacity stability and essential grid services keeping costs low for consumers and delivering the governments commitment to end power generation with unabated coal by 2025 public exhibitions featuring draxs proposals are taking place at the following venues selby town hall york street selby yo8

complement draxs ongoing work to explore options for further generation from sustainable biomass and are part of its strategy to play a vital role in changing the way energy is generated as the uk

infrastructure project nsip under the construction or extension of a generating station category in part 3 sections 141a and 152 of the planning act 2008 as amended as such drax is required to seek planning permission known as a development consent order dco from the secretary of state for business energy  industrial strategy about the repower project draxs proposals include the following elements up to 3600 megawatts mw of new gas generation capacity and up to 200mw of battery storage  two battery storage facilities one per unit and each up to 100mw the capacity of the draxs coal units being considered for this project is 1290mw gasfired generation units four new turbines up to two per unit that can operate in combinedcycle or opencycle modes use of existing steam turbines and cooling towers a new gas pipeline connection to the national gas transmission system and an electrical connection into draxs existing substation to allow electricity to be exported to the national grid an option to install a temporary crane positioned next to the existing jetty on the river ouse and at a point close to the power station during construction environmental assessments are
