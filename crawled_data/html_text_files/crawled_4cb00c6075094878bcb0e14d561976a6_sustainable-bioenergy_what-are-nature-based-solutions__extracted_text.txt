2021 sustainable bioenergy what are naturebased solutions naturebased solutions are means of removing carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere by conserving restoring or managing physical environments these are separate from engineered or technologybased solutions for removing co 2  in that they use natural forest soil and coastal ecosystems a landscape that can absorb co 2 from the atmosphere and trap it there is known as a carbon sink how can naturebased solutions help tackle climate change reducing co 2 levels in the atmosphere is key to tackling climate change the paris agreement sets out targets for organisations and nations to reduce their co 2 emissions to keep global warming within 15 degrees celsius of preindustrial levels and avoid catastrophic consequences however even as industries strive to decarbonise some crucial sectors of the economy such as aviation and agriculture may prove hugely difficult or even impossible to entirely reduce emissions to zero therefore as well as reducing co 2 emissions it will be essential to actively remove co 2 that may remain in the economy this makes naturebased solutions ability to absorb co 2 from the atmosphere crucially important nature and carbon sinks have kept earths natural carbon cycle balanced since long before humans even stood upright and they have a crucial role to play in removing co 2 that remains in the atmosphere even as industries strive to reduce their emissions how can forests work as naturebased ways of capturing carbon forests remove carbon from the atmosphere using photosynthesis to capture co 2 using the carbon as a source of energy while releasing oxygen a 2014 study found that the worlds forests had absorbed as much as 30 of annual global humangenerated co 2 emissions over the previous few decades forests are some of the earths most important carbon sinks but face threats such as creeping urbanisation protecting and managing forests is an important part of ensuring they continue to remove co 2 from the atmosphere afforestation is the establishing of a new forest while reforestation is the restoration of a forest where trees have been lost afforestation and reforestation require significant planting and maintenance of trees but offer additional benefits of reducing the chances of desertification and flooding improved forest management also increases the productivity of forests with activities like thinning diseased or suppressed trees this is because young trees absorb more co 2 to fuel their growth than more mature forests that do not grow at the same rate what other ways can the land capture co 2  forests are not the only way land can be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere soil all over the earths surface is a massive carbon sink simple changes in farming methods can better protect soil and enable it to continue serving as a sources of carbon removal and storage such methods include rotating crops and reviving grasslands which create larger volumes of plant biomass that decay and store more carbon in the soil the effectiveness of soil as a carbon sink can be enhanced further by using a substance called biochar biochar is a highcarbon form of charcoal made by burning biomass like wood or agricultural waste in a zerooxygen environment when this charcoal is added to soil more of the carbon absorbed will remain locked in it and soil isnt the only earthbased natural substance that absorbs co 2  rocks can too as they are rained on weather and erode rocks naturally absorb carbon the bicarbonate that is produced is washed into the sea and is eventually stored on the seabed this process can be enhanced by grinding rock into powder and spreading it over a large area how can restoring environments remove carbon mangroves on coasts and riverbanks as well as salt marshes and sea grasses offer another major source of carbon removal and storage when protected or restored these coastal ecosystems which cover 490000 km 2 of the earth can absorb and store huge amounts of what is referred to as blue carbon  in fact they have the ability to sequester carbon at a faster rate than other types of vegetation  the regeneration of peatlands a type of wetland including bogs and swamp forests is also an important way of creating carbon sinks peatlands cover more than 3 million km 2 around 3 of the worlds surface and sequester 037 billion gigatonnes of co 2 per year what other types of solutions are there its difficult to predict co 2 levels that will remain in the uk economy the national grids 2020 future energy scenarios fes report lays out a steady progress scenario in which decarbonisation is slow and limited to power and transport sectors in this forecast there is still 258 million tonnes of co 2 being emitted in 2050 naturebased solutions ability to remove co 2 at such a scale can be limited by factors such as the land use needed which can encroach on food crops for example nature based solutions are do not always offer permanent removal of co 2  forest fires for example would release carbon stored in forests damaging their ability to remove emissions achieving the levels of carbon capture needed to reach net zero will require a variety of naturebased techniques and technologies are needed all working in tandem to achieve a net zero future manmade technologies include carbon capture methods such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs  but it can also include methods such as using wood or lowcarbon concrete in construction there are more ambitious innovations at play too such as stratospheric aerosols cloud seeding space mirrors and painting surfaces with a reflective coating fast facts afforestation and reforestation have the potential to capture between 5 and 36 billion tonnes of co 2 every year at a cost of between 390 and 39 per tonne uk woodland set up by the uk government has 13000 hectares validated and more than 5000 projects forestry registered which will lead to 8 million tonnes of carbon being sequestered annually apple has invested in mangrove forests as a means of carbon offsetting its operations natural rock weathering currently absorbs around 03 of global fossil fuel emissions annually  and can also helping to counteract ocean acidification once minerals are sweep to costal regions go deeper can carbon capture create a net zero future for the uk what we need for a zero carbon lower cost energy future negative emissions techniques and technologies that will help meet climate change mitigation targets how does carbon capture work how we can go carbon negative by 2030 what is a biomass wood pellet  share name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter
