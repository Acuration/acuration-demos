sustainable bioenergy latvia is a heavily forested small country about half the size of england with 52 forest cover totalling 354 million ha 27 times bigger than the forest area in england and 11 bigger than the entire uk in its catchment area analysis report of the baltic country consultancy indufor found best management practice is driven by the stateowned sector with an increasing proportion of corporate owners improving management standards in the private sector markets are dominated by domestic sawtimber demand and pulpwood exports to neighbouring scandinavia fuelwood pellets and biomass are substantial and critical markets for lowgrade fibre increasing forest area carbon stored and no deforestation there has been an increase of around 400000 hectares ha of forest in latvia since 2000 this is due to natural afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands and also to an improvement in forest inventory analysis in 2009 which provided a more accurate assessment of land use and forestry data since 2010 the forest area has increased by 55000 ha there is no evidence of deforestation primary land use latvia there has also been a substantial increase in forest carbon or growing stock this increased by 106 million cubic metres m 3  since 2000 75 hardwood and by 33 million m 3 since 2010 57 hardwood increase in forest carbon limited hardwood markets a proportion of the increase in hardwood volume in 2009 was due to the improvement of forest inventory calculations but also due to increased natural regeneration on unutilised land the hardwood forest in latvia and the baltic region is quite different to that of the us south  in the baltics there is prolific hardwood regeneration birch alder and aspen which grows quite rapidly there are limited markets for structural timber therefore hardwoods produce a lot of lowgrade wood fibre there are no domestic pulp markets in latvia and only limited markets for panel board therefore much of the lowgrade wood fibre can only be used for firewood and biomass the chart below shows a minor change in species composition from planted pine to naturally regenerated spruce and aspen  the most prolific regenerators in this region varied species mix planting and regeneration state owned forests have a higher proportion of planted forest areas compared to the private sector where natural regeneration is preferred due to lower costs planting allows the owner to control the species mix quality and growth whereas regeneration can be more of a lottery for both quality and species mix as more corporate owners emerge planting with improved stock may increase restocking practice by ownership category how the financial crisis impacted latvian forests harvesting levels have been consistently below net annual increment since 2000 there have been some fluctuations in the annual allowable cut in state forests particularly following the global financial crisis in 2008 harvesting in the private sector declined due to falling prices and sawnwood production dropped by 42 in 2009 compared to 2006 during that period stateowned forest increased harvesting in order to support the industry in the absence of strong markets and private sector supply postrecession the harvesting balance returned and demand for wood products increased the current surplus of growth compared to removals is around 55 million m 3 pa or a growth drain ratio of 16 surplus of growth compared to removals biomass and pulp prices increasing wood pellet exports have had limited impact on wood prices the feedstock for this market fuelwood  forest chip has limited competition and therefore remains fairly stable pulpwood markets are driven by export demand to scandinavia and can be volatile as this market fluctuates 2018 saw a substantial spike in pulpwood prices due to increased export demand as a response to a global increase in pulp and paper prices boosting scandinavian production this had a minor knock on effect on the domestic fuelwood markets variation of lowgrade wood prices with changing demand an important part of this analysis is to look for evidence to evaluate draxs performance against its new forest commitments  some of which relate directly to these trends and data sets pine forest in latvia below the consultant summarises the evidence of biomass impacts against key metrics in the forest industry of latvia is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes in  forest area  forest cover no impact both forest area and forest cover have increased during the last two decades the main driver of the growing forest area has been the natural regeneration of agricultural lands that were left uncultivated during the soviet regime forest growing stock no impact forest growing stock has steadily increased throughout the observation period the main driver for harvesting level is the roundwood demand from sawmills panel mills and export woodbased bioenergy demand may increase thinnings and residue collection but it is not as significant a driver for total harvests as the aforementioned exported pellets have accounted for approximately 1014 of the total volume of annual harvests in recent years depending on the assumed average dry densities of the harvested wood and pellets harvesting levels no impact  slight increasing impact the national felling volume is only about 65 of the national forest increment the total harvesting area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings and increased share of clearcuts a decline in both area and volume of fellings can be seen between 20022008 and 20102016 the main drivers of harvesting levels are sawmill industry panel industry and export demand however wood demand for energy purposes can still improve the overall income for the forest owner and therefore increase the total harvesting levels in private forests harvesting residue collection increasing impact most of the collected residues originate from clearcuts in state forests most produced harvesting residues are left in situ and they are not overexploited collection of wood residues from harvesting operations has been increasing for the last 15 years as a result of increased capacities and demand from heat and chp plants latvia is increasingly relying on woody biomass for energy generation forest growth  carbon sequestration potential no apparent impact the total forest area and growing stock have grown in the last decade according to latvias national forestry accounting plan 20212025 the forests are decreasing their ghg sequestration capacity even a low sequestration rate increases carbon storage which explains the increases in forest growing stock and area the decrease in ghg sequestration capacity is due to forest ageing emissions from soils and the increased share of broadleaved forests which have lower carbon accumulation capacity than conifers removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are an input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes to forest management practices  rotation lengths no impact the law on forests regulates minimum forest age and diameter for clearcuts the lvm and largescale forest owners often conduct clearcuts at minimum diameter whereas smallholders tend to wait until roundwood prices are high due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations thinnings increasing impact in naturally afforested former agricultural lands no impacts on thinnings overall the total harvested area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings due to existing forest age structure and increased share of clearcuts most of the harvesting residues are collected from clearcuts there is an increased demand for small diameter wood and harvestingprocessing residues overall the increased demand for smalldiameter hardwood has increased harvesting in previously unmanaged afforested agricultural lands which usually overgrow with broadleaved trees these kinds of lands are usually otherwise not significant for forest management conversion from hardwood to softwood no impact no indication of hardwood conversion to softwood was found instead pine forests are decreasing due to the favouring of natural regeneration which usually results in spruce or broadleaved forests in nutrientrich andor wet soils is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has impacted solid wood products markets  diversion from other wood product markets no apparent impact production of sawnwood and woodbased panels have increased or remained steady ie no evidence of diversion several interviews confirmed that sawlogs are not processed for other products besides sawnwood and woodbased panels wood prices no apparent impact prices of all wood assortments increased in 20172018 most notably the prices of pulpwood this was due to difficult harvesting conditions and increased demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden because of high market pulp prices pulpwood prices returned to presurge levels in 2019 fuelwood prices also increased temporarily but at a much more moderate rate the main driver for fuelwood price increases was the surge of pulpwood prices read the full report catchment

changing forest structure in virginia and north carolina 21 may 2020 sustainable bioenergy forest owners have responded to the recovery in pine sawtimber markets since the global financial crisis of 2008 by planting more forest and investing more in the management of their land the same period has witnessed increased demand from the biomass sector which has replaced declining need for wood from pulp and paper markets the area of timberland  actively managed productive forest  has increase by around 89000 hectares ha since 2010 this change is due to three important factors new planting on agricultural land the planting of lowgrade selfseeded areas with more productive improved pine and the reclassification by the us forest service usfs of some areas of naturally regenerated pine from woodland to timberland the 2018 data shows that pine forest makes up 46 of the timberland area of which 61 is planted and the remainder naturally regenerated hardwoods cover 43 of the timberland area with 93 of this naturally regenerated the remaining area is mixed stands composition of timberland area since 2000 there have been some significant changes in the composition of the timberland area with a transition from hardwood to softwood pine has increased from 39 of the total area in 2000 to 46 in 2018 and hardwood has decreased from 50 to 43 over the same period all pine areas have increased since 2000 with naturally regenerated pine increasing by 13000 ha and planted pine by 340000 ha since 2000 mixed stands have declined by 6500 ha as some of these sites have been replanted with improved pine to increase growth and sawtimber production the biggest change has been in the hardwood areas where there has been a decline of around 314000 ha despite the total area of timberland increasing by 31000 ha change in forest type this change has been driven by private forest owners representing 91 of the total timberland area seeking to gain a better return on investment from their forest land hardwood markets have declined since the 2008 recession and demand for hardwood sawtimber has not recovered demand for pine sawtimber has rebounded and is now as strong as precrisis pine also offers much faster growth rates and higher total volumes in a much shorter time frame typically 2535 years compared to 7580 years for hardwoods the decision to change species is similar to a farmer changing their agricultural crops based on market demand and prices for each product where forests are managed for revenue generation then it is reasonable to optimise the land and crop for this objective this can be a significant positive from a carbon perspective more carbon is sequestered in a shorter time frame and more carbon is stored in long term wood products if the quantity if sawtimber is increased increased revenue generation also helps to maintain the forest area rather than conversion to urban development agriculture or other uses a potential negative is the change in habitat from a pure hardwood stand to a pure pine stand each providing a different ecosystem and supporting a different range of flora and fauna there is no conclusive evidence that one forest type is better or worse than the other there is a great deal of variety of each type some hardwood forests are rich in species and biodiversity others can be unremarkable the key is not to endanger or risk losing any species or sensitive habitat and to ensure that any conversion only occurs where there is no loss of biodiversity and no negative impact to the ecosystem it is not clear whether all of the lost hardwood stands have been directly converted to pine forests some hardwood stands may have been lost to other land uses urban and other land has increased by 400000 ha some may have been directly converted to pine by forest owners encouraged by the increase in pine sawtimber demand and prices whatever the primary driver of this change it is clearly not being driven by the biomass sector change in forest type  timing the chart above demonstrates that the biggest change loss of hardwood and increase in planted pine occurred between 2000 and 2012 prior to the operation of the pellet mills since 2012 there has been no significant loss of natural hardwood and only a small decline in planted hardwood read the full report catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends

changes management of state and corporate owned forests is now good but some small privatelyowned areas of forest are still poorly managed despite this both the forest area and the growing stock have

 note since 2014 it has not been compulsory for private and other forest owners to submit reforestation data click to viewdownload planting of seedlings is the most common form of regeneration however some native hardwood species are strong pioneers and naturally regenerate among the spruce and pine stands this has led to a change in the species composition of some forests with an increase in

growth slowed or halted official statistics show a decrease but this is due to sampling error in 2018 there was recordhigh wood demand from finland which was driven by high global pulp prices motivating maximal pulp production this increased harvests to a previously unseen level harvesting levels slight increasing impact during 20042011 harvesting levels in estonia were less than half of the estimated maximum sustainable level this resulted in an increase in the maximum sustainable harvesting level for the 20112020 period in 2018 the harvesting volumes were at the maximum sustainable level the main drivers increasing the harvesting volumes have been increased sawmill capacity and production high demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden and improved demand for energy wood this was a temporary peak and demand has already slowed softwood lumber prices have decreased significantly in europe due to an abundance of wood supply from central europe which has been created by widespread bark beetle and other forest damages global pulp prices have also decreased to below 2017 prices forest growth  carbon sequestration potential ambivalent impact the annual increment has grown throughout the 20002018 period increased fuelwood price has enabled forest management in some of the alder forests that were completely unutilised in the past thinnings both commercial and

soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels utilisation of sawmill byproducts does not directly impact forests carbon sequestration potential but it can increase harvesting through improved sawmill overall profitability impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to forest management practices rotation lengths neutral forest law regulates minimum forest age

woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations at least in statemanaged forests in forests that are older than the minimum final felling age sawlog price is a more important driver for finalfelling decisions than woodbased bioenergy demand thinning increasing impact the increase of bioenergy demand has increased the demand for smalldiameter hardwood which in turn has increased

papers pulp and paper mill located in the morehouse parish of louisiana had been in operation since 1927 and was once the largest employer in the area however as a result of the global recession of 2008 the company was forced to lay off over 550 employees and shut the facility other mills in the area have also reduced production including georgia pacific which let go around 530 people at its crossett arkansas plant 18 miles to the north of morehouse in 2019 for an area dominated by forests such as northern louisiana and southern arkansas this decline in traditional markets came as a serious blow its a region where a healthy market for wood products is vital for the local economy and in turn the health of the regions forests luckily other wood product manufacturers and industries have since began to fill the gap engineers in front of wood pellet storage silos at draxs morehouse bioenergy biomass manufacturing facility in northern louisiana drax biomass has opened a mill in morehouse parish that uses some of the the lowgrade wood previously used to supply the paper industry to produce compressed wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity in the uk commissioned in 2015 the plant employs 74 people and can produce as much as 525000 metric tonnes of biomass pellets a year this makes it an important facility for local employment and the wood market in the region however to ensure it is positively contributing to the area and its environment the demand for wood must be sustainably managed morehouse bioenergy sources lowgrade wood from a catchment area that covers a 60mile radius and includes 18 counties in arkansas and four in louisiana as drax biomass doesnt own any of the forests it sources wood products from it regularly examines the environmental impact of its pellet mills on the forests and markets in which it operates the aim is to ensure the biomass used by drax to generate 12 of great britains renewable electricity is sustainably sourced and does not contribute to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts a new report by forestry research and consulting firm forisk evaluates the impact of biomass pellet demand from morehouse bioenergy on the forests and wood markets within the mills catchment area map of pulpwoodusing mills near morehouse timber market it found that biomass demand in the region does not contribute to deforestation  nor increase forest harvesting above a sustainable level overall growth of the regions pine timberland which supplies morehouse bioenergy continues to exceed removals pointing to expanding forest carbon and wood inventory annual growth compared to harvesting removals growing forests and increasing timber stocks the study focuses on timberland  working forests  in the plants sourcing area which the us forestry service categorises as productive land capable of providing timber on an industrial scale the timberland here is made up of 63 softwood trees which includes pines and 37 hardwoods such as oak pellet manufacturing as a whole including other pellet producers in the area accounts for only 6 of the demand for wood products in the region of that morehouse bioenergy contributes to 4 of total pellet demand total area of timberland lumber  such as sawtimber  makes up the bulk of demand for wood products accounting for 46 of total demand largely as a result of its high market value and landowners aims to extract maximum revenue from their pine stands however the less valuable wood  parts of trees that are misshapen too short or thin to be used for lumber  can be sold at a lower price to biomass pellet mills this wood might previously have been sold to paper and pulp mills exclusively but with international papers departure morehouse bioenergy now fills a part of that role total volume of growing stock on timberland maintaining healthy markets for both high and lowvalue wood is key to enabling landowners to reforest areas once they have been harvested in the knowledge it will provide a valuable return in the future ultimately however the way forests are maintained depends on the individual landowners and how they want to use their land the advantages of corporate ownership morehouse bioenergys catchment area covers 28000 square kilometres of timberland within which 96 of the timber is privately owned while some of that is owned by families with small patches of productive land 54 is held by corporate owners this includes businesses such as real estate investment trusts reits and timber investment management organisations timos which advise institutional investors on how to manage their forest assets this high percentage of corporate ownership influences forest management and replanting as owners look to maximise the value of forests and seek to continue to generate returns from their land in general corporate owners are spending more money on silviculture and actively managing their timber stands explains forisk consulting partner amanda lang they are investing more in fertiliser their seedlings and harvest control on pine stands because that leads to larger trees of a higher quality and more profit in the long run this is reflected in the higher growth rates found in the private sector leading to faster rates of carbon sequestration annual growth per hectare by owner type smaller private landowners meanwhile may have other objectives for their land like recreation and hunting in addition to timber income as a result some owners may be less inclined to intensively manage their timber stands forgoing fertilisation and competition control due to cost and might harvest on a less regular basis although these landowners may not be maximising the productivity of their timber resource to the same degree corporate owners do their unique management often contribute to greater diversity on the landscape demand and forest health in 2018 the annual average price for a metric tonne of pine sawtimber in morehouse bioenergys catchment area was 2571 down from a 10year high of 3160 in 2010 similarly pine pulpwood from which biomass pellets are made was valued at 775 per metric tonne in 2018 down from a 10year high of 13 in 2010 these low wood prices have caused many landowners to delay harvesting forests in hopes for a more lucrative wood price as a result pine timber inventories have grown across morehouse bioenergys catchment area in 2010 the us forest service counted more than 167 million metric tonnes of pine inventory by 2018 this had increased by more than 35 to reach 226 million morehouse bioenergy market historic stumpage prices metric tonne the report suggests this price slump is an ongoing result of the 2008 recession which greatly affected us house construction  one of the primary uses of sawtimber and many other types of wood products in the us some areas have already seen sawtimber prices increase as they recover from the recession  however the report suggests this is not spread evenly on a national level the inventory overhang in morehouse bioenergys catchment area is expected to begin reversing in 2024 or 2025 as lang explains we expect inventories to increase for a few more years and then start to decline that said inventories will remain higher than prerecession levels while high inventories suggest an abundant resource lower inventory volumes are not indicative of declining or unhealthy forests rather they can point to younger growing forests that have recently been replanted which will later grow to higher inventory volumes as they mature both suggest a healthy forestry industry in which landowners continue to reinvest in forests overall the analysis of the region points to healthy growing forests and importantly a sustainable industry from which drax can responsibly source biomass pellets ensuring the biomass used at drax power station is sustainably sourced is crucial to its

the hardwood inventory remained static historic inventory and timberland area in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload us forest service fia data shows that the pine resource in this catchment area has been maturing the volume of timber has been increasing in each size class year on year this means that the volume available for harvesting is increasing and that more markets will be required to utilise this surplus volume and ensure that the longterm future of the forest area can be maintained historic pine inventory by dbh class in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload this is reflected in the growth drain ratio  the comparison of annual growth versus harvesting a ratio of one shows a forest area in balance less than one shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing phase but it can also occur when insufficient market demand exists and owners are forced to retain stands for longer in the absence of a viable market draxs morehouse bioenergy compressed wood pellet plant in northern louisiana this can have a negative impact on the future growth of the forest limiting the financial return to forest owners and reducing the cumulative sequestration of carbon by enforcing suboptimal rotation lengths the current growth drain ratio of pine around morehouse is 167 with an average annual surplus of around 7 million metric tonnes this surplus of growth is partly due to a decline in sawtimber demand due to the global financial crisis but also due to the maturing age class

john thank you for your letter of the 9 january detailing the findings and recommendations from the first meeting of the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass i want to begin by reiterating how important the work of the iab is to draxs purpose and ambition as you know we recently announced our intention to become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030 by scaling up our pioneering biomass with ccs beccs pilot project this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use makes a positive contribution to our climate the environment and the communities in which we operate to that end both you and the iab will play a vital role by guiding us on our sourcing choices and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be i enjoyed meeting with the iab and hearing your conclusions from the first meeting i am also pleased to hear from my team that the longer discussions were useful and constructive please pass on my thanks to all the members of the iab for their time and consideration in particular i am grateful for their consideration of our new sustainable biomass sourcing policy and the insight and recommendations that were given i am pleased to hear that you agree our policy is an accurate representation of the criteria laid down in the forest research report i agree that a key topic for us to explore is how science can be further developed with regards the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood i also agree that understanding the counter factuals in the usage of wood that has come to us is important this is an area we have and continue to explore and i would refer the iab to a report we have published subsequent to the meeting catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends 2019  which contains an independent analysis of the impact of our sourcing at our amite pellet mill in mississippi the team look forward to discussing this with you at a future meeting and receiving your input to shape the next phases of this work i also agree the need to continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light as well as ensure that the current policy is embedded into our operations for that reason our policy will be kept under regular review to accommodate changes in science and new evidence as it emerges we have also committed to advancing scientific research in the areas applicable to our operations through partnerships with academic institutions and direct support for academic research with regards your suggestion of a restatement of the academic evidence on biomass sustainability we shall give this interesting approach due consideration i do believe that better alignment through a shared understanding of the evidence among the academic community environmental groups policy makers and industry would be a welcome development and would be grateful to the iab for its further consideration of how this might be achieved i will also raise your considerations regarding the sustainable biomass program spb in my position a member of the spb board you are correct that our new policy goes beyond sbp and so an important work programme for us is how we demonstrate we are meeting the new policy lastly i welcome the addition of two interim telephone calls which will help to keep momentum between the half yearly meetings and will support us as we develop our policy research and implementation projects further thank you for this commitment as the work of the iab progresses i look forward to hearing how you believe drax can best build the evidence required to demonstrate that we are sourcing according to the best available science as the worlds largest biomass consumer it is important that we lead by example this means not only having a world leading biomass sustainability policy in place but also the data and evidence available to give all our stakeholders the confidence that we are fulfilling our purpose of

iab the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass provides this statement following its first meeting on friday 15th november 2019 attendees john beddington chair john krebs deputy chair virginia dale sam fankhauser elena schmidt robert matthews exofficio member during the meeting iab members discussed the role of the iab reflected on the public launch of the iab reviewed and accepted the iabs terms of reference developed its understanding of draxs business considered draxs approach to sustainable biomass including its new responsible sourcing policy  explored the climate aspects of draxs new responsible sourcing policy in light of forest researchs work on the carbon impacts of biomass  explored draxs use of the independent sustainable biomass program standard to evidence their performance against drax policies the iab shares this summary of its findings and recommendations the iab agreed that its role is to provide independent advice to drax on its sustainable biomass policy and practice iab members will do this by scrutinising the science and evidence informing draxs approach and by providing independent feedback to drax on how it can adopt best practices in addition to holding two face to face meetings each year the iab agreed to hold two interim telephone meetings the iab recommended drax refer to forest environment not natural environment in its policy the iab noted that the ten criteria drax have outlined to reduce the carbon emissions of its biomass approach have been designed to reflect the findings of forest researchs carbon impacts of biomass consumed in the eu report 2018 the iab found that the drax criteria are an accurate interpretation of the report the iab would like to explore how the science can further be developed with regard to the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood and consider how draxs policy might evolve the iab and drax discussed the possibility of developing some sub criteria for specific forest types the iab suggested drax could consider a restatement of the evidence academic review process to better understand and draw alignment on where there is scientific evidence on the sustainability of biomass the iab suggested drax should consider both a goal to continuously improve and consider the longer term implications of its policy commitments in light of potential climate changes the iab emphasised that the way drax operationalises its commitments will be critical it stressed the importance of robustly exploring the counterfactuals to draxs biomass activities highlighting the potential for tradeoffs between climate and biodiversity outcomes as an area for more detailed review the iab highlighted a number of considerations for drax in its use of the sustainable biomass program sbp it welcomed sbps adoption of a multistakeholder approach and suggested it will be important to scrutinise its evolution it noted that as draxs sustainability commitments go beyond sbps current criteria drax needs a strategy on how to evidence the compliance for these additional commitments the iab expressed interest in learning about draxs long term vision it noted that the ceasing of subsidies in 2027 will be a key milestone and highlighted its interest in exploring draxs strategy for managing this in future meetings with drax the iab will further examine evidence of draxs approach performance and impact against its commitments to identify any changes that drax may need to make the iab noted the following specific topics for further consideration evidence relating to the impact of thinning a forest on carbon pest control and fire risks how drax operationalises its commitments the counterfactuals of draxs biomass activities and potential tradeoffs between biodiversity and carbon outcomes draxs approach to biodiversity draxs long term vision including its plans for developing and scaling bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and its broader roadmap to net zero carbon

wood pellets trusting in trees  how four countries transformed their forests 14 november 2018 sustainable bioenergy from arcticcircle snowladen pines to damp equatorial rainforests to dry australian scrublands the planet is home to an incredibly diverse range of forested environments and while each region is very different almost all have been impacted by humans the effects of this have not always been positive and despite decades spent raising awareness of the importance of forests for the health of the world some regions forests remain in decline africa and asia in particular have seen a decline in forest cover although each year sees less lost over the past few decades but there are areas where the impact of humans is in fact having a positive effect this is largely thanks to the introduction of modern sustainable forestry practices  which have incentivised growth and helped bringing a variety of environmental and economic benefits to different regions around the world a recent report by pöyry management consulting for drax has looked in depth at these benefits and in particular four regions where different approaches to sustainable forestry have brought a positive impact to people industry and the environment alike more than a testament to the beneficial effects sustainable forest management can have it shows that while the tactics methods and environments may differ their positive effects are universal us south turning around old practices weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama the forests of the us south from virginia and kentucky to texas and florida have a long history of misuse both indigenous people and later european settlers used disruptive techniques such as large scale burning and removed valuable mature hardwood on a mass scale often leaving areas to naturally regenerate that largely changed in the mid20 th century however when forestry became moreintensive and the need for sustaining a supply of quality timber grew more apparent the introduction of processes such as thinning and managed regeneration helped usher in a more responsible approach that has led to growth in both the forestry industry and forest coverage between 2010 and 2015 there was 50 more growth in the volume of forests than was removed from harvesting more than just growing forest area this means an increase in the amount of carbon being absorbed and stored from the atmosphere charts us south historical increment to removal and us south above ground carbon 19571997  in the us south around 86 of forest land is privately owned by either corporations or individuals but the economics of sustainable forestry practices has encouraged the overall growth in forests even with limited regulations on land use in the area in addition to the native birds and mammals that depend on sustainably managed forests in the region more than 200000 people were employed by the industry in 2016 making it a vital part of local rural economies finland a centurylong history of sustainable practices asikkala finland by taneli lahtinen on unsplash wood and wood products play an important role in finnish culture from its famous saunas to the worlds largest wooden church  multinational phone brand nokia even started life in in 1865 as a wood pulp mill a high demand for wood as a commercial product meant that a few centuries ago finlands forests where in a state of heavy degradation but starting as far back as 100 years ago sustainable practices such as planned harvesting and regeneration legislation were introduced the results are significant there is now more wood in finnish forests today than at the turn of the century the majority 61 of finlands forests are privately owned with the state owning 25 companies only owning 8 and 5 held by other owners many large companies however offer services such as forestry work wood sales drainage and tax services to private owners this collaboration between sectors allows for best practices to be easily shared and quickly become widespread as a result forest stocks have increased from 1500 million m 3 in 1970 to 2500 million m 3 in 2015 even while overall forest area has remained largely the same it

be 30 covered by forestland but by the turn of the last century forests made up less than 5 today however this has grown to as much as 13 owing largely to regulation and incentives chart forest area in uk by country and type over previous 10 years   as far back as the 1700s the uk had become dependent on wood imports from new england in the us and the baltics in europe following the first world war the forestry commission was established primarily to try prevent timber shortages during times of war but it went on to drive a boom in new plantations across the country and introduce grant schemes for private plantations chart top 10 net importers of wood products  in 2017 the uk was the worlds second largest net importer of wood products a problem with this afforestation however was that it mostly consisted of monocultures of exotic species that were well suited to the climate rather than regenerating native species the modern uk forestry standard is countering this practice by putting in place requirements for afforestation and replanting that protect biodiversity landscape and climate change as well as soil and water forest in argyll and bute some 73 of the uks forests are privately owned which includes historic estates and charitable trusts as well as investment funds despite the increasing forest area in the uk over the past century imports of both wood and wood products still make up almost 80 of the uks wood needs the upside for the region is increased recreational and preserved historic forests uruguay sustainably managing rapid expansion uruguays forestry industry is much younger than the likes of the us south or finland but offers an example of a how to rapidly expand the sector while preserving its old growth or primary forests eucalyptus trees in uruguayan working forest in 1975 the country introduced incentives such as tax waivers on forest operations and later subsidies for new plantations as well as tax duties for timber exports the result was a surge in eucalyptus plantations which grew from 25000 hectares in 1987 to more than 1 million hectares in 2015 largely driven by interest from international companies and investors these plantations are currently managed sustainably with growth still exceeding removals eucalyptus is not a native species to uruguay but by allowing international investors to plant on land deemed of no agricultural or environmental value the country has seen enormous afforestation while 800000 hectares of native forests remain the economic impact is similarly impressive today forestry directly
