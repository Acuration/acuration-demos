power station gone with the wind fossil fuel loses ground in uks energy mix new analysis from imperial college london for drax electric insights has found that for the first time ever installed wind capacity has surpassed gas reaching 279gw in june compared to the 277gw installed capacity of gas generation 13 september 2023 after more than a century of fossil fuels dominating the uks power grid britain now has more installed wind capacity than gas generation new data from drax electric insights also shows output from gas power stations fell year on year by 23 in q2 2023 and output from coal fell by 75 to its lowest level on record carbon emissions from electricity production fell to less than 10 million tonnes of co2 in the second quarter of 2023 for only the second time on record new analysis from imperial college london for drax electric insights has found that for the first time ever installed wind capacity has surpassed gas reaching 279gw in june compared to the 277gw installed capacity of gas generation as a result after more than a century of fossil fuels dominating britains electricity grid coal and gas power generation has plummeted at the fastest rate outside of the pandemic in its latest quarterly report drax electric insights has found that output from gasfired power stations fell by 23 in q2 2023 compared to the same quarter last year meanwhile output from coal which was once was the backbone of grid was slashed by 75 to its lowest levels on record overall carbon emissions from electricity production fell to less than 10 million tonnes of co2 in the second quarter of 2023 for only the second time on record with the only previous occasion being due to the destruction of demand from covid19 lockdowns britains installed capacity of power stations over the past two decades click to viewdownload the figures come amid new data showing that for the first time ever the uk has more wind power capacity installed than gas left electricity generated from fossil fuels in britain during each quarter since 2010 right yearonyear change in electricity generated from fossil fuels in britain during each quarter since 2010 click to viewdownload dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report series said wind power is blowing away gas and coal from britains energy mix and in just a decade weve gone from relying completely on the polluting fuels of the past to embracing the clean energy technologies of the future the shift to wind as the largest power source by capacity is a clear sign of the progress weve made showing countries around the world that they can decarbonise their power grids when government and industry works together great britain now has just one remaining coalfired power station following draxs decision earlier this year to permanently end use of the fuel at its plant in north yorkshire once the largest coalfired power station in western europe drax power station is now the single largest generator of renewable power in the uk over the last decade four of the power stations six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass providing the uk with clean green and secure renewable electricity penny small draxs group generation director said cutting the uks reliance on imported foreign gas and coal is critical to strengthening the countrys national energy security and tackling climate change at drax we believe the uks next big focus should be on unlocking investment in technologies which permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere thats why we are progressing plans to deploy bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology at scale in the uk and the us beccs is a remarkable technology that simultaneously removes millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while generating renewable electricity ends aidan kerr senior media manger e  email protected t 07849090368 about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 19 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers in europe and asia customers drax supplies renewable electricity to uk businesses offering a range of energyrelated services including energy optimisation as well as electric vehicle
