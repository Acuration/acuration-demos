british freight line after major repair operation network rail today reopened one of the most important freight lines in the country after an unprecedented 247 operation to keep the lights on 20 april 2020 link to drax power station kept open with 24houraday monitoring after huge flooding damage divers drones and helicopters deployed to monitor the route since february over 90 trains per week still able to use route whilst repairs carried out the line into drax power station was inundated with flood water in february when the nearby river aire burst its banks with the selby plant supplying 5 of the uks electricity it was vital to keep services moving during the covid19 crisis while repair work was carried out engineers have been deployed on 24houraday shifts to maintain the constant safety reassurance required to keep freight trains running chris gee head of operations for network rails north and east route said this was an unprecedented operation to deal with an unprecedented situation its never been more important for us to keep freight services running so we pulled out all the stops to maintain this vital link while we conducted repair work at the same time our teams have worked nonstop to make sure that crucial deliveries of sustainable biomass have been able to run despite severe flooding which has been incredibly important to keep the nation powered up this has been a real team effort and shows the dedication of the rail industry to vital services moving during this national crisis one of two lines leading in and out of drax power station in selby yorkshire had to close in february when water from the nearby river aire flooded the area but engineers were able to keep one route open to allow vital freight services transporting sustainable biomass to keep the nation powered up during the covid19 pandemic image showing the february floods affecting the railway line leading to drax power station the damaged line has now reopened following significant repair work by network rail deliveries were maintained while the work took place with over 90 freight trains a week transporting biomass to the plant this was made possible by the rail industry working together and the dedication of network rail and their contractors cml who took up shifts 24 hours a day to keep watch of the site and make sure that trains could use the line safely a crucial job was monitoring the railway embankment for any further movement following the damage caused by floods the emergency repair work cost 300000 and included unconventional methods to make sure that the line could reopen as quickly as possible this included using a team of divers to inspect structures which were underwater to check for damage as well as flying drones and helicopters along the route to assess the extent of the damage significant repair work to the track needed to take place before it could reopen such as replacing ballast the stones which support the track after sections of it were washed away by flood water the team faced an additional challenge when they discovered that several koi carp from a nearby private residence were on the railway when the pond they were in also flooded network rail teams worked closely with the landowner to safely transport them home keeping freight services moving is of vital importance during the covid19 crisis with the transportation of sustainable biomass helping to keep the lights on across the country network rail is working on ways to improve resilience on the line in a 25million investment and are currently in the design stage of this project rail minister chris heatonharris said freight plays a vital role in ensuring critical food and supplies can continue moving smoothly at this challenging time it is fantastic news that this important line has reopened and once again i want to thank frontline staff for their efforts nigel adams mp said the flooding in february showed how important it is to respond immediately to flooding events when roads are closed homes flooded and in this case the railway line delivering biomass fuel to drax power station was seriously damaged fortunately drax power station was able to continue to generate electricity because network rail responded immediately by introducing emergency operational procedures i am delighted that network rail have now completed the repair of the embankment and the line is back to two tracks working drax ceo will gardiner said the teams who worked tirelessly at network rail on the uk rail freight system and at drax to ensure deliveries of sustainable biomass were maintained throughout the repair work so we can continue to generate the power the country needs during the covid19 crisis have done a tremendous job the health safety and wellbeing of these teams are vital and we have implemented strategies to reduce the chances of spreading the virus these rail deliveries are a critical part of our global supply chain for sustainable biomass that supports thousands of jobs and has delivered economic growth across the north of england while supplying renewable electricity to millions of homes and businesses john smith gb railfreight managing director said huge credit to network rail and their contractor cml who have carried out the repairs so quickly whilst also managing to keep the railway partially open in the meantime the efforts applied demonstrate again the importance of rail freight during these trying times in keeping the lights on and food on the tables gbrf is committed to continuing and redoubling its efforts to ensure that freight continues to move around the country during these unprecedented times db cargo uks head of sales roger neary said db cargo has been working closely with both drax and network rail the communication and collaboration by all parties has been brilliant ensured a seamless supply of material to the power station during the covid 19 pandemic we continue to work with drax power station to provide essential biomass fuel by rail from immingham db cargo uk delivers on average 65 trains per week around 4500 tonnes of biomass which drax uses to supply the uk power network its great to be able to play a part in keeping the uk running during these difficult times ends media contacts drax selina williams drax group media manager e email protected t 07912 230 393 network rail press office

of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets
