power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station how did we use electricity in the 70s the world has changed dramatically in the last four decades but its still powered by electricity the question is do we still use it in the same way 8 december 2017 electrification great britains energy mix is arguably in the best place its been in modern times during the second quarter of 2017 56 of our power came from lowercarbon energy sources  this includes renewable nuclear and much of the power imported from france by 2035 its projected that the amount of electricity generated by major power producers from renewable sources like wind solar and biomass could more than double from just over 80 terawatt hours twh in 2016 to almost 180 twh there is still a way to go but the progress weve made is remarkable great britain is now ranked seventh among large economies for electricity decarbonisation its even more impressive when you consider where weve come from just five years ago 38 of the uks electricity was generated from coal between april and august 2017 that share slipped to just 19  and in april 2017 britain went a full 24 hours without using any coal to generate its electricity  the first time this has happened since the industrial revolution if you look even further back however the difference is even more impressive electricity in the 70s welcome to 1970s britain striking workers in the power industry have prompted edward heaths conservative government to put in place the threeday week limiting commercial use of electricity and putting curfews on television broadcasting  since then a lot has changed and this has had a marked effect on how we use electricity for one the uks population has grown by nearly 10 million  more than that the average number of electronic appliances per household has risen from 21 to 50  in 1970 the average household had 16 lighting appliances one cold eg fridges and freezers one wet eg washing machines and dishwashers one cooking appliance and two consumer electronic devices eg a tv and a power supply unit in comparison the average today is 27 lighting two cold two wet 13 consumer electronics three cooking devices and an additional three home computing devices the uk household today is far more reliant on electricity and electrical devices  unsurprisingly this means how much electricity we use has changed total household electricity consumption in 1970 was 2995 ktoe thousand tonnes of oil equivalent in 2015 britain used nearly double  6869 ktoe and while this is a steep rise our electricity use is currently on a downward trajectory since peaking in 2007 at more than 8000 ktoe domestic electricity use has shrunk thanks to more efficient appliances for example an led light bulb can use as much as 80 less electricity than a traditional incandescent one  and can last 25 times longer our overall energy use ie the sources beyond electricity that we use to fuel things like heating and transport has also decreased since 1970 households are using 12 less while the relative decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in the uk means industry now uses 60 less energy than it did in 1970 these gains are slightly offset by our growing love of mobility in 1970 there were around 10 million cars on uk roads now there are around 26 million and we also take a lot more flights which means the transport sector today uses roughly 50 more energy than in 1970 cleaning things up electricity consumption has changed since the 1970s thats no surprise but whats more important is the electricity we use is cleaner than its ever been in 1970 we used 57 million tonnes of coal in power generation every year by 2012 we were using just three million tonnes and during the last four years coal output has fallen 82 instead our electricity is increasingly coming from natural gas plus renewable and low carbon sources a trend set to continue with the maturation of renewables the increasing prevalence of smarter technologies and smarter more efficient electricity grids our energy system is set to remain in a state of positive change a lot of progress has been made over the last 40 years  and its likely to continue over the next 40 this is the first in a series on electricity demand through the ages the second story of which looks at 2018  share related stories press releases drax helps
