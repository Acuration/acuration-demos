is great britains electricity to zerocarbon emissions 15 may 2019 power generation demand for electricity might have been 6 lower in the first three months of 2019 than in last years first quarter but the demand for lower carbon power is only growing and theres more pressure than ever for global industries to decarbonise more rapidly aided by a significantly milder winter than last year  great britains electricity sector continued to make further progress in reducing carbon emissions in the first quarter q1 of 2019 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity was almost 20 lower in q1 2019 than in the same period last year this was driven by a significant decrease in coal usage with 581 coalfree hours in total over the period  eight times more than in q1 2018 this trend has only increased with may seeing the countrys first coalfree week in modern times the findings come from electric insights  a report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london that analyses great britains electricity consumption and looks at what the future might hold as public commercial and political demand for lower carbon emissions mounts the question for the power system is can it truly reach zeroemissions keeping a zerocarbon system stable quarter after quarter the carbon intensity of great britains electricity system has declined from 545 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatt hour gkwh in q1 2012 to just over 200 gkwh last quarter for a single hour carbon emissions have fallen as low as just 56 gkwh but how soon can that figure reach all the way down to netzero carbon emissions the national grids electricity system operator eso believes it could be as soon as 2025  but some serious changes are needed to make it possible for the system to operate safely and efficiently when you have fewer sources offering balancing services like reserve power inertia frequency response and voltage control  the national grid eso believes an approach that establishes a marketplace for trading services holds the solution the hope is that competition will breed new innovation and bring new technologies such as gridscale storage and ai into the commercial energy markets offering reserve power and more accurate forecasting for solar and wind power for the meantime weatherdependent technologies are a key source of renewable electricity in great britain with wind making up more than 20 of all generation in q1 2019 however with wind capacity only expected to increase how should the system react when its not an option read the full article coauthored by julian leslie head of national control national grid eso how low can we go we cannot control the weather  but we can harness its power today there are around 20 gigawatts gw of wind capacity installed around great britain and this is forecast to double to 40 gw in the next seven years however average wind output can fluctuate between 2 gw one day and 12 gw the next  as happened twice in january it highlights the ongoing needs for flexibility and diversity of sources in the electricity system even as it decarbonises there are a number of ways to make up for shortfalls in wind generation the most obvious of which is through other existing sources there is more solar installed around the county than any source of generation except gas at 129 gw and sun power helped meet demand during a wind drought last summer  solar averaged 13 gw over the last 12 months this is more than coal which accounted for 11 gw however storage will also be important in delivering low or zerocarbon sources of electricity when there is neither wind nor sufficient sunlight at present this includes pumped storage and some battery technologies but in future will include greater use of gridscale lithiumion batteries as well as vehicletogrid systems that can take advantage of power stored in idle electric cars httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 new fuels particularly hydrogen also have the potential to meet demand and help create a wider lowercarbon economy for heating  as well as vehicle fuel with water as the only emission hydrogen can be produced from natural gas or using excess electricity from renewable sources or through carbon capture from industrial emissions  it can then be stored for a long time and at scale before being used to generate electricity rapidly when needed another increasingly important source of great britains electricity is interconnectors however they are not yet being used in a way that can support gaps in the electricity system with northern european countries normally all experiencing the same weather  and wind levels  at the same time read the full article what to do when the wind doesnt blow a bigger future for interconnection great britain added a new power source to its electricity system in q1 2019 in the form of belgium the opening of the 600 million nemo link between kent and zeebrugge added another 1 gw of interconnection capacity it joins connections to france the netherlands northern ireland and the republic of ireland to bring great britains total interconnection capacity to 5 gw these links accounted for 79 of the 78 terawatt hours twh of electricity consumed over the quarter electricity from imports also set new records for a daily average of 43 gw on 24 february  accounting for 129 of total consumption and a monthly average in march when it made up 106 of consumption  these records represent the first time great britain fell below 90 for electricity selfsufficiency with 34 gw of new interconnectors under construction coming online by 2022 and 91 gw more planned to be completed over the next five years great britains neighbours are set to play a growing role in the countrys electricity mix however while interconnectors offer an often costeffective way for great britain to ensure electricity supply meets demand the carbon intensity of neighbouring countries electricity should also be considered read the full article 10 of electricity now generated abroad the need for crossborder decarbonisation the new link to belgium has imported rather than exported electricity every day since it began operations as belgium has the lowest natural gas prices in europe and its power stations pay 16 per tonne less for carbon emissions than their british counterparts this makes it cheaper to import and less carbon intense than electricity from the more coaldependant netherlands and ireland planned links to germany and denmark could allow great britain to import more renewable power however if there is a wind drought across northern europe these countries often turn to their emissionsheavy coal or even dirtier lignite sources france is currently great britains cleanest source of imports mostly using nuclear and renewable generation however when the north sea link opens in 2021 it will give great britain access to norways abundance of hydropower to plug gaps in renewable generation considering the carbon intensity of great britains imports is important because the decarbonisation needed to address the global climate change emergency cant be solved by one country alone for electricity emissions to go as low as they can it takes collaboration that goes across borders read the full article where do britains imports come from explore the quarters data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk  read the full report  commissioned by drax electric
