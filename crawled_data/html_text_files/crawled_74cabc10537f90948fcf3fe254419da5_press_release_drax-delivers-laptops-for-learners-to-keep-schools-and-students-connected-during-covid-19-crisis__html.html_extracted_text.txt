Drax delivers laptops for learners to keep schools and students connected during COVID-19 crisis
Drax Group is working with partner schools local to Drax Power Station to support children and ensure they can continue with their studies from home during the coronavirus lockdown.
28 April 2020
Energy company Drax is delivering laptops with prepaid internet access to schools and colleges local to its operations across Britain, to ensure students can continue with their studies during the Covid-19 crisis.
Eighteen schools, a college and a service to support young people leaving care in Yorkshire will receive 452 of the Drax HP Chromebook laptops with pre-paid dongles.
The Robinson family collect their laptop. Lacey is pictured holding the laptop watched by Mum Natalie and brothers Archie (yellow and black top) and Levi.
With schools and colleges closed, many children whose families do not own a computer are finding it difficult to access learning resources.
To ensure no child is left behind, Drax has invested £250,000 in 853 new laptops and each one has three months of pre-paid internet access via a 30GB dongle to support their learning over the summer term. The laptops are being delivered to Drax’s partner schools, local to its operations
across Britain
as part of the energy company’s efforts to support its communities during the lockdown.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“We’re very happy to help people in our communities by providing our partner schools with the technology they need to get more students connected online so they can keep learning during the Covid-19 crisis and beyond.”
Laptops have so far been donated to five schools and a college in Selby and Ainsty near Drax Power Station including:
Selby High School
Barwic Parade Primary
Camblesforth Primary
Selby Abbey Primary
Selby Community Primary
Selby College
Ian Clennan, Head Teacher of Selby Community Primary School, school, said:
“This donation of laptops from Drax is going to make a huge difference to the lives of pupils currently without access to online educational resources – as well as our whole school community after the Coronavirus lockdown is over.

“Ensuring no-one gets left behind in their studies during the lockdown is a priority for us, but schools don’t just provide education – they’re a whole support system. Having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and classmates more easily too – which is also incredibly important at the moment.”
Nigel Adams MP for Selby and Ainsty, said:
“The donation of 292 laptops and internet access is very welcome and is just one example of how Drax play an important role in supporting our communities and helping our young people reach their full potential.
“Education is essential, and the laptops means that 292 children will be able to keep up with their studies while schools are closed but also afterwards when there is wealth of learning available to them on-line via the new laptops”.
A total of eighteen

schools, a college and a service to support young people leaving care in

the communities of

Selby, Snaith, Goole, Doncaster, Grimsby and Scunthorpe are receiving laptops from Drax including:
Selby College
Selby High School
Barwic Parade Primary
Camblesforth Primary
Selby Abbey Primary
Selby Community Primary
Snaith secondary
Goole secondary
Campsmount Academy
East Yorkshire Children’s care leavers service

Editor’s Notes
Drax
is a founding member
of the C-19 Business Pledge, a national scheme which encourages employers to join the coronavirus effort by pledging to help their employees, customers and communities to get through the crisis.
The 853 laptops and dongles will be delivered to Drax’s partner schools and colleges local to its operations. Head teachers will then distribute the technology to pupils identified as requiring support.
About Drax
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030.
Its 2,900-strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production.
Power generation:
Drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across Britain. The assets include the UK’s largest power station, based at Selby, North Yorkshire, which supplies five percent of the country’s electricity needs.
Having converted two thirds of Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the UK’s biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
Its pumped storage, hydro and energy from waste assets in Scotland include Cruachan Power Station – a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowed-out mountain Ben Cruachan.  It also owns and operates four gas power stations in England.
Customers:
Drax owns two B2B energy supply businesses:
Haven Power, based in Ipswich, supplies electricity and energy services to large Industrial and Commercial sector businesses.
Opus Energy, based in Oxford, Northampton and Cardiff, provides electricity, energy services and gas to small and medium sized (SME) businesses.
Pellet production:
Drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the US South which manufacture compressed wood pellets (biomass) produced from sustainably managed working forests. These pellet mills supply around 20% of the biomass used by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to generate flexible, renewable power for the UK’s homes and businesses.
