to keep electricity system stable 29 january 2020 press releases national grid has awarded synchronous compensation contract to draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station the contract is to provide system services to keep the national grid stable the contract means drax will provide services such as inertia which keeps the system stable and reactive power which helps move power around the grid for the next six years andy koss ceo generation drax at cruachan power station click to viewdownload in high res system services such as inertia and reactive power were readily available in the past due to the number of large spinning power stations on the electricity system but the rise of nonsynchronous generators such as solar wind and interconnectors mean these services are now more important and have to be procured separately  andy koss ceo drax generation said provision of these crucial services is central to draxs purpose of enabling a zero carbon lower cost energy future our strategic aim is to be a leading provider of system services which support the deployment of more renewable power  it could also help to bring us a step closer to our ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 this is the first tender national grid eso has run under phase one of its system stability pathfinder under the terms of the provisional contract one of the four turbines at the 440mw cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in argyll and bute will no longer generate power instead the turbine will only be used to provide the services needed to support the system national grid currently plans further stability tenders to take place both nationally and regionally which provide an opportunity to secure further contracts for some of draxs other power generation assets notes to editors national grid esos system stability pathfinder tender is separate to the capacity market auctions starting tomorrow and units are able to take part in both processes provided they are available to provide the contracted services inertia is a system support service which acts like a shock absorber helping to control changes in frequency to ensure the grid maintains a frequency of 50hz without having enough inertia available to reduce the rate of frequency changes which occur on the system the grid is more vulnerable to power cuts national grid made an announcement about its new approach to stability services today ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t

report press releases both the uk committee on climate change and the intergovernmental panel on climate change agree that beccs a groundbreaking negative emissions technology which drax is pioneering will play a critical role in addressing the climate emergency it is the only negative emissions technology which can produce renewable electricity whilst removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by applying beccs to draxs biomass generating units we could deliver 16 million tonnes of negative emissions a year  a significant proportion of whats required in the uk to address the climate crisis this could be done sustainably using lowgrade wood from the working forests we already source from which have a large surplus of this material draxs new biomass policy paves the way for worldleading sustainability standard 24 january 2020 press releases an independent advisory board iab led by former uk government chief scientific adviser sir john beddington was appointed by drax in october when it published a strengthened sourcing policy to ensure the biomass it uses to produce 12 of britains renewable electricity meets the highest sustainability standards in its first report the iab has found that draxs sustainable biomass sourcing reflects the recommendations made by forest research  the research agency of the forestry commission which is widely considered to be the industry gold standard drax group ceo will gardiner said the work of the iab is vital in guiding and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be i am reassured to know that our existing policies reflect the forestry commissions recommendations and well continue to work with the board to strive for greater excellence across our operations we recently announced our ambition to become the worlds first carbon negative company by using sustainable biomass with carbon capture and storage technology to achieve this we need to go further in our efforts to lead the world on biomass sustainability standards positively contributing to our climate the environment and the communities in which we operate the iab also recommended consideration is given to a review of existing evidence on sustainable biomass to advance understanding among academics policy makers and environmental groups such a restatement of evidence would be aimed at fostering agreement amongst scientists and environmental groups on the role of sustainable biomass sharing information with third parties on draxs operations and using scientific evidence to identify points of agreement disagreement and areas which need further study the iabs chair john beddington said its a complex area to navigate and if some common ground based on the scientific evidence can be agreed it creates a framework to help ensure the right types of biomass are used which make the greatest contribution towards addressing the climate emergency the uks committee on climate change has said that biomass will play a critical role in achieving the uks 2050 net zero target the iab which meets twice a year will produce a written report of its conclusions and recommendations for drax after its meetings and a summary of these will be published on the drax website  the iab held its first meeting on november 15 2019 ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr email protected 07712 670 888 editors notes forest

economy report drax set up the iab in 2019 alongside its new strengthened biomass sustainability policy which goes beyond existing regulations to ensure the companys biomass sourcing continues to improve with the latest science and best practice the restatement of the evidence the iab has suggested is an independently run process based on input from scientists with varying points of view consultation with industry nongovernmental organisations and policy makers sir john beddington also said in his letter to drax that the board wanted to explore how science regarding the use of early thinnings and small roundwood can further develop drax has initiated a programme of independent analysis on the environmental and economic impacts in the areas where it sources its wood it will be sharing this with the iab for its scrutiny and insight the iab acts as a forum for engagement between sustainable biomass experts and drax and is tasked to advise and give feedback on feedstock

loch awe ben cruachan is one of many munros that spend much of the winter blanketed in snow cruachan is unlike any other scottish mountain however on its slopes lies a dam which stores water in a reservoir that is then transported into a power station built inside the hollowedout centre of the mountain to generate power by spinning turbines on a few occasions the snowfall has been so extreme that weve been unable to access the dam for a few weeks at a time says gordon pirie a civil engineer at cruachan thankfully we have enough controls in place where we are still able to monitor and operate things remotely when there is excess power on grid the turbines reverse and use it to pump water from loch awe up to the reservoir in this way it is storing the excess electricity in the form of water  like a battery  and holding it in the top reservoir ready to be used by the power station when demand for power increases built on the shores of loch awe in argyll and bute in the mid1960s cruachan was the first reversible pumped storage hydro system on its scale to be built in the world and is still one of only four power stations in the whole of the uk that can operate in this way making it a vital component of britains generation network the power station is very responsive and able to react quickly to changes on the system  it can achieve full load 440mw in just 30 seconds and can operate continuously at full output for around 15 hours if necessary thanks to scotlands wet weather 70 million cubic metres of water flowed into cruachans reservoir from surface water from the mountainside melting snow and rainfall in 2018 thats enough to fill 28000 olympicsized swimming pools this water is collected and delivered through a complex series of aqueducts which stretch for some 14km and brings water from 75 intakes across the mountain the intakes range from pipes no larger than small street drains to some large enough for a jeep to drive through keeping these aqueducts in working order so melt water from snow can continue to flow into the reservoir is one of piries main tasks even in freezing conditions the water will still flow through the aqueduct system the intakes have a builtin feature which allows the water to flow into them even if the surface is frozen solid he explains any snow or frost on the ground eventually thaws and makes its way to the reservoir cruachan shows that with a bit of ingenuity and determination scotlands dreich weather neednt be a negative the rain and snow which fall across the highlands helps produce renewable electricity that powers our homes and moves us closer to a netzero future the hollow mountain shows that every cloud really does have a silver lining image captions click to viewdownload top image a

with british airways and shell submitted plans for europes first commercial wastetojetfuel plant near immingham on the south bank of the humber the company has since voiced its support for the zero carbon humber campaign which is seeking to develop a largescale carbon dioxide transport and storage network in the humber that would significantly reduce emissions and create new job opportunities for the region dr neville hargreaves vp waste to fuels velocys said subject to planning consent and financing our altalto immingham project could be producing sustainable aviation fuel as soon as 2024 velocys has a robust technological solution for this challenging sector which addresses one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise and can help the uk meet its net zero target furthermore well also produce a captureready stream of carbon dioxide and thus a transport and storage network in the humber would allow us to make negative emission fuels delivering a further environmental benefit steve drayton director of innovation drax dr neville hargreaves vp waste to fuels velocys brian greensmith drax richard gwilliam drax martin hopkins velocys steve drayton director of innovation at drax said there are some interesting synergies between our ambitions at drax to become the worlds first carbon negative company and velocys plans to produce carbon negative fuels in the humber having innovative businesses like velocys in the humber region makes a zero carbon industrial cluster here an exciting possibility which will result in new jobs and clean growth delivering for the environment as well as the economy the zero carbon humber campaign aims to create the uks first net zero industrial cluster in the region which could make a bigger contribution to uks climate goals than any other industrial cluster  capturing 15 of the uks current annual co 2 emissions by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs drax will be able to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

negative by 2030 when ceo will gardiner spoke at cop 25 in madrid in december sustainable biomass is an important part of the uks longterm energy mix combining this renewable fuel with carbon capture and storage technology on draxs biomass generating units at its power station in north yorkshire england means the groups operations could capture 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year or more  a significant proportion of the uks target drax announced it had captured the first carbon dioxide from its pioneering beccs pilot project earlier this year the uk committee on climate changes  net zero  report states that beccs could generate up to 173 twh of electricity by 2050 capturing up to 51 million tonnes of co 2  around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the uk will need to capture to become net zero drax launched the zero carbon humber campaign in september with partners equinor and national grid ventures aimed at creating the worlds first zero carbon industrial cluster
