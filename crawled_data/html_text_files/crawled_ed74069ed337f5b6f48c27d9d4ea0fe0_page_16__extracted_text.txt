constituency mr jack said i know from my own constituents particularly those living near the galloway hydro scheme just how much young learners valued the use of the laptops and free internet access

children and college students are returning to the classroom amidst extensive measures to keep them safe the additional laptops being provided by drax will again be extremely useful and appreciated one lesson i believe has been highlighted through the current health crisis is the importance of internet access and good broadband connections  an area of technology particularly in rural areas i
