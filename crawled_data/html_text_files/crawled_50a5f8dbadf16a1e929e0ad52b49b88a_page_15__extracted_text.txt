investors drax biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies 21 march 2018 sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton rouge a significant carbon saving compared to trucks will be achieved when lasalle reaches its capacity of 450000 tonnes per year moving pellets by rail should start in the next year tags sustainability  supply chain  wood pellets  investors  decarbonisation  united states bitcoins electricity consumption problem 2 march 2018 electrification bitcoin is having a breakout year its price fluctuations are making headlines all over the world and major investment banks are finally beginning to take it seriously  in short bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency  its becoming a major player but for all the advantages it and other decentralised currencies offer such as lowtransaction fees and no intermediaries  theres a fundamental problem at their core they use an extraordinary amount of electricity according to bitcoin analysis site digiconomist  the bitcoin network now uses more than 52 terawatt hours twh every year  more than the whole of portugal ireland or peru if this rate of growth continues its forecast that by july 2019 it is expected to use more electricity than the us  so while bitcoin may be heralded as a saviour from the monopolies of big banks what does its incredible appetite for electricity spell for the worlds power networks why does bitcoin use so much electricity bitcoin might be an entirely digital currency but it still needs to be created and this requires a process called bitcoin mining bitcoin is a decentralised network meaning transactions are carried out directly between parties without any central authority instead bitcoin securely records all its transactions through a network made up of thousands of users computers bitcoin mining is essentially the process of recording and adding these transactions to the public network or ledger  known as the blockchain every 10 minutes each pending bitcoin transaction is converted into a complex mathematical problem that needs to be solved this is where the mining computers come in which use highpowered processing hardware to tackle the mathematical equations and solve each transaction the first miner to successfully crack one of these problems adds that bitcoin transaction to the ledger and is rewarded with an amount of newly mined bitcoins  currently set at 125 bitcoins btc worth roughly 140000 this process isnt a quick one and relies on large numbers of highpowered computers to solve the problems one of the largest bitcoin mining rigs in the world  in ordos inner mongolia  is made up of eight buildings crammed with 25000 machines  all cranking through calculations 24 hours a day unsurprisingly this huge amount of processing power uses a lot of electricity it also requires a huge amount of space and generates a lot of heat all of which have sent bitcoin miners around the world in search of cheap electricity plentiful space and cold weather the search for cheap tech power iceland and sweden have become popular destinations for bitcoin mining thanks to its climate which keeps computer equipment from overheating and plentiful electricity  in fact in iceland mining is set to reach 840 gigawatt hours gwh this year  more than the 700 gwh used by the countrys households icelands high level of geothermal and hydroelectric power means these mining operations have a low environmental impact however the same cant be said of the largest bitcoin miner in the world china while it has an abundance of hydropower and an increasing renewable capacity a large amount of chinas electricity still comes from coal  72 of its total generation came from the fossil fuel in 2015  this raises concerns around the environmental impact of bitcoins increasing electricity needs digiconomist estimates the emissions of just one largescale coalpowered bitcoin mining operation eg the operation in ordos could fall between 2440 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per hour  roughly the same as flying a full boeing 747400 for the same period however not everyone is convinced the network is as energy intensive as reports suggest  and part of the challenge is that  despite knowing how many bitcoins are in existence  theres no precise way of knowing how much mining is going on what is known however is that even as cryptocurrency prices fluctuate mining is increasing  in short bitcoins incredible appetite for electricity isnt going anywhere soon but could it get cleaner moving towards cleaner mining some companies are tackling the problem of making bitcoin more sustainable by bringing it off grid and linking it directly to cleaner sources of power much like how tech companies are striking deals with local renewable suppliers when locating data centres  hydrominer  for example is placing mining hardware directly into hydropower stations while harvest aims to use dedicated wind turbines to power mining which takes pressure off national grids and their electricity sources however a more fundamental change could be possible making the protocol used to create bitcoins less energyintensive ethereum arguably the main rival cryptocurrency to bitcoin this year switched from proofofworkbased mining to proofofstake  this means coin creation is not depended on highpowered computers cranking through calculations but instead through owners validating their stake in the cryptocurrency and voting on block creation  another alternative is chia network which harnesses unused hard drive storage space for blockchain verification chia farmers for offering storage space for the network both have significant ground to cover to catch the market leader however so the more pressing question remains whats next for bitcoin and what will happen as the number of available bitcoins decreases the future of bitcoin like gold there are a limited number of bitcoins that can ever be mined  21 million to be precise this means the reward for bitcoin mining halves roughly every four years as they become more abundant the next drop is scheduled for 2020 when the reward will slide to 625 btc but this doesnt mean theyre getting easier to mine in fact it is growing increasingly difficult and this means more computer power and a need for even more electricity which in turn means higher overheads a report from jp morgan estimates the price of mining a single bitcoin has grown tenfold in the last year to 3920  a change that could send miners in search of cheaper utilities more than this the added stress on grids could lead to a growth in dirtier and cheaper fossil fuels which can generate and power mining operations around the clock this could mean that as mining becomes more difficult and rewards drop it will be controlled by fewer largerscale operators which can absorb the spiraling costs either way its expected they will be forced to reduce their electricity consumption or at least the cost of it to remain economical as the rewards they earn cover less of their expenses ultimately however if cryptocurrency is set to play a positive role in our future it must become less electricity intensive and work with evolving energy systems to be as sustainable and progressive for the environment as it could be for the global economy tags technology  investors drax group plc

renewable records  great britains electricity system is less dependent on fossil fuels than ever before over the course of 2017 lowcarbon energy sources including nuclear as well as renewables accounted for half of all electricity production the finding comes from electric insights  a quarterly research paper on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the latest report highlights how great britains electricity system is rapidly moving away from fossil fuels with coal and gas dropping from 80 of the electricity mix in 2010 to 50 in 2017 its an impressive change for eight years but its even more dramatic when compared to 60 years ago powering the past with renewables in 2017 renewable output grew 27 over 2016 and produced 96 terawatt hours twh of electricity  enough to power the entire country in 1958 back then great britain was dependent on one fuel coal it was the source of 92 of the countrys power and its highcarbon intensity meant emissions from electricity generation sat at 93 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  compare that to just three million tonnes of co 2 emissions from roughly the same amount of power generated in 2017 just by renewables today the electricity system is much more diverse than in 1958 in fact with nuclear added to renewable generation 2017s total lowcarbon capacity produced enough power to fulfil the electricity needs of 1964s beatlemania britain but whats enabled this growth in renewable generation one answer as bob dylan explained a year earlier is blowin in the wind read the full article here powering the past  stormy weather powering great britain wind power experienced a watershed year in 2017 thanks to blusterier weather and a wave of new wind farm installations coming online wind generation grew 45 between 2016 and 2017 windfarms both onshore and offshore produced 15 of the entire countrys electricity output in 2017 up from 10 in 2016 the 45 twh it generated over the course of the year was almost double that of coal  and theres potential for this to increase in 2018 as more capacity comes online the 16 gigawatts gw of new offshore wind turbines installed in great britain last year accounted for 53 of the net 315 gw installed across europe  with large offshore farms at dudgeon and race bank still being commissioned the 32 gw of total new operating capacity registered in 2017 across offshore as well as onshore wind is on course to grow coauthor of the article renewableuks head of external affairs luke clark said these figures underline that renewables are central to our changing power system higher wind speeds and a jump in installed capacity drove a dramatic increase in the amount of clean power generated alongside breaking multiple records for peak output wind energy continued to cut costs as wind power is dependent on weather conditions it is intermittent in its generation but in 2017 more than one storm offered ideal conditions for wind turbines during q4 there were three named storms as well as the remnants of a hurricane all battering the british isles all of which helped push average wind speeds 5 higher than in 2016 while calculating wind power based on wind speed is complex  windier weather means more power  monthly average wind speed is proportional to monthly average power output from wind farms while the 2017 annual average wind speed of 101mph was in line with the countrys longterm average wind generation was not consistent across the year in q4 wind output was close to an average of 7 gw by contrast between may and august it was closer to 4 gw thankfully these calmer months saw longer hours of daylight allowing solar power to compensate read the full article here wind power grows 45 driving down carbon emissions the knockon effect of an increase in renewable generation is a drop in the carbon intensity of electricity production and in 2017 this reached a new low across the year carbon emissions including those from imported sources totalled 72 million tonnes down 12 from 2016 this decrease is equal to 150 kg of co 2 saved per person or taking 47 million cars off the roads the least carbon intensive period of the quarter came just after midnight in the early hours of monday 2 october when it measured a record low of 56 grammes per kilowatt hour gkwh thanks to low fossil fuel generation and high levels of renewables over the whole year there were 139 hours when carbon intensity dipped below 100 gkwh this generally required 50 of the electricity mix to come from renewable sources and demand to be lower than 30 gw for carbon intensity to dip under 100 gkwh on a more permanent basis greater renewable capacity will be required as demand rises read the full article here carbon emissions down 12 interconnectors meeting future demand electricity demand in great britain has been on the decline since 2002 primarily due to more efficient buildings and appliances  and a decline in heavy manufacturing however this is expected to change over the coming years as more electric vehicles are introduced and the heating system is electrified to help meet 2050 carbon emissions targets while installing greater renewable capacity will be crucial in meeting this demand with lowcarbon power interconnectors will also play a significant role particularly from france which boasts a large nuclear and lowcarbon capacity however electricity sales through interconnectors are often based on dayahead prices rather than the live market which can lead to trades that arent reflective of demand on each sides of the channel in q4 there were eight halfhours when demand was very high more than 50 gw yet power was being exported this occurred despite dayahead prices suggesting traders would lose money due to lower demand in france and the cost of using the interconnector it highlights the need for improvements in internetwork trading as great britain increases its intermittent renewable generation and looks to a greater reliance on importing and exporting power read the full article here moving electricity across the channel great britains electricity system continues to break its renewable records each year and heading into 2018 this is likely to continue wind and solar power will continue to grow as more installations come online and

investors what will electricity look like in 2035 14 february 2018 electrification the year is 2035 cars cruise clean streets without the need for a driver our household appliances are all connected and communicate with one another and all of it is powered by electricity  specifically lowcarbon electricity its been 10 years since great britains last coal power station shut down and across the country wind turbines are generating more electricity than fossil fuels and nuclear energy combined pushing carbon emissions to a new low this isnt a vision of a greenminded scifi novel this is the forecast for great britain in less than 20 years time this sustainable lowcarbon future of 2035 is a significant evolution from today in 2018 and it comes despite a rising population a continued shift to urban living and an expected rise in power demand great britain gets power hungry if we transport back to the here and now of the late 2010s it would be easy to expect electricity demand to drop by 2035 in fact since 2005 electricity demand has been on a steady decline as a result of more efficient appliances and the decline of heavy industry by the mid2020s however this trend is expected to reverse but with the likelihood that appliances will grow more efficient and no sign of heavy industry coming back to british shores what will drive this growing demand two of the major contributors will be the electrification of transport and the heating system with the government setting 2040 as the end date for the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles  preparations are already underway for a fully electrified transport network  but it wont just be restricted to roads train networks and even potentially planes could switch from fossil fuels to electric increasing demand from the transport sector by 128 between 2015 and 2035 electric vehicles evs alone are predicted to add 25 terawatt hours twh of electricity demand by 2035 according to a report by bloomberg new energy finance  however this will be dependent on significant investment in the necessary charging infrastructure to enable a decarbonised transport network across the country added to this will be extra demand from a shift in how we heat our homes if planning goes ahead and pilot projects are completed lowcarbon electric heating is expected to begin rolling out in the next decade and will involve the phasing out of gas boilers in favour of electric heat pumps but as with ev adoption this will require major government investment and incentives to grow electric heating beyond the 7 of uk homes that use it today  an electrified heat network will add a greater strain on the electricity system particularly in winter months when demand is high the result is a forecast increase of 40 gw in demand during peak times  the mornings and the evenings these peak times for electricity consumption will be the greatest test for the grid as intermittent renewables meet more and more of the countrys demand it raises the question how we will cope with cold still and dark november evenings one solution is the growing role of large scale electricity storage  by 2035 technological advances are expected to bring electricity storage to 8 gw of installed capacity  double the size of drax the uks biggest power station it is also likely that the abilities of evs as electricity suppliers delivering excess electricity back to the grid once plugged in overnight will play an increasing role in meeting demand but to ensure this is possible it will require advances in another sector with a great impact on our power system technology this is not just about how technology could enable advances but how much electricity its likely to use the internet of everything and a smarter grid by 2035 chip manufacturer arm predicts there will be more than one trillion internet of things iot devices globally this smart technology will be able to turn everything from your morning coffee maker to your bed into intelligent machines gathering masses of data that can be used to optimise and personalise daily life powering all these devices let alone the vast plains of servers holding all the data they gather is one of the great challenges for the iot industry  however as much as smart devices will demand energy they will also help save it thanks to smart connected devices traffic lights will turn off when there are no cars offices will turn off lights when there is no one in a room and homes will understand your energy needs better and tailor appliance usage to your habits at a larger scale the introduction of artificial intelligence will allow the entire grid to connect and work in harmony with every one of the billions of devices taking energy from it a fullyintelligent system like this will allow grid operators to smooth out peaks in demand by for example charging evs overnight when there is less demand it means that while there will be an overall greater demand for electricity in 2035 the shape of demand may differ from the accentuated peaks of the current system renewable reaction to demand at its heart the increasing electrification of our transport utilities and technology has been driven by a few specific goals one of which is lowering our reliance on fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions  its positive then that all projections towards 2035 have us making significant strides towards this vision coal will have been completely removed from the electricity system  while gas generation will drop to just 708 twh  down from the 1122 twh expected in 2018 according to bloombergs forecast  in its place wind will become the greatest source of our electricity producing 1385 twh in 2035 up from 523 twh in 2018 the watershed year for wind power will come in 2027 when wind first overtakes gas to become the biggest contributor to the grid thanks to significant increases in capacity nuclear will still play an important role in the energy mix contributing 458 twh while solar will more than double in generation from 12 twh in 2018 to 25 twh in 2035  the same amount of power produced by all of californias solar panels in 2016  the results of this continued move to lower carbon sources will be significant carbon emissions from electricity in 2035 are expected to be 2381 gco 2 mj grammes of carbon dioxide per megajoule  less than half what is expected in 2018 and while there will be many major changes in the electricity system over the next 17 years it is this that is perhaps the most important and optimistic tags technology  investors the power systems super subs 5 february 2018 power generation every day we flick on lights load dishwashers and boil kettles but few of us pause and think of the stress this can cause for the electricity system we certainly dont call national grid in advance to let them know when we plan to do laundry but when any number of the 258 million households in great britain turn on a washing machine the grid needs to be ready for it fortunately these spikes in demand are often predictable we are creatures of habit says ian foy drax head of ancillary services we all tend to come home from work at the same time and turn on similar appliances and this keeps the shape of daily electricity demand much the same national grid the operator of great britains high voltage power transmission system uses this consistent demand to plan when and how much electricity will be needed for the coming days and agrees contracts with generators to meet it however there are times when the unexpected can happen  an unseasonable cold spell or a power station breakdown  causing sudden imbalances in supply and demand to plan for this the grid carries reserve power which is used to fill these shortterm gaps delivering this doesnt just mean keeping additional power stations running to deliver last minute electricity instead it involves a range of services coming from different types of providers technologies and timescales in great britain there are four primary ways this is delivered frequency response the fastest form of reserve is frequency response it is an automatic change in either electricity generation or demand in response to the system frequency deviating from the target 50hz  generation and demand must be kept balanced within tight limits second by second failure to do so could lead to the whole system becoming unstable leading to the risk of blackouts this is why every second of the day national grid has power generators operating in frequency response mode these power stations effectively connect their steam governor or fuel valves to a frequency signal if frequency falls generation increases if frequency rises generation is reduced an issue which has arisen over the past few years is a reduction in system inertia  the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension some small power generation technologies along with some demand are sensitive to the rate of change of frequency  too high a rate can cause it to disconnect from the system and this unplanned activity can lead to system instability some forms of generation such as wind and solar along with high voltage direct current hvdc interconnectors between great britain and the rest of europe do not provide inertia as these electricity sources grow on the system the system operator must find ways to accommodate them reducing the size of the largest credible loss eg reducing interconnector load buying faster frequency response or running conventional generation out of merit are the usual approaches spinning reserve the next quickest and most common reserve source spinning reserve can jump into action and start delivering electricity in just two minutes this reserve both positive and negative is carried on multiple generating units often running at a part load position for example if draxs biomass unit 3 is running at 350 mw of a possible 645 mw typical delivery rates are 10 to 20 mw per minute this type of reserve responds to unexpected shortterm changes in power demand or changes in power generation either in size or timing for example during a major tv event or if a generator changes output unexpectedly during television ad breaks the millions of people watching may switch on kettles or flick on lights sending demand soaring  if a programme or sporting event does not end at the scheduled time national grid has to quickly change the generation schedule by sending an electronic dispatch to a generator who responds by quickly ramping up or down thermal power stations such as drax along with hydro and pumped storage which can increase or decrease output on demand  are the most common providers of this form of reserve but newer technologies such as batteries will also be able to offer the speed required  short term operating reserve stor a slightly slower cousin to spinning reserve stor is contracted months in advance by national grid it is designed to be available within 20 minutes notice around 2 gigawatts gw of capacity can provide reserves against exceptionally large losses or demand spikes stor capacity tends to be plant which cannot make a living in the energy market because it has a high marginal cost traditionally stor has been supplied by low efficiency aeroderivative turbines or diesel engines but a wider variety of technologies from batteries to demand reduction are increasingly being contracted demand turn up managing reserve power isnt just about finding extra generation to meet demand sometimes its about quickly addressing too much generation high levels of generation coming onto the grid without an equally high demand can overload power lines and networks  causing instability and frequency imbalances  which can lead to blackouts this might happen in the summer months when the weather allows for lots of intermittent renewable generation such as wind and solar but low levels of demand due to factors like warmer weather and longer daylight hours to restore balance the grid is beginning to ask intensive commercial or industrial electricity users to increase consumption or turn off any of their own generation in favour of gridprovided power in the case of generating units at drax power station  the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation to help slow the rate of frequency change and minimises large frequency swings reserve in a changing energy system planning for the unexpected has long been a staple of the electricity system but as the shape of that system changes  reserve and response delivery is having to change too carrying reserve is easier on conventional plants because you know what the plant is capable of generating says foy wind and solar are subject to the weather which changes over time the certainty you get with conventional generation you dont necessarily get with the intermittency of weatherdependant renewables add to that the way we use electricity everything from high efficiency lighting electric vehicles through to smart appliances and we can see the challenges will grow as more variable renewables hits the system storage technologies will become more important in providing a fastacting source of short term reserve and response smart appliance technology too will play a bigger role in spreading demand across the day and reducing the size of demand peaks and troughs which require rapid changes in generation industry has a role to play too some of the biggest users of electricity are expected to play an increasingly important role in support of the system operator national grid told members of parliament in 2016 that it is our ambition to have 3050 of our balancing capacity supplied by demand side measures by 2020 artists impression of a drax rapidresponse gas power station ocgt with planning permission until these technologies and market mechanisms are widespread and implemented at scale across the grid however it will fall to thermal power stations such as biomass  gas turbines such as the planned progress

system balancing and ancillary services  investors  energy storage the shape of electricity use in 2018 31 january 2018 power generation in homes and offices on streets and in shops there are more electronic devices than ever however for all the phones washing machines and tvs british consumers are plugging in our electricity consumption has been on a downward tick  and has been since the middle of the last decade  at the same time an increasing percentage of our demand is being met by renewable and lowcarbon energy sources by 2016 greenhouse gas emissions from electricity had dropped to 62 below 1990 levels  helping the uk get close to meeting its third carbon budget target its the power sector that has seen the biggest reductions through the decline of coal the greater use of gas and the rise of renewables there are still big strides to make in the economy as a whole  particularly in sectors such as heat transport and buildings but there are positive signs of transformation that could help the country reach its fifth carbon budget goal of lowering emissions by 57 between 1990 and 2030 will 2018 prove to be another milestone year for great britains electricity system and could the electrification of the economy help other sectors stepup their own decarbonisation the efficiency transformation reduced demand for electricity comes in part as a result of the decline in energyintensive manufacturing and heavy industry however in the domestic sector the decline has been equally significant since 2002 energy consumption in the home has fallen 19 from 52229 ktoe kilotonne of oil equivalent to 42486 ktoe as well as electricity this includes gas solid fuels such as coal and more this drop comes despite a growing population economic growth an increase in the number of households and a rising number of consumer devices and appliances  so what exactly is bringing down energy consumption one cause is the increased efficiency of electronics and appliances the phasing out of incandescent lightbulbs  which had hardly changed since edisons day  in favour of energysaving models such as leds has reduced electricity used to light homes by a third since 1997 as well as the improved efficiency of large appliances like fridge freezers there is also a greater consumer awareness of electricity saving habits such as washing clothes at lower temperatures the increase in small batterypowered devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops on the other hand means were spending less time using higherpowered equipment that constantly pulls from the grid such as tvs and hifis what this can lead to however is a change in the shape of electricity demand the shape of power demand can be explored in electric insights  for example overnight when many people choose to charge those batterypowered appliances such changes in demand present a challenge to forecasters at in national grids control room who predict ahead when where and how much power will be needed from the countrys electricity grid shifting demand spikes todays peak electricity demand times remain relatively unchanged from the 20 th century people still come home and turn on lights kettles and washing machines at around 5pm and 6pm but as artificial intelligence makes its way into more and more home appliances  these spikes are likely to level out across the day connected devices will aim to predict peak times and where such tariffs are provided by energy suppliers only run when overall demand costs are lower at the same time lifestyles have changed affecting electricity demand even further in the past some of the biggest surges in uk electrical history came in the immediate aftermath of big tv moments when people across the country switched on kettles opened fridges and went to the toilet now the proliferation of ondemand and online tv has reduced the need for national grid to keep power stations on standby during major televised moments as people choose to watch at their leisure rather than when they are broadcast sports however remains one of the things that still attracts large numbers of live viewers this junes football world cup means the national grid will be braced for any surges in postpenalty shootout tea breaks combined with a royal wedding  the last of which caused a significant spike  summer 2018 could see a few rare moments when mass tv viewing shunts electricity demand enough for it to be noticeable cleaner power but while 2018 may see some instances where demand surges its likely power generation will continue to grow cleaner the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis has released projections suggesting installed renewable electricity capacity could reach 36 gigawatts gw by 2030  building on a 900 increase between 2007 and 2017 it is of course important we continue to use electricity more efficiently in 15 years from now its predicted that power generation could begin to rise significantly and so decarbonising the production of power is arguably just as important as saving it this year will see another flexible 600 megawatt mw coal unit converted to sustainable biomass at drax power station in yorkshire and the first of 84 offshore wind turbines turned on as part of the 588mw beatrice project in the outer moray firth these developments will quicken the pace of decarbonisation in great britains electricity network meaning that positive trend that will continue this is the second story in a series on electricity demand through the ages the first of which looked at the 1970s
