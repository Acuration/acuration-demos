great britains lights on 21 may 2020 press releases renewables supplied more than 40 of electricity during first quarter of 2020 with output overtaking fossil fuels for the first time in february factories and supermarkets reduced electricity usage at key times to help keep the grid stable when power from wind farms fell and margins tightened electricity demand on weekdays down 13 to lowest level since 1982 due to covid19 lockdown  with carbon emissions also falling independent analysis  conducted via imperial consultants by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights shows how volatile the countrys electricity system was in the first quarter of 2020  but how a variety of energy technologies rose to the challenge output from wind farms soared up by 40 compared to q1 2019 as severe storms meant britain experienced its wettest and windiest february since records began  but it was flexible power stations and action from businesses able to reduce their electricity usage in january which helped prevent blackouts during cold calm spells the share of electricity supplied by renewables and fossil fuels each quarter over the past decade dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights reports said britains electricity system is under pressure like never before with both the countrys weather getting more extreme and a global pandemic testing its resolve so far in 2020 weve seen companies reducing their demand for electricity to help keep the grid stable when supply from wind power rapidly decreased and then the covid19 lockdown caused many businesses to shut up shop reducing electricity demand and creating new challenges with oversupply of power having flexibility within the power system at these critical moments is crucial to keeping britains lights on the report shows that when output from wind power fell sharply on cold calm days the stress to the system increased and in one incident created a higher chance of blackouts with just 02gw of spare capacity available compared to over 4gw the following day flexible technologies like biomass pumped storage and gas were able to increase their output to fill the void on some occasions when wind power reduced an evening peak in demand was also managed with factories and supermarkets reducing their electricity usage helping to maintain normal dayahead power prices after lockdown measures were introduced to contain the spread of covid19 weekday demand for electricity fell by 13 to levels not seen since the early 1980s will gardiner drax group ceo said so far in 2020 our lives as well as the power system have been affected like never before to overcome the challenges were facing we must keep sight of the importance of building a sustainable recovery for both our communities and our climate by embracing flexible low carbon technologies we will enable the uks power system to evolve and provide the secure and sustainable electricity supplies a postcovid zero carbon economy needs ends media contacts aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes a recordbreaking quarter in britains power system wind power supplied an average of 123gw through february beating the previous monthly record of 93gw set in december 2019 biomass supplied more than a tenth of electricity over a day for the first time on march 27 2020 supply from all renewable sources accounted for 40 of electricity consumed during q1 2020 overtaking output from fossil fuels for the first time visualising the
