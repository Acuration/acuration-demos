Background
The Humber and Teesside industrial clusters make up 50% of the UK’s industrial emissions, so decarbonising these regions will have the biggest impact on the UK reaching net zero.
Drax would act as an anchor project for Zero Carbon Humber, protecting and creating tens of thousands of jobs, kickstarting a new green industry for the region.
The East Coast Cluster is made up of both Zero Carbon Humber and Net Zero Teesside, supported by the Northern Endurance Partnership – a collaboration between bp, Eni, Equinor, National Grid, Shell and Total, with bp leading as operator.
Drax is ready to invest more than £2bn in two BECCS units at Drax Power Station, with the creation of tens of thousands of jobs.
BECCS at Drax can permanently remove at least eight million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year, whilst supporting the creation of a new global industry in the UK, delivering tens of thousands of jobs in a new green economy. This builds on what we have already achieved with sustainable biomass, in transforming a coal fired power station to become Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
The UK has decarbonised its energy system faster than any other country’s as a result of the support the government made available to renewables like offshore wind, solar and biomass. With the right policies, the same could be achieved for negative emissions technologies – demonstrating the same, global climate leadership the UK has a track record of delivering.
Drax Power Station produces 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity, keeping the lights on for millions of homes and businesses.
We have reduced our emissions by more than 90% in the last decade and Drax is now one of Europe’s lowest carbon energy generators.

Drax and NFU partner to boost UK energy crop market
20 September 2021
Press releases

World leader in sustainable bioenergy Drax Group has teamed up with the
National Farmers Union of England and Wales (NFU)
, to identify opportunities to scale up perennial energy crop production and help the UK meet its ambitious climate goals.
The
Climate Change Committee (CCC)
has previously stated that if the UK is to meet its decarbonisation objectives, a substantial area of energy crops must be planted each year to deliver the low carbon, renewable fuel required over the coming decades.
Through the partnership announced today, Drax and the NFU plan to develop a roadmap for boosting the market in perennial energy crops, identifying how they can be used sustainably.
The programme of work will help to provide insights into important diversification opportunities for UK farming businesses as they adapt to new agricultural policies and will seek to identify new revenue streams that may include utilising marginal land unsuitable for food crops, as well as delivering meaningful climate action.
It will also support Drax’s ambition for British farmers to supply some of the biomass needed for its plans to develop the vital negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
The partnership demonstrates clear intent from the bioenergy and agricultural sectors to accelerate the delivery of negative emissions in the UK following calls to action this summer from the UN’s IPCC, the National Infrastructure Commission, and the Coalition for Negative Emissions.
Drax Group’s Chief Innovation Officer, Jason Shipstone, said:
“If we can source some of Drax’s sustainable biomass for our BECCS units from domestically grown energy crops, we could further reduce our supply chain emissions at the same time as stimulating innovation within British farming.
“By encouraging British farmers to plant energy crops here in the UK, the agricultural sector can join the bioenergy industry, and support national efforts to address the climate crisis, driving down emissions and building back greener.”
NFU Deputy President Stuart Roberts said:
“There is a huge opportunity for the growth of perennial energy crops in the UK, with large areas of suitable land potentially available for diversification into the growing of sustainable biomass for renewable energy generation. This would support the UK’s decarbonisation plans as well as our own agricultural net zero ambition, alongside continuing to provide quality, affordable and climate-friendly food for the nation.
“By working with Drax Group, we can unlock this potential and ensure our farmers are ready to take advantage of the opportunity energy crops create, one which will provide a boost to both farm businesses and the UK’s climate credentials. It’s exciting that the carbon dioxide captured by the crops grown by UK farmers for Drax would be permanently removed from the atmosphere.”
The partnership follows an announcement last month from the Government which outlined the provision of £4 million in funding to increase British biomass production for green energy through the Biomass Feedstocks Innovation Programme.
Drax Group, which has converted Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal to become the UK’s largest single site renewable generator, plans to deploy the essential negative emissions technology BECCS in the 2020s. This has the potential to create the world’s largest carbon capture power project and deliver a significant proportion of the negative emissions needed for the UK to meet its climate targets.
By using BECCS, Drax could permanently remove eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2030, becoming a carbon negative company. The energy crops grown by UK farmers would support this ambition.

Editor’s Notes
The Climate Change Committee has recommended expanding UK energy crop planting to around 23,000 hectares each year by 2030 to support the government’s net zero target
Energy crops are typically densely planted, high yielding crop species grown solely for energy production. The crops are processed into solid, liquid or gaseous fuels, such as pellets, bioethanol or biogas and are then used to generate electrical power or heat.
Energy crops include perennials such as miscanthus and short rotation coppice willow, which are grown with very low levels of inputs and management compared with conventional agricultural land use.
Leading climate scientists at the UN’s IPCC and UK Climate Change Committee have said that the world cannot address the climate crisis without negative emissions from technologies like BECCS, which permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
In August the UK government announced £4 million in funding to increase British biomass production for green energy through the
Biomass Feedstocks Innovation Programme
Drax has started the planning application process for two BECCS units.
Work to build BECCS at Drax could get underway as soon as 2024, with the creation of thousands of jobs.
Subject to the right regulatory support, the first BECCS unit could be operational in 2027, with the second commissioned in 2030, enabling Drax to achieve its world-leading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030.
Drax has already delivered
carbon reductions of more than 90% in its generation business as a result of using sustainable biomass instead of coal at its power station in North Yorkshire, making it one of Europe’s lowest carbon electricity generators.
Planting and growing perennial energy crops would need to start several years in advance of commissioning the first BECCS unit, in order to grow the supply chain progressively over several agricultural seasons.
The NFU has an ambition for British agriculture to be net zero by 2040.
Both Drax and the NFU are founding members of the Coalition for Negative Emissions, a member organisation promoting the growth of the negative emissions solutions to the scale required to deliver global climate targets.

Leading B2B renewable energy supplier changes its name to Drax
14 September 2021
Press releases

The name change marks the next step in the renewable energy supplier’s journey to help businesses and organisations become more sustainable, supporting the UK’s climate goals
The rebrand follows the launch of
Drax Electric Vehicles
and
Drax Electric Assets
and aims to offer a partnership approach for customers, supporting the UK’s journey to net zero
B2B renewable energy supplier Haven Power is changing its name to Drax, to deliver the products and services businesses and organisations need in order to support UK efforts to reach net zero.
Haven Power was acquired by Drax Group in 2009 and supplies more than 20,000 large industrial and commercial customers with over 12TWh of renewable sourced electricity each year – the equivalent annual power use of more than three million homes.
With the rebrand, Drax aims to partner with its business customers to support them in achieving their sustainability goals, delivering innovative solutions which help them optimise their energy use, reduce carbon emissions, and minimise costs.
The name change follows the launch of
Drax Electric Vehicles
, and
Drax Electric Assets
, which help businesses take control of their energy use through the electrification of their fleets and the optimisation of their operations.
Paul Sheffield, Managing Director of Drax’s supply businesses, said:
“Drax has an impressive track record in sustainability – we’ve reduced Drax Group’s carbon footprint by more than 90% in less than a decade.
“By more closely aligning our supply business to Drax, we can better support businesses and organisations with their own net zero ambitions using Drax’s scale, knowledge and expertise in decarbonisation. It also demonstrates our commitment to enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future for our customers.”
Drax plans to deploy vital negative emissions technology,
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
, at its power station in North Yorkshire. This will permanently remove eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2030.
With the creation of a voluntary carbon market, business customers could purchase the permanent and verifiable negative emissions from Drax, helping difficult to decarbonise industries offset their own emissions. This supports efforts to decarbonise the UK’s economy, protects jobs, and demonstrate climate leadership.

Drax calls for UK supply chain to deliver climate saving negative emissions technology
9 September 2021
Press releases

New programme of nationwide events will encourage British businesses to work with renewable energy pioneer Drax to deliver its multi-billion-pound climate-saving negative emissions technology – bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
Events series marks a crucial step on Drax’s journey to deliver this pioneering technology in the 2020s.
Event launch comes as Drax prepares to start a major public consultation on its BECCS plans in November, offering stakeholders and communities the chance to learn more about the project.
The company will be hosting a series of nationwide events throughout 2022 in partnership with the West & North Yorkshire and Hull & Humber Chambers of Commerce, as well as further events across the wider North, Midlands and South of England. These will enable Drax to identify a robust supply chain for BECCS, ensuring the project can be accelerated as soon as planning approval is received.
The event series will start with an introductory webinar on Thursday September 23, 2021, run with business support organisation NOF. The initial event will give new and prospective suppliers the opportunity to learn more about the BECCS project, as well as how they can be involved in delivering this vital negative emissions technology.
Graham Backhouse, Drax’s Commercial Director for the BECCS project, said:
“Negative emissions technologies like BECCS will play a vital role in enabling the UK to reach its net zero goals. At its peak, BECCS at Drax will protect and create over 10,000 jobs, levelling up the north, and positioning the UK as a global leader in this climate-saving technology.
“This programme of events is a fantastic opportunity for businesses of all sizes to get involved and learn more about the project, and we want to encourage a range of companies from across the country to take part.”
Drax has a proven track record in delivering ambitious and pioneering infrastructure projects – the conversion of its power station in North Yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal has enabled it to become the UK’s largest single site renewable generator, reducing its emissions by over 90% and paving the way for the deployment of BECCS.
The event takes place ahead of a formal public consultation on Drax’s BECCS plans in November, when stakeholders including local communities will be able to learn more about the proposed project and provide their feedback.
Businesses which are interested in attending the introductory supplier event webinar on September 23, or the event series more generally and how they can be involved, can register their interest via

Renewable energy company Drax is welcoming seven apprentice engineers as part of its efforts to create career development opportunities in the North and ensure it has the best in-house talent to support its ambitious decarbonisation plans.
The apprentice engineers have won places on the technical apprenticeship scheme at Drax Power Station near Selby in North Yorkshire – the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator, which produces enough renewable electricity for four million homes.
The four-year programme gives new recruits the opportunity to gain expertise working alongside the world-class engineers at Britain’s biggest power station which has become one of Europe’s largest decarbonisation projects following its conversion from coal to using sustainable wood pellets.
Mike Maudsley, Drax Group’s UK Portfolio Generation Director said:
“I started my career as an apprentice and meeting our new renewable energy apprentices is one of the highlights of my job. Providing these young people with the tools needed to become the skilled workforce of the future is not only essential to the success of our business, it’s also an incredibly rewarding part of what we do.
“Giving our apprentices the opportunity to work on the cutting-edge, environmental technologies of the future will ensure we’re nurturing our in-house talent and creating opportunities for people here in the North to lead the green energy revolution needed to get the UK to net zero, supporting a post-covid economic recovery.”
Patrick Harpham, aged 19 from Selby, who has joined Drax as a mechanical apprentice, said:
“I’m really pleased to have the opportunity to be part of the new intake of apprentices at Drax and proud to be starting my career with a company that is so committed to tackling global climate change. I’m also very proud to be following in the footsteps of my great grandfather and grandad, both of whom spent much of their careers at the power station. This family history is what has always inspired me to want to become an engineer.”
Mechanical apprentice Poppy Johnson-Roberts, aged 18 from Cleethorpes, said:
“I chose to apply for an apprenticeship with Drax because it is an innovative company which is always developing and looking to the future. I also feel like it’s a great opportunity for me and will open up so many potential career pathways as Drax is committed to helping young people develop their skills.”
The apprentices beginning their careers at Drax Power Station this year are:
Chloe Wrightham,18, from Grimsby
Daniel Penistone, 17, from Selby
Dylan Hall Parkes,18, from Doncaster
Lewis White, 23, from Grimsby

Poppy Johnson-Roberts, 18, from Cleethorpes
Sam Easthill, 21, from Cliffe, near Selby.
L-R: Daniel Penistone, Chloe Wrightham, Poppy Johnson-Roberts, Drax Group Operations Director Mike Maudsley, Plant Director Bruce Heppenstall, Sam Easthill, Lewis White, Dylan Hall Parkes and Patrick Harpham
They will be trained within the maintenance department of the power station, with three of them in mechanical roles and four working alongside the electrical and instrumentation team.
Drax plans to become carbon negative by 2030 by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) which it aims to start developing at the power station as soon as 2024 with the creation of thousands of jobs.
The first BECCS unit would be operational in 2027 with a second in 2030, permanently removing a total of eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, making a significant contribution to the UK’s efforts to address the climate crisis, whilst generating the renewable electricity the country needs.
