Press Release
Drax boosts STEM skills with new Daldowie apprentices
16 December 2019
Press releases

Two apprentices are kick starting their careers with Drax after the company extended its apprenticeship scheme to budding engineers across Scotland.
Drax is continuing its commitment to STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) skills by offering apprenticeships at its Cruachan pumped storage hydro power station, in Argyll and Bute, Galloway hydro power scheme and the Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow.
Danielle Nicholson, aged 19 from East Kirkbride, has joined Drax’s Daldowie energy from waste plant as a technical apprentice. She said: “I thought that finding engineering jobs in the area might be difficult, so it was great to hear about the opportunity at Daldowie. Renewable energy’s a really exciting industry to be in, especially now with all the focus on climate change.”
Gregor Fraser, aged 19, from Dunbartonshire, said of his new apprenticeship at the Daldowie energy from waste plant:
“
An apprenticeship made the most sense to me as it gives the sort of practical experience you can’t get at university. Drax is well known for its engineering, so I’m really excited to be starting my career with the company, learning new skills and getting some good experience here.”
Both Gregor and Danielle will be working at Daldowie once they have completed formal training at East Kilbride Group Training Association (EKGTA).
Drax’s apprenticeship scheme has been running for over 15 years at its North Yorkshire power station, and since it acquired a portfolio of flexible, low carbon and renewable generating assets, some of which are in Scotland, it has sought to extend the scheme to other locations.
Gregor Fraser
Andy Koss, CEO Generation said:
“To be able to open up new opportunities for apprentices in Scotland is a really proud moment for us. It demonstrates our commitment to education and skills, as well as our dedication to our workforce and the future of these new Drax sites.
“The energy sector is experiencing unprecedented change with Drax right at the forefront of it. We’re going to continue to need talented, hard-working young people to help us deliver the changes needed to meet the UK’s net zero carbon ambitions. As we’ve seen with our apprentices elsewhere, supporting ambitious young people to develop their skills is critical to the ongoing success of our business.”
Drax’s technical apprenticeship scheme
gives new recruits the opportunity to gain skills and expertise by working alongside highly qualified engineers. It is a four-year programme, and specialises in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation.
Drax offers apprenticeships in business support areas too, such as Finance and Business Administration, as well as engineering.
All opportunities are advertised on its website
.
This year’s apprentices at Drax’s Scottish operations are:
Danielle Nicholson (19) who will be working at Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow
Gregor Fraser (19) who will be working at Daldowie energy from waste plant, near Glasgow
Iain MacPherson (17) who will be working at Cruachan pumped hydro power station, Argyll and Bute
Joshua Smith (24) who will be working at Cruachan pumped hydro power station, in Argyll and Bute
Ryan Connelly (19) who will be working at Galloway hydro power scheme.

Motorists saved from flood waters by Drax employees
11 December 2019
Press releases

The first was a man in his 70s who had been stuck in his BMW car for over an hour on the A762 road between
Glenlee Power Station and Earlstoun Power Station
, when Robert Peacock and Daniel Hunter from Drax arrived on the scene at around 4pm, wading through chest deep water to reach the vehicle.
Robert Peacock, a mechanical fitter at Drax’s Galloway Hydro Scheme, said:
“It was just by chance we came across the elderly gentleman, but he had been stranded in his car in freezing water for an hour. We could not open the doors and ended up having to smash the rear window to gain access and drag him out. I think hypothermia would have set in soon, had we not got to him.”
Robert and Daniel transported the man to the Glenlee Power Station where they provided him with dry clothes to change into and a hot drink before taking him to an ambulance waiting on the other side of the floodwaters, which took him to hospital.The second incident involved a woman with a small child who were trapped inside a car, which had broken down in floodwater on the same road at around the same time. Another Drax team member Rob Little assisted them to safety.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Head of Hydro said:
“The quick thinking of the teams at our power stations, their swift response and professionalism helped to prevent these serious incidents resulting in tragedy – we’re very proud of what they did and send our well wishes to the people who were trapped. In both these incidents a significant volume of water had entered the vehicles and the occupants were trapped.”

The Met Office had issued a yellow weather warning for the Galloway area, and SEPA had issued several flood warnings on Tuesday due to the volume of rainfall.
Drax’s Galloway hydro scheme produces enough flexible electricity to power more than 90,000 households and includes six power stations, eight dams and a network of tunnels, aqueducts and pipelines. The system helped to absorb some of the rainfall and provide a buffer preventing the flooding from being as severe as it could have been.
Commissioned in the mid-1930s, the Galloway Hydro Scheme was the first large-scale integrated hydro-electric complex to be built in Britain and consists of Glenlee Power Station, near St John’s Town of Dalr which is the nerve centre of the scheme, able to operate the other power stations at Kendoon, Carfad, Earlstoun and Tongland, remotely.

Drax sets world-first ambition to become carbon negative by 2030
10 December 2019
Press releases

Drax will be the first company in the world to announce an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 when CEO Will Gardiner speaks at COP 25 in Madrid on Tuesday December 10, 2019
Using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) Drax will remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces, creating a negative carbon footprint for the company.
Drax’s ambition is only achievable with an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework. The UK Government is developing those as part of its global leadership in addressing the climate crisis.
Leading British energy company, Drax Group Plc, will be the first company in the world to announce an ambition to become carbon negative when
CEO Will Gardiner speaks at a Powering Past Coal Alliance event at COP 25 in Madrid, today
(Tuesday December 10, 2019).
He will say that Drax has an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030, but doing so will depend on an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework for new technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).

Being carbon negative means that Drax will be removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces throughout its operations – creating a negative carbon footprint for the company within a decade.
Drax is already running a successful BECCS pilot at its power station capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide every day. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UK Committee on Climate Change agree that BECCS is critical to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Sustainable biomass is an important part of the UK’s long-term energy mix. Combining this renewable fuel with carbon capture and storage technology on Drax’s biomass generating units at its power station in North Yorkshire, England, means the Group’s operations could capture 16 million tonnes of CO
2
a year or more – a significant proportion of the UK’s target.
Drax CEO Will Gardiner said:
“Drax’s ambition is to be carbon negative by 2030.  Having pioneered the use of sustainable biomass, Drax now produces 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity. With the right negative emissions policy, we can do much more, removing millions of tonnes of emissions from the atmosphere each year.
Drax CEO Will Gardiner in the control room at Drax Power Station; click image to view/download
“The UK Government is working on a policy and investment framework to encourage negative emissions technologies, which will enable the UK to be home to the world’s first carbon negative company. This is not just critical to beating the climate crisis, but also to enabling a just transition, protecting jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth – delivering for the economy as well as for the environment.”
In recent years Drax has undergone a world-leading transformation, becoming Europe’s largest decarbonisation project by converting two-thirds of its coal-fired power station to use sustainable biomass. In the first half of 2019, 94% of the power produced by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire, England, was renewable – delivering carbon savings of more than 80% compared to when it only used coal.
The engineering skill and expertise at Drax which enabled this unique transformation is now pioneering ground-breaking negative emissions technologies. Earlier this year Drax became the only power generator in the world to have captured carbon dioxide from a 100% biomass feedstock using BECCS technology, through its successful pilot project.
After closing its remaining two coal generating units at Drax Power Station by 2025 and using carbon capture technology on its biomass power generating units, its operations would become carbon negative by 2030.
Will Gardiner will announce Drax’s ambition when he speaks at COP25 in Madrid. Drax is a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an initiative launched by the UK and Canadian governments, which seeks to end the use of unabated coal in power stations around the world by 2030. The Powering Past Coal Alliance wants to accelerate the transition away from unabated coal and Drax is supporting its work to encourage members to scale up their ambitions, and to create more collaboration, helping prospective new members to move forwards in using cleaner energy.

Notes to Editors
Drax CEO Will Gardiner will speak at the Powering Past Coal Alliance event at COP 25 in Madrid, on Tuesday December 10, 2019 at 5.50pm local time (4.50pm GMT).
His speech will be published on the Drax website afterwards
.
Achieving Drax’s ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 is dependent upon it:
Closing its two remaining coal generating units at Drax Power Station, which it plans to do by 2025 – consistent with the UK government’s objectives
Having at least two biomass generating units operating with BECCS technology running at 90% availability, capturing and storing eight million tonnes of CO
2
a year
This would more than compensate for Drax’s projected CO
2
emissions from its other operations in 2030.
Drax has included all harmful greenhouse gases as defined by the Kyoto Protocol in its calculations.
The
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard
classifies a company’s greenhouse gas emissions into three ‘scopes’. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream.
Scope 3 emissions are not included in Drax’s calculations for achieving its carbon negative status in 2030. This is in line with accepted practice globally, based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. However, had its sustainable biomass supply chain emissions been included,  Drax would still be a carbon negative company in 2030.
Drax has signed up to the
UN Global Compact Science Based targets
which  provides companies with a clearly defined pathway to future-proof growth by specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The target is aligned to the pathway which limits global temperature rise to 1.5°C below pre-industrial levels.
The UK government is currently developing an effective negative emissions policy and  investment framework. Drax believes this should include:
A regulated asset base “RAB” based model to support transport and storage;
Contract for Difference to support BECCS and other negative emissions technologies.
Support for multiple carbon capture clusters in the UK, including Zero Carbon Humber
In September 2019 the UK Government published a
report
it commissioned from Vivid Economics, an economic consultancy, considering how the UK could deliver up to 130 million tonnes of negative emissions required to achieve net zero by 2050. The report recommended a suite of short and long-term government actions including:
Strengthening existing payment schemes for afforestation and habitation restoration
Introducing an obligation on fossil fuel suppliers to fund negative emissions technologies
Amending the existing Contracts for Difference support scheme in the electricity sector for BECCS and Direct Air Capture projects.
Drax
announced it had captured the first carbon dioxide
from its pioneering BECCS pilot project earlier this year.
The UK Committee on Climate Change’s ‘
Net Zero
’ report states that BECCS could generate up to 173 TWh of electricity by 2050, capturing up to 51 million tonnes of CO
2
– around half of the remaining carbon in the economy that the UK will need to capture to become ‘net zero’.
Drax
launched the Zero Carbon Humber
campaign in September with partners Equinor and National Grid Ventures, aimed at creating the world’s first zero carbon industrial cluster in the region.
Drax could use BECCS across all four of its biomass generating units, capturing 16 million tonnes of CO
2
a year. As the world’s first negative emissions power station it could be the anchor for a net zero industrial cluster in the Humber region – protecting thousands of jobs, delivering clean growth and new export opportunities for the region.
All major UK political parties have now committed to develop at least one industrial carbon capture storage cluster.

Ten times more energy storage needed for Britain to reach net zero climate target
4 December 2019
Press releases

Energy storage will play a major role in the energy transition supporting renewables like wind and solar power
Great Britain could need at least 30GW of energy storage to meet climate goals – ten times the available storage today
Energy storage, such as pumped storage hydro and batteries, enables further decarbonisation by providing system services to support more renewables
Across Great Britain, Europe and the US, the need for energy storage is set to soar as more renewables such as wind and solar power, connect to the grid in efforts to meet the net zero carbon targets required to address the climate emergency, according to
analysis by Imperial College for Drax Electric Insights.
Britain’s energy storage capacity alone will need to grow to around 30GW or more over the next 20 to 30 years, from 3GW today.
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London and lead author of the quarterly Electric Insights reports said:
“Energy storage is one of the most important issues in the energy industry – it has the potential to dictate the pace, scale and cost of the energy transition. Along with other technologies, such as interconnection and flexible generation, energy storage helps integrate more renewables onto the system, which makes it easier to manage the grid and enables greater decarbonisation at lowest cost.”
Imperial’s analysis
shows that, for the current GB electricity mix with a quarter of power coming from variable renewables, every unit of intermittent renewables added to the system requires an additional 0.2 units of energy storage capacity to smooth out intermittency and keep the grid stable.
As the share of wind and solar power rises towards 80% of electricity supplied, every extra unit of intermittent renewables will require 1 unit of energy storage.
Dr Oliver Schmidt, co-author of the report and senior consultant at cleantech advisory Apricum, said:
“This summer’s blackout in Britain highlights the value of having a range of fast-acting technologies and that demand will only grow as older thermal power plants retire and are replaced by intermittent renewables.
“We’ll also need a rapid expansion of other forms of flexibility, such as demand-side response, interconnectors and fast-acting flexible power stations as well as from pumped storage hydro, which is currently the biggest storage technology, and batteries where costs are falling.”
Andy Koss, CEO Generation, Drax, said:
“Pumped storage hydro plays a vital role in the UK’s energy system today – able to reach full load in as little as 30 seconds, it is proven to be able to react quickly to resolve intermittency issues associated with some renewable technologies.
“It’s clear from this
Electric Insights report
that more energy storage systems are vital to ensure the country has the power it needs in the decades ahead as wind and solar become the biggest sources of electricity. As the leading flexible power generator on Great Britain’s national grid, Drax has opportunities in storage and other technologies to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.”
The Imperial College study
found that variable renewables are providing an increasing share of energy supply, with wind farms alone providing more than half of Britain’s electricity for the first time ever in Q3 2019. This is creating unprecedented challenges in balancing the power system.
Keeping the UK’s power system stable made up a tenth of the total cost of generating electricity and the cost of balancing the power system hit a record high of £3.80/MWh in Q3.

Notes to Editors
Imperial College’s analysis
looked at 28 scenarios from 24 studies evaluating potential energy storage requirements in Europe and the US. The 24 independent studies forecast how much energy storage would be required depending on the share of demand met by variable renewables such as wind and solar. (figure 1)
The studies looked at Europe, Germany, GB and the US. Installed storage capacities are divided by the peak demand for electricity in each region to account for the relative size of countries.
[1]
70 to 80 per cent of electricity production from variable renewables would require storage capacity of around a third of peak electricity demand. In the current GB system (60GW peak) this would mean around 20GW of storage. The UK Committee on Climate Change expects that electricity demand will double by 2050, with peak demand rising to 150GW – implying there will be an even greater need for storage.
Demand-side response, interconnection or flexible power stations could be deployed to a similar extent, which would reduce the need for additional storage. Although current academic and industrial studies suggest that storage will become the main flexibility technology.
Cruachan Power Station, Drax’s pumped storage plant in Scotland, acts responsively by generating electricity to meet peak-time demand. It can achieve full load in 30 seconds and can maintain its maximum power production for more than 16 hours if necessary.
The 440 MW energy storage station has four primary modes of operation – ‘pump’, ‘spin pump’, ‘spin generate’ and ‘generate’ – and can deliver a range of balancing and ancillary services such as frequency management and inertia. Further information on Cruachan’s operations, is available
online
.
A 2016 feasibility study indicated it would be possible to develop 400 MW of additional capacity at Cruachan. Cruachan 2 is on the European Union’s list of projects of common interest. Find out more about
Drax’s development options

Airedale Junior School visits Europe’s biggest carbon saving project
25 November 2019
Press releases

Over three days, 112 students aged between 10 and 11 visited Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, which has upgraded two thirds of its generating capacity to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal.
This has transformed the plant to become the UK’s largest renewable power generator – producing enough electricity for four million homes – and Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project.
It has also paved the way for Drax to pioneer ground-breaking bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology. If BECCS can be used across all four of its biomass generating units, Drax could become the world’s first negative emissions power station, helping it to make an even greater contribution towards tackling the climate emergency.
Pupils were taken on a full tour of the site including the innovative BECCS pilot plant which is capturing a tonne of CO2 each day, the 427-metre turbine hall that houses the six huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity.
They also enjoyed a close-up view of the UK’s first wood pellet storage domes, each large enough to fit The Royal Albert Hall inside, and the 12 cooling towers, which at 115 metres high are taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Drax Group’s Head of Business Sustainability, Vicky Bullivant, said:
“By providing tours at Drax Power Station we want to further students’ understanding of how electricity is produced and hopefully fire their imaginations and inspire them to study STEM subjects by showing them some of the pioneering technologies we’re trying, like BECCS, which could play a vital role in addressing the climate crisis.”
During the tour, pupils learned how renewable electricity is generated and discovered how sustainable, compressed wood pellets have enabled Drax to reduce its carbon emissions by more than 80% compared to when those generating units used coal.
Students from Airedale Junior School standing outside the Biomass Domes at Drax Power Station
Louise Clarkson, from Airedale Junior School, who organised the visit, said:
“The students had a great day at Drax, learning about how the electricity system works and where our electricity is generated. Visits like this are so valuable because seeing the power station and the scale of the operations is impossible to replicate in a classroom – it really brings the subject to life.”
Drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the engineers of the future by encouraging greater interest in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. Earlier this year it invested £35,000
in the GreenPower initiative
, which helped pupils at seven local schools and colleges assemble electric vehicles from kits for a race in Hull in April.
The Airedale Junior School students are among over 12,000 visitors to Drax every year. Tours are free to all primary and secondary schools and can be tailored to suit the area of the curriculum teachers are interested in.

Drax Women of the Future Event Inspires New Career Paths for the Next Generation
21 November 2019
Press releases

Around 100 students aged 14 to 18 from Selby College, Holy Family Catholic High School in Carlton and Selby High School, spent the afternoon at the power plant in Yorkshire where female employees from Drax ran group activities, games and mini workshops at stands to illustrate the skills they use in their daily jobs.
At the event, the girls crowded around stands that highlighted careers in 10 different areas at Drax: Business Ethics, Viable Fuels & Sustainability, Facilities, Procurement, Engineering and Maintenance, Finance, Fuel & Logistics, Research & Innovation, Communications and IT. Community Engagement & Outreach and Human Resources, who organised the event, were also on hand to answer career questions.
Jess Williams, who is studying Mechanical Engineering at Selby College, said:
“Talking to the female engineers made me realise how much there is on offer at Drax and it’s inspired me to apply for an apprenticeship here when I finish college and university. It was great to see how involved the women are in keeping the power station running.”
Ella Parsonag, who is a student at Selby High School, said:
“I think it’s important as a woman to pursue careers in engineering. Such career paths aren’t popular at the moment and I would like to inspire more young women to become part of the engineering industry – there are good opportunities and the world will always need engineers.”
Rosie and Molly, students at Holy Family Catholic High School in Carlton, said it was important for women to get involved and push for the same opportunities as men.
“Just because we’re female doesn’t mean we’re any less entitled to get the job we want in the future,”
said Rosie.
Students from Holy Carlton School talking to Natalie Wright, Technical Engineering Trainee, at the Engineering and Maintenance stand.
Alongside the Engineering department’s stand which had a model of how the power station works, the Finance team’s Drax monopoly board illustrated the value of making the right decisions. Research & Innovation’s Top Trumps game focused on evaluating new ideas and projects while Fuel and Logistics showed the steps needed to bring fuel for the power station from Canada and the US.
In the Drax boardroom looking out onto the power station’s cooling towers, the Business & Ethics team challenged the girls to identify the correct response to a hypothetical situation that could be potentially harmful to the company, such as corruption and bribery.
Back in the main room, the communications team helped the girls make their own videos to promote the company externally on social media.
Vicky Bullivant, Drax Group Head of Sustainable Business said:
“We want to inspire the young women of tomorrow and show them the fantastic career opportunities at Drax for people from all backgrounds. Everyone benefits in a diverse and inclusive workplace – it brings new perspectives, ideas and approaches and helps strengthen the company and communities.
“Events like these and the many others we do throughout the year give us the opportunity to make a positive contribution to the communities we operate in.”
Drax has a long tradition of supporting educational initiatives and encouraging interest in science, technology, engineering and maths subjects (STEM) to help inspire the next generation of professionals.
Earlier this year, Drax invested £35,000 in the
GreenPower initiative
which helped pupils at seven local schools assemble electric vehicles from kits for a race in Hull in April. Drax employees also provided 160 hours of volunteer time to support the students involved in the project.

Britain ranks second to last for power system flexibility in review of nine leading European countries
13 November 2019
Press releases

Britain ranks eighth out of nine northern European countries in attracting and facilitating investment in electricity system flexibility, a new industry report finds
Delivering flexibility is crucial to power sector decarbonisation and achieving Net Zero targets
Regulatory uncertainty, lack of visibility on returns, and technical challenges connecting to the network are delaying investment in flexibility and could hamper renewables deployment in the 2020s
Regulatory uncertainty, lack of visibility on returns, and technical challenges are impeding investment in flexibility services to support Britain’s electricity network as more renewables come online, risking delays in the transition to a greener future, an industry report said.
The
Energy Transition Readiness Index
,
a report published by the Association for Renewable Energy & Clean Technology (REA) and commissioned by Eaton and Drax, reviewed regulation and market access, social and political support for the energy transition, and deployment of enabling technologies such as smart meters in nine northern European countries.
Britain, which ranked eighth out of the nine countries in the index, scored poorly on market factors such as a clear and stable regulatory and market framework. The report also highlighted potential difficulties accessing the distribution network and a lack of progress on delivering smart electric vehicle charging.
Overall results of the Energy Transition Readiness Index illustrated by a country ranking
Flexibility is becoming increasingly important as more variable renewables such as wind and solar replace Britain’s large fossil-fuelled power stations to meet targets to cut carbon emissions. Large generators typically provided flexibility by supplying power during peak demand and ensuring that the system’s voltage and frequency remained within operational limits.
The Netherlands topped the league table of nine countries. Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland and Norway also scored high, while Germany, Britain and France lagged.
Dr Nina Skorupska, Chief Executive of the REA said:
“Decarbonising power means delivering flexibility. In a world of very low-cost variable renewable electricity generation, grids need to be organised differently and some services which were once taken for granted need to be actively procured.
“Crucially, as renewable power prices fall around the world every country will be experiencing the same shift. If Britain becomes a flexibility pioneer, then a whole world of markets for exporting our products and services opens up. Whilst this index shows we’re lagging behind, there’s still time to bounce back.
“That’s why the REA is calling for the next government to address the barriers to flexibility by delivering wholesale systems change and reform Ofgem as a priority.”
Drax Head of Strategy Robert Riley said:
“Flexibility is essential to enable net-zero carbon in Britain for 2050. It reduces the risks of power cuts and builds resilience into the grid so that the system can handle the volume of intermittent renewables that we’ll need. Without these flexibility services, it’s going to be much harder, and more costly, to transition to a cleaner electricity system.
“There’s a huge potential for innovative flexible technologies to play a role. More could be done to provide a level playing field, and clarity on business models so that they can contribute to the zero-carbon ambition.”
Drax already provides a number of flexibility services in the UK, including frequency management, inertia and reserve power from its biomass-powered plant in Yorkshire, hydro in Scotland and is looking to provide further flexibility services including from rapid response gas plants.
Eaton Head of Energy Storage Business Fabrice Roudet said:
“We welcome Britain’s ambition and its strong policy commitment to decarbonisation, encouraging new flexibility technologies and business models. However, we urgently need more clarity and an end to the flux to provide the certainty needed to spur private investment in the new technologies that will be required to ease the transition to a high-renewable energy future.”
Robert Hull, author of the report said:
“In Britain, the strong ambition for the energy transition and growing flexibility markets hasn’t yet translated into the market and regulatory framework, which is complex and slow to change.”

Editor’s Notes
Drax is working with Eaton to
supply energy storage to small businesses
.
Pairing energy storage with on-site micro renewables such as wind and solar helps maximise the value of the renewable energy and gives customers more flexibility.
Robert Hull, who authored
the report
, is an industry leader with over 30 years’ experience, including at Ofgem, National Grid and consultancy KPMG.
The report was based on contributions from utilities, industry associations, grid operators, energy technology companies and academics in northern Europe as well as publicly available data on the sector.
The northern European countries were selected for their similar ambitions on the energy transition.
The Index ranked the countries as follows:
The Netherlands
Finland
Sweden
Denmark
Ireland
Norway
Germany
Great Britain
France
Case study on battery energy storage
Drax has partnered with Eaton to supply and connect battery storage systems to small businesses that are already customers of Drax, such as farms and offices, so they can store power generated from on-site micro renewables like wind turbines and solar.
This allows Drax’s customers to maximise the value of the renewable energy they generate, either using it when it is required or selling it back to the grid during peak demand.
Drax and Eaton have connected three Eaton xStorage Buildings storage systems and are installing another five by the end of this year and four early next year with a total capacity of around 600 kWh. These are a mix of 40 kWh and 80 kWh capacity from new and second-life batteries.

REA General Election 2019
manifesto
top level asks:
Ensure that the funding, integrated planning and delivery of the wholesale systems change that’s needed to decarbonise the economy sits with No 10 and the Cabinet Office. An independent body with strong enforcement capabilities should be appointed to ensure the Government produces policy that supports decarbonisation in line with the Carbon Budgets and advice of the Committee on Climate Change.
Ensure that renewable energy and clean technology are central to a Net Zero Treasury test, as set by Committee on Climate Change and enforced by an independent body, for Government funding; and that the Treasury implements a more effective taxation system that incentivises these technologies instead of fossil fuels.
Reform Ofgem, in part by including decarbonisation as a central mandate, alongside consumer protection, and ensure energy network operators are sufficiently incentivised to modernise the energy systems so that they can deliver a major expansion of renewable energy generation capacity and meet the 5th Carbon Budget.
Help local authorities to reach Net Zero by providing ring-fenced funding for measuring and reporting on progress on the number of zero-carbon buildings, energy efficiency, effective waste management, decarbonising transport fleets while valuing soil quality and natural capital.
Deliver a just transition by developing a workforce strategy that supports the renewable energy and clean technology sector to provide high-quality skilled jobs for existing fossil fuel sector workers transitioning to the new economy, and future workers, across the UK.
