smart ways to charge evs electric vehicle charging has clean money saving options but they are little understood 15 october 2019 electrification the future of electric cars and electric vans holds great potential  not just for the transport industrys overall carbon footprint but for the populations of heavily congested polluted cities and even individual drivers looking for more efficient fuel costs that future is approaching fast by 2040 or even as soon as 2035 no new cars or vans sold in the uk can be solely powered by diesel or petrol while this is a positive step it brings with it a shift in the way drivers will need to manage the way they plan journeys and more importantly refuel for years drivers have relied on a quick and plentiful supply of fuel at petrol stations but an ev doesnt charge as quickly as a conventional car nor are fast charging points widespread  at least not right now the change will be considerable but it wont necessarily take shape in a single form here we look at four things that will become increasingly influential in how drivers recharge their evs over the coming years smart charging and timeofuse tariffs electricity costs more to produce and supply at certain times of the day this wholesale price depends on the demand for power weather conditions and the costs of different generation technologies and fuels for example electricity is often more expensive in the evenings when people are coming home from work and turning on lights tvs ovens and plugging in devices just a few hours later it rapidly drops in price as homes and offices turn off lights and appliances but the power system is changing  the price of electricity is increasingly driven by less predictable factors such as the weather on windy and sunny days wind and solar generation can drive down the cost of producing power on calm and cloudy days the costs of electricity can increase while this in theory makes it sensible to wait for a cheap period of time to plug in and charge an electric vehicle ev in practice people are unlikely to spend the time sit refreshing websites which display the price of electricity in real time to get the best value instead the use of smart charging technology can play a big role to capitalise on fluctuations in prices smart charging technology will be able to monitor things like electricity prices and even electricity usage across an entire site for example across a business where many devices are using electricity and automate the charging process to make use of the best prices and limit overall electricity use rather than needing someone to recharge evs at one oclock in the morning this means people or businesses can plug in at times convenient to them and set their vehicles to charge at the cheapest times and have an appropriate amount of charge to carry out tasks when they need to by shifting power usage into cheaper periods youre saving money and you can be more sympathetic to supply and demand limits on a company explains adam hall who leads draxs ev proposition if i know my battery will be fully charged by nine in the morning do i care if it charges immediately or delays it and saves me a few pounds for business fleet owners who manage large numbers of electric vehicles the difference this can make is even larger he adds vehicletogrid v2g technology each ev has a battery in it that powers the vehicles motor but what if the electricity stored in that battery could also be harnessed to deliver electricity back to grid and what if that concept could be used to collect a small portion of power from every idle ev in the country and use it to plug gaps in the electricity system there are over 30 million cars on uk roads national grid predicts by 2050 99 of those vehicles will be powered by electricity  explains hall the majority of cars remain idle for 95 of any day thats a huge amount of storage potential that could be used to balance the grid at key times  its a battery network that assets around the country will be able to use this concept is whats called vehicle to grid technology v2g and while it holds great potential its still some way from becoming a mainstream source of reserve power right now the technology is costly and limited  only chademo charging systems as found on japanese models actually support bidirectional charging nevertheless hall remains optimistic of its future role in the energy system particularly as this technology will be hugely important in managing future grid constraints the cost of bidirectional hardware is coming down all the time he says at the moment there arent enough vehicles we dont have the scale to do it but i fully believe it will change quite dramatically for domestic users the benefit will be less immediate than it will be for entire countries for business fleet managers allowing the grid to take some power from their idle vehicles could lead to financial compensation or other advantages for offering grid support the out of sight out of mind approach third party management schemes more suited for businesses managing whole fleets of vehicles employing a third party to manage the charging of vehicles allows for the delegation of a potentially costly and timeconsuming task adam hall drax ev proposition lead with draxs electric vehicle fleet service effectively the customer knows theyll get the vehicles with the amount of charge they want when they need it says hall that might be for the cheapest price or as fast as possible it means the customer doesnt have to think they just get their charged vehicle in the optimum way for their needs third party providers could also open up new charging businesses models such as flat monthly rates for unlimited vehicle charging or allrenewable services by taking the technical aspects of running a fleet out of businesses hands third parties could even serve to lower the barrier to ev adoption mandatory managed charging its difficult to accurately know how much demand electric vehicles will place on the electricity system  some estimates see demand growing in great britain as much as 22 by 2050 as a result of evs while the constant development of battery and charging technology will likely mean this prediction will come down there are some theories as to how the country will need to deal with this rapid growth one of these is to actually turn down the electricity surging through charging points at certain points to prevent widespread blackouts the idea is there to protect the grid explains hall when local distribution networks have a lot of demand they may need to turn charge points down he adds there will likely be exemptions for emergency services however hall is sceptical mandatory managed charging would ever really come into play for the damage it would do to consumer attitudes to evs the idea also taps into wider scaremongering around evs and quite how much they will push up electricity demand instead what will really need to shift for a future of efficiently charged vehicles is a mindset shift theres a psychological element to it he suggests everyone goes through some range anxiety at first but soon realises the technology is sound as battery technology continues to improve vehicles evolve to go further on a single charge and networks of superfast charge points expand transitioning to electric vehicles will become easier and more economical for businesses than continuing to depend on fossil fuel i personally believe once electric vehicles are doing 300 miles on a single charge the requirement for onroute charging will be pretty low says hall not many people drive 300 miles need to recharge at a service station and then drive anther 300 in one fell swoop its much more important to have good charging installations at work and at home there are many ways in which evs will change the way the world drives from how we charge them to how and where we travel we can be certain this will mean a shift in mindsets and our approach to transport  what remains uncertain is just how quickly and widespread that shift will be share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero
