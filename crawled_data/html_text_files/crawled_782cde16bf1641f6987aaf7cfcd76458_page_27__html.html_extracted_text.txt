Press Release
Drax Group to supply free energy to 33 care homes across Northampton during COVID-19 crisis
5 May 2020
Press releases

Energy company Drax Group is supplying 33 small care homes across Northampton with free electricity and gas for two months during the Covid-19 crisis
The initiative is part of a package of support worth £636,000 that Drax Group is providing to its UK customers and communities to help them during the pandemic
They are amongst 170 care homes selected to receive the free energy, which are small businesses based in communities local to Drax’s operations across England, Scotland and Wales and are already supplied by Opus Energy and Haven Power – both part of Drax Group.
Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner said:
“We’re working hard to offer more support to our customers and communities during this crisis.
“Care homes are critically important – they do incredible work looking after some of the most vulnerable people in our communities and we know this pandemic is putting them under immense pressure. As a gesture of appreciation for the excellent work these businesses are doing, we’re cancelling their energy bills for a couple of months.”
Haven Power customer, Shaw Healthcare, operates a number of care homes across Northampton and has been selected to receive the free energy.
Mike Smith, Shaw Healthcare Chief Operating Officer, said:
“Our teams are working very hard in some really challenging circumstances at the moment. Not having to pay our energy bills for two months means we can redistribute our funds to buy essential items like PPE to ensure our employees are supported to give our residents the level of care they deserve. Well done to the Dax Group for recognising that the social care sector is very much on the frontline of this crisis.”
As well as the support for the 33 care homes across Northampton, Drax is also donating £150,000 to the Money Advice Trust’s Business Debtline, a national charity helping SMEs facing financial hardship. This is in addition to reduced and deferred payment plans for business customers adversely impacted by the lockdown, and energy rates being frozen for three months for those coming to the end of their contracts and rolling onto a monthly plan.
Will Gardiner added:
“We know a lot of businesses are having a tough time, as the lockdown is having a major impact on many different sectors, so we’ve donated £150,000 to the Money Advice Trust’s Business Debtline. This will help to ensure those businesses who may be struggling to pay their bills can access the advice and support they need.”
Drax’s donation to the Money Advice Trust’s Business Debtline will provide support and free advice to small businesses and self-employed people who are facing financial hardship as a result of Covid-19.
Care homes selected to receive free energy from Drax’s supply businesses, Haven Power and Opus Energy, will receive a letter notifying them that their bills have been cancelled.
Drax owns and operates eight power stations across England and Scotland, as well as two energy supply businesses, Opus Energy and Haven Power, which have offices in the South East and Wales.

Drax launches new biomass carbon calculator that will enable industry to cut emissions from supply chain
1 May 2020
Press releases

Drax is seeking views from a wide range of experts, including academics, non-governmental organisations and the biomass for energy industry in a consultation on the Biomass Carbon Calculator to ensure that the methodology is as accurate and transparent as possible so it is more effective.
Drax Group’s head of climate change, Rebecca Heaton said:
“Drax announced a world-leading ambition to become
carbon negative by 2030
by pioneering the groundbreaking negative emissions technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (
BECCS
).
“As part of this commitment to support the UK’s
net zero
target, Drax is also ensuring that the supply chain for the sustainable biomass pellets we use to generate renewable electricity is as low carbon as possible.

“To do that, it’s vital that Drax and the rest of the biomass industry has the clearest picture possible of emissions in the production and transportation of the pellets, by using actual supply chain data to help raise the quality of carbon accounting for biomass.
“That’s why we’re calling on academics, scientists, regulators and non-governmental organisations, as well as those in the biomass industry, to participate in the consultation to help further improve the modelling for this new calculator and create a higher industry standard for emissions reporting.”
Drax’s Biomass Carbon Calculator has already been independently reviewed against the greenhouse gas calculation methodology laid out in the Renewable Obligation, one of the main support mechanisms for large-scale renewable electricity projects in the UK, which has helped the country to decarbonise faster than any other in the world. This independent review also verified the calculator for compliance with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive II.

Following the six-week consultation, Drax will undertake further third-party verification to ensure the new calculator remains in compliance with regulatory requirements.
The creation of the Biomass Carbon Calculator is one of a number of initiatives Drax is taking to develop world-leading policies and tools to create greater clarity and transparency across the biomass industry.
It follows
the creation of an Independent Advisory Board
of scientists, academics and forestry experts, led by Sir John Beddington formerly the chief scientific adviser to the UK government, to ensure Drax’s biomass sourcing is in line with latest scientific research and best practice.
It has found
Drax’s sourcing policies are in line with the Forest Research report, which is widely considered to be the industry gold standard.

Editor’s Notes
The
consultation
runs from May 1 to June 12
The calculator allows users to view all equations performed for calculating supply chain GHG emissions.
The calculator is designed to comply with the Greenhouse Gas reporting requirements of the UK Renewables Obligation and the EU Renewable Energy Directive.
These regulations require that biomass is considered as carbon neutral for Greenhouse Gas reporting purposes and that the CO
2
emitted at the stack is balanced by the CO
2
captured at forest level.
Drax is the largest renewable power generator in the UK – generating 12% of the country’s renewable electricity using biomass.
Drax’s biomass delivers carbon savings of more than 80% compared to coal – this includes emissions from our supply chain.
The use of biomass has transformed Drax to become the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
It’s a low-carbon supply chain – Drax monitors and reports all emissions, which are independently audited. The biomass for energy industry is the only sector that does this.
The carbon emissions from shipping across the Atlantic are lower than road haulage from Scotland and are accounted for in the
more than 85% carbon savings
reported across Drax Group since 2012.

Energy company Drax is delivering laptops with prepaid internet access to schools and colleges local to its operations across Britain, to ensure students can continue with their studies during the Covid-19 crisis.
Five schools and Dumfries & Galloway college and will receive 72 of the Drax HP Chromebook laptops with pre-paid dongles.
With schools and colleges closed, many children whose families do not own a computer are finding it difficult to access learning resources.
To ensure no child is left behind, Drax has invested £250,000 in a total of 853 new laptops and each one has three months of pre-paid internet access via a 30GB dongle to support their learning over the summer term. The laptops are being delivered to Drax’s partner schools, local to its operations
across Britain
as part of the energy company’s efforts to support its communities during the lockdown.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“We’re very happy to help people in our communities by providing our partner schools with the technology they need to get more students connected online so they can keep learning during the Covid-19 crisis and beyond.”
Laptops have been provided to six schools and a college in Dumfries and Galloway, including:
Dumfries & Galloway College
Gelston Primary School
Castle Douglas Primary School
Kirkcudbright Primary School
Dalry & Kells Primary School
Crossmichael Primary School
Heathall Primary School
Kenny Jardine from Dumfries and Galloway Council’s education department collects the laptops.
Billy Currie, head of corporate services at Dumfries & Galloway College, said:
“This donation of laptops from Drax is going to make a huge difference to the lives of students currently without access to online educational resources – as well as our whole college community after the Coronavirus lockdown is over.
“Ensuring no-one gets left behind in their studies during the lockdown is a priority for us, but schools and colleges don’t just provide education – they’re a whole support system. Having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and fellow students more easily too – which is also incredibly important at the moment.”
McNabb Laurie, Team Leader of the Galloway Glens Scheme, which has been assisting in the local distribution of the equipment, said:
“The donation of laptops and internet access is hugely welcome and is just one example of how Drax continues to play an important role in supporting our communities and helping our young people reach their full potential.
“Education is essential, and these laptops will help children across Dumfries and Galloway to keep up with their studies and stay connected to their friends while we all stay apart”.

Keeping the lights on: Network Rail reopens a vital British freight line after major repair operation
20 April 2020
Press releases

Link to Drax Power Station kept open with 24-hour-a-day monitoring after huge flooding damage
Divers, drones and helicopters deployed to monitor the route since February
Over 90 trains per week still able to use route whilst repairs carried out
The line into Drax Power Station was inundated with flood water in February when the nearby River Aire burst its banks.
With the Selby plant supplying 5% of the UK’s electricity, it was vital to keep services moving during the Covid-19 crisis while repair work was carried out. Engineers have been deployed on 24-hour-a-day shifts to maintain the constant safety reassurance required to keep freight trains running.
Chris Gee, Head of Operations for Network Rail’s North and East Route, said:
“This was an unprecedented operation to deal with an unprecedented situation.
“It’s never been more important for us to keep freight services running, so we pulled out all the stops to maintain this vital link while we conducted repair work at the same time.
“Our teams have worked non-stop to make sure that crucial deliveries of sustainable biomass have been able to run despite severe flooding, which has been incredibly important to keep the nation powered up.
“This has been a real team effort and shows the dedication of the rail industry to vital services moving during this national crisis.”
One of two lines leading in and out of Drax Power Station in Selby, Yorkshire, had to close in February when water from the nearby River Aire flooded the area. But engineers were able to keep one route open to allow vital freight services transporting sustainable biomass to keep the nation powered up during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Image showing the February floods affecting the railway line leading to Drax Power Station
The damaged line has now reopened following significant repair work by Network Rail. Deliveries were maintained while the work took place, with over 90 freight trains a week transporting biomass to the plant.
This was made possible by the rail industry working together and the dedication of Network Rail, and their contractors CML, who took up shifts 24 hours a day to keep watch of the site and make sure that trains could use the line safely. A crucial job was monitoring the railway embankment for any further movement following the damage caused by floods.
The emergency repair work cost £300,000 and included unconventional methods to make sure that the line could reopen as quickly as possible. This included using a team of divers to inspect structures which were underwater to check for damage, as well as flying drones and helicopters along the route to assess the extent of the damage.
Significant repair work to the track needed to take place before it could reopen, such as replacing ballast, the stones, which support the track, after sections of it were washed away by flood water.
The team faced an additional challenge when they discovered that several Koi Carp from a nearby private residence were on the railway, when the pond they were in also flooded. Network Rail teams worked closely with the landowner to safely transport them home.
Keeping freight services moving is of vital importance during the Covid-19 crisis, with the transportation of sustainable biomass helping to keep the lights on across the country. Network Rail is working on ways to improve resilience on the line, in a £2.5million investment, and are currently in the design stage of this project.
Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said:
“Freight plays a vital role in ensuring critical food and supplies can continue moving smoothly at this challenging time. It is fantastic news that this important line has reopened, and once again I want to thank frontline staff for their efforts.”
Nigel Adams MP said:
“The flooding in February showed how important it is to respond immediately to flooding events when roads are closed, homes flooded and in this case the railway line delivering biomass fuel to Drax Power station was seriously damaged.
“Fortunately, Drax Power station was able to continue to generate electricity because Network Rail responded immediately by introducing emergency operational procedures. I am delighted that Network Rail have now completed the repair of the embankment and the line is back to two tracks working.”
Drax CEO Will Gardiner said:
“The teams who worked tirelessly at Network Rail, on the UK rail freight system and at Drax to ensure deliveries of sustainable biomass were maintained throughout the repair work, so we can continue to generate the power the country needs during the Covid-19 crisis, have done a tremendous job.
“The health, safety and wellbeing of these teams are vital and we have implemented strategies to reduce the chances of spreading the virus.”
“These rail deliveries are a critical part of our global supply chain for sustainable biomass that supports thousands of jobs and has delivered economic growth across the north of England, while supplying renewable electricity to millions of homes and businesses.”
John Smith, GB Railfreight Managing Director said:
“Huge credit to Network Rail and their contractor, CML, who have carried out the repairs so quickly whilst also managing to keep the railway partially open in the meantime.
“The efforts applied demonstrate again the importance of rail freight during these trying times in keeping the lights on and food on the tables. GBRf is committed to continuing and re-doubling its efforts to ensure that freight continues to move around the country during these unprecedented times.”
DB Cargo UK’s Head of Sales Roger Neary said:
“DB Cargo has been working closely with both Drax and Network Rail. The communication and collaboration by all parties has been brilliant ensured a seamless supply of material to the power station.
“During the COVID 19 pandemic, we continue to work with Drax Power Station to provide essential biomass fuel by rail from Immingham. DB Cargo UK delivers on average 65 trains per week, around 4,500 tonnes, of biomass which Drax uses to supply the UK power network. It’s great to be able to play a part in keeping the UK running during these difficult times.”

Drax workers’ blue light support for NHS
16 April 2020
Press releases

Engineers at Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, have installed blue lighting on one of the 12, 114m tall cooling towers at the 1,850-acre site, in honour of the NHS.
Michael Davies a section head in the maintenance team at Drax Power Station, who led a team of engineers from Drax, EMI and Yess Electrical to install the blue lights, said:
Michael Davies, Section Head, maintenance team, Drax Power Station, who led a team of engineers from Drax and EMI to install the blue lights
“We all know how vitally important the NHS is right now and we’re in awe of what the teams there are doing. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week these people are putting themselves in harm’s way to protect us and look after those worst affected by this disease.
“Lighting up one of our cooling towers is our signal to those working in the NHS to let them know we appreciate what they’re doing. We know they must be working incredibly hard in very difficult circumstances and we fully support them.”
Drax Power Station has the capacity to generate enough electricity for up to six million households. Measures have been put in place to ensure its employees can work safely and continue operating this critical national infrastructure.
Employees from across Drax’s UK businesses, including power stations located across Britain, as well as energy supply businesses Opus Energy and Haven Power, have shown their appreciation for the NHS in their own ‘Clap for Carers’
video

Editor’s Notes
Cooling tower facts:
Each of the 12
cooling towers at Drax
are 114m tall and 93m in diameter at the base.
You could fit the Statue of Liberty inside each one.
The dimensions of the cooling towers are such that if they were scaled down to be the size of an egg, the thickness of the cooling tower walls would be the same as an eggshell – so whilst the walls could be viewed as being quite delicate, the hyperboloid shape of the cooling towers gives them strength to withstand harsh weather conditions. The ones at Drax date from almost 50 years ago when the first half of the power station was built and came into operation in 1974.
A common misconception is that the cooling towers release smoke – this is not true, it’s actually steam, or water vapour which can be seen rising from them.
Power stations use a lot of water. Drax’s 12 cooling towers draw 160 million litres of water each day from the River Ouse.
The power station works by using boilers to heat water and make high pressure steam, which is used to spin turbines and generate electricity. The steam is then cooled inside the cooling towers and the water is returned to the boiler to be heated again.
