Who we are
We’re a leading global renewable energy company and producer of wood pellets: a sustainable, low-carbon fuel source for renewable electricity generation. We transformed the UK’s biggest coal-fired power station to operate with sustainable biomass in the largest, single site decarbonization project in Europe. Mississippi has played a key part in our growth, providing biomass from forest harvesting residues and sawmill residues into renewable energy that keeps global economies moving.

Mississippi forestry
Drax is helping local forests and habitats thrive. Almost two thirds of Mississippi is made up of timberland and working forests. Sustainable forest management practices play a critical role in improving the health and resilience of forests by reducing risks from wildfires and pests. Since Drax began production in Amite County, total timberland in the area has increased by over 12,500 acres. We also partner with the Federation of Southern Cooperatives to drive equal access to forest management opportunities for minority and underserved small landowners.

We’ve helped provide the local law enforcement, fire department, schools and organization with equipment needed as well as event support. When natural disasters have hit, we’ve supporting the local community with water and other essentials.
The Drax Foundation provides grant funding for non-profit organizations and social enterprises that deliver lasting socio-economic impact in the heart of our communities. We’re taking further steps to create a more positive future for the hard-working people who call Mississippi home.

We take our environmental responsibilities seriously and we are committed to compiling with all local and federal regulations. We monitor our emissions and transparently report them to the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.
So what is biomass and how does it work?
In ecological terms, biomass refers to any type of organic matter. When it comes to energy, biomass is any organic matter that can be used to generate energy, for example wood, forest residues or plant materials. Biomass used and combusted for energy can come in a number of different forms – which are used in power stations that have upgraded from coal. The term biomass also refers to any type of organic material used for energy in domestic settings, for example wood burned in wood stoves and wood pellets used in domestic biomass boilers. Biomass is organic matter like wood, forest residues or plant material, that is used to generate energy.
Frequently Asked Questions
How is biomass made?
How does biomass generate power?
What is sustainable biomass?
How is Drax ensuring the health of Mississippi forests?
Biomass pellets are made at a pelletisation plant. Here wood that is unsuitable for other industries like sawmill residues, are brought together. The wood is chipped, screened for quality, heated to reduce its moisture content and then converted into a fine powder. This is then pressed through a grate at high pressure to form the solid, short, dense biomass pellet.
Biomass can be produced from different sources including agricultural or forestry residues, dedicated energy crops or waste products such as uneaten food. Drax Power Station uses compressed wood pellets sourced from sustainably managed working forests in the US, Canada, Europe and Brazil, and are largely made up of low-grade wood produced as a byproduct of the production and processing of higher value wood products, like lumber and furniture. Biomass producers and users must meet a range of stringent measures for their biomass to be certified as sustainable and responsibly sourced. Areas Drax sources its pellets from January 2021 to December 2021 include USA (64.9%), Canada (15.5%), Latvia (9.3%), Estonia (2.8%), Brazil (2.5%), Portugal (2.4%), Belarus (1.4%)*, UK (0.7%). Russia (0.4%)*, and other European countries (0.1%).
Biomass pellets can be used to generate power in a similar way to coal, allowing existing coal power stations to be transformed to use renewable bioenergy instead. A conveyor system takes pellets from storage through to pulverising mills, where they are crushed into a fine powder that is then blown into the power station’s boiler. Here the biomass is combusted as fuel, the heat from this combustion is used to make steam which powers the generators that produce electricity. Biomass pellets’ density and uniform shape also makes them easier to transport and store in large quantities.
Sustainable biomass is made of the low grade and low quality by-products from the forestry industry that don’t negatively impact the growth of the forest, the amount of carbon being stored, biodiversity and the socioeconomic wellbeing of the communities that surround them. When used for heat and power, sustainable biomass releases significantly less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels. Using forestry residues from harvesting also helps reduce the risk of forest fires, pests and disease outbreaks. This ensures that forests will not be negatively affected by the cultivation of biomass, instead the removal of waste and low-grade wood promotes healthy biodiversity and growth.
Drax ensures the health of Mississippi forest through sustainable forestry. Biomass pellets are created using low-grade wood waste, tree trimmings, and residue from local wood processing plants. Drax also implements the practices of reforestation and afforestion.
