power however is a far cry from humans early taming of fire and this is down to constant research and innovation in fact today its one of the most extensively researched areas in energy and environmental studies with biomass accounting for 64 of total renewable energy production in the eu in 2015 the development isnt likely to stop ongoing advancements in the field are helping the technology become more sustainable and efficient in reducing emissions here are seven of the projects businesses ideas and technologies pushing biomass further into the future torrefaction  supercharging biomass pellets when it comes to making biomass as efficient as possible its all down to each individual pellet improving whats known as the calorific value of each pellet increases the overall amount of energy released when they are used in a power station one emerging process aiming to improve this is torrefaction which involves heating biomass to between 250 and 300 degrees celsius in a lowoxygen environment this drives out moisture and volatiles from woody feedstocks straw and other biomass sources before it is turned into a black biocoal pellet which has a very high calorific value this year estonian company baltania is constructing the first industrialscale torrefaction plant in the country with the target output of 160000 tonnes of biocoal pellets per year if its successful power stations worldwide may be able to get more power from each little pellet biobean  powered by caffeine biofuels dont just come from forest residues every day more than two billion cups of coffee are consumed globally as people get themselves caffeinated for the day ahead in london alone this need for daily stimulation results in more than 200000 tonnes of coffee waste produced every year more often than not this ends up in landfills biobean aims to change this by collecting used coffee grounds from cafes offices and factories and recycling them into biofuels and biochemicals the company now recycles as much as 50000 tonnes of coffee grounds annually while one of its products b20 biodiesel has been used to power london buses biobean also produces briquettes and pellets which like woody biomass can serve as an alternative to coal biomass gasification  increasing the value of biomass waste biogas is often seen as a promising biofuel with fewer emissions than burning fossil fuels or biomass pellets its an area undergoing significant research as it points to another means of creating highervalue products from biomass matter the finnish town of vaasa is home to the worlds largest gasification plant  the facility is part of a coal plant where cofiring biogas with coal has allowed it to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions by as much as 230000 tonnes per year as well as reducing emissions cofiring allows the power plant to use 25 to 40 less coal and when demand is low in the autumn and spring months the plant runs entirely on biogas more than that the forestry residues which are used to produce the biogas are sourced locally from within 100 km of site as part of our transition away from coal cofiring biomass with that fossil fuel took place at drax power station from 2003 until full unit conversions became a reality in 2013 lynemouth power station  powering the move away from coal after 44years the coalfired lynemouth power station in northumberland is the latest uk power producer converting to biomassfuel set for completion this year the plant will supply 390 mw of lowcarbon electricity to the national grid enough to power 700000 homes  every new power station conversion poses different challenges as well as the opportunity to develop new solutions but none are as crucial as the conversion of the materials handling equipment from coal to biomass pellets while coal can sit in the rain for long periods of time and still be used biomass must be kept dry with storage conditions constantly monitored and adjusted to prevent sudden combustion at lynemouth the handling of 14 million tonnes of biomass annually has required the construction of three 40metre high concrete storage silos as well as extensive conveyor systems to unload and transport biomass around the plant biotrans  two birds with one stone energy and food are both undergoing serious changes to make them more sustainable danish startup biotrans is tackling both challenges by using one of the food industrys key pain points  wastage  to create energy with its biogas systems the company installs systems that collect leftover food from restaurants and canteens and stores it in odourproof tanks before collecting and turning it into biogas for heating and electricity production more than just utilising this waste stream the byproduct of the gasification process can also be sold as a fertiliser drax and ccapture  cutting emissions from the source carbon capture usage and storage ccus is one of the most important fields in the energy sector today the technologys ability to capture co 2 from the electricity generation process and turn it into a revenue source before it can enter the atmosphere means its attracting significant investment and research drax is partnering with ccapture  a company spun out of the university of leeds chemistry department to trial a new form of ccus the pilot scheme will launch in november and aims to capture a tonne of co 2 per day from one of draxs biomass units ccaptures technology could make the process of capturing and storing co 2 less costly and energy intensive it does this using a specially developed solvent capable of isolating co 2 before being recycled through the system and capturing more if the pilot proves successful the technology could be implemented at an industrial scale seeing up to 40 of the co 2 in the flue gases from draxs biomass units captured and stored if the technology tested at drax leads to the construction of a purposebuilt carbon capture unit elsewhere scientists and engineers at ccapture believe the co 2 captured could exceed 90 back in north yorkshire the eventual goal is negative carbon emissions from drax power station  its biomass units already deliver carbon savings of more than 80 compared to when they used coal and if a new revenue stream can be developed from the sale of the carbon captured then the power produced from biomass at the power station could become even more cost effective with thanks to biomass uk and the european biomass association  aebiom   tags biomass energy  technology  wood pellets cutting costs

sustainable bioenergy electricity systems around the world are decarbonising and increasingly switching to renewable power sources while intermittent sources such as solar and wind are the fastest growing types of renewables being installed globally the reliability and flexibility of biomass and its ability to offer grid stabilisation services such as frequency control and inertia make it an increasingly necessary source of renewable power according to the international energy agency biomass generation is forecast to expand as planned projects come online a versatile resource biomass comes in many different forms when looking to assess future demand and use it is important to recognise benefits that different types of biomass bring compressed wood pellets are just one small part of the biomass spectrum which includes many forms of agricultural and livestock residues waste and biproducts  much of which is currently discarded or underutilised maximising the use of these wastes and residues provides plenty of scope for expansion of the biomass energy sector around the world the global installed capacity for biomass generation is expected to reach close to 140 gigawatts gw by 2026  which will be fuelled primarily by expansion in asia using residues from food production and the forestry processing industry however the use of woody biomass can also provide many benefits too such as supplying a market for thinnings providing a use for harvesting residues encouraging better forest management practices and generating increased revenue for forest owners how much surplus exists in areas like the us south traditional markets for forest products have declined whilst forest growth has significantly increased according to the usda forest inventory and analysis fia data there is an average annual surplus of growth in the us south of more than 176 million cubic metres compared to removals  thats enough to make around 84 million tonnes of wood pellets a year from just one supply region of course not all of this surplus growth could or should be used for bioenergy much of it is suitable for high value markets like sawtimber or construction and some of it is located on inaccessible or protected sites however new and additional markets are essential to maintain the health of the forest resource and to encourage forest owners to retain and maintain their forest assets in the current wood pellet supply regions for europe pöyry management consulting has calculated that there is a surplus of low grade wood fibre and residues that could make an additional 140 million tonnes of wood pellets each year  wood pellets in context compressed wood pellets on a conveyor belt it is also necessary to look at the global production of all wood products to put wood pellet production into context in 2016 the global production of industrial roundwood the raw material used for construction furniture paper and other wood products was 187 billion cubic metres while the global production of wood fuel used for domestic heating and cooking was 186 billion cubic metres 1  only around 16 of this feedstock was used to make wood pellets both for industrial energy and residential heat the total production of wood pellets in 2016 was 284 million tonnes of which only 45 was used for industrial energy 2  while forestry consulting and research firm forisk predicts demand for industrial wood pellets those used in electricity generation rather than residential heating will grow globally at an annual rate of 15 for the next five years reaching 275 megatonnes mt by 2023 they are also clear that this growth in context will not impact forest volumes or other markets the wood pellet industry in the us south is not exploding it is a tiny component of the overall market forest volumes in the south in total will continue to grow for decades no matter what bioenergy markets or housing markets do the wood pellet sector simply and unequivocally cannot compete economically with us pulp and paper mills 80 of pulpwood demand in south for raw material on a headtohead basis 3  so while demand for wood pellets is likely to increase over the next 10 years this increase will be well within the scope of existing surplus fibre the question therefore is can suppliers keep up with this demand and can they do this while ensuring it remains sustainable reliable and renewable whats driving demand in the shortterm intelligence firm hawkins wright estimates global demand will increase by almost 30 during 2018 to reach 204 mt while forisk predicts a smaller jump an almost 5 mt increase compared to 2017 most of this will continue to come from europe 73 of global demand by 2021 more than 80 in 2018 where projects such as lynemouth power station s conversion from coal to biomass as well as five cofiring units in the netherlands are all set to come online very soon while smaller in number asia is also developing a growing appetite for biomass and in 2018 demand is forecast to grow by 198 mt these estimates might paint a picture of a continually soaring demand but forisks forecast actually expect this growth to plateau levelling off around 2023 at 275 mt hawkins wright expects a similar slow down forecasting manageable growth of under 15 between 2023 and 2026 a forestry specialist at drax group believes this plateau could come even sooner current and future forecasts in industrial wood pellet demand are based on a series of planned conversions and projects coming online he explains but once these projects are active demand in europe will likely plateau around 2021 and then gradually reduce as various eu support schemes for industrial biomass come to an end any long term use of biomass is likely to be based on agricultural residues and wastes but even with this expected slowdown the biomass demand of the near future will be substantially higher than it is right now so the question remains can suppliers meet the need for biomass pellets responding to todays growing demand meeting this growing demand depends on two factors sufficient raw materials and the production capabilities to turn those materials into biomass pellets in todays market theres no shortage of raw materials and low grade fibre instead what could cause challenges is the production of pellets hawkins wright reports the capacity for global industrial pellet production was roughly 214 mt a year at the end of 2017 and will increase by a further 3 mt by 2019 as facilities currently under construction reach completion it means that to meet even forisks conservative 275 mt prediction by 2023 pellet production needs to increase however draxs forestry specialist points to the three to four years needed to complete pellet facilities and the relatively short period of time financial support programmes will remain in place as something that could lead to a slowdown in new plants coming online instead he says expansions of existing plants and the increased use of smallscale facilities will become crucial to increasing overall production however the biomass market changes and develops it remains critical that proper regulation is in place  efficiencies are found and that technological innovation continues within the forestry industry so forests are grown and managed sustainably as we move into a lowcarbon future we know that biomass demand will increase but for this to be truly beneficial and sustainable we need to ensure we are not only meeting the demand of today but also of tomorrow the day after tomorrow and beyond discover

energy  investors  sustainability  wood pellets drax biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies 21 march 2018 sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton

sustainable bioenergy biomass is playing an important role in moving the uk away from coal at drax power station in the form of compressed wood pellets  biomass is already supplying roughly 17 of great britains renewable power  but more than just being a low carbon replacement for fossil fuel generation it is also crucial in maintaining the stability of the power network among renewable sources of power biomass is unique in being able to provide the same range of ancillary services that can be provided by coal power stations  such as frequency control and inertia  this inherrent flexibility is vital in maintaining stability on britains high voltage transmission system wood pellets can also reliably generate power helping to fill in the gaps left by intermittent renewables when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine and avoiding reliance on diesel coal and gas however for the uk and the wider global environment to reap the maximum benefits from biomass it must be produced sustainably more than this its supply chain must be low in emissions so that clear savings can be made versus power generation with fossil fuels to ensure this the use of biomass is regulated in the uk under eu timber regulations and the renewables obligation ro  but further guidelines are set to be introduced as part of the european parliaments update to the renewable energy directive red which will specify criteria for all biomass there is a clear need for this but for these to be truly successful they need to be based on a set of robust key principles a new report by drax outlines seven of these which can ensure sustainable biomass usage in the future 1 forest biomass for bioenergy should be sourced from sustainable forests the sustainability of the forests from which biomass is sourced is key to ensuring its usage has a positive impact on the environmental social and economic health of that supply region for example a properly managed forest can boost carbon stock as the younger faster growing trees that are replanted after felling absorb more co 2 than older overmature trees thinning operations also increase the growth of the biggest and best trees  ensuring more carbon is stored in longer term solid wood products generators should be able to demonstrate they are avoiding biomass sourced from higherrisk areas where extracting biomass could cause longterm carbon stock decreases in soils or ecosystems as well as other factors such as biodiversity loss soil erosion or depletion of water sources 2 bioenergy from forest biomass should not be produced from highrisk feedstocks feedstocks the raw materials turned into biomass pellets must come from sustainable sources and avoid protected and sensitive sites that could be considered a risk in 2016 around 40 of all feedstock supplied to drax originated as a sawmill residue  processes such as thinning also serve as a source of biomass feedstock while also benefitting the overall health and quality of the forest thinning a semi mature stand of trees allows the forest owner to maximise the production of higher value sawtimber trees storing more carbon and generating more stable revenue streams having a variety of wood products markets from saw logs through to biomass incentivises land owners to maintain healthy forests and reduces the risk of conversion of forest to agriculture or urban development 3 carbon savings and emissions should be properly accounted to understand the effectiveness of biomass sustainability policy carbon savings need to be measured factors such as fossil fuel substitution and the emissions associated with harvesting processing and transporting biomass are relatively straightforward to measure 4 bioenergy should be limited to what can be sustainably supplied unlike coal or oil which will eventually run out more trees can be planted grown and harvested that said there is a natural limit to the amount of biomass available on the planet and so it should not be considered an infinite resource this is why its crucial biomass is sourced from sustainable forests managed following set guidelines in short to ensure biomass truly is sustainable it is essential that working forests are actively managed and maintain or increase productivity  5 support should be given to all technologies that achieve significant carbon savings one of the major advantages of biomass over other renewable sources is its potential to help the uk rapidly adapt to meet the eu target of achieving 27 of final energy consumption from renewables the fastest way for biomass to make an impact to the uks carbon emissions is through converting coal power stations to biomass  as is the case at drax power station this repurposing of existing facilities not only offers rapid adoption of renewable energy but also the ability to provide vital ancillary services other renewable sources cant quickly deploying biomass solutions in this manner will serve to help it become an established part of the energy system as it continues to decarbonise 6 the efficient use of raw materials is supported by encouraging buoyant forest biomass markets globally there are substantial amounts of forest residue and forestry industry byproducts that currently go unused biomass should be sourced from regions where the largest surpluses exist and the forest carbon balance can be maintained to enable this to function effectively on a global scale trade restrictions should be avoided pelletisation offers one of the most efficient ways for this raw material to be used by making it safe costefficient and lowcarbon to transport around the world these principals are tried and tested by drax and known to protect forests and ecosystems  as well as optimise supply chains to ensure carbon emissions are kept to a minimum ultimately draxs experience in sustainably using biomass serve as a guide for other producers and governments to quickly decarbonise energy systems 7 the sustainability of forest biomass should be independently verified one of the best ways to guarantee biomass is sourced sustainably is by introducing thirdparties and official guidelines that generators and suppliers can work with in europe forest level management certification schemes can act as an effective indicator that forests are managed in accordance with the guidelines laid out by forest europe  outside of europe where drax sources most of its biomass  independent third part auditors can ensure the uks stringent criteria are being met on the ground read the full report the 7 principles of a sustainable forest biomass policy  proven to work tags sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets keeping the options open 19 october 2017 sustainable bioenergy roughly 750 million acres of the us is covered in forestland  an area nearly 12 times the size of the uk approximately twothirds of that land is working timberland producing wood used for construction and furniture in short us forestry is a massive industry enviva is the worlds largest wood pellet producer and biggest biomass supplier to drax power station  but in the context of the us forestry industry in which it operates enviva does things differently were leading the industry in sustainability and transparency in our sourcing practices says jennifer jenkins vice president and chief sustainability officer at enviva weve created unique tracking systems and we conduct sciencebased sourcing both of which encourage sound forest stewardship specifically enviva draws on best practices to make decisions about which areas it sources from and how it protects the areas it doesnt protecting bottomland forests a bottomland forest is an area of lowlying marshy area near rivers or streams that can be home to unique tree and wildlife species these forests are flooded periodically and they can be ecologically important however theyre also a part of southeastern americas working forest landscape in fact enviva sources 34 of its wood from these areas  but only where harvesting improves the life of the forest for example in some cases harvesting mimics naturally occurring storms clearing the canopy so young seedlings and forest floor species thrive more than that harvesting can also help keep forests as forests in the areas where we work one of the biggest threats to forests is being converted to another use  specifically to developed or agricultural land explains dr jenkins our goal is to keep forests as forests we want to preserve those with the highest risk of being converted for another use if landowners can gain a steady income from regular harvests theyre likely to keep their land as working forests however this is only true for carefully assessed forests where harvesting is deemed safe any land that doesnt meet envivas set of strict criteria means enviva wont source from it  it can simply walk away the landowners on the other hand dont have that luxury isnt it our responsibility to provide another option for a landowner who might not want to facilitate a harvest asks dr jenkins maybe they recognize its value maybe they would prefer to conserve it instead in recognition of our responsibility we made a commitment a fund that keeps forests as forests envivas commitment was to partner with the us endowment for forestry  communities to set up the enviva forest conservation fund  a 5 million 10year programme designed to protect tens of thousands of acres of sensitive bottomland forests in the virginianorth carolina coastal plain it works by inviting submissions from projects looking to protect areas of high conservation value last year it awarded its first round of funding to four projects more recently in june 2017  the enviva forest conservation fund announced a total of 500000 to go toward a second round of projects with partners such as ducks unlimited  an organization which  with the grant  plans to acquire more than 6000 acres of wetlands to operate as a public wildlife management area the fund follows a history of proactive sustainability programmes including a strict supplier assessment process and the companys track  trace tool  a oneofakind publiclyaccessible system that tracks every ton of primary wood enviva purchases back to the forest from which it was sourced it is entirely transparent and is a testament to envivas commitment to sustainability and doing things differently as dr jenkins explains this approach stems back to the origins of the company in 2004 as a company that makes wood pellets envivas reason for being is to help lower greenhouse gas emissions an emphasis on sustainability has always been a part of envivas dna tags forests  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp  wood pellets active management of forests increases growth and carbon storage 28 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy a study on the historical trends in the forest industry of the us south  carried out by supply chain consultancy forest2market and commissioned by drax group the national alliance of forest owners and the us endowment for forestry and communities  found that over the last 60 years as demand for forestry products has increased the productivity of the areas forests has increased too in short the more weve come to use them the more forests have grown a forest is not like a mine  there is not a finite amount of wood in the ground that disappears when it is extracted never to return forests are a renewable resource that can be replanted improved and harvested for as long as the land is managed responsibly whats more landowners have a strong financial incentive to not only maintain their holdings but to improve their productivity  after all the more of something you have the more of it you have to sell it is an economic incentive that works six decades of growth the forest2market report found that increased demand for wood is statistically correlated with more annual tree growth more wood volume available in the forest and more timberland for example between 1953 and 2015 tree harvests increased by 57 largely driven by us economic growth and increased construction over the same period annual wood growth increased by 112 and inventory increased by 108 in total annual growth exceeded annual removals by 38 on average annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million cubic metres in 1953 to 408 million cubic metres in 2015 inventory increased from 4 billion to 84 billion cubic metres the forest products industry funded privatepublic research projects to enhance the quality and performance of seedlings and forest management practices to ensure a stable supply of wood because of these efforts landowners saw the value of active management techniques changing their approach to site preparation fertilization weed control and thinning  and the use of improved planting stock healthy demand made it easy for landowners to take a longterm view investing in more expensive management practices up front for greater returns in the future and the results were extraordinary seedlings established in the last 20 years have helped plantations to become nearly four times as productive as they were 50 years ago a changing market markets for wood have changed over the last two decades precipitated by decreased demand for writing paper and newsprint increased demand for absorbent hygiene products and containerboard and increased demand for biomass these changes in demand have not impacted the way that landowners manage timberland however as sawtimber the largest trees in the forest remains the most valuable timber crop it also remains the crop the landowners want to grow  pulpwood is harvested from the forest only when the forest is being thinned to create optimal conditions for growing sawtimber or when sawtimber is harvested and the forest is being cleared for replanting pellet production has expanded rapidly in the us south though its overall footprint is still small in comparison to more traditional forest product industries in some local wood basins however like the one surrounding bastrop louisiana the location of one of draxs us production facilities the use of biomass to create pellets has filled a gap left by the closure of an 80year old paper mill  draxs decision to locate in this area is integral to supporting forest industry jobs and landowners who carefully consider local demand when deciding whether to continue growing trees according to tracy leslie director of forest2market s biomaterials and sustainability practice as history has shown forests in the us south have benefitted from increased demand for all types of wood the rise of the pulp and paper industry did not detract from landowner objectives to maximize production of higher value sawtimber nor did it result in a shift in focus to growing only pulpwood this new demand did however provide landowners with important interim and supplemental sources of income forest2markets research shows that an increase in demand for pellets will have the same effect incentivizing landowners to grow and regrow forests increasing both forest inventory and carbon storage the real threat to forests not only does demand for forest products increase the productivity and carbon storage of forests and provide an incentive for landowners to continue growing trees but it also helps counter factors that irrevocably destroy this natural resource the real threat to forests in the us is not demand for wood but urbanisation nearly half of all us forestland that converted to another use between 1982 and 2012 was cleared for urban development commercial forestry protects forested lands from development between 1989 and 1999 just 1 of managed pine plantations in the us south were cleared for nonforest development compared to 3 of naturallyregenerated forest types urbanisation not the forest products industry places the most pressure on forests in the us south forest2markets findings demonstrate that demand associated with healthy timber markets promotes the productivity of forests and mitigates forest loss by encouraging landowners to continue to grow harvest and regenerate trees read the full report historical perspective on the relationship between demand and forest productivity in the us south  an at a glance version plus an
