organisations and the biomass for energy industry in a consultation on the biomass carbon calculator to ensure that the methodology is as accurate and transparent as possible so it is more effective drax groups head of climate change rebecca heaton said drax announced a worldleading ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 by pioneering the groundbreaking negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  as part of this commitment to support the uks net zero target drax is also ensuring that the supply chain for the sustainable biomass pellets we use to generate renewable electricity is as low carbon as possible sawmill residues used to manufacture sustainable biomass wood pellets at lasalle bioenergy in louisiana click to viewdownload to do that its vital that drax and the rest of the biomass industry has the clearest picture possible of emissions in the production and transportation of the pellets by using actual supply chain data to help raise the quality of carbon accounting for biomass thats why were calling on academics scientists regulators and nongovernmental organisations as well as those in the biomass industry to participate in the consultation to help further improve the modelling for this new calculator and create a higher industry standard for emissions reporting draxs biomass carbon calculator has already been independently reviewed against the greenhouse gas calculation methodology laid out in the renewable obligation one of the main support mechanisms for largescale renewable electricity projects in the uk which has helped the country to decarbonise faster than any other in the world this independent review also verified the calculator for compliance with the eus renewable energy directive ii sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station click to viewdownload following the sixweek consultation drax will undertake further thirdparty verification to ensure the new calculator remains in compliance with regulatory requirements the creation of the biomass carbon calculator is one of a number of initiatives drax is taking to develop worldleading policies and tools to create greater clarity and transparency across the biomass industry it follows the creation of an independent advisory board of scientists academics and forestry experts led by sir john beddington formerly the chief scientific adviser to the uk government to ensure draxs biomass sourcing is in line with latest scientific research and best practice it

all equations performed for calculating supply chain ghg emissions the calculator is designed to comply with the greenhouse gas reporting requirements of the uk renewables obligation and the eu renewable energy directive these regulations require that biomass is considered as carbon neutral for greenhouse gas reporting purposes and that the co 2 emitted at the stack is balanced by the co 2 captured at forest level drax is the largest renewable power generator in the uk  generating 12 of the countrys renewable electricity using biomass draxs biomass delivers carbon savings of more than 80 compared to coal  this includes emissions from our supply chain the use of biomass has transformed drax to become the largest decarbonisation project in europe its a lowcarbon supply chain  drax

station kept open with 24houraday monitoring after huge flooding damage divers drones and helicopters deployed to monitor the route since february over 90 trains per week still able to use route whilst repairs carried out the line into drax power station was inundated with flood water in february when the nearby river aire burst its banks with the selby plant supplying 5 of the uks electricity it was vital to keep services moving during the covid19 crisis while repair work was carried out engineers have been deployed on 24houraday shifts to maintain the constant safety reassurance required to keep freight trains running chris gee head of operations for network rails north and east route said this was an unprecedented operation to deal with an unprecedented situation its never been more important for us to keep freight services running so we pulled out all the stops to maintain this vital link while we conducted repair work at the same time our teams have worked nonstop to make sure that crucial deliveries of sustainable biomass have been able to run despite severe flooding which has been incredibly important to keep the nation powered up this has been a real team effort and shows the dedication of the rail industry to vital services moving during this national crisis one of two lines leading in and out of drax power station in selby yorkshire had to close in february when water from the nearby river aire flooded the area but engineers were able to keep one route open to allow vital freight services transporting sustainable biomass to keep the nation powered up during the covid19 pandemic image showing the february floods affecting the railway line leading to drax power station the damaged line has now reopened following significant repair work by network rail deliveries were maintained while the work took place with over 90 freight trains a week transporting biomass to the plant this was made possible by the rail industry working together and the dedication of network rail and their contractors cml who took up shifts 24 hours a day to keep watch of the site and make sure that trains could use the line safely a crucial job was monitoring the railway embankment for any further movement following the damage caused by floods the emergency repair work cost 300000 and included unconventional methods to make sure that the line could reopen as quickly as possible this included using a team of divers to inspect structures which were underwater to check for damage as well as flying drones and helicopters along the route to assess the extent of the damage significant repair work to the track needed to take place before it could reopen such as replacing ballast the stones which support the track after sections of it were washed away by flood water the team faced an additional challenge when they discovered that several koi carp from a nearby private residence were on the railway when the pond they were in also flooded network rail teams worked closely with the landowner to safely transport them home keeping freight services moving is of vital importance during the covid19 crisis with the transportation of sustainable biomass helping to keep the lights on across the country network rail is working on ways to improve resilience on the line in a 25million investment and are currently in the design stage of this project rail minister chris heatonharris said freight plays a vital role in ensuring critical food and supplies can continue moving smoothly at this challenging time it is fantastic news that this important line has reopened and once again i want to thank frontline staff for their efforts nigel adams mp said the flooding in february showed how important it is to respond immediately to flooding events when roads are closed homes flooded and in this case the railway line delivering biomass fuel to drax power station was seriously damaged fortunately drax power station was able to continue to generate electricity because network rail responded immediately by introducing emergency operational procedures i am delighted that network rail have now completed the repair of the embankment and the line is back to two tracks working drax ceo will gardiner said the teams who worked tirelessly at network rail on the uk rail freight system and at drax to ensure deliveries of sustainable biomass were maintained throughout the repair work so we can continue to generate the power the country needs during the covid19 crisis have done a tremendous job the health safety and wellbeing of these teams are vital and we have implemented strategies to reduce the chances of spreading the virus these rail deliveries are a critical part of our global supply chain for sustainable biomass that supports thousands of jobs and has delivered economic growth across the north of england while supplying renewable electricity to millions of homes and businesses john smith gb railfreight managing director said huge credit to network rail and their contractor cml who have carried out the repairs so quickly whilst also managing to keep the railway partially open in the meantime the efforts applied demonstrate again the importance of rail freight during these trying times in keeping the lights on and food on the tables gbrf is committed to continuing and redoubling its efforts to ensure that freight continues to move around the country during these unprecedented times db cargo uks head of sales roger neary said db cargo has been working closely with both drax and network rail the communication and collaboration by all parties has been brilliant ensured a seamless supply of material to the power station during the covid 19 pandemic we continue to work with drax power station to provide essential biomass fuel by rail from immingham db cargo uk delivers on average 65 trains per week around 4500 tonnes of biomass which drax uses to supply the uk power network its great to be

cooling tower facts each of the 12 cooling towers at drax are 114m tall and 93m in diameter at the base you could fit the statue of liberty inside each one the dimensions of the cooling towers are such that if they were scaled down to be the size of an egg the thickness of the cooling tower walls would be the same as an eggshell  so whilst the walls could be viewed as being quite delicate the hyperboloid shape of the cooling towers gives them strength to withstand harsh weather conditions the ones at drax date from almost 50 years ago when the first half of the power station was built and came into operation in 1974 a common misconception is that the cooling towers release smoke  this is not true its actually steam or water vapour which can be seen rising from them power stations use a lot of water draxs 12 cooling towers draw 160 million litres of water each day from the river ouse the power station works by using boilers to heat water and make high pressure steam which is used to spin turbines and generate electricity the steam is then cooled inside the cooling towers and the water is returned to the boiler to be heated again about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero
