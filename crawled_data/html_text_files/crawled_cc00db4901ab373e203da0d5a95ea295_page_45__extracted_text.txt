energy and industrial strategy drax responds to ccus cost challenge task force report 19 july 2018 press releases the cost challenge task force report rightly identifies the important role bioenergy and ccs could play in a future low carbon energy grid in addition to providing flexible low carbon electricity to complement wind and solar bioenergy and ccs can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere helping to tackle climate change and realise the uks vision of being a net zero economy by 2050 tags energy policy korean electricity producers learn about powering past coal 6 july 2018 press releases a group from a korean power station has visited drax to understand how it transformed itself from being the uks biggest coalfired power station to become the largest decarbonisation project in europe the delegation from korean southeast power co visited drax power station near selby in north yorkshire where enough renewable electricity is now produced from sustainable biomass to power more than four million homes the group had a tour of the power station and heard about how drax upgraded half of its generating units to use sustainable biomass instead of coal to become the uks biggest single site renewable power generator drax signed up to the governments powering past coal alliance earlier this year the ukcanadian initiative seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries as part of efforts to tackle climate change andy koss drax power ceo said unabated coal does not have a role in our low carbon future in the uk there has already been a dramatic fall in power generation from coal  an 84 reduction in the last five years and a major shift towards lower carbon technologies we want to share some of the engineering knowledge and expertise gained from successfully upgrading half of the power station to use biomass with other power producers in the hope we can help to remove more coal from the system and develop a low carbon future globally drax is currently converting a fourth coal generating unit to use biomass and is also progressing plans for repowering its two remaining coal units with gas power generation and batteries  it welcomes over 13000 visitors to the power station each year as a member of the powering past coal alliance drax is committed to the development of a low carbon future globally new drax trains powering the northern powerhouse 5 july 2018 press releases since it upgraded half of the power station near selby in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal drax has transformed its business to become europes biggest decarbonisation project and the uks largest single site renewable power generator key to its success is its supply chain  including the development of bespoke train wagons able to transport compressed wood pellets in the quantities needed to the power station draxs rail wagons the first of their kind in the world were designed and developed by lloyds register rail ricardo and wh davis  the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer work is now being carried out at davis wagon services facilities a subsidiary of wh davis to rebrand all 225 of draxs rail wagons complete with new northern powerhouse branding drax is a member of the governments northern powerhouse initiative which is aimed at boosting the regions economy by investing in skills innovation transport and culture jake berry northern powerhouse minister said the development of draxs train wagons is a northern powerhouse success story  im delighted to unveil the first of the newly branded wagons the energy sector has been and will continue to be a major source of jobs and economic opportunity in the north of england it is worth over 5bn to the north and the region has more low carbon jobs per 1000 employees than anywhere else in england andy koss drax power ceo said with these trains delivering up to 20000 tonnes of biomass each day we are now powering millions of homes and businesses across the uk with reliable renewable electricity whilst generating over 500m for the northern economy and supporting more than 6000 jobs in the region  including some here at davis wagon services facilities we have invested 700m transforming the business from coal to biomass including the development of an entirely new supply chain and these rail wagons are a vital part of that investment our biomass comes into the ports on the east and west coasts from north america and europe and is brought to the power station by rail because it is more efficient than road transportation  helping us to make carbon savings of more than 80 per cent compared to when we used coal to generate electricity john hall managing director of davis wagon services ltd said our parent company is the last uk rail freight manufacturer and winning the contract with drax firstly to develop and build these unique biomass wagons and now in maintaining them has enabled us to retain a number of staff in skilled jobs and invest 850000 in our facilities here in the north we will be working with drax as it rebrands all of its wagons over the coming two years rewrapping them with the new branding as part of a rolling maintenance programme ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of news e email protected t 07712670888 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 0203 9434305 editors notes 65 of the electricity drax produced in 2017 was renewable  enough to power four million households having upgraded three generating units to use biomass instead of coal drax is in the process of converting a fourth generating unit to use biomass which should be completed this summer it has also submitted plans to repower its remaining two coal units with gas power and battery storage which are being considered by the planning inspectorate the majority of the biomass drax uses comes from north america and europe on ships to ports on the east and west coasts of the uk immingham hull port of tyne and liverpool it is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day over a sixday working week in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 15 per cent of the uks renewable electricity each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the uk with enough electricity for a year the fuel is transported to drax via rail rather than road to further reduce carbon emissions as it is more efficient than road transportation using rail saves approximately 270000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 3262250 tonnes of c02 per year independent research by oxford economics using 2016 data showed that drax supported over 18500 jobs across the country  more than 6000 of which were across the north of england yorkshire and humber north west and north east in addition drax generated 577m for the northern powerhouse regional economy and 17

breathed a collective sigh of relief after englands victory in the tense penalty shootout against colombia last night and what better way to celebrate than with a cup of tea at half time an additional 1200mw of electricity was required from national grid to cope with the number of kettles boiling lights being switched on toilets being flushed and pints being pulled the surge in demand was even greater than national grid expected and equated to almost half a million kettles being boiled demand surged to over 34400mw during the game last night  150mw more than national grid had anticipated however the spike in demand was successfully plugged  largely by gas generation one of the biggest surges in sporting history still goes to the world cup semi final in 1990  england v west germany the electricity demand was 2800mw  equivalent to 1120000 kettles being boiled after that fateful penalty miss the population made for the kitchen the match was watched by an estimated 26 million people in the uk when full time was called they caused a 2800mw surge in electricity demand the world cup quarter final of 2002  england v brazil  also saw an enormous spike broadcast early on a wednesday morning in the uk due to time differences with south korea where the game was played the match saw england put up a solid fight against overall tournament winners brazil a goal from michael owen provided early hope and at half time tv viewers left their screens to cause a huge 2570mw spike in demand by the time the game had reached its conclusion brazil had won thanks to a chipped ronaldinho free kick that fooled england keeper david seaman and those viewers who had lasted the duration caused a slightly smaller 2300mw surge ends media contact ali lewis drax group head of news e email
