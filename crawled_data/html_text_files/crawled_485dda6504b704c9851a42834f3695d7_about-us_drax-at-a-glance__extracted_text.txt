 about us  drax at a glance drax at a glance at a glance drax is the second largest producer of sustainable biomass globally and the uks largest source of renewable power by output we are progressing options for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs our integrated flexible and renewable value chain pellet production the material we use to make pellets includes sawmill and forest residuals and lowgrade roundwood material of a lower grade which is unsuitable for use in a sawmill they provide a sustainable low carbon fuel source that can be safely and efficiently delivered through our global supply chain the forests we source our biomass from are managed in accordance with standards designed to support the health and growth of these forests over the long term based in the us south and in western canada we have 18 operational and development sites with nameplate capacity of around 5mt once expansions are complete we have us41 billion of longterm contracted sales to third parties across asia and europe our generation business also uses pellets sourced from our pellet production sites to make flexible renewable electricity for the uk generation our portfolio of flexible lowcarbon and renewable uk power assets  biomass hydro and pumped storage generation  provides dispatchable renewable power and system support services to the electricity grid our dispatchable power  which can be ramped up and down or switched on or off at short notice to provide a flexible response to changes in electricity demand  has a vital role to play in enabling the transition to more renewable energy and a more flexible energy system generating renewable electricity when the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow we are the uks largest source of renewable power by output and drax power station is the uks largest single source of renewable electricity by output our portfolio provides longterm earnings stability and opportunities to optimise returns from the transition to a lowcarbon economy we are developing options for beccs at drax power station in the uk and exploring options for global beccs customers our customers business is principally focused on renewable electricity sales to industrial and corporate customers in the uk the business also offers nongeneration system support and energy management services such as the provision of decarbonisation services including vehicle fleet electrification it also provides a route to market for many smaller embedded renewable generators market context our role in delivering a secure and renewable energy system tackling climate change sustaining healthy forests and habitats and promoting socioeconomic growth 2022 was a challenging year for the global community the aftereffects of covid19 and the continuing effect of russias invasion of ukraine combined to have an impact on the social economic and political fabric of most countries around the world developed economies experienced rising demand high energy costs and supply chain issues driving inflation and resulting in a cost of living crisis for many people bolstering energy security in 2022 drax generated 11 of the uks renewable electricity  more than any other generator this electricity comes from drax power station  fuelled by sustainable biomass  in north yorkshire and our pumped storage and hydro sites in scotland rising global acceptance of beccs the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is the worlds leading authority on climate science it states that carbon dioxide removal cdr methods including beccs are needed to mitigate residual emissions and keep the world on a pathway to limit warming to 15ºc delivering a future positive outcome to tackle the climate crisis the world needs secure renewable energy  and to remove carbon from the atmosphere the ipcc and a number of governments agree that cdr methods including beccs are necessary elements in achieving this goal drax is the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation production and supply business and is now developing options for beccs in the uk and north america our responsible sourcing policy is informed by science and the biomass we use to generate electricity is assessed against sustainable forest management principles where we operate 18 operational and development sites with nameplate capacity of around 5mt once expansions are complete five deep water ports accessing asian and european markets dispatchable renewable power generation  biomass hydro and pumped storage  and supply to british industry
