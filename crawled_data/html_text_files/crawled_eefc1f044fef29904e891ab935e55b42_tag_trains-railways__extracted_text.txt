railways and trains working towards carbon negative reducing supply chain emissions 17 march 2023 sustainable bioenergy key takeaways draxs ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 means were always working to reduce our supply chain emissions further were partnering with different organisations to explore innovative solutions to lowering shipping emissions through our experience of carbon capture and storage we can deploy the technology to decarbonise operations at our pellet mills using rail wagons specifically designed to transport biomass wood pellets helps us reduce transport on land emissions by developing a new beccs power station in the us we can help decarbonise electricity systems while removing emissions from the atmosphere and tackling climate change at drax we have ambitious plans to not only help countries around the world replace fossil fuels with renewable biomass but to become a carbon negative company by 2030 for the world to achieve its net zero targets and meet the paris agreement goals of keeping global temperature rises below 15c its essential to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than is produced drax is leading in this effort through pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology beccs is the process of generating renewable power using sustainably sourced biomass while capturing and permanently storing co2 developing beccs at scale and achieving our own carbon negative objective means working to decarbonise the technologys entire supply chain its a responsibility weve been committed to for decades even before the drax power station was converted to run on sustainable biomass  and we continue to look for new innovations here are three of the ways were working to optimise our supply chains to make them as energy efficient and lowcarbon as possible 1 shipping emissions harnessing the wind around 90 of the worlds goods are transported by sea  including the wood pellets produced at our pellet mills and used to generate renewable power at drax power station in the uk and while shipping has a lower carbon footprint than road or air transport the sector still accounts for around 3 or 1 billion tonnes of global greenhouse gas ghg emissions initiatives to reduce the emissions associated with shipping are an important part of our efforts to decarbonise our supply chain and become carbon negative in 2022 we signed a memorandum of understanding with japanese shipping company mol drybulk  together were exploring installing mols proven wind challenger hard sail technology on vessels transporting wood pellets on routes such as british columbia to biomass customers in japan wind challenger which reduces fuel consumption and emissions by harnessing wind power through modern sails could be ready to be fitted onto newly built vessels for drax from 2025 the environmentally friendly bulk carrier efbc projects use of new and more efficient windpower could contribute to reducing emissions associated with shipping biomass by around 20 at a later stage the project could also incorporate the use of other lowcarbon technologies as well as loweremission fuels such as liquefied natural gas ammonia and synthetic fuels we previously partnered with the smart green shipping alliance dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design for a feasibility study that looked at reducing shipping emissions  the study examined the potential to retrofit an innovative sail solution known as fastrig onto ultrabulk ships importing biomass into the uk fastrigs made from 100 recycled and recyclable material are designed to considerably reduce ghg emissions and the use of fuel the feasibility study found that the fastrig solution could help lower fuel use and ghg emissions on one of our export routes  from baton rouge louisiana to liverpool in the uk  by at least 20  2 reducing emissions through carbon capture and storage biomass pellet plants are a key part of draxs supply chain by producing renewable sustainable biomass feedstock we can help countries around the world to replace fossil fuels our pellet mills in canada and the us south use a mix of fibre sources  all of which are unsuitable for lumber or other solid wood products globally in the first half of 2022 almost 70 of the fibre for our biomass came from sawmill residues like sawdust and wood chips fibre for biomass also comes from lowgrade wood thats rejected by the lumber industry slash left over from lumber industry harvests and trees removed in forest management processes like thinning and wildfire mitigation the pelletisation process uses power from local grids  wedding us to regional power sources in areas like the us where 61 of electricity is still generated from fossil fuels this adds to our scope 2 emissions  however our pioneering development of carbon capture technology offers the potential to decarbonise emissions connected to pelletisation its one of the ways that the experience and technology we put into action at a new us beccs plant can decarbonise other facilities whole industrial clusters and our own supply chains 3 rail the lowcarbon road option for incountry transportation drax utilises rail freight as much as possible as rail offers the capacity we need as well as having a lower carbon footprint than road transport in the uk we own 225 rail wagons  specifically designed to transport biomass wood pellets and will be taking delivery of 30 more in 2023 the bespoke wagons carry a greater volume of compressed wood pellets than traditional wagons are capable of delivering around 20000 tonnes of renewable biomass to drax power station every day train carrying sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets arriving at drax power station in north yorkshire click to viewdownload optimising the volume of biomass on each train allow us to run fewer trains to the power station keeping emissions minimal using rail rather than road transport is estimated to save around 270000 truck journeys and more than 32000 tonnes of co2 a year in 2020 a new rail link was opened to connect our lasalle bioenergy biomass pellet plant in louisiana to the regional rail network enabling the delivery of around 7000 tonnes of biomass per week to the port of greater baton rouge the rail link replaced the 27 tonnes that was previously transported by each individual truck helping countries around the world achieve net zero and working towards becoming a carbon negative company is only possible if we continue our practice of examining our supply chain and developing new innovative ways to reduce emissions even further tags supply chain  railways and trains  supply chain emissions  shipping  emissions 4 of the longest running electrical objects 15 june 2020 electrification how long do your electrical devices last were not talking about battery life but the overall lifetime of the items we use every day that are powered by electricity its accepted that todays electrical devices have short life spans in part a symptom of rapidly evolving technology fuelling the need for constant consumer updates and in part a result of planned obsolescence devices being manufactured to fail within a set number of years to encourage repeat purchases electrical devices arent purchased with the belief they will last a lifetime but it hasnt always been this way before rapid technological development and the rise of fast consumerism devices were built to last over the relatively short history of electrical appliances there are tools and equipment that have operated for decades some of these remain in operation today with hardly any alterations but for a few tweaks here and there to upgrade or preserve built to last here are a few of the longest running electrical inventions the oxford electric bell located in the clarendon laboratory university of oxford 1840  the oxford electric bell the oxford electric bell is not your typical bell  not just in how it looks but in the fact it has been in constant operation since the mid 19 th century it consists of two primitive batteries called dry piles with bells fitted at each end and a metal ball that vibrates between them to very quietly continuously ring its original purpose is unidentified but what is known is that the bell is the result of an experiment put on by the london instrumentmanufacturing firm watkins and hill in 1840 acquired by robert walker a physics professor at the university of oxford in the mid 1800s its displayed at oxfords clarendon laboratory which explains why its also known as the clarendon pile the exact makeup of the dry piles is unknown as no one wants to tamper with them to investigate their composition out for fear of ending the bells 179yearlong streak as a result confusion remains as to why the oxford electric bell has remained in operation for so long souter lighthouse tyneside england 1871  souter lighthouse in south shields uk the lamp in the souter lighthouse  situated between the rivers tyne and wear was the most advanced of its day when it was first constructed designed to use an alternating electric current it was the first purposebuilt electrically powered lighthouse in the world although no longer in operation today it ran unchanged for nearly 50 years the light was generated using carbon arc lamps  and it originally produced a beam of red light that would come on once every five seconds souters original lamp operated unchanged from 1871 to 1914 when it was replaced by more conventional oil lamps it was altered again to run on mains electric power in 1952 and was finally deactivated in 1988 1896  the isle of mans manx electric railway tourism hit the isle of man in the 1880s and with it came the construction of hotels and boarding houses two businessmen saw this as an opportunity to purchase a large estate on the island and develop it into housing and a pleasure development the manx parliament approved the sale in 1892 on one condition that a road and a tramway be built to give people access snaefell mountain railway station isle of man it was decided that the tram would be electric and work began in the spring of 1893 with the tram system up and running by september of that year although the track and its cars have been extended and updated over time the first three cars remain the longest running electric tramcars in the world  photograph by dick jones centennialbulborg 1902  the centennial bulb the unassuming centennial bulb has been working in the livermore california fire department for 117 years the bulb was first installed in 1902 in the departments hose cart house but was later moved to livermores fire station 6 where it has been illuminated for more than a million hours throughout its life the centennial bulb has seen just two interruptions for a week in 1937 when the firehouse was refurbished and in may 2013 when it was off for nine and a half hours due to a failed power supply made by the shelby electric company the handblown bulb previously shone at 60 watts but has since been dimmed to 4 watts while this means it isnt able to actually

of the population and the economy of the country when rail transport first arrived in earnest in the 19 th century it suddenly allowed goods from around the world as well as people to quickly cross the country it reshaped perceptions of the countrys geography unlocked the population and accelerated industries over time however the role of the railways has diminished owing largely to the massive rise in car ownership and the shifting of freight onto the road but that is not to say it has completely lost its importance with 6000 trains passing through drax power station every year rail is still integral to drax and the region around it in fact since the very first introduction of the railways to the region it has played a major part in shaping the landscape a village with two stations before the construction of the power station or nationalisation of the railways drax village was wellconnected with two different railway lines running through it the north eastern railway ner selby to goole line and the hull and barnsley railways doncaster to hull line each of these lines ran through a different station with ner calling at drax hales station while hull and barnsley called at drax abbey station but following nationalisation and british rails modernisation plans drax abbey station which had closed to passengers in 1931 closed to goods traffic in 1959 drax hales station followed suit in 1964 when it was closed as part of what became known as the beeching axe british rail chairman richard beeching famously carried out a review of britains railways in the 60s and as a result closed vast quantities of  what he considered  uneconomical lines explains andrew christian fgd  byproducts section head at drax power station and expert on the areas history at that time oil was cheap people were increasingly using cars and motorways were being constructed nobody really foresaw the rail demand that would be needed in the future to serve the power station daleks on a merrygoround in the 1960s and 70s with the planning and construction of drax power station underway there was a new need for railways in bringing coal from the new selby coalfield this resulted in the reopening of a closed part of the hull and barnsley line for four miles from a reinstated junction at hensall known as hensall junction it was renamed drax power station branch junction and later shorted to drax branch junction a rail system known as a mgr loop was installed on the power station grounds which allows trains to loop around the station and deposit coal  today also wood pellets  without stopping the merrygoround trains as they are known were originally made up of 40 fourwheeled merrygoround mgr hopper wagons these were much smaller than the wagons that carry biomass from ports to power stations today and more than 11000 mgrs where built to serve coal power stations around great britain photo by andrew brade railway engineer at drax power station the opentopped wagons were each capable of carrying 33 tonnes of pulverised coal which was automatically released thanks to a piece of machinery alongside the track colloquially known as daleks thanks to their resemblance to the dr who villain but as the power station began to change and evolved to fit the modern world so too did the railway serving it rail at drax beyond coal  the original drax rail loop was a single track with three coal unloading points by 1993 there was 145 km of track with 27 sets of points and crossings allowing trains to switch rails thanks to the double tracked loop and extra tracks laid to serve traffic taking limestone in and gypsum out from the power station this was further expanded with the introduction of biomass and a new double track and unloading facility in 2013 the biomass trains are specially designed to keep compressed wood pellets dry and they are much longer than their mgr predecessors at 182 meters long their capacity is 30 greater than a coal wagon it means the 23wagon trains bringing biomass to the power stations from tyne hull immingham and liverpools ports are a quarter of a mile long it might be a far cry from the heyday in which the railways crisscrossed the region but they remain a vital part of the area and while the areas original lines are now 50 years dormant their remnants are still visible in the lasting impact theyve left on the surrounding landscape many of the embankments and bridges found in and around drax stem from those first railway lines while much of the a645 road that was constructed in the early 1990s runs along

decarbonising electricity may soon power more of the worlds trains plus its planes and boats taking trains forward the electrification of the rail industry has arguably been in the making for a lot longer than evs but theres still progress to be made trains are already one of the mostefficient modes of longdistance transport and network rail claims electric models carbon emissions are 20 to 35 lower than diesel trains electric trains also accelerate and brake faster than dieselpowered models and cause less wear to tracks electrified trains are already commonplace in many parts of the world  japans famously fast and reliable shinkansen railways are electric meanwhile in the uk less than 50 of the rail network is electrified  with transport secretary chris graylings recent pause on development casting doubts on previous ambitious plans to electrify 850miles of track nevertheless advancements are still being made to enable the sector to utilise solar energy as an alternative to the national power grid the concept would prove cost effective and reduce the carbon footprint of trains even further according to a report by climate change charity 1010 and researchers at imperial colleges energy futures lab rail companies could cut their annual running costs by millions of pounds through installing their own trackside solar panels to power electric trains directly with companies spending around 500 million a year on power  the savings on selfgeneration would enable them to cut fares for passengers as well as emissions take off for electric planes of all transport modes air travel has made the least progress in electrification but theres hope yet airbus rollsroyce and siemens recently teamed up to develop the technology needed to create electricallypowered aircraft the companies plan to fly a demonstrator aircraft with one of its existing jet engines replaced by an electric unit in 2020 paul stein chief technology officer at rollsroyce said aviation is the last frontier of the electrification of transport it could lead to a step change in the way we fly with greater efficiency and less noise these proposed hybridelectric aircraft are not powered by onboard batteries like evs but with a gas turbine that generates electricity to drive the propellers  this could reduce fuel consumption by up to 10 predicted mark cousin head of flight demonstration at airbus moving to electric aircraft would also help the aviation industry meet eu targets of a 60 reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  by 2020 as well as 90 less nitrogen oxides and a noise reduction of around 75 ukbased airline easyjet also announced it could be flying electric planes within a decade and is teaming up with us firm wright electric to build batterypowered aircraft according to easyjet the move would enable batterypowered aeroplanes to travel shorthaul routes such as london to paris and amsterdam and edinburgh to bristol wright electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of easyjet passengers the challenge comes in making lithiumion batteries light and safe enough for the air the airline said this was the next step in making air travel less harmful for the environment after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31 between 2000 and 2016  wright electric claims that electric planes will save up to 15 in fuel burn and co 2 emissions  be 50 quieter and 10 cheaper for airlines to buy and operate with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers testing new waters theres a lot of buzz coming out of the maritime industry too every year marine transport emits 1000 million tonnes of co 2  which is why the international maritime organization imo has agreed that a reduction of 50

pulled out of skipton station and began a journey through the pennines to the lancashire town of colne having run since october 1848 through the towns and villages of elslack thornton earby and foulridge this railway line had been in operation through both world wars as well as the transition from steam to diesel but this journey was to be its last as part of a cost cutting drive within the british railways network the skiptoncolne link was shutting down today however the norths need for freight capacity is growing and this short 12mile stretch of railway that meanders through the pennines could soon be reopened the disused skiptoncolne line campaigns such as the skipton and east lancashire rail action partnership  selrap  with the support of businesses like drax  are calling for the return of the line not only because of the history of the railway but because it could play a crucial part in the future of transport in the north reshaping british railways in the 122 years between the skiptoncolne lines opening and its closure the uk saw serious change the rise of cars after the end of postwar petrol rationing made roads more important than railways and by 1961 british railways was in a poor condition losing money at a rate of 300000 a day  something needed to change the government looked to richard beeching chairman of br who published a controversial 1963 report the reshaping of british railways which recommended closing 6000 miles of the countrys 18000 miles of railway lines  mostly in rural and industrial areas a train at earby station on 1 february 1970 the last day of service on the skiptoncolne line the skiptoncolne line managed to avoid this first wave of closures but with annual losses reported to be as high as 110000 in 1968 its end was inevitable  on that february morning in 1970 photographers and onlookers gathered at the station to watch as the packed final train pulled out of the station on its last ever journey now almost 50 years after closing the country has gone through further changes and its time once again to reevaluate its transport network investment in the northern powerhouse the opportunity to reopen the rail line follows the governments plan to invest 70 billion into road and rail infrastructure in the north over the next 30 years with the aim of boosting the economy by 100 billion and creating 850000 jobs a key goal of this investment would be shifting freight services from roads to rail according to transport for the north  freight growth on the railway in the north is predicted to increase by 23 million tonnes by 2050 road freight on the other hand is set to grow by 2030 million tonnes on the m62 alone graham backhouse draxs head of supply chain and logistics highlights the urgency of the need for greater rail freight capacity that growth means another truck joining the m62 every second 24hours a day seven days a week that is not sustainable thanks to its location the skiptoncolne line is strategically placed to play a major role in transforming the norths transport by alleviating some of this pressure from the roads it could also help better connect cities like blackburn and burnley to hubs such as leeds and manchester increasing access to jobs and higher education institutions consultancy firm jmp suggest that over 60 years the lines opening could return 48138m of employment benefits to the region  how 12 miles can save eight hours draxs supply chain offers a further example of how transformative the skiptoncolne line could be for businesses in the region today renewable wood pellets imported from the southern us and canada arrive at the port of liverpool and are transported to drax power station in selby via an 11hour rail journey with access to the skiptoncolne line this journey could be as short as three hours this is because trains currently make a steep uphill climb between manchester and huddersfield which  when carrying more than 1600 tonnes of biomass  limits their speed to an average of 14 mph well below the 60 mph theyre designed to run at when fully loaded with the skiptoncolne line open to both freight and passenger trains biomass wagons would be able to make this journey while avoiding inclines and run at full speed something which in the long run will save more than just time if we make our supply chain more efficient of which reducing the cost of running a train across the country is one part we can move towards a position where we can operate without government subsidies  says backhouse but there is a lot of work that needs to happen before this becomes reality selrap forecasts the new line could be up and running along the old route by the mid 2020s with five years of engineering preparation public consultations and statutory approvals followed by two years of construction work the department of transport has recently started a project looking at the feasibility of the line which should be completed by the end of 2018 the total costs of the project would come in at over 100 million and while these shortterm costs are not insignificant the longterm effect on the businesses industries and people of the area could be far greater tags supply chain  railways and trains how sustainable biomass crosses the atlantic to power the nation 21 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels manufactured in china  imports that ensure we have readily available access to power on our shores tags investors  railways and trains  supply chain  sustainability this train isnt like any other in the uk 25 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the sight was the same day after day trains pulling opentop wagons filled with coal would arrive at drax power station coal was the fuel on which the station ran but as that changes and the world moves from the dirtiest of fossil fuels to renewables and other lower carbon technologies so too do the makeup of draxs daily deliveries now more than half of draxs power is generated from compressed wood pellets instead of coal the trains still arrive daily but in addition to coal carriages more are pulling stateoftheart biomass wagons theyre not only the first of a kind theyre bigger than any others on uk railways moving a modern fuel coal and biomass are fundamentally different whereas coal is a durable fuel that can be left open to the elements without concern if compressed wood pellets are left in the rain they become unusable in short traditional hoppers the large opentop train wagons used to transport coal arent big enough nor do they provide enough protection for transporting biomass to deliver roughly 20000 tonnes of wood pellets to the power station every day it would need an entirely new railway wagon for this drax turned to lloyds register rail now ricardo rail  and wh davis  putting a lid on it one of the first things to solve was the open top the team designed a pneumatically operated roof for each wagon that could open and close on demand  providing easy access for loading but suitable protection for the pellets when in transit a similar system on each wagons base was introduced to make unloading just as simple a typical hopper design includes a wide roof that narrows into a shoot at its base for releasing fuel the drax wagons are different when they arrive at the power station automated flaps on their underside open in stages as they pass through the biomass unloading area this releases pellets into a sorter that delivers them into storage ready to be used for generation with this system in place each train can unload in under 40 minutes the big problem space a more significant hurdle to overcome was the question of space the obvious answer was to make the wagons bigger but uk railways have some of the most restrictive dimensions in the world thanks to its bridges and tunnels  some of which were constructed in victorian times so to get a similar efficiency out of the compressed wood pellet loads as previously obtained with coal the wagons needed to be bigger  not in physical size but in volume the team looked to the normally unused space at the ends of traditional wagons to house the braking and control equipment cubicle while the pipework was designed to run inside the wagons siding creating more inside storage space the result is a wagon with 116m 3 capacity almost a 30 increase in volume compared to the coal wagons they are not only the first ever bespoke biomass wagons theyre also the largest on uk railways bigger wagons better economy the impact of these wagons is felt beyond just the railway lines wh davis is the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer and relationships like this are not only good for drax but positively impact the wider uk economy a joint study by oxford economics for drax calculated that in the east midlands where wh davis is headquartered drax supports 1100 jobs through its supply chain and the resulting economic activity in total the report found drax had added 603 million to the local economy through indirect and induced means nationwide in 2015 that impact extended to a total of 124 billion in contribution to the uk gdp and more than 14000 jobs theres potential for this impact to be even greater roughly 14 trains arrive every day at the power station from ports in liverpool  tyne immingham and hull delivering up to 20000 tonnes every day to fuel the three of draxs six generating units that run on wood pellets but if all six are upgraded it will mean more biomass more deliveries and more trains the railways have always been a part of the power station and in the foreseeable future its likely they always will be tags technology  visit us  railways and trains  supply chain  engineering name email comment
