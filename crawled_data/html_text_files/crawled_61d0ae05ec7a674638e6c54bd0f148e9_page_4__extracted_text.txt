decarbonisation committing to a net zero power system as part of cop26 30 november 2020 carbon capture dear prime minister chancellor cop26 president and minister for energy and clean growth we are a group of energy companies investing tens of billions in the coming decade deploying the low carbon infrastructure the uk will need to get to net zero and drive a green recovery to the covid19 crisis we welcome the leadership shown on the ten point plan for a green industrial revolution and the detailed work going on across government to deliver a net zero economy by 2050 we are writing to you to call on the government to signal what this will mean for uk electricity decarbonisation by committing to a date for a net zero power system  head of beccs carl clayton inspects pipes at the ccus incubation area  drax power station the electricity sector will be the backbone of our net zero economy and there will be ever increasing periods where great britain is powered by only zero carbon generation to support this the electricity system operator is putting in place the systems products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025 achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing which has been central in delivering uk leadership in the move away from coal and has led to uk electricity emissions falling by over 63 between 2012 and 2019 alone it is thanks to successive governments commitment to robust carbon pricing that the uk is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago  before the birth of the steam locomotive a consistent robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment lowcarbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in british history in the first quarter of 2020 yet even with the demise of coal and the progress in offshore wind more needs to be done to drive the remaining emissions from electricity as its use is extended across the economy wwwdraxcomcaptureit in the nearterm in combination with other policies continued robust carbon pricing on electricity will incentivise the continued deployment of low carbon generation market dispatch of upcoming gasfired generation with carbon capture and storage ccs projects and the blending of low carbon hydrogen with gasfired generation further forward a robust carbon price can incentivise 100 hydrogen use in gasfired generation and importantly drive negative emissions to facilitate the delivery of a net zero economy next year the worlds attention will focus on glasgow and negotiations crucial to achieving our climate change targets with important commitments already made by china the eu japan and south korea amongst others an ambitious 2030 target from the uk will help kickstart the sprint to glasgow ahead of the ukun climate summit on 12 december electricity cables and pylon snaking around a mountain near cruachan power station  draxs flexible pumped storage facility in the highlands 2030 ambition is clearly needed but to deliver on net zero deep decarbonisation will be required previous commitments from the uk on its coal phase out and being the first major economy to adopt a net zero target continue to encourage similar international actions to build on these and continue uk leadership on electricity sector decarbonisation we call on the uk to commit to a date for a net zero power system ahead of cop26 to match the commitment of the us presidentelects clean energy plan  to ensure the maximum benefit at lowest cost the chosen date should be informed by analysis and consider broad stakeholder input alongside nearterm stability as the uks carbon pricing future is determined to meet this commitment government should launch a consultation on a date for a net zero power system by the budget next year with a target date to be confirmed in the uks upcoming net zero strategy this commitment would send a signal to the rest of the world that the uk intends to maintain its leadership position on climate and to build a greener more

of the economy must reduce their emissions and do it quickly i believe the best approach to tackling climate change is through cobenefit solutions solutions that not only have a positive environmental impact but that are economically progressive for society today and in the future through training skills and job creation as an energy company this task is especially important for drax we have a responsibility to future generations to innovate and use our engineering skills to deliver power thats renewable sustainable and that doesnt come at a cost to the environment wwwdraxcomcaptureit our work on zero carbon humber  in partnership with 11 other forwardthinking organisations aims to deploy the negative emissions technology beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as well as ccus carbon capture usage and storage in industry and power and ramp up hydrogen production as a low carbon fuel these are all essential technologies in bringing the uk to net zero but they are also innovative projects at scale that can benefit society and the lives of people in the humber and around the uk new jobs in a new sector the humber region has a proud history in heavy industries  what began as a thriving ship building hub has evolved to include chemicals refining and steel manufacturing however these emissionsintensive industries have grown increasingly expensive to operate and many have left for countries where they can be run cheaper leading to a decline in the humber region if they are not decarbonised these industries will face an even greater cost by 2040 emitters could face billions of pounds per year in carbon taxes making them less competitive and less attractive for international investment deploying carbon capture and hydrogen are essential steps towards modernising these businesses and protecting up to 55000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the region capturing carbon at drax delivering jobs clean growth and levelling up the humber click to view executive summary and case studies from vivid economics report for drax a report by vivid economics commissioned by drax found that carbon capture and hydrogen in the humber could create and support almost 48000 new jobs at the peak of the construction period in 2027 and provide thousands of long term skilled jobs in the following decades as well as protecting peoples livelihoods decarbonisation is also a matter of public health in the humber alone higher air quality could save 148 million in avoided public health costs between 2040 and 2050 i believe the uk is well position to rise to the challenge and lead the world in decarbonisation technology there is a clear opportunity to export knowledge and skills to other countries embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys beccs alone could create many more jobs related to exporting the technology and operational knowhow and deliver additional value for the economy as interest in negative emissions grows around the world the uk needs to move quickly to secure a competitive advantage a fairer economy this is in many ways the start of a new sector in our economy  one that can offer new employment earnings and economic growth it comes at just the right time without intervention to spur a green recovery the covid19 crisis risks subjecting longterm economic damage being at the beginning of the industrial decarbonisation journey means we also have the power to shape this new industry in a way that spreads the benefits across the whole of the uk weve previously seen sector deals struck between the government and industry include equality measures for example the nuclear industry aims to count women as 40 of its employees by 2030 while offshore wind is committed to sourcing 60 of its supply chain from the uk  wind turbines at bridlington east yorkshire at present the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk contributing to a pronounced skills gap among the workforce in addition almost 60 of construction workers across the wider yorkshire and humber region were furloughed as of august 2020 a project such as zero carbon humber could address this regional imbalance and offer skilled long term jobs to local communities thats why i welcome the prime ministers announcement of 1bn investment to support the establishment of ccus in the humber and other superplaces around the uk as the governments ten point plan says ccus can help decarbonise our most challenging sectors provide low carbon power and a pathway to negative emissions healthier forests the cobenefits of beccs extend beyond our communities in the uk we aim to become carbon negative by 2030 by removing our co 2 emissions from the atmosphere and abating emissions that might still exist on the uks path to net zero this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use continues to be sourced from sustainable forests that positively benefit the environment and the communities in which we and our suppliers operate engineer working in turbine hall drax power station north yorkshire i believe we must continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light we can help ensure the uks biomass sourcing is led by the latest science  best practice and transparency  supporting healthy biodiverse forests around the world and even apply it internationally global leadership delivering deep decarbonisation for the uk will require collaboration from industries government and society what we can achieve through largescale projects like zero carbon humber is more than just the vital issue of reduced emissions it is also about creating jobs protecting health and improving livelihoods these are more than just benefits they are the makings of a future filled with opportunity for the humber and for the uks green industrial revolution  by implementing the ten point plan and publishing its national determined

tags decarbonisation  investors  sustainability jobs skills zero emissions  the economic need for carbon capture by drax 18 november 2020 carbon capture the humber estuary is one of the most distinctive features of the uks eastern coastline viewed from above it is a crack in the land where the north sea merges with england  its this connection to the sea that has defined it as a region and led to its rich industrial history but in recent years as sectors such as heavy manufacturing move overseas the humber has begun to sink into economic decline these challenges are now being exacerbated by covid19  almost 60 of workers in the yorkshire and the humber construction industry were furloughed in august 2020 stimulation is needed to rejuvenate the humber and prevent lasting economic scars on the region and its workingage population decarbonisation offers the opportunity to rebuild the region for the 2020s and decades ahead technologies that have been identified as essential for the uk to reach its legallybinding commitment of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 include carbon capture usage and storage ccus  trapping transporting and storing or recycling carbon dioxide co 2  from industrial processes and energy generation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  carbon removal from renewable sustainable biomass power generation that leads to negative emissions hydrogen production  switching processes from natural gas to this zeroemissions fuel the humber has unique capabilities that positions it as a hub for developing all three zero carbon humber zch  the partnership between a number of leading companies including drax aims to bring together these essential technologies and create the foundations from which the regions emissionsheavy industries can regain their competitive edge create jobs and rejuvenate the area a new report by vivid economics for drax investigates the potential economic impact of carbon capture and hydrogen it concluded that nearly 48000 jobs could be created and supported in the industrial cluster at the peak of the construction phase in 2027 its a chance to not just revitalise a powerhouse of northern england but to collaborate with other industrial clusters and build a ukwide green economy ready to export globally and attract international business to the region rejuvenating the humber the north sea has helped forge hulls strong industrial heritage of ship building and fishing in the 1950s the flat lands of the south bank enabled postwar industries such as refining chemicals and steel to thrive the regions economy is built around the ports and accessibility to europe and the north sea explains pauline wade director of international trade at the hull and humber chamber of commerce they are the biggest ports in the uk in terms of tonnage and the energy and chemical industries hinge on materials coming in and going out of them but these are also emissionsintensive industries and as a result the humber has the highest co 2 emissions of any uk industrial region  emitting 30 more than the second largest industrial cluster decarbonisation is vital in modernising and protecting these sectors and the 55000 manufacturing jobs they support decarbonisation brings opportunities many businesses in this region have that target very firmly set in their business plans says beckie hart regional director of the yorkshire and the humber cbi confederation of british industry many are high polluters  they know that but they are very keen to became part of the solution developing beccs ccus and hydrogen as well as building the infrastructure needed to capture and transport co 2  offers both immediate construction jobs and longterm skilled jobs the main construction period of the project would run from 2024 to 2031 and support up to 47800 new jobs at its peak in 2027 when 31 billion a year would be added to the regional economy these include up to 25200 high quality jobs in construction and operations as well as a further 24400 supported across the supply chain and wider economy these construction roles include jobs such as welders  pipe fitters  machine installers and technicians  with immediate government backing these jobs could be available in as little as four years ongoing operations will also create 3300 long term skilled jobs in the cluster in the early 2030s the supply chain needed to provide the materials and parts for the regions industrial revitalisation will also support further indirect jobs in fact businesses of all kinds stand to benefit  the increased spending by workers also could support further jobs across businesses ranging from cafes to professional services these indirect jobs go on to induce further employment and spending out across more of the economy overall the report suggests an annual average of more than 7000 indirect and around 10800 induced jobs could be supported during the construction phase with 452 million in indirect and 581 million in induced value added to the wider economy annually on average however transformation is costly and today the humber region receives among the lowest levels of government investment in research and development in the uk this has contributed to a pronounced skills gap in the region as opportunities decline and more people fall out of the workforce bridging the skills gap in the humber projects such as zch depend on availability of skilled workforces to build and operate the next generation of energy technologies however the humber currently has a low proportion of school leavers with the right qualifications to take on roles with specialist technical and practical skills this skills gap is only expected to get worse the governments working futures model forecasts that from 2022 key sectors such as electricity and gas engineering and construction in the region will require higher qualifications than are currently available in the local labour market the skills gap is also compounded by covid19 as it creates economic uncertainty it pushes more people out of work and further reduces skills in the workforce this has a particularly pronounced impact on young people who are less established in careers threatening to create a covidgeneration that feel discouraged and detached from the labour market but this is not an inevitability with the right intervention from government and business the humbers workforce can be upskilled and drive a green recovery a number of different approaches are possible apprenticeships have historically proved a valuable means of training the next generation of workers companies and schools should work together to highlight the opportunities of vocational training to school leavers  universities and colleges must work a lot more closely with the businesses in the region to have an honest conversation about what they need explains hart a good example is the ron dearing university technical college its a businessled college that has only been open about 18 months but has had great results from the students because they offer specific courses that the regions employers actually need for older generations of workers who have been out of the labour force for extended periods of time skills vouchers are a timely intervention these work by offering grants to cover the cost of flexibly retraining meaning longterm unemployed workers of any age can ease back into new types of jobs training local people for the future is key to decarbonising the humber and creating jobs as well as protecting industries but a net zero industrial cluster could also have an impact beyond just the humber carbon removal in yorkshire and the humber the committee on climate change ccc has made it clear that for the uk to reach net zero by 2050 ccus and negative emissions from beccs are essential  as is hydrogen as a zerocarbon source of fuel these will be needed at scale across the uk and in the humber they are already underway engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station drax power station is piloting beccs technology and has proven it can deliver negative emissions generating electricity using biomass from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 is a carbon neutral process as part of the power generation process adding ccus and capturing the co 2 emitted storing it permanently under the north sea turns the process into a carbon negative one deploying beccs across four of draxs generating units would support 10304 jobs and create 673 million in value at the peak of the construction phase when operations get underway as early as 2027 750 permanent operations and maintenance jobs could be created drax aims to operate as a carbon negative power station by 2030  of the 10491 jobs supported by deploying beccs 10300 at the peak 6367 of these would be within the projects supply chain and wider economy 9073 in 2028 such supply chains needed across the north of england offer further potential to establish yorkshire and the humber as a hub for decarbonisation technology facilities such as an advanced manufacturing research centre amrc have been proven to make regions of the uk more competitive locations for advanced industries by bringing together business with universities they can focus on sectorspecific challenges for technical industries by creating a manufacturing hub dedicated to research and innovation in a specific industry amrcs also encourage crowingin investments this is when private sectors investments enter into a region in the wake of government spending a zero carbon technologyfocused amrc in the humber would also position the region to offer decarbonisation skills and products to other industrial clusters in the uk and further afield from the humber to the world up the north coast from the humber is net zero teesside a neighbouring industrial cluster with its own aims for decarbonisation through collaboration with clusters such as this zch can offer even wider reaching benefits and enable ukwide carbon capture negative emissions and hydrogen however for the entire uk to reach net zero clusters all across the country must decarbonise  the report suggests as much as 190 million tonnes mt co 2 could be captured and stored every year across the country beyond just the clusters themselves 193000 jobs could be created at the peak for uk deployment in 2039 these jobs would add 139 billion in value to the economy building a strong zero carbon economy based around the combined strengths of beccs ccus and hydrogen can provide the uk with a worldleading export at a time when countries across the globe all face the same decarbonisation challenges successfully building clusters like zch will allow the uk to export knowledge skilled labour technology and services around the world as a port city hull has always had an international influence the chamber of commerce was set up in 1837 by the merchant adventurers who were seafaring traders that history is inbuilt into the local dna says wade today were trying to create the environment for international companies to invest and locate in the humber it serves as a further example of how investing decisively in projects such as carbon capture by drax and ccus and hydrogen clusters such as zero carbon humber today will bring long term economic benefits taking the uk from a green recovery to a worldleading green industrial powerhouse the humber has evolved from the fishing industry to a generator of highemissions

behind the paris agreement it set a clear collective target negotiated at the 2015 united nations climate change conference and signed the following year to keep the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in november 2021 cop26 will see many of the countries who first signed the paris agreement come together in glasgow for the first global stocktake of their environmental progress since its creation cop26 will take place at the sec in glasgow already delayed for a year as a result of the pandemic covid19 and its effects on emissions is likely to be a key talking point so too will progress towards not just the paris agreement goals but those of individual countries known as national determined contributions ndcs these sit under the umbrella of the paris agreement goals and set out individual targets for individual countries with many countries still reeling from the effects of covid19 the question is which countries are actually on track to meet them what are the goals the ndcs of each country represent its efforts and goals to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change these incorporate various targets from decarbonisation and forestry to coastal preservation and financial aims while all countries need to reduce emissions to meet the paris agreement targets not all have an equally sized task the principle of differentiated responsibility acknowledges that countries have varying levels of emissions capabilities and economic conditions the universal ecological fund outlined the emissions breakdown of the top four emitters showing that combined they account for 56 of global greenhouse gas emissions china is the largest emitter responsible for 268 followed by the us which contributes 131 the european union and its 28 member states account for nine per cent while india is responsible for seven per cent of all emissions these nations have ambitious emissions goals but are they on track to meet them china traffic jams in the rush hour in shanghai downtown contribute to high emissions in china by 2030 china pledged to reach peak carbon dioxide co 2   increase its nonfossil fuel share of energy supply to 20 and reduce the carbon intensity  the ratio between emissions of co 2 to the output of the economy  by 60 to 65 below 2005 levels covid19 has increased the uncertainty of the course of chinas emissions some projections show that emissions are likely to grow in the short term before peaking and levelling out sometime between 2021 and 2025 however according to the climate action tracker it is also possible that chinas emissions have already peaked  specifically in 2019 china is expected to meet its nonfossil energy supply and carbon intensity pledges united states the forecast for the second largest emitter the us has also been affected by the pandemic economic firm rhodium group has predicted that the us could see its emissions drop between 20 and 27 by 2025 meeting its target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 below 2005 levels however president trumps rolling back of obamaera climate policies and regulations his support of fossil fuels and withdrawal from the paris agreement effective from as early as 4 november 2020 suggest any achievement may not be longlasting the united states coronavirus aid relief and economic

climate action tracker estimates will be achieved in fact the eu is on track to cut emissions by 58 by 2030 this progress is in part a result of a large package of measures adopted in 2018 these accelerated the emissions reductions including national coal phaseout plans increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency the package also introduced legally binding annual emission limits for each member state within which they can set individual targets to meet the common goal the uk has not yet released an updated independent ndc however it has announced a 350 million package designed to

secretaries of state building back better by supporting negative emissions technologies today our organisations have launched a new coalition with a shared vision to build back better as part of a sustainable and resilient recovery from covid19 by developing pioneering projects that can remove carbon dioxide co 2  and other pollutants from the atmosphere together we represent hundreds of thousands of workers across some of the uks most critical industries including aviation energy and farming each of which contribute billions of pounds each year to the economy a growing number of independent experts including the committee on climate change royal society and royal academy of engineering and the electricity system operator have recognised the crucial role of negative emissions or greenhouse gas removal technologies in fighting the climate crisis whilst we should seek to decarbonise sectors such as aviation heavy industry and agriculture as far as practically possible due to technical or commercial barriers it is unlikely we will eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions completely negative emissions technologies are critical therefore to balancing out these residual emissions and ensuring we achieve net zero in a credible cost effective and sustainable way as well as benefiting the environment negative emissions technologies and projects can build back a cleaner greener economy in the wake of covid19 the foundations for this are already being laid by our coalitions members today for example the national farmers union has set out a net zero vision for the agricultural sector whereby uk farmers harness the ability to capture carbon to create new income streams the aviation industry through the sustainable aviation initiative has identified negative emissions projects alongside other measures as sustainable jet fuel as being crucial to greening the industry in north yorkshire drax is developing plans to combine sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology beccs to create the worlds first carbon negative power station  supporting thousands of jobs in the process in north east lincolnshire velocys with the support of british airways is developing the altalto wastetojet fuel project that could produce negativeemission jet fuel once the humber industrial clusters carbon capture and storage infrastructure is established finally carbon engineering has announced a partnership with pale blue dot energy to deploy commercialscale direct air capture projects in the uk that would remove significant volumes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with cop26 fast approaching there is a real and compelling opportunity for the uk government to demonstrate to the world it is taking a leadership position on negative emissions conversely if the uk does not act quickly it could jeopardise the delivery of projects in the 2020s that can support innovation learning by doing and the scaleup of negative emissions in the 2030s it also risks britain falling behind in the race to scale and commercialise these technologies with a view to exporting them to other countries around the world to support their own decarbonisation efforts we therefore call on this government supported by your departments to pursue the following low regrets interventions to support this critical emerging industry adopt a clear unambiguous commitment to supporting negative emissions in the 2020s and beyond the last significant reference to negative emissions by government was in the 2017 clean growth strategy between now and the end of the year there is a window of opportunity for the government to go further reflecting the changed reality of a net zero world and the growing consensus on the need for negative emissions a clear signal of intent would also give greater confidence to investors and developers in negative emissions projects in the absence of a longterm strategy develop targeted policies to support viable negative emissions projects in the 2020s  in order to scale up in the 2030s at a pace compatible with the uks climate commitments it is essential that government works with industry to bring forward early projects in the 2020s that are viable and represent value for money however there is no marketplace or regulatory regime in the uk today that incentivises or rewards negative emissions making financing projects extremely challenging dedicated policy frameworks and business models for solutions such as afforestation beccs and direct air capture are therefore urgently needed seize the opportunity to make negative emissions a point of emphasis at cop26  the uk has already led the way at a global level by adopting net zero as a legally binding target at cop26 the uk can showcase its further commitment to continuous innovation around the decarbonisation agenda by signposting the early actions it has taken to deploy negative emissions  which other countries will also need to meet their own zero carbon ambitions this statement would be particularly powerful as it can be credibly supported by several pioneering projects already being undertaken by british businesses and research organisations in this space we would welcome the opportunity to meet with each of you to discuss these points in further detail yours the coalition for negative emissions viewdownload the letter as a pdf  tags negative emissions  energy policy  investors  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage what is carbon dioxide 18 september 2020 carbon capture what is co 2  carbon dioxide or co 2  is a colourless and odourless naturally occurring gas in the earths atmosphere which is made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms  as a greenhouse gas ghg it traps heat making sure the planet isnt uninhabitably cold however fast rising levels of co 2 and other longlasting ghgs in the atmosphere are currently causing global warming to occur at an alarmingly rapid rate what is the carbon cycle carbon is the basis of all life on earth  it is a key ingredient in almost everything on the planet as the earth has a closed atmosphere there has always been the same amount of carbon on the earth but it is in a constant state of change transitioning from gas to solid to liquid and moving between the atmosphere and the earth this process is called the carbon cycle  and it is key to ensuring the earth is capable of sustaining life co 2 forms one part of this process and makes up the largest available source of carbon on earth how is co 2 made carbon is stored in oceans soil and living things and is released from this storage into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together through a number of processes including the decay of organic matter the combustion of materials such as wood coal and natural gas through the breathing of humans and animals and from events such as volcanic eruptions how does co 2 affect the planet an abundance of co 2 in the earths atmosphere means more heat gets trapped which in turn contributes to a rise in global temperatures and climate change  this acceleration in carbon entering the atmosphere began during the industrial revolution around the 1800s when fossil fuels were mined and burned to create energy which released longstored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of co 2  from the beginning of the industrial revolution until today the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per million to 387 parts per million which constitutes a 39 increase  today co 2 levels are the highest theyve been in 800000 years  co 2 is created when one carbon atom meets two oxygen atoms which join together when organic materials containing carbon are burned wood coal and natural gas how can countries reduce co 2 in the atmosphere according to the paris climate agreement  nations must work to limit warming of the globe to be well under two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels in the first half of 2015 the earth registered a one degree celsius rise in global temperatures above preindustrial levels which means drastic and meaningful action must be taken to decarbonise within the next few years there are many ways to reduce the earths carbon footprint including reforestation and using alternative ways to generate energy that dont rely on fossil fuels for example wind  solar  biomass and hydro can all provide sustainable carbonneutral and low carbon sources of electricity technology such as carbon capture and storage ccs can capture carbon permanently storing co 2 from industries in which some co 2 emissions remain by combining ccus with biomass energy bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs it is even possible to generate negative emissions where more co 2 is removed from the atmosphere than is emitted  co 2 fast facts in the 1960s the growth of co 2 occurred at 06 parts per million per year in the last 10 years the rate has been 23 parts per million per year the average human breathes out 93 kilograms of co 2 per year  however our breathing only contributes 065 billion tonnes of carbon returned to the atmosphere which is 001 of the amount released by fossil fuels each year trees absorb co 2 in the atmosphere and release it in the form of oxygen making them vitally important in the worlds fight against climate change in the us alone forests absorb 13 of the nations carbon output there are many ways to reduce the earths carbon footprint including using alternative ways to generate power go deeper where drax and biomass fit into the carbon cycle renewable energy sources are only a part of the solution to cutting co 2 emissions draxs strategy to reducing co2 emissions captured co 2 could create a whole new market for products measuring co 2 and greenhouse gas emissions tags faqs frequently asked questions  decarbonisation  climate change  negative emissions how to count carbon emissions iain staffell imperial college london 31 august 2020 opinion reduced demand boosted renewables and the neartotal abandonment of coal pushed last quarters carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes emissions are at their lowest in modern times having fallen by threequarters compared to the same period ten years ago the average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kwh of electricity consumed over the quarter the carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just 18 gkwh in the middle of the spring bank holiday  clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated the generation mix together nuclear and renewables produced 90 of britains electricity leaving just 28 gw to come from fossil fuels the generation mix over the spring bank holiday weekend highlighting the mix on the sunday afternoon with the lowest carbon intensity on record national grid and other gridmonitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being 46 gkwh at that time that was still a record low but very different from the electric insights numbers so why the discrepancy these sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation  as opposed to consumption  not all the electricity we consume is generated in britain and not all the electricity generated in britain is consumed here should the emissions from power stations in the netherlands count towards our carbon footprint if they are generating power consumed in our homes earths atmosphere would say yes as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities co 2 has the same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced on that bank holiday afternoon britain was importing 2 gw of electricity from france and belgium which are mostly powered by lowcarbon nuclear we were exporting threequarters of this 15 gw to the netherlands and ireland while they do have sizeable shares of renewables they also rely on coal power britains exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt whereas the imports did not as they came predominantly from clean sources so the average unit of electricity we were consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated within our borders we estimate that 1190 tonnes of co 2 were produced here 165 were emitted in producing our imports and 730 avoided through our exports in the longterm it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used as the mix of imports and exports gets averaged out over the whole quarter carbon emissions would be 153gkwh with our measure or 151 gkwh with productionbased accounting but it does matter on the hourly timescale consumption based accounting swings more widely imports and exports helped make the electricity we consume lower carbon on the 24 th  but the very next day they increased our carbon intensity from 176 to 196 gkwh when renewable output is high in britain we typically export the excess to our neighbours as they are willing to pay more for it and this helps to clean their power systems when renewables are low britain will import if power from ireland and the continent is lower cost but it may well be higher carbon two measures for the carbon intensity of british electricity over the bank holiday weekend and surrounding days this speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy should we use production or consumption based accounting with production by far the most common measure  the uk is doing very well and overall emissions are down 32 so far this century with consumptionbased accounting its a very different story and theyre only down 13   this is because we import more from abroad everything from manufactured goods to food to data when streaming music and films online either option would allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions on the one hand productionbased accounting  britain could be producing 100 clean power but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand  that should not be classed as zero carbon as its pushing the problem elsewhere on the other hand consumptionbased accounting  it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed even with unabated gas power stations running if we got to 96 low carbon 1300 mw of gas running we would be down at 25 gkwh then if we imported fully from france and sent it to the netherlands and ireland wed get down to 0 gkwh regardless of how you measure carbon intensity it is important to recognise that britains electricity is cleaner than ever the hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather than the exception by continuing to expand renewable generation preparing the grid for their integration and introducing negative emissions
