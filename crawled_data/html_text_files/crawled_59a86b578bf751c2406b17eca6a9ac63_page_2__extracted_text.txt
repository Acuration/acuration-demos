supply chain morehouse catchment area analysis 28 january 2020 sustainable bioenergy the forest area around the drax morehouse bioenergy plant has a long history of active management for timber production 96 of the forest owners are private and around half of these are corporate investors seeking a financial return from forest management  the pulp and paper pp sector dominates the market for low grade roundwood with over 75 of the total demand the wood pellet markets use only 6 of the roundwood of which 4 is used by morehouse given the small scale of demand in the pellet sector the extent of influence is limited however the new pellet markets have had a positive impact replacing some of the declining demand in the pp sector and providing a market for thinnings for some forest owners and a new offtake for sawmill residues pine forest is dominant in this area with an increasing inventory growing stock despite a stable forest area active management of pine forests has increased the amount of timber stored in the standing trees by 68 million tonnes from 2006 to 2018 over the same period the hardwood inventory remained static historic inventory and timberland area in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload us forest service fia data shows that the pine resource in this catchment area has been maturing the volume of timber has been increasing in each size class year on year this means that the volume available for harvesting is increasing and that more markets will be required to utilise this surplus volume and ensure that the longterm future of the forest area can be maintained historic pine inventory by dbh class in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload this is reflected in the growth drain ratio  the comparison of annual growth versus harvesting a ratio of one shows a forest area in balance less than one shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing phase but it can also occur when insufficient market demand exists and owners are forced to retain stands for longer in the absence of a viable market draxs morehouse bioenergy compressed wood pellet plant in northern louisiana this can have a negative impact on the future growth of the forest limiting the financial return to forest owners and reducing the cumulative sequestration of carbon by enforcing suboptimal rotation lengths the current growth drain ratio of pine around morehouse is 167 with an average annual surplus of around 7 million metric tonnes this surplus of growth is partly due to a decline in sawtimber demand due to the global financial crisis but also due to the maturing age class of the forest resource and the increasing quantity of timber available for harvesting

shipping emissions 5 july 2019 sustainable business shipping is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport as a result its the transportation of choice for around 90 of world trade  but even as the most efficient it still accounts for roughly 3 of global carbon dioxide co 2  emissions this may not sound like much but it amounts to 1 billion tonnes of co 2 and other greenhouse gases per year  more than the uks total emissions output in fact if shipping were a country it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and unless there are drastic changes emissions related to shipping could increase from between 50 and 250 by 2050  as well as emitting ghgs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel also known as heavy fuel oil release other emissions these include two that can have indirect impacts  sulphur dioxide so 2  and nitrogen oxides nox both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts as a result the international maritime organization imo is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions in january 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 05 one approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit  scrubbers  devices which wash exhausts with seawater turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate but these will only tackle the sulphur problem and still mean that ships emit co 2  another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as biofuels  batteries or even sails but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas or lng what is lng in its liquid form natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships replacing heavy fuel oil which is more typically used emissionsheavy and cheaper but first it needs to be turned into a liquid to do this raw natural gas is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids this leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to 162 o c in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times the end product is a colourless transparent nontoxic liquid thats much easier to store and transport and can be used to power specially constructed lngready ships or by ships retrofitted to run on lng as well as being versatile it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by 90 to 95  while emitting 10 to 20 less co 2 than heavier fuel alternatives the cost of operating a vessel on lng is around half that of ultralow sulphur marine diesel an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output and its also futureproofed in a way that other lowsulphur options are not as emissions standards become stricter in the coming years vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold the industry is starting to take notice last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on lng the highest annual number to date one company that has already embraced the switch to lng is estonias graanul invest europes largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to drax power station graanul is preparing to introduce custombuilt vessels that run on lng by 2020 the new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9000 tonnes of compressed wood pellets and graanul estimates that switching to lng has the potential to lower its co 2 emissions by 25 to cut nox emissions by 85 and to almost completely eliminate so 2 and particulate matter pollution is lng shippings only viable option lng might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping but its not the only solution on the table another potential is using advanced sail technology to harness wind  which helps power large cargo ships more than just an innovative way to upscale a centuriesold method of navigating the seas it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions drax is currently taking part in a study with the smart green shipping alliance danish dry bulk cargo transporter ultrabulk and humphreys yacht design to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass what a pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails artists impression of a possible design for a wood pellet carrying sailing ship manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions last year boats using batteryfitted technology similar to that used by plugin cars were developed for use in norway belgium and the netherlands while dutch company portliner are currently building two giant allelectric barges  dubbed tesla ships  that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers then there are projects exploring the use of ammonia which can be produced from air and water using renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell technology  in short there are many options on the table but few that can be implemented quickly and at scale  two things which are needed by the industry judged by these criteria lng remains the frontrunner there are currently just 125 ships worldwide using lng but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020 given that the world fleet boasts more than 60000 commercial ships this remains a drop in the ocean but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways tags decarbonisation  transport  supply chain  engineering  technology  sustainability drax a rail history 5 july 2018 power generation railways in great britain today are often seen as unreliable or chaotic yet they remain a vital part of the lives of the population and the economy of the country when rail transport first arrived in earnest in the 19 th century it suddenly allowed goods from around the world as well as people to quickly cross the country it reshaped perceptions of the countrys geography unlocked the population and accelerated industries over time however the role of the railways has diminished owing largely to the massive rise in car ownership and the shifting of freight onto the road but that is not to say it has completely lost its importance with 6000 trains passing through drax power station every year rail is still integral to drax and the region around it in fact since the very first introduction of the railways to the region it has played a major part in shaping the landscape a village with two stations before the construction of the power station or nationalisation of the railways drax village was wellconnected with two different railway lines running through it the north eastern railway ner selby to goole line and the hull and barnsley railways doncaster to hull line each of these lines ran through a different station with ner calling at drax hales station while hull and barnsley called at drax abbey station but following nationalisation and british rails modernisation plans drax abbey station which had closed to passengers in 1931 closed to goods traffic in 1959 drax hales station followed suit in 1964 when it was closed as part of what became known as the beeching axe british rail chairman richard beeching famously carried out a review of britains railways in the 60s and as a result closed vast quantities of  what he considered  uneconomical lines explains andrew christian fgd  byproducts section head at drax power station and expert on the areas history at that time oil was cheap people were increasingly using cars and motorways were being constructed nobody really foresaw the rail demand that would be needed in the future to serve the power station daleks on a merrygoround in the 1960s and 70s with the planning and construction of drax power station underway there was a new need for railways in bringing coal from the new selby coalfield this resulted in the reopening of a closed part of the hull and barnsley line for four miles from a reinstated junction at hensall known as hensall junction it was renamed drax power station branch junction and later shorted to drax branch junction a rail system known as a mgr loop was installed on the power station grounds which allows trains to loop around the station and deposit coal  today also wood pellets  without stopping the merrygoround trains as they are known were originally made up of 40 fourwheeled merrygoround mgr hopper wagons these were much smaller than the wagons that carry biomass from ports to power stations today and more than 11000 mgrs where built to serve coal power stations around great britain photo by andrew brade railway engineer at drax power station the opentopped wagons were each capable of carrying 33 tonnes of pulverised coal which was automatically released thanks to a piece of machinery alongside the track colloquially known as daleks thanks to their resemblance to the dr who villain but as the power station began to change and evolved to fit the modern world so too did the railway serving it rail at drax beyond coal  the original drax rail loop was a single track with three coal unloading points by 1993 there was 145 km of track with 27 sets of points and crossings allowing trains to switch rails thanks to the double tracked loop and extra tracks laid to serve traffic taking limestone in and gypsum out from the power station this was further expanded with the introduction of biomass and a new double track and unloading facility in 2013 the biomass trains are specially designed to keep compressed wood pellets dry and they are much longer than their mgr predecessors at 182 meters long their capacity is 30 greater than a coal wagon it means the 23wagon trains bringing biomass to the power stations from tyne hull immingham and liverpools ports are a quarter of a mile long it might be a far cry from the heyday in which the railways crisscrossed the region but they remain a vital part of the area and while the areas original lines are now 50 years dormant their remnants are still visible in the lasting impact theyve left on the surrounding landscape many of the embankments and bridges found in and around drax stem from those first railway lines while much of the a645 road that was constructed in the early 1990s runs along the track bed of ners route to goole photos by andrew brade railway engineer at drax power stati on the trains might not stop in drax village anymore but they remain a vital part of the landscape and how its powered northern powerhouse minister jake berry was in yorkshire on 5 july 2018 to unveil the first drax freight

missing link 23 march 2018 sustainable business on 1 february 1970 a train pulled out of skipton station and began a journey through the pennines to the lancashire town of colne having run since october 1848 through the towns and villages of elslack thornton earby and foulridge this railway line had been in operation through both world wars as well as the transition from steam to diesel but this journey was to be its last as part of a cost cutting drive within the british railways network the skiptoncolne link was shutting down today however the norths need for freight capacity is growing and this short 12mile stretch of railway that meanders through the pennines could soon be reopened the disused skiptoncolne line campaigns such as the skipton and east lancashire rail action partnership  selrap  with the support of businesses like drax  are calling for the return of the line not only because of the history of the railway but because it could play a crucial part in the future of transport in the north reshaping british railways in the 122 years between the skiptoncolne lines opening and its closure the uk saw serious change the rise of cars after the end of postwar petrol rationing made roads more important than railways and by 1961 british railways was in a poor condition losing money at a rate of 300000 a day  something needed to change the government looked to richard beeching chairman of br who published a controversial 1963 report the reshaping of british railways which recommended closing 6000 miles of the countrys 18000 miles of railway lines  mostly in rural and industrial areas a train at earby station on 1 february 1970 the last day of service on the skiptoncolne line the skiptoncolne line managed to avoid this first wave of closures but with annual losses reported to be as high as 110000 in 1968 its end was inevitable  on that february morning in 1970 photographers and onlookers gathered at the station to watch as the packed final train pulled out of the station on its last ever journey now almost 50 years after closing the country has gone through further changes and its time once again to reevaluate its transport network investment in the northern powerhouse the opportunity to reopen the rail line follows the governments plan to invest 70 billion into road and rail infrastructure in the north over the next 30 years with the aim of boosting the economy by 100 billion and creating 850000 jobs a key goal of this investment would be shifting freight services from roads to rail according to transport for the north  freight growth on the railway in the north is predicted to increase by 23 million tonnes by 2050 road freight on the other hand is set to grow by 2030 million tonnes on the m62 alone graham backhouse draxs head of supply chain and logistics highlights the urgency of the need for greater rail freight capacity that growth means another truck joining the m62 every second 24hours a day seven days a week that is not sustainable thanks to its location the skiptoncolne line is strategically placed to play a major role in transforming the norths transport by alleviating some of this pressure from the roads it could also help better connect cities like blackburn and burnley to hubs such as leeds and manchester increasing access to jobs and higher education institutions consultancy firm jmp suggest that over 60 years the lines opening could return 48138m of employment benefits to the region  how 12 miles can save eight hours draxs supply chain offers a further example of how transformative the skiptoncolne line could be for businesses in the region today renewable wood pellets imported from the southern us and canada arrive at the port of liverpool and are transported to drax power station in selby via an 11hour rail journey with access to the skiptoncolne line this journey could be as short as three hours this is because trains currently make a steep uphill climb between manchester and huddersfield which  when carrying more than 1600 tonnes of biomass  limits their speed to an average of 14 mph well below the 60 mph theyre designed to run at when fully loaded with the skiptoncolne line open to both freight and passenger trains biomass wagons would be able to make this journey while avoiding inclines and run at full speed something which in the long run will save more than just time if we make our supply chain more efficient of which reducing the cost of running a train across the country is one part we can move towards a position where we can operate without government subsidies  says backhouse but there is a lot of work that needs to happen before this becomes reality selrap forecasts the new line could be up and running along the old route by the mid 2020s with five years of engineering preparation public consultations and statutory approvals followed by two years of construction work the department of transport has recently started a project looking at the feasibility of the line which should be completed by the end of 2018 the total costs of the project would come in at over 100 million and while these shortterm costs are not insignificant the longterm effect on the businesses industries and people of the area could be far greater tags supply chain  railways and trains drax biomass invests in greenhouse gas efficiencies 21 march 2018 sustainable bioenergy we have increased the capacity at drax biomass amite and morehouse pellet plants to increase capacity and made them more greenhouse gas ghg efficient central to the projects was the addition of storage silos and handling equipment to allow increased use of dry shavings and other mill residuals the developments included the addition of an extra truck dump at each facility to allow delivery of increased volumes of these feedstocks use of mill residuals and dry shavings reduces the energy required to make a pellet as such material does not need to be debarked chipped and resized in the same way as roundwood some of the material has a low moisture content and is therefore able to enter the process after the dryer which effectively increases the capacity of each plant this drives down the average ghg emission per tonne of pellets produced a key measure of this is the kwh of electricity per tonne of pellets and we saw this reduce by about 10 in the final months of the year compared with the start of the year with further savings anticipated lasalle bioenergy in louisiana at lasalle a significant amount of our investment is going into allowing pellets to be transported to the port by rail rather than truck for the 250 km trip to baton rouge a significant carbon saving compared to trucks will be achieved when lasalle reaches its capacity of 450000 tonnes per year moving pellets by rail should start in the next year tags sustainability  supply chain  wood pellets  investors  decarbonisation  united states 5 incredible numbers from the worlds largest biomass port 26 january 2018 sustainable bioenergy since its origins the port of immingham has held close links with the uks rail and energy networks it was the humber commercial railway and dock company along with the great central railway that first established the dock completing it in 1912 to serve its primary purpose of exporting the most important fuel of the time coal today immingham is the uks largest port by tonnage  and while these transport connections endure theyve changed with the times the port is now connected to modern rail infrastructure and helps run a renewable energy system immingham is one of a number of uk ports that receives shipments of wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity at drax power station in yorkshire with 20000 tonnes of wood pellets arriving at drax every day here are the numbers that tell the story of how the port of immingham keeps more biomass coming in than any other in the world  135 million revamping for renewables the port began to get serious about renewable energy in 2013 when an investment of around 135m kickstarted the creation of the immingham renewable fuels terminal  the largest biomass handling facility in the world developed by the associated british ports as part of a 15year deal with drax the revamp of the former coal port saw an update of its unloading storage rail and road facilities to make it biomassready getting those 60000 tonnes of biomass pellets from ship to train to drax requires tight supply chain systems designed especially for this task 2300 tonnes of biomass unloaded every hour a key component of immingham is its continuous ship unloaders replacing the ports grab cranes in 2013 these two structures use a combination of suction and an archimedes screw to discharge 2300 tonnes of biomass an hour from docking ships the continuous unloaders are bespoke for immingham and designed to keep operating at a constant rate as the humbers tide rises and falls biomass is drawn up through the unloaders to a conveyer that then takes it all the way from the jetty to one of the ports eight silos 120 olympicsized swimming pools of storage unlike coal which can be stored in the open air biomass must be kept dry  immingham stores wood pellets in eight silos each capable of holding 25000 tonnes of biomass with the port doubling its storage space from four silos in early 2016 the sites total capacity now comes in at 336000m 3  the equivalent of more than 120 olympicsized swimming pools  here the biomass can be stored for any time between a couple of days and a couple of months depending on draxs demand 72 trains heading to britains biggest power station every week the next leg of the journey for the wood pellets sees them moved along the conveyer to board draxs specifically designed trains  imminghams rail facilities and draxs train wagons were developed to automate the loading process for maximum efficiency trains slow down to half a mile per hour as they enter the loading bay where sensors and magnets open the hatch doors of the wagons and close them when theyre full the automation of this process allows a 25wagon train to be filled in just 37 minutes in total 12 trains can pass through each day meaning the port can send 72 trains to drax every week with each hoppers full load at 716 tonnes of compressed wood pellets each train can carry between 1700 and 1800 tonnes it takes the total biomass reaching the power station from immingham to a maximum of 130000 tonnes each week 400 million added to the local economy draxs contribution to the yorkshire and humber region includes 3650 jobs and a 4192 million economic impact  this is primarily the result of the impact made by drax power station to the region however its support of other businesses along its supply chains means its economic contribution is felt far beyond its selby site in 2016 drax indirectly supported 1800 jobs in yorkshire and the humber region at facilities such as immingham its indirect economic contribution came to 117 million as the regions biomass industry became increasingly important find out about another major uk port that has been transformed thanks to renewable energy how does biomass get shipped to the uk read the story of one of the us ports sending wood pellets to uk shores tags technology  supply chain  ships and shipping how do you keep a 12 tonne steel ball in prime condition 18 january 2018 power generation there are 600 giant balls at drax power station each one weighs 12 tonnes  roughly the same as a saloon car  and is designed for one simple but very specific purpose to pulverise every day thousands of tonnes of biomass and coal are delivered to the power station to fuel its generators but before this fuel can be combusted it must be ground into a powder in pulverising mills so it burns quicker and more efficiently its the giant balls that do the grinding and although these balls may be incredibly durable the constant smashing crushing and pulverising they go through on a daily basis can take its toll maintaining the 600 balls across the power stations 60 mills is a vital part of keeping the plant running as effectively as possible surviving the pulveriser each of the six generating units at drax three biomass and three coal has up to 10 mills that feed it fuel all of which operate at extreme conditions inside each one 10 metal balls rotate 37 times a minute at roughly 3 mph exerting 80 tonnes of pressure crushing all fuel in its path air is then blasted in at 190 degrees celsius to dry the crushed fuel and blow it into the boiler at a rate of 40 tonnes per hour to survive these extremities the balls must be tough drax works with a local foundry in scunthorpe lincolnshire to manufacture them first they are cast as hollow orbs of nickel steel or chrome iron and then smoothed to within one millimetre of being perfectly spherical after 8000 hours of use engineers check how rapidly theyre wearing down by measuring their thickness using ultrasound equipment and if deemed to be too thin which usually occurs after about 50000 hours of use replace them for this they must first remove the top of the mill  including the grinding top ring  and then individually lift out and replace each massive ball those that are removed are typically shipped back to scunthorpe to be recycled transforming for a decarbonised future when drax power station was first built in the 1970s  the mills were designed to only crush coal but since it was upgraded to run primarily on biomass in the form of sustainable wood pellets  they have been adapted to work with the new fuel for the most part this requires only minor changes  the primary difference is that coal is harder to fully pulverise coal typically does not get entirely ground down in the first cycle so a classifier is needed in the mill to separate the heavier particles and recirculate them for further grinding the process of switching one mill from biomass to coal takes about seven days and nights this work was carried out on unit 4s mills ahead of this winter following biomass trials in the spring and summer of 2017 now that the decision has been made to permanently upgrade that fourth power generation unit  converting one of its 10 mills from coal to biomass later in 2018 will take about twice as long using the same essential equipment and process for both fuels helps to quicken the pace of decarbonisation at drax power station as the uk moves to end the production of unabated coalfired electricity by 2025  come seven years from now one thing

to that announcement and remains unedited below the uk electricity market used to be simpler coal gas and nuclear plants generated energy and fed power into the national grid  retail companies then delivered that power to homes and businesses across the country thanks to regional distribution network operators  today its not as simple the energy system of great britain has grown more complex  it needed to the push to lower carbon emissions led to the introduction of an array of different power generation technologies and fuels to the energy mix these all generate power in different ways at different times and in different conditions added to this are government schemes that have changed how this is all funded in short our electricity market is now more complex drax group has transformed itself to align with this new system it is now an energy company with complementary operations across its supply chain  sourcing fuel  generating 17 of great britains renewable power and then selling much of that electricity directly to business customers in the retail market  this has fundamentally changed both how we do business and the financial mechanisms behind the business where are we now draxs financial and operating strategies are very much interlinked shifting how we generate energy changes how we generate revenue the company is structured according to a set of distinct business segments each of which is treated in a slightly different way the generation business drax has adapted its business model to the uk governments regulatory framework which through successive administrations has broadly promoted investment in renewable and low carbon power generation three of our six electricity generation units  accounting for 68 of our output in the first half of 2017  have been upgraded from coal to produce renewable electricity from sustainable compressed wood pellets  these units are a core part of britains renewable energy mix guaranteed income from the third unit conversion has given us a significantly higher degree of earnings visibility and reduced our exposure to commodity prices h1 2017 107 twh total generation 73 twh biomass generation our coal generation units no longer provide 247 baseload electricity this means we primarily use our coal generation as a support system when the grid needs it we can ramp up and down coal generation responding to demand and ancillary service needs  our renewable generation units do this too ultimately however our longterm goal is to convert the remaining coal units  either to renewables or to gas our research and innovation team is currently looking into how we might be able to do this but early indications show that coaltogas conversion could be an attractive option for delivering flexible and reliable generation capacity for the uk drax power is doing well and generated 137m of ebitda in the first half of this year a 51m increase compared to the first half of 2016 we are confident about the projected growth of our power generation business to 300 million ebitda by 2025 that plan is aided by our move into rapid response gas  a technology that can meet urgent needs of a power system that includes an increasing amount of weatherdependent renewables two of the four rapid response gas projects were developing are ready to bid for 15year capacity market contracts this coming february they are designed to start up from cold faster than coal and combined cycle gas turbine ccgt units these smallyetpowerful plants will respond to shortterm power market price signals and be capable of providing other ancillary services to further enhance security of supply these projects should add an attractive additional source of earnings to our generation business they also will have attractive characteristics as a significant element of their earnings will come from the capacity market  guaranteed government income for 15 years the retail business we directly serve the retail market through haven power  which supplies renewable electricity primarily to industrial and commercial customers last week we announced that haven power was able to breakeven six months ahead of schedule retail is an area were growing and in february 2017 we acquired opus energy  the largest nondomestic uk energy company by meters installed outside the big six this has had a marked effect  today were the largest challenger b2b energy retailer in the uk there is a healthy and regular annuity coming in through the existing retail business and we believe this can generate 80 million of ebitda by 2025 which together with our growing biomass supply business will make up a third of our earnings we demonstrated good progress in the first half of the year earning 11m of ebitda the biomass business our two operational wood pellet manufacturing plants in louisiana and mississippi are progressing well they are both still ramping up to full production and have seen marked improvements in pellet quality and production we are looking to grow our us business and as part of this well need to build on the recent addition of lasalle bioenergy with further acquisitions expansion will grow our capacity for the selfsupply of pellets from 15 to 30 of drax power stations requirements adding an additional one million tonnes of production in the second half of 2017 we expect the profitability of drax biomass to increase lasalle will be commissioned in the first half of 2018 and reach capacity in 2019 whats next the energy landscape continues to change and well need to change with it phasing out coal entirely is priority number one for this well continue to look at options how and when we can convert more units to sustainable biomass depends on trials that we are conducting at drax power station during 201718 the right government support would also make further conversions cost effective we also recognise that its important to look at alternative possibilities for our remaining coal units this is why we are seeking planning permission to convert one or more of our 645 mw megawatt coal units to 1300 mw of gas such an upgrade would be at a discount to a newbuild combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power station of equivalent capacity and thats simply because we would use much of the existing infrastructure and equipment another major prospect is in the technology space and so were continuing to invest in research and innovation batteries and storage are a huge opportunity for us  both in how they could benefit our retail customers and how they could provide solutions for largescale centralised energy systems in short its an area with huge potential we welcome the governments recent initiatives designed to stimulate the development of battery technology  as well as encourage the use of electric vehicles drax has gone through a period of considerable change and that will continue as we meet the uks lowcarbon energy demands we are improving the quality of our earnings reducing our exposure to commodities and positioning to take advantage of future opportunities as we told investors in june if we deliver on these plans we can expect 425

sustainable bioenergy in the uk were so accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels
