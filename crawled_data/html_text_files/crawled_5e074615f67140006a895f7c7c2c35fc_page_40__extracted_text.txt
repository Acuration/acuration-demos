power station  technology uk progress on climate targets at risk 13 february 2019 press releases new analysis shows great britains progress in decarbonising electricity has slowed new solar and wind projects fall to lowest level in seven years collapse of new nuclear projects and the suspension of the capacity market raises concerns over uks long term energy strategy efforts to decarbonise energy generation have slowed raising concerns that the uks world beating progress on tackling climate change could stall while output from renewables reached new highs in 2018 there was a dramatic decline in the amount of new wind and solar projects coming online according to the latest electric insights report  the carbon intensity of electricity averaged 217 gkwh last year that was 8 lower than in 2017 but amounts to the slowest rate of decarbonisation since 2013 the fastest rate of power system decarbonisation happened in 2016 when carbon intensity dropped 85 gkwh compared to 2018s decrease of 20 gkwh great britains carbon intensity must continue to fall by 6 a year over the coming decade to meet the committee on climate changes target of 100 gkwh by 2030 but its already projected to fall by slightly less than that  5  in the coming years due to the slump in new renewables and nuclear progress could be further dented if coal makes a comeback ahead of it coming off the system in 2025 commenting on the analysis dr iain staffell of imperial college london said the uk has led the world in decarbonising electricity and that continued in 2018 as output from renewables hit new highs the sharp fall in new solar and wind projects coming online is worrying and the likelihood that this trend will continue raises serious questions over future progress towards meeting our climate targets in the last 12 months fewer wind and solar projects were built than at any time since 2010 the governments own forecasts expect this slump to continue into the next decade new solar pv and wind capacity installed in each calendar year the suspension of the capacity market late last year created further uncertainty around the future of britains power system that was compounded in january by hitachis decision to suspend work on the planned 29gw wylfa nuclear power plant and a similar project at oldbury in gloucestershire together with the moorside nuclear project which was cancelled last year it has left a 9gw hole in the uks future low carbon generation plan all but one of the current fleet of nuclear power plants are due to close by 2030 will gardiner chief executive of drax group said its vital that the uk meets its climate goals thats why at drax we have been taking coal off the system and trialling breakthrough bioenergy carbon capture and storage technology but this analysis and the problems besetting new nuclear shows that as a country we need to look again at our future energy strategy we must ensure that the uk power system has the flexibility and stability needed to enable much more renewable energy in the future dr nina skorupska cbe chief executive of the renewable energy association commented changes to energy policy in recent years hit the solar pv onshore wind and bioenergy sectors hard renewables represent some of the lowest cost forms of new power generation today a fact recognised by the government in both recent statements from the secretary of state and the clean growth strategy however there remains a significant policy gap and an absence of a fair route to market for new renewable and clean technology projects todays data highlights a collapse in the number of projects under development despite the that fact that polling tells us the public want to see more renewable power on the system electric insights reveals that 2018 was a record breaking year for britains power system with several new renewables and low carbon records set but britain needed flexible gas generation too  on a cold night in january with low wind and much of the nuclear fleet out of action gas fired stations reached a new record high producing 27gw and meeting 66 of power demand data on the realtime electric insights website shows that

electric insights  electricity  investors  sustainability  technology carbon dioxide now being captured in first of its kind beccs pilot 7 february 2019 press releases the first carbon dioxide has been captured using ccapture technology at drax power station in their innovative bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs pilot this moves britain further ahead in the race to develop beccs technologies  essential in the fight against climate change the project could enable drax to become the worlds first negative emissions power station  reducing harmful greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere the demonstration plant at the power station near selby in north yorkshire is using innovative technology developed by leedsbased ccapture to capture a tonne of co 2 a day during the pilot it is the firsttime carbon dioxide has been captured from the combustion of a 100 biomass feedstock anywhere in the world if the beccs pilot can be scaled up to deliver negative emissions  drax power station would be helping to remove the gases that cause global warning from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced engineers began commissioning the pilot plant in november with the first carbon now being captured proving that the proprietary solvent developed by ccapture can be used to isolate the carbon dioxide from the flue gases released when biomass is used to generate electricity data being obtained about the co 2 capture process will continue to be analysed throughout the pilot to fully understand the potential of the technology and how it could be scaled up at drax part of this will include identifying and developing ways to store and use the carbon dioxide being captured drax has invested 400000 in the pilot which could be the first of several projects undertaken at the power station to deliver a rapid lower cost demonstration of beccs will gardiner drax group ceo said proving that this innovative carbon capture technology works is an exciting development and another important milestone in our beccs project climate change affects us all so this is of real significance  not just for us at drax but also for the uk and the rest of the world the successful deployment of beccs requires us to identify ways in which the carbon dioxide were now capturing can be stored or used in other processes and were working with the government and other businesses on that were focused on working together to make the progress required for us to tackle climate change and enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future the royal society and royal academy of engineering have estimated that beccs could enable us to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050  approximately half the nations emissions target the governments clean growth strategy identified beccs as one of several greenhouse gas removal technologies that could remove emissions from the atmosphere and help achieve long term decarbonisation minister for energy and clean growth claire perry said this innovative technology has the potential to make huge strides in our efforts to tackle climate change while kickstarting an entirely new cuttingedge industry in the uk worldfirsts like this will help us to realise our ambition of having a first operational plant by the mid2020s as we continue to seize the opportunities of moving to a greener cleaner economy  a key part of our modern industrial strategy chris rayner founder of ccapture and professor of organic chemistry at the university of leeds said this represents a major milestone on the road to achieving negative emissions through beccs which is going to be so important in the future to see our technology working in a real environment like drax is a tribute to the fantastic team of chemists and engineers who work on the project caspar schoolderman director of engineering at ccapture added working at this scale is really where the engineering gets interesting the challenge now is to get all the information we need to design and build a capture plant 10000 times bigger its only really when we get to those sorts of scales that we can start to have an impact on the climate drax power station became the largest decarbonisation project in europe by upgrading two thirds of its generating units to use biomass instead of coal as part of the beccs pilot it will examine options for a similar repurposing of existing infrastructure to deliver more carbon savings work has already been undertaken to ensure the solvent ccapture has developed is compatible with the biomass flue gas at drax power station this was completed last summer along with a labscale study into the feasibility of reutilising the flue gas desulphurisation fgd absorbers at the power station fgd equipment is vital for reducing sulphur emissions from coal but it is no longer required to control sulphur on four of the generating units at drax that have been upgraded to use biomass because the wood pellets

carbon animation viewdownload the animation editors notes drax power station is the single largest user of sustainable biomass for power in the world  around 70 of the electricity it produces is renewable enough to power four million households biomass such as sustainably sourced compressed wood pellets is a renewable fuel  the co 2 captured when it grew is equal to the emissions it releases when used to generate electricity so it does not contribute new carbon to the biosphere when coupled with ccs the overall process of biomass electricity generation removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it releases the governments clean growth strategy identified sustainable biomass power stations used in tandem with ccus technology as a potential route to achieving longterm decarbonisation between now and 2050 drax is in discussions with the british beer and pub association to see if it could help keep the fizz in the drinks industry as part of its efforts to ensure the carbon captured during the beccs pilot project is used in another process or industry there are other markets which drax expects to provide significant opportunities such as using the co 2 captured in the creation of synthetic fuels drax is also working with the humber local enterprise partnership catch and other interested parties to explore the role ccus can play in turning the humber estuary into the worlds first netzero carbon cluster by 2040 it has plans to repower its two remaining coal generating units to use high efficiency flexible gas by reusing some of its existing infrastructure including the grid connection and cooling towers the development will be cost effective and very competitive it could also enable drax to stop using coal as soon as 2023 well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline reducing its emissions whilst playing a vital role in supporting the system as more renewables come online ccapture is a spin out from the chemistry department at leeds university and
