hospital as part of efforts to support frontline nhs workers it has teamed up with former cabinet minister rt hon justine greening as a founding member of the c19 business pledge a national scheme which encourages employers to join the coronavirus effort by pledging to help their employees customers and communities to get through the crisis drax group ceo will gardiner said our dedicated teams across england scotland and wales are working around the clock to continue generating and supplying the electricity the uk needs at this critical time through the c19 business pledge we can work with others to go further in supporting those in our communities who need our help more than ever right now will gardiner ceo drax group we want to do as much as we can to help and support our own employees as well as our customers and the communities in which we operate during this crisis justine greening said with the future of many employers hanging in the balance and incredibly tough times unfolding in sectors across the uk businesses face many incredibly difficult decisions but those organisations who are able to like drax group can have a huge role in battling the impact of coronavirus and make a real difference in these uniquely challenging times justine greening with drax generation ceo andy koss in spite of everything lots of employers have already shown amazing initiative and commitment to helping people affected by coronavirus the c19 business pledge is all about encouraging as many businesses and universities as possible to get involved and then helping them do that faster and better by sharing all the great work thats already been done the early response has been incredible and ill do everything i can to help to connect up british business to play its role drax has also delivered 250 facemasks to york hospital to help keep nhs staff on the frontlines safe the masks were donated to drax power station by employees at the shanghai waigaoqiao no3 power generation company in china part of shenergy power technology the chinese energy companys engineers visited drax power station in north yorkshire last year to learn more about how it has transformed itself to become the largest decarbonisation project in europe by using sustainable biomass instead of coal drax power station is the uks largest generating 5 of the countrys electricity prof feng weizhong shenergy general manager said we have suffered from the virus in the past two months and know how terrible it is thankfully now we are in a much better situation and we want to help our international friends so that all of us can overcome the virus as soon as possible we shouldnt and cant manage this alone although we are from different countries and different cultures we think we share the belief that life and health are priceless simon morritt chief executive of york teaching hospital nhs foundation trust said i would like to express my personal thanks to drax and their partners in china for their support in donating facemasks to the trust to help us ensure we are well equipped to support our staff and care for our patients in the coming days and weeks drax power station will gardiner added were very grateful for the donation of the face masks from our friends in china  it is a great example of businesses working together to help people during this crisis through the c19 business pledge we aim to support more of those who are most in need the c19 business pledge is targeting not just the immediate challenges of coronavirus but also the challenges of recovery  and was born out of the huge response from businesses and universities involved in the existing social mobility pledge wanting to be part of a national effort the initiative has already received the backing of employers representing over 900000 people staff and students throughout businesses and universities as well as drax group they include bp barratt developments everton football club national grid dla piper persimmon homes and severn trent water employers who sign up to the pledge give their backing to three main objectives built around employees customers and communities they will not only help britain through the immediate challenges of coronavirus but also through its recovery for more on the c19 business pledge visit the website wwwc19businesspledgeorg ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 07712 670 888 aidan kerr drax group media manager e email protected t 07849 090368 editors notes drax is already a member of the social mobility pledge which aims to champion social mobility and raise aspirations within communities local to its operations employers who sign up to the c19 business pledge give their backing to three main objectives including to support their own employees throughout and beyond this challenging time for example this could include practical support and advice on financial security mental health personal wellbeing as well as reintegration back into work for those who have experienced an extended period away from the workplace to publish clear and simple advice for customers where possible they could have specialist teams dedicated to supporting customers if they are having problems such as those facing repayment difficulties and vulnerable customers to do what they can to help communities in britain through the epidemic over the coming months we are likely to see a sharp increase in isolation loneliness mental health and household financial issues in our communities across the country there will be an increased need for communities to come together with practical support such as food deliveries collections and financial assistance for organisations that specialise in supporting vulnerable people about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 its 2900strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers drax owns two b2b energy supply businesses haven power based in ipswich supplies electricity and energy services to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity energy services and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more information visit wwwdraxcom about the c19 business pledge founded by former cabinet minister rt hon justine greening and entrepreneur david harrison the c19 business pledge aims to harness the power of business as a force for good in tackling the coronavirus epidemic we understand many businesses will be working hard to ensure they are able to continue in this turbulent time we acknowledge that this will involve difficult decisions but for those that can we are asking them to help in the national effort with their employees customers and communities by mobilising that collective effort we can support those most in need through this crisis our purpose to encourage uk businesses and universities to be a force for good by making a commitment to doing what they can to tackle coronavirus covid19 these objectives are not only about helping our country get through the immediate challenges of coronavirus they are also about the recovery business has a crucial role to play in helping to rebuild britain over the medium to long term there are three ways that we believe businesses can have an immediate and longlasting impact 1 employees businesses can join the national effort by developing action plans to support their own staff throughout and beyond this challenging time for example this could include practical support and advice on financial security mental health personal wellbeing as well as reintegration back into work for those who have experienced an extended period away from the workplace for example severn trent water have put clear action plans in place to protect their staff when making home visits and are prioritising vulnerable customers more immediately it should include disseminating the latest nhs covid19 advice 2 customers businesses can join the national effort by publishing clear and simple advice for customers where possible they should have specialist teams dedicated to supporting customers if they are having problems such as those facing repayment difficulties and vulnerable customers as rbs has done this could include prioritising those customers who are isolated and vulnerable ensuring they do not become disconnected and can easily access services for example through priority helplines and dedicated support others may wish to consider waiving some fees for customers and suppliers who may experience financial difficulties as a result of the coronavirus 3 community businesses can join the national effort by committing to help britain through the coronavirus epidemic over the coming months we are likely to see a sharp increase in isolation loneliness mental health and household financial issues in our communities across the country there will be an increased need for communities to come together with practical support such as food deliveries collections and financial assistance for organisations that specialise in supporting vulnerable people the way britains businesses work is changing so too will their relationship with the communities they serve bringing greater emphasis on grassroots community action this could also include support for community projects where they operate as national wealth management firm true potential based in the north east is doing by providing assistance to local hospices and charities that support the elderly and vulnerable the c19 business pledge is driven by the social mobility pledge  a campaign for businesses to be a force for good by delivering a level playing field on opportunity and boosting social mobility in the uk the social mobility pledge is a growing coalition of over 500 organisations 450 businesses employing almost 4 million people across the uk as well as over 50 uk universities representing over 1 million students contact email protected share most read
