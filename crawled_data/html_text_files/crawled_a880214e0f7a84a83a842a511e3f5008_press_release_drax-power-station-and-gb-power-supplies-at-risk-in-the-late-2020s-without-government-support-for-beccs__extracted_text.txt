renewable energy company drax group has shown that in the late 2020s biomass generation could play an increasingly critical role in ensuring security of uk energy supply 21 march 2023 new research highlights the critical contribution that biomass could play in late 2020s as coal plants and nuclear fleet close down drax pauses uk beccs investment in 2023 as it awaits clarity of governments commitment to its project without government support for beccs drax power station could become unviable in 2027 baringas research shows that by 2027 peak demand for gb electricity will increase by 4gw but at the same time the imminent closure of coal older gas generation and nuclear power stations will remove up to 63gw of secure capacity from the grid this will mean that the dispatchable capacity which supports gb energy security will fall from 93 to 85 at times of peak demand increasing the risk of a supply shortfall the system will need to rely on other forms of capacity such as electricity interconnectors and intermittent renewable generation like wind or solar to make up the 15 difference at times of peak demand or steps may need to be taken to reduce consumption such as through voluntary demand reduction or forced turndown draxs power station in yorkshire is currently the largest provider of dispatchable power to the gb electricity system as well as being one of the only renewable sources of secure supply its renewable biomass generation provides 26gw of electricity supplying millions of homes and businesses with dispatchable reliable power whilst drax welcomed the governments support for ccs in the recent budget it needs its beccs project to gain track 1 status without which drax power station may become unviable and unable to contribute secure power at a time of such critical need until it receives this clarity drax has taken the decision to pause its multimillionpound investment programme into the beccs project at drax power station at times with the tightest margins draxs biomass units provide up to 11 of total gb electricity generation and up to 70 of the renewable generation the loss of draxs and other biomass units from the gb electricity system would further reduce the countrys dispatchable capacity to 80 of peak demand from the already forecasted fall to 85 increasing reliance on gas and power imports generation from intermittent renewables and increasing costs for consumers drax ceo will gardiner said whilst we welcome the governments ambition to invest billions in carbon capture and storage we need a firm commitment to beccs before we commit to investing 2bn into installing this technology at drax power station until we have this clarity we are pausing our multimillion pound investment programme in the uk beccs project and urge government to use the planned announcement at the end of the month to outline their support for this any further delays to this project could impact the uks security of supply net zero and levellingup ambitions and the viability of drax power station the research also found that by 2027 no established technology can feasibly replace the security of supply provided by draxs 26gw of biomass capacity without significantly increasing carbon emissions and relying more on imported fossil fuel from europe it goes on to state that meeting decarbonisation targets without the carbon removals provided by draxs beccs units will be more expensive and difficult and would require accelerating decarbonisation in challenging sectors such as heating industry and road transport the report concludes that it is more cost effective and lower risk to keep existing biomass open than to build additional new build or retrofit gas ccs capacity ends media contacts chris mostyn head of media

announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 19 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers in europe and asia customers
