compressed wood pellet supply chains matthew rivers career is one built around a common theme wood matthew rivers director of corporate affairs drax group special advisor 6 october 2016 opinion it was a forestry catastrophe that first inspired matthew rivers interest in forests dutch elm trees an iconic part of the uk landscape for over 250 years were becoming infected with a fatal and fastspreading disease the race was on to save them a schoolboy in north london at the time rivers joined the after curricular school team tasked with saving its trees  first by injecting them with insecticide and when that didnt work by felling and replanting them it was an early foundation in how forests work and the challenges of keeping them healthy decades later rivers is director of corporate affairs at drax its a role he finds himself in following a career as a forester helping to manage forestry businesses and supporting the setting up of wood product manufacturing plants his own estimation of his working life is a humble one however i think im probably a failed farmer he says a forester always plants in hope rivers studied forestry at university in scotland before taking up jobs in the forestry industry across the uk uruguay and finland working in this industry he says is one that requires patience in the uk were talking about 30 or 40year growth cycles the trees i planted at the start of my career are only just coming to maturity now he explains but more than the long investment of time being a forester relies on faith a forester always plants in hope he says when a forester plants a tree he or she most commonly does not know who the end customer will be so when the call came from drax for a forestry expert to help guide the company through an important transformation  upgrading the power station from coal to biomass  the challenge was one he was ready to take drax already had ambitions of converting three boilers to run on biomass that would mean consuming tonnes of compressed wood pellets he says the business needed a supply and rivers was drafted in to set this up as part of the supply solution and chaired by rivers drax set up drax biomass  a pellet manufacturing business in the usa that makes and supplies compressed wood pellets to drax power station  setting up its own manufacturing plant not only means drax needs to rely on fewer external suppliers but also that it can use the learnings about the technologies the economics and the sourcing of the process to continually hone its supply chain to operate responsibly and receive governmental support drax has to be sustainable and this is particularly important when it comes to where and how it sources its fuel this comes with its own challenges no universal definition of sustainability to my understanding there is no universal definition of sustainability says rivers so how do you proof your business for an unclear entity at its heart sustainability is about not doing anything today that would prejudice doing the same thing for the next generation or generations to come a responsibly managed forest is one that is as healthy productive diverse and useful in 100 or 500 years time as it is today they key to this is to think of forests as a whole rivers explains think about a single tree  you fell it and use it to heat your home over one winter but its going to take perhaps 30 years for that tree to grow back he says what do you do for the next 30 years in a sustainably managed forest you have all different ages of tree represented  one thirtieth devoted to each age and when you use an older tree to warm you in winter you plant a replacement that way for every year youll have trees reaching maturity ready to provide your power its a cycle that if managed responsibly keeps delivering a useful resource as well as maintaining the health of the forest rivers continues sustainability is the very nature of what a forester does because if we dont take care of our forests and ensure we have a crop to harvest year after year we lose our livelihood becoming a private forester two decades ago rivers completed a loop he started decades ago amidst the dutch elm crisis and became a forest owner himself in scotland he bought and now manages his own private forest weve had kids birthday parties weve dug out a pond we harvest chanterelles in the autumn  theres a millennium capsule buried somewhere he says its not only a family heirloom its a place for him to exercise a passion  maintaining and managing a responsible and healthy forest share related
