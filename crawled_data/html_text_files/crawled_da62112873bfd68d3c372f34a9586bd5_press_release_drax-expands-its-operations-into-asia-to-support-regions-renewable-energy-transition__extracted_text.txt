to increase sustainable biomass sales to support energy security and decarbonisation in asia 14 july 2022 to celebrate the launch of drax asia and the opening of a new drax office in japan more than 160 guests including government officials major trading houses energy businesses and shipping companies attended a reception at the british ambassadors residence in tokyo at the reception british

capacity to 8 million tonnes a year by 2030 from 5 million tonnes a year currently supporting global efforts to displace fossil fuels and decarbonise energy systems as a supplier of sustainable biomass pellets to customers in asia and europe and with more than a decade of experience in converting the uks biggest coalfired power station to use sustainable biomass drax is uniquely placed to support japan as it further decarbonises its economy and energy system the britishheadquartered company is also pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs an essential carbon removals technology which provides renewable energy while also permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere drax groups managing director for asia yasuhisa okamoto who is based in tokyo and will oversee the companys ambitious plans for growth in japan and the region said drax group managing director for asia yasuhisa okamoto draxs unrivalled expertise across the entire biomass value chain  from sustainable fibre sourcing pellet manufacturing supply chain management biomass power generation and beccs  can support japans climate targets accelerating the move away from coal and enabling investment in clean energy technologies we look forward to continuing our partnership with japanese companies supporting them as they decarbonise their businesses using sustainable biomass draxs conversion of its uk power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal is europes largest decarbonisation project reducing fossil fuel emissions from draxs power generation by over 95 since 2012 the day after the reception in tokyo a team of drax executives visited a standalone biomass power plant that drax supplies with biomass drax executives british ambassador and embassy official at

role in achieving draxs target to double biomass sales by 2030 draxs use of sustainable biomass is paving the way for its plans to deploy beccs globally beccs is the only negative emissions technology that can permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while also continuing to generate the reliable renewable electricity needed in a decarbonising economy by the end of this decade drax could be permanently removing 12 million tonnes of co2 from the atmosphere each year while also delivering the renewable power required to transition off fossil fuels drax has 17 sustainable biomass pellet plants and developments in the us and canada with capacity of 5 million tonnes and access to four ports in north america drax plans to increase its pellet production capacity to 8 million tonnes by 2030 to help meet its own requirements as well as its customers needs in asia and europe amid an expected increase in global demand for the lowcarbon fuel drax aims to increase pellet sales to 4 million tonnes by 2030 drax power station supplies 12 of the uks renewable electricity keeping the lights on for millions of uk homes and businesses the uns ipcc the worlds leading sciencebased climate authority says that sustainable biomass and negative emissions from beccs are crucial to meet net zero draxs world leading sustainability policy guarantees the biomass used at drax power station meets the highest sustainability standards and is only sourced from sustainably managed forests that are stable or growing about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4 million tonnes of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 17 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year drax is targeting 8 million tonnes of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3 million tonnes of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers
