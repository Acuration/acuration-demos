energy policy maintaining electricity grid stability during rapid decarbonisation 13 november 2019 power generation great britains electricity system is in the middle of a revolution where power supply was once dominated by some big thermal coal gas and nuclear power stations  it now comes from an array of sources thousands of new individual points have been added to the mix ranging from large interconnectors that bring in power from neighbouring countries through to wind farms solar panels small gas and diesel engines the energy mix has been changing radically with low carbon sources expected to provide 58 of great britains power by 2020  up from 22 in 2010 and 53 in 2018  however the security standards at which the electricity grid needs to be operated remain the same these are predominantly voltage and frequency and nominally 230 v and 50hz for a domestic consumer the operation of the transmission system including maintaining these standards is overseen by the national grid electricity system operator eso using a set of vital tools it needs to have available known as ancillary services some of this capability was inherent in large generators which could provide the ancillary services required to keep a stable transmission system maintaining system stability with thousands of generation points  a large part of which are not directly controllable  is increasingly challenging click graphic to viewdownload ancillary services enable electricity to reach the end customer when and where it is required in a safe manner within acceptable quality standards in addition to managing voltage and frequency levels these standards also include maintaining adequate reserves to accommodate demand forecast uncertainties generator breakdown and system faults 1 as the electricity mix changes so must the process by which these services are secured a diverse set of existing and genuinely new solutions will be needed to keep the lights on in the net zero carbon future three steps to creating the right environment for a stable resilient future grid 1 make the value of ancillary services transparent in order for companies to help the eso be they generators or other service providers it must be open and transparent about whats needed to maintain grid stability and build resilience for the future the eso is the only buyer in the ancillary services market and is wellpositioned to understand how the system is evolving it should be proactively flagging how its needs may evolve in the future so that the market can develop solutions to meet them says marcelo torres draxs regulation manager  markets certain ancillary services still dont have their own competitive markets and are provided as a byproduct of the generation of electricity an example is reactive power  for which there are no developed functioning regional markets yet generally all power stations connected to the transmission network with a generation capacity of over 50mw are required to have the capability to provide this service at a default price that may not reflect its real value to the system another example is inertia  provided today largely through the heavy spinning turbines of thermal and pumpedstorage hydro stations which serve as stored energy that can slow down or smooth out sudden changes in network frequency if ancillary services were valued explicitly market participants would have an insight into how much they are actually worth to the eso and the grids stability which would in turn incentivise new competitive products to reach the market torres points to technologies such as synchronous compensators  which are machines capable of providing ancillary services including inertia and reactive power without generating potentially unneeded electricity click graphic to viewdownload these solutions will enable more renewables to connect safely to the network at a lower cost to consumers for these solutions to come forward ascribing the right value to ancillary services will be key without clear price signals there is a risk of underinvestment in those technologies that provide the services needed potentially resulting in price shocks for consumers the eso is moving in the right direction with its recent network development pathfinder projects it has accelerated this work launching its first ever tender for inertia and should roll out similar initiatives gbwide such procurements should align with existing investment signals such as those provided by the capacity market  this should allow for the right type of capacity to be built where it is most needed delivering a secure and resilient grid 2 create market confidence constructing the machinery and infrastructure that will enable the eso to operate a carbonfree system will require major financial investment as well as years to plan and build says torres this can only be achieved if ofgem designs the esos incentives in a way that rewards it for taking bold strategic initiatives that have the potential to deliver good value for money to consumers in the longterm evidence of this working is shown in the success of offshore wind which now provide around a sixth of great britains electricity at record low prices this is partly due to the government providing offshore wind developers with revenue stabilisation mechanisms known as  contracts for difference  cfds this is not a new concept for government and regulators around the world looking to enable investment in energy infrastructure financing renewables to achieve decarbonisation is enabled through cfds or marketled hedging tools like power purchase agreements  investment to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet peak demand is secured through longterm contracts competitively awarded through the capacity market similarly investment in interconnection is supported through ofgems cap  floor regime subsidy isnt required for investment in ancillary services whats needed says torres is a clear and stable market framework designed around the systems needs which provides a mix of short and longterm signals more certainty over the market landscape and the expected returns will lower the risk of these investments and get the solutions needed at a lower overall cost to consumers longterm procurement is not the right answer everywhere where there is already a mature and liquid market such as the case for frequency response buying services closer to real time makes sense for two reasons first it allows prices to reflect more accurately the market conditions and therefore the real value of a service at the time when it is needed second it allows a wider range of resources to participate in the market increasing competition striking the right balance between short and longterm procurement is key to create a sustainable ancillary services market currently the eso requests that electricitygeneration firms commit to supplying a certain amount of power for the purpose of frequency response a month ahead of time for resources such as wind farms or solar which are dependent on the weather this makes it extremely difficult for them to enter this market even for conventional large thermal generators it can be a problem as many of them do not know how or if they will be running beyond a few days the eso is currently conducting some trials procuring frequency response one week in advance while this is an improvement it is still too long a lead time for intermittent sources or demandside response which ideally need dayahead or almost real time auctions to unlock their full potential says torres the ancillary services market has been through a prolonged period of change since the eso published its system needs and product strategy in 2017  without knowing how the market landscape will look like by the end of these reforms its difficult for providers to develop the right solutions a shift in thinking which considers what the electricity network might require in the future  and how to provide the market with financial incentives to make it a reality is needed a resilient stable future system is to the advantage of consumers 3 diversify there will be no silver bullet that can solve all the challenges the energy transition poses maintaining system reliability in a high renewables world will require large amounts of dispatchable power with different response time and duration from small batteries and demandside response that will manage instantaneously frequency fluctuations  through to large pumped storage hydro plants that will provide backup power during the days when the wind wont blow and the sun wont shine a framework structured around the systems different needs should aim at harnessing flexibility across a range of technologies and sizes source the road to 2050 the need for flexibility in a high renewables world  by ana barillas aurora 2019 truly diversifying will also involve unlocking the flexibility potential on the distribution grid to achieve this the way that access to the distribution network is managed and paid for will need to evolve today with big parts of the distribution network being congested small flexible assets are asked to wait in the queue for several years or face disproportionate amount of network reinforcement costs to get connected machine hall cruachan power station the ongoing review of the network access and forwardlooking charging arrangements needs to address these barriers soon if we are serious about making use of flexibility to foster the energy transition while keeping consumer bills as low as possible since 2018 gbs distribution network operators dnos have been tendering and procuring for various flexibility services to manage congestion in regional electricity grids in 2019 they published a roadmap setting out the steps they intend to take to enable a smarter and more flexible energy system as we transition from dnos towards distribution system operation  a wider set of functions and services to run a smart distribution grid  the regional networks will be open to marketbased flexibility solutions dsos will be able to compete on a level playing field offering options for network reinforcement as dnos move from trials to more structured flexibility procurement harmonisation and effective coordination with the national markets will be the key prerequisites to reveal the true value that flexibility can bring to the energy system argues torres to build a modern and resilient grid we will need a wider lens

budget we are writing to you to urge you to maintain the uks robust approach on carbon pricing the prolonged uncertainty regarding the uks carbon pricing future as it exits the eu reiterates the need for the upcoming budget  at whatever final date is chosen  to provide some muchneeded certainty in a potentially turbulent period for businesses across the uk with its approach to carbon pricing the powering past coal alliance and its net zero commitment the uk has been a leader in global efforts to meet the ambition of the paris agreement by phasing out coal as well as incentivising low carbon energy development and helping drive cost reductions this leadership should continue at the first net zero budget as outlined by the committee on climate change in its recent advice to the uk government on its carbon pricing future 1  reaching net zero will require a strong and rising carbon price in order to induce changes to both shortterm behaviour and longerterm investment decisions importantly in the run up to cop26 in glasgow in november 2020 it is important that the uk continues its global leadership and is not perceived to waver on its commitment to tackling climate change given the uncertainty over the uks exit from the eu there is little clarity on what the carbon pricing mechanism will be in the near term and this is already impacting on the forward pricing of carbon in electricity markets therefore providing certainty and stability is crucial when the government sets the carbon price support cps rate for april 2021 and beyond any reduction in cps rates made in isolation of wider clarity on the uks carbon pricing arrangements post eu exit risks sending a negative signal to low carbon investors and undermining the continuing need for a strong and rising carbon price in addition to the considerations on the cps the carbon emissions tax cet  that will replace the eu ets in the event that the uk leaves the eu without a deal  will need to be set out for 2020 as soon as possible to minimise the potential divergence between the cet and the eu ets over 2020 it is vital that the cet is set a level for 2020 that is comparable with recent eu ets pricing we look forward to measures to help the uk meet its leading ambitions at the first net zero budget including certainty and stability on the cps further clarity on the uks carbon pricing future following

electric cars and electric vans holds great potential  not just for the transport industrys overall carbon footprint but for the populations of heavily congested polluted cities and even individual drivers looking for more efficient fuel costs that future is approaching fast by 2040 or even as soon as 2035 no new cars or vans sold in the uk can be solely powered by diesel or petrol while this is a positive step it brings with it a shift in the way drivers will need to manage the way they plan journeys and more importantly refuel for years drivers have relied on a quick and plentiful supply of fuel at petrol stations but an ev doesnt charge as quickly as a conventional car nor are fast charging points widespread  at least not right now the change will be considerable but it wont necessarily take shape in a single form here we look at four things that will become increasingly influential in how drivers recharge their evs over the coming years smart charging and timeofuse tariffs electricity costs more to produce and supply at certain times of the day this wholesale price depends on the demand for power weather conditions and the costs of different generation technologies and fuels for example electricity is often more expensive in the evenings when people are coming home from work and turning on lights tvs ovens and plugging in devices just a few hours later it rapidly drops in price as homes and offices turn off lights and appliances but the power system is changing  the price of electricity is increasingly driven by less predictable factors such as the weather on windy and sunny days wind and solar generation can drive down the cost of producing power on calm and cloudy days the costs of electricity can increase while this in theory makes it sensible to wait for a cheap period of time to plug in and charge an electric vehicle ev in practice people are unlikely to spend the time sit refreshing websites which display the price of electricity in real time to get the best value instead the use of smart charging technology can play a big role to capitalise on fluctuations in prices smart charging technology will be able to monitor things like electricity prices and even electricity usage across an entire site for example across a business where many devices are using electricity and automate the charging process to make use of the best prices and limit overall electricity use rather than needing someone to recharge evs at one oclock in the morning this means people or businesses can plug in at times convenient to them and set their vehicles to charge at the cheapest times and have an appropriate amount of charge to carry out tasks when they need to by shifting power usage into cheaper periods youre saving money and you can be more sympathetic to supply and demand limits on a company explains adam hall who leads draxs ev proposition if i know my battery will be fully charged by nine in the morning do i care if it charges immediately or delays it and saves me a few pounds for business fleet owners who manage large numbers of electric vehicles the difference this can make is even larger he adds vehicletogrid v2g technology each ev has a battery in it that powers the vehicles motor but what if the electricity stored in that battery could also be harnessed to deliver electricity back to grid and what if that concept could be used to collect a small portion of power from every idle ev in the country and use it to plug gaps in the electricity system there are over 30 million cars on uk roads national grid predicts by 2050 99 of those vehicles will be powered by electricity  explains hall the majority of cars remain idle for 95 of any day thats a huge amount of storage potential that could be used to balance the grid at key times  its a battery network that assets around the country will be able to use this concept is whats called vehicle to grid technology v2g and while it holds great potential its still some way from becoming a mainstream source of reserve power right now the technology is costly and limited  only chademo charging systems as found on japanese models actually support bidirectional charging nevertheless hall remains optimistic of its future role in the energy system particularly as this technology will be hugely important in managing future grid constraints the cost of bidirectional hardware is coming down all the time he says at the moment there arent enough vehicles we dont have the scale to do it but i fully believe it will change quite dramatically for domestic users the benefit will be less immediate than it will be for entire countries for business fleet managers allowing the grid to take some power from their idle vehicles could lead to financial compensation or other advantages for offering grid support the out of sight out of mind approach third party management schemes more suited for businesses managing whole fleets of vehicles employing a third party to manage the charging of vehicles allows for the delegation of a potentially costly and timeconsuming task adam hall drax ev proposition lead with draxs electric vehicle fleet service effectively the customer knows theyll get the vehicles with the amount of charge they want when they need it says hall that might be for the cheapest price or as fast as possible it means the customer doesnt have to think they just get their charged vehicle in the optimum way for their needs third party providers could also open up new charging businesses models such as flat monthly rates for unlimited vehicle charging or allrenewable services by taking the technical aspects of running a fleet out of businesses hands third parties could even serve to lower the barrier to ev adoption mandatory managed charging its difficult to accurately know how much demand electric vehicles will place on the electricity system  some estimates see demand growing in great britain as much as 22 by 2050 as a result of evs while the constant development of battery and charging technology will likely mean this prediction will come down there are some theories as to how the country will need to deal with this rapid growth one of these is to actually turn down the electricity surging through charging points at certain points to prevent widespread blackouts the idea is there to protect the grid explains hall when local distribution networks have a lot of demand they may need to turn charge points down he adds there will likely be exemptions for emergency services however hall is sceptical mandatory managed charging would ever really come into play for the damage it would do to consumer attitudes to evs the idea also taps into wider scaremongering around evs and quite how much they will push up electricity demand instead what will really need to shift for a future of efficiently charged vehicles is a mindset shift theres a psychological element to it he suggests everyone goes through some range anxiety at first but soon realises the technology is sound as battery technology continues to improve vehicles evolve to go further on a single charge and networks of superfast charge points expand transitioning to electric vehicles will become easier and more economical for businesses than continuing to depend on fossil fuel i personally believe once electric vehicles are doing 300 miles on a single charge the requirement for onroute charging will be pretty low says hall not many people drive 300 miles need to recharge at a service station and then drive anther 300 in one fell swoop its much more important to have good charging installations at work and at home there are many ways in which evs will change the way the world drives from how we charge them to how and where we travel we can be certain this will mean a shift in mindsets and our approach to transport  what remains uncertain is just how quickly and widespread that shift will be tags energy policy  transport  decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs climate change is the biggest challenge of our time will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 28 july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing tags investors  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  about us  biomass energy  sustainability  energy policy  careers  gas laying down the pathway to carbon capture in a net zero uk will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 17 july 2019 opinion the starting gun has fired and the challenge is underway the government has officially set 2050 as the target year in which the uk will achieve carbon neutrality  theres no denying this economywide transformation will need a great deal of investment reaching net zero carbon emissions will require an evolutionary overhaul of not just great britains electricity system but the uk economy as a whole and indeed the way we live our lives and go about our business but that doesnt mean its out of reach instead it will fall to technologies such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus as well as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to make it economical and possible the secret to making decarbonisation affordable the uks committee on climate change ccc estimates the price of decarbonisation will cost as little as 1 of forecast gdp per annum in 2050 however the business energy and industrial strategy beis select committee inquiry found that failure to deploy ccus and beccs technology could double the cost to 2 there are a number of reasons for this such as the cost to jobs productivity and living standards of shutting down industrial emitters ccuss ability to contribute to a hydrogen economy can help avoid this moreover the ccc claims even with industries striving to decarbonise rapidly as much as 100 megatonnes of hardtoabate carbon dioxide co 2  is expected to remain in the uk economy by 2050 this makes carbon negative techniques and technologies  such as beccs  which uses woody biomass that has absorbed carbon in its lifetime as forests  alongside direct air capture dac the boosting of ocean plant productivity much greater tree planting and better sequestration of carbon in soil essential if the uk is to attain true carbon neutrality the importance of beccs and ccus in the zero carbon future is clear now is the time for rapid development not in 2030 not in 2040 but today in 2019 and into the 2020s but doing this requires the government to move beyond its historic policies that have failed to support the technology in the past progress needs longterm frameworks that provide private sector investors with the certainty they need to kickstart the commercialscale deployment of ccus technologies laying down the tracks to negative emissions for carbon capture to become an integrated part of the energy system it must deliver value well beyond the energy sector establishing markets for products developed from captured carbon will play a role here but to set the wheels in motion financial frameworks are needed that can allow beccs and ccus to thrive one device that can allow the market to develop ccus is the creation of contracts for difference cfds for carbon capture these currently exist in the lowcarbon generation space between generators and the governmentowned low carbon contracts company  lccc  through these contracts power generators are paid the difference between their cost of generating low carbon electricity known as a strike price and the price of electricity in great britains wholesale power market if the power price in the market is higher than the strike price generators pay the difference back to the lccc meaning consumers are protected from price spikes too it means that the generator is protected from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power offering the security to invest in new technology more than this cfds last many years meaning they transcend political cycles and the cost per megawatt can be reduced with a longer contract creating a market for carbon capture or negative emissions generation could offer the same security to generators to invest in the technology a cfd for beccs should not only incentivise the building of infrastructure to capture carbon but we must also recognise the valuable role that negative emissions can play by compensating beccs producers for their negative emissions it should provide a lower cost alternative to reducing all other co2 emissions to zero while still ensuring that the uk can get to net zero beyond installing carbon capture at existing generation sites one of the major financial barriers to the wider deployment of ccus and beccs is the cost and liability associated with transporting and storing captured carbon a regulated asset base rab funding model would encourage investment by gradually recovering the costs of transport and storage via a regulated return this approach is currently under consideration as a means of financing other major infrastructure projects  a rab allows businesses including investment and pension funds to invest in projects under the oversight of a government regulator in exchange for their commitment investors can collect a fee through regular consumer and nondomestic bills led by industry guided by government ultimately the current carbon trading system is based around charging polluters but as we approach a postcoal uk and in order to achieve net zero its necessary for this to evolve  from economically disincentivising emissions to incentivising carbonnegative power generation however with the cost of carbon capture and negative emissions differing between types of industries and technologies theres a requirement to consider differentiated carbon prices to guide industry through longterm strategy but the need for carbon capture development is too pressing for us as an industry to wait at drax power station our beccs pilot is just the beginning of our wider ambitions to become the first negative emissions power station our use of biomass already makes drax power station the largest generator of renewable electricity in great britain the responsiblymanaged working forests our suppliers source from absorbed carbon from the atmosphere as they grew so adding carbon capture at scale to this supply chain can turn our operation from low carbon to carbonneutral and eventually carbon negative and we have bigger plans still to create a net zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region  in partnership with equinor and national grid the cluster would deliver carbon capture at the scale needed to not just decarbonise the most carbonintensive industrial region in the uk but to put the country at the forefront of the decarbonisation of industry and manufacturing government action is needed to make ccus and beccs economically sustainable at scale as an integrated part of our energy system however the onus is on us the energy industry to lead development and act as trusted partners that can deliver the decarbonisation needed to reach net zero carbon by 2050 learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere from capture methods to storage and use across three continents

great britains electricity to zerocarbon emissions 15 may 2019 power generation demand for electricity might have been 6 lower in the first three months of 2019 than in last years first quarter but the demand for lower carbon power is only growing and theres more pressure than ever for global industries to decarbonise more rapidly aided by a significantly milder winter than last year  great britains electricity sector continued to make further progress in reducing carbon emissions in the first quarter q1 of 2019 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity was almost 20 lower in q1 2019 than in the same period last year this was driven by a significant decrease in coal usage with 581 coalfree hours in total over the period  eight times more than in q1 2018 this trend has only increased with may seeing the countrys first coalfree week in modern times the findings come from electric insights  a report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london that analyses great britains electricity consumption and looks at what the future might hold as public commercial and political demand for lower carbon emissions mounts the question for the power system is can it truly reach zeroemissions keeping a zerocarbon system stable quarter after quarter the carbon intensity of great britains electricity system has declined from 545 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatt hour gkwh in q1 2012 to just over 200 gkwh last quarter for a single hour carbon emissions have fallen as low as just 56 gkwh but how soon can that figure reach all the way down to netzero carbon emissions the national grids electricity system operator eso believes it could be as soon as 2025  but some serious changes are needed to make it possible for the system to operate safely and efficiently when you have fewer sources offering balancing services like reserve power inertia frequency response and voltage control  the national grid eso believes an approach that establishes a marketplace for trading services holds the solution the hope is that competition will breed new innovation and bring new technologies such as gridscale storage and ai into the commercial energy markets offering reserve power and more accurate forecasting for solar and wind power for the meantime weatherdependent technologies are a key source of renewable electricity in great britain with wind making up more than 20 of all generation in q1 2019 however with wind capacity only expected to increase how should the system react when its not an option read the full article coauthored by julian leslie head of national control national grid eso how low can we go we cannot control the weather  but we can harness its power today there are around 20 gigawatts gw of wind capacity installed around great britain and this is forecast to double to 40 gw in the next seven years however average wind output can fluctuate between 2 gw one day and 12 gw the next  as happened twice in january it highlights the ongoing needs for flexibility and diversity of sources in the electricity system even as it decarbonises there are a number of ways to make up for shortfalls in wind generation the most obvious of which is through other existing sources there is more solar installed around the county than any source of generation except gas at 129 gw and sun power helped meet demand during a wind drought last summer  solar averaged 13 gw over the last 12 months this is more than coal which accounted for 11 gw however storage will also be important in delivering low or zerocarbon sources of electricity when there is neither wind nor sufficient sunlight at present this includes pumped storage and some battery technologies but in future will include greater use of gridscale lithiumion batteries as well as vehicletogrid systems that can take advantage of power stored in idle electric cars httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 new fuels particularly hydrogen also have the potential to meet demand and help create a wider lowercarbon economy for heating  as well as vehicle fuel with water as the only emission hydrogen can be produced from natural gas or using excess electricity from renewable sources or through carbon capture from industrial emissions  it can then be stored for a long time and at scale before being used to generate electricity rapidly when needed another increasingly important source of great britains electricity is interconnectors however they are not yet being used in a way that can support gaps in the electricity system with northern european countries normally all experiencing the same weather  and wind levels  at the same time read the full article what to do when the wind doesnt blow a bigger future for interconnection great britain added a new power source to its electricity system in q1 2019 in the form of belgium the opening of the 600 million nemo link between kent and zeebrugge added another 1 gw of interconnection capacity it joins connections to france the netherlands northern ireland and the republic of ireland to bring great britains total interconnection capacity to 5 gw these links accounted for 79 of the 78 terawatt hours twh of electricity consumed over the quarter electricity from imports also set new records for a daily average of 43 gw on 24 february  accounting for 129 of total consumption and a monthly average in march when it made up 106 of consumption  these records represent the first time great britain fell below 90 for electricity selfsufficiency with 34 gw of new interconnectors under construction coming online by 2022 and 91 gw more planned to be completed over the next five years great britains neighbours are set to play a growing role in the countrys electricity mix however while interconnectors offer an often costeffective way for great britain to ensure electricity supply meets demand the carbon intensity of neighbouring countries electricity should also be considered read the full article 10 of electricity now generated abroad the need for crossborder decarbonisation the new link to belgium has imported rather than exported electricity every day since it began operations as belgium has the lowest natural gas prices in europe and its power stations pay 16 per tonne less for carbon emissions than their british counterparts this makes it cheaper to import and less carbon intense than electricity from the more coaldependant netherlands and ireland planned links to germany and denmark could allow great britain to import more renewable power however if there is a wind drought across northern europe these countries often turn to their emissionsheavy coal or even dirtier lignite sources france is currently great britains cleanest source of imports mostly using nuclear and renewable generation however when the north sea link opens in 2021 it will give great britain access to norways abundance of hydropower to plug gaps in renewable generation considering the carbon intensity of great britains imports is important because the decarbonisation needed to address the global climate change emergency cant be solved by one country alone for electricity emissions to go as low as they can it takes collaboration that goes across borders read the full article where do britains imports come from explore the quarters data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk  read the full report  commissioned by drax electric

policy  electric insights  investors  decarbonisation  flexibility and stability and power system security  electricity system balancing and ancillary services can great britain keep breaking renewable records 15 february 2019 power generation how low carbon can britains electricity go as low as zero carbon still seems a long way off but every year records continue to be broken for all types of renewable electricity 2018 was no different over the full 12month period 53 of all britains electricity was produced from low carbon sources which includes both renewable and nuclear generation up from 50 in 2017 the increase in low carbon shoved fossil fuel generation down to just 47 of the countrys overall mix the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report found electricitys average carbon intensity fell 8 to 217 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatthour of electricity generated gkwh and while this continues an ongoing decline that keeps the country on track to meet the committee on climate changes target of 100 gkwh by 2030 it was however the slowest rate of decline since 2013 it also highlights that while britain can continue to decarbonise in 2019 the challenges of the years ahead will make it tougher to continue to break the records it has over the past few years httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201902drax_record_highs_and_lowsv03mp4 the highs and lows of 2018 last year every type of renewable record that could be broken was broken wind solar and biomass all set new 10year highs for respective annual monthly and daily generation as well as records for instantaneous output generation over a halfhour period and share of the electricity mix the result was a new instantaneous generation high of 21 gigawatts gw for renewables 58 of total output wind had a particularly good year of renewable recordsetting it broke the 15 gw barrier for instantaneous output for the first time and accounted for 48 of total generation during a half hour period at 5am on 18 december  overall low carbon generation which takes into account renewables and nuclear both that generated in britain and imported from french reactors had an equally recordbreaking year with an average of almost 18 gw across the full year and a new record for instantaneous output of 30 gw at 1pm on 14 june  nearly 90 of total generation over the half hour period while low carbon and individual renewable electricity sources hit record highs there were also some milestone lows coal accounted for an average of just 5 of electricity output over the year hitting a record low in june when it made up just 1 of that months total generation fossil fuel output overall had a similarly significant decline hitting a decadelow of 15 gw on average for 2018  44 of total generation over the year one fossil fuel that bucked the trend however was gas which hit an alltime output of 27 gw for instantaneous generation on the night of 26 january there was low wind on that day last year plus much of the nuclear fleet was out of action for reactor maintenance in one case with seaweed clogging a cooling system  this was all aided by an ongoing decline in overall demand as ever smarter and more efficient devices helped the country reach the decades lowest annual average demand of 335 gw more impressive when considering how much the countrys electricity system has changed over the last decade however is the record low demand net of wind and solar only 99 gw was needed from other energy technologies at 4am on 14 june  how the generation mix has changed the most remarkable change in britains electricity mix has been how far out of favour coal has fallen from its position as the primary source from 2012 to 2014 in the space of four years it has crashed down to sixth in the mix with nuclear wind imports biomass and gas all playing bigger roles in the system this sudden decline in 2015 was the result of the carbon price nearly doubling from 954 to 1808 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  in april making profitable coal power stations lossmaking overnight  with coal continuing to crash out of the mix biomass has become the mostused solid fuel in britains electricity system interconnectors are also playing a more significant part in britains electricity mix since their introduction to the capacity market in 2015  thanks to increased interconnection to europe britain is now a net importer of electricity with 22 twh brought in from europe in 2018  nine times more than it exported while more of britains electricity comes from underwater power lines less of it is being generated by water itself hydros decline from the fifth largest source of electricity to the eighth is the most noticeable shift outside coals slide new largescale hydro installations are expensive and a secondary focus for the government compared with cheaper renewables hydros role in the electricity mix is also affected by drier hotter summers which means lower water levels for solar by contrast the warmer weather will see it play a bigger role and its expected to overtake coal in either 2019 or 2020 what is unlikely to change in the nearfuture however is the position at the top in 2018 gas generated 115 twh  more than nuclear and wind combined but this is just one constant in a future of multiple moving and uncertain parts 2019 a year of unpredictability britain is on course to leave the eu on 29 march the effects this will have on the electricity system are still unknown but one influential factor could be britains exit from the emissions trading scheme ets the euwide market which sets prices of carbon emitted by generators this may mean that rather than paying a carbon price on top of the ets as is currently the case britains generators will only have to pay the new fixed carbon tax of 16 per tonne the uk government says will come into play in april topped up by the carbon price support cps of 18tonne lower prices for carbon relative to the fluctuating ets  cps could make coal suddenly economically viable again the black stuff could potentially become cheaper than other power sources this aboutturn could cause the carbon intensity of electricity generation to bounce up again in one or more years between 2019 and 2025 the date all coal power units will have been decommissioned the knockon effect of lower carbon prices combined with fluctuations in the pound against the euro could see a reverse from imports to exports as britain pumps its cheap potentially coalgenerated electricity over to its european neighbours thats if the interconnectors can continue to function as efficiently as they do at present which some parties believe wont be the case if human traders have to replace the automatic trading systems currently in place sizewell b nuclear power station a reversal of importing to exporting could also reduce the amount of nuclear electricity coming into the country from france future nuclear generation in britain also looks in doubt with toshiba and hitachis decisions to shelve their respective plans for new nuclear reactors which could leave a 9 gw hole in the lowcarbon base capacity that nuclear normally provides renewables have the potential to fill the gap and become an even bigger part of the electricity system but this will require a push for new installations 2018 saw a 60 drop in new wind and solar installations and less than 2 gw of new renewable capacity came onto the system making it the slowest year for renewable growth since 2010 britains electricity has seen significant change over the last decade and 2018 once again saw the country take significant strides towards a low carbon future but challenges lie ahead records might be harder to break but it is important the momentum continues to move towards renewable sustainable electricity explore the quarters data in detail by
