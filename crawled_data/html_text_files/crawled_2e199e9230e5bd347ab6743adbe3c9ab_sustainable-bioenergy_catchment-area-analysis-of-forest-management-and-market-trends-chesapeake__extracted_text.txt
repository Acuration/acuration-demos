chesapeake catchment area analysis the drax forestry team reviews evidence suggesting the area supplying three enviva wood pellet plants is a dynamic and evolving forest landscape demonstrating strong growth in standing timber volume and an expansion of the forest area 21 may 2020 sustainable bioenergy increased timberland increased carbon stored in the forest robust prices and new markets benefiting forest owners and forest workers are among the findings of a report by hood consulting  this fourth in a series of catchment area analyses for drax looks at the area surrounding three pellet plants operated by enviva  ahoskie northampton and southampton enviva catchment area in virginia and north carolina forests and woodlands represent 68 of the total area at just over 54 million hectares ha with 87 of this area classified as timberland the area of timberland actively managed productive forest has increased by around 89000 ha since 2010 and there have been some significant changes in forest type  the overall area of forest has increased and there is no evidence of deforestation occurring land use by area since 2000 the total volume of standing timber in the catchment area has increased by 170 million cubic metres m 3  sixty five percent of this increase has occurred since 2012 indicating a growingmaturing forest resource and an expanding forest area most of the increase in volume has been in the sawtimber categories for both pine and hardwood although the hardwood pulpwood size class has also increased by nearly 10 million m 3 since 2012 following a small decline between 2000 and 2012 timber inventory by product category the increased demand from the three enviva pellet mills beginning operation in 2012 in the chesapeake region appears to have had no negative impact of the accumulation of forest carbon in the growing stock of the region since this time all categories of timber product have increased timber inventory by product category  pre and postenviva this increase in inventory is also reflected in the comparison of average annual growth to removals the surplus of uncut growth has increased substantially since 2010 from 47 million m 3 per year to 159 million m 3 pa over this period annual growth has increased by 355 whereas removals have decreased by 86 annual growth vs removals and surplus volume demand for timber products has fluctuated since 2000 the global financial crisis in 200809 impacted all product categories but particularly pine and hardwood sawtimber where there was a combined drop of over five million tonnes in 2010 compared to 2000 this was a loss of over 20 of total annual demand in the catchment area pine sawtimber has now recovered to precrisis levels but hardwood demand has remained low hardwood pulpwood demand also declined around this time with the closure and decline of existing pulp mills in the catchment area demand had fallen by one million tonnes pa by 2011 prior to the enviva pellet mills opening from 2012 the new biomass demand enabled the hardwood pulpwood market to recover to precrisis levels with demand in 2018 at almost exactly the same level as in 2000 annual demand by product category this fluctuation in demand is reflected in the average annual stumpage price data shown on the chart below this is the value that the forest owner gets for each product the trends are generally as expected with the exception of the hardwood sawtimber price which has increased substantially despite a decrease in demand this is due to supply chain issues reduced capacity of loggers and access to land average annual stumpage prices detailed below is an edited version of the consultants review and analysis of key issues in the catchment area the full version can be found in the main report is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows the opposite the total area of timberland in the enviva chesapeake catchment area has increased an estimated 82818 hectares 18 since enviva pellets ahoskie commenced full production in 2012 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no  inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area since 2012 but there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand has caused these changes conversion of hardwood and mixed pinehardwood timberland to planted pine timberland has occurred in the catchment area diversion from other markets no  inconclusive since 2012 pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has decreased 19 however this decrease is largely attributed to decreased demand from the pulppaper sector also demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs have increased an estimated 14 and 7 respectively since 2012 an unexpected increase in wood prices no  inconclusive the increase in hardwood biomass demand coincided with price increases of 1024 for delivered hardwood pulpwood these price increases were likely linked to a combination of both supply chain issues shortage of local loggers following pulppaper mill closures in the region and elevated prices offered by enviva to ensure guaranteed wood supply for the first several years of operation as prices for delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chips proceeded to decline 16 and 9 respectively from 2014 to2017 once the market stabilised since 2014 prices for pine products have held flat even though softwood raw material purchases demand by enviva have more than doubled in this catchment area changes in pine pulpwood and pine chip prices are largely driven by demand attributed to the pulppaper sector a reduction in growing stock timber no total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 19 from 2012 through 2018 over this period inventories increased as follows for each of the five major timber products 33 for pine sawtimber 23 for pine chipnsaw 14 for pine pulpwood 12 for hardwood sawtimber and 14 for hardwood pulpwood the increase in timber inventory can be linked to a combination of increased forest area additional hectares  additional inventory and annual harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment area forest ie annual growth has continued to exceed annual removals resulting in increased inventory levels a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock timber has increased slightly since 2012 increased timber growth ratescarbon sequestration rates can be linked to a combination of changes in species composition and silvicultural practices softwood pine grows at a much quicker rate compared to hardwood species and in the enviva chesapeake catchment area pine timberland area increased from 436 of total timberland area in 2011 to 460 in 2018 also improvements in silviculture have continued to enhance growth and overall productivity together these factors help explain how average per hectare volume growth increased from 59 m3 in 2011 to 77 m3 in 2018 an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no in 2018 the latest available growthtoremovals ratio for pine and hardwood pulpwood the timber products utilised by bioenergy equalled 249 and 276 respectively a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area what has been the impact of bioenergy demand on timber growing stock inventory neutral total wood demand increased an estimated 14 from 20122018 and much of that increase can be attributed to increased demand from bioenergy in this catchment area inventories are so substantial that increases in demand from bioenergy as well as from other sources have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth total growing stock inventory has continued to increase  an average of 29 per year since enviva first entered this market in 2012 timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have increased for pine sawtimber pine chipnsaw pine pulpwood and hardwood pulpwood since 2012 hardwood sawtimber growth rates have declined slightly evidence suggests these overall increases in growth rates are linked to changes in age class distribution ie a younger forest not due to changes in bioenergy demand forest area positive  neutral total forest timberland area in the catchment area increased nearly 83000 hectares 18 from 2012 through 2018 the latest available our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found a strong positive correlation between these two variables but also a moderately strong correlation between softwood sawlog demand and forest area wood prices neutral  negative the additional wood demand placed on this market by enviva from 20122014 coincided with a 19 increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 24 increase in delivered hardwood pulpwood price pine and hardwood chip prices also increased 1011 over this period analysis found evidence that increases in hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices can be linked to increases in total hardwood pulpwood demand however given that hardwood bioenergy demand has accounted for over 75 of total hardwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2014 it is reasonable to conclude that hardwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy has had some level of impact on delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices markets for solid wood products positive in the enviva chesapeake catchment area demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased 15 and 9 respectively from 20122018 a byproduct of the sawmilling process are sawmill residuals  a material utilied by envivas three mills to produce wood pellets with the increased production of both softwood and hardwood lumber so too has come an increase in sawmill residuals some of which has been purchasedconsumed by enviva not only has enviva benefited from the greater availability of this byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as envivas three mills have provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts forest landowners positive increased demand attributed to bioenergy has been a positive for forest landowners in the chesapeake catchment area not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood particularly hardwood pulpwood but the increase in pulpwood prices as a result of an overall increase in both softwood and hardwood pulpwood demand has transferred through to landowners improved compensation specifically since 2013 the first year all three enviva pellet mills were operating hardwood pulpwood stumpage price  the price paid to landowners  has averaged roughly 560 per ton in the chesapeake catchment area this represents a 47 increase over the approximately 380 per ton averaged by hardwood pulpwood stumpage in the catchment area over the 10 years prior 20032012 similarly pine pulpwood stumpage price has averaged 1295 per ton in the catchment area since 2013 up 67 from the 20032012 average of 775 per ton read the full report catchment area analysis of forest management and market
