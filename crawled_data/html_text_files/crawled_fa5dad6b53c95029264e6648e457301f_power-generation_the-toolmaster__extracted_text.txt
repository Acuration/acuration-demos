piece of equipment in the uks largest power station breaks down more often than not the answer is send it to andrew storrs workshop 22 january 2017 power generation before drax power station was a part of andrew storrs career it was a part of his local environment when i was at school in selby they were building the second half of the station he says we could see them building the cooling towers out of the classroom windows but it wasnt until a careers advisor brought an old cine film of the power station into class that he considered working there part of the film was them stripping the turbine and i watched it and thought i want to do that he says today storr does more than strip the turbines hes part of the engineering team that oversees them  a job that needs to be taken seriously if the turbines off forget the rest of it were not generating electricity  he says weve got to make sure the turbine and the generator are absolutely as bulletproof as possible because weve only got one per unit considering the conditions each one comes under this is no easy task the turbine shaft weighs 300 tonnes and spins at 3000 rpm the high pressure turbine is 165 bar and temperaturewise the steam running through it making it spin is 565 degrees centigrade bulletproof is an understatement when it comes to carrying out maintenance on a turbine its more than likely youll have to visit storrs workshop fixing the governor the workshop hasnt always been there it all started fifteen years ago when a piece of equipment broke it was a turbine governor relay a precision hydraulic actuator that keeps the turbine spinning at the right speed drax needed a new one theyve got to be 100 reliable storr explains if they lose control of the turbine it can either come to a grinding halt or speed up too much and selfdestruct the team went in search of a replacement contacting a manufacturer who came back with a skyhigh quote but storrs boss at the time had another idea he asked whether storr could reverse engineer a full set of governor relays i made the fatal mistake of saying yeah so i set off with a few photographs and a handful of sketches storr explains what followed were sleepless nights and a lot of grey hair but in the end he managed to reproduce a full set that cost nearly half of the original quote better than that they worked perfectly today theyre on unit 5 doing the business building the workshop manufacturing the governor relays was a turning point storr and the team saw there could be further savings and benefits if they did more manufacturing or refurbishment inhouse they had the staff capable of doing it they just needed the facilities although there was some initial scepticism from some in the company drax armed storr with a small budget and he set out on building the workshop that was 15 years ago back then the workshop was designed to only refurbish equipment but it has since grown now they can manufacture too today when drax buys in equipment which is either very expensive or lacking in quality storrs team can modify it make it fit better last longer or improve its efficiency without sending it away from the plant and incurring extra costs were reaping the rewards were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility storr says we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people the workshop has given drax an edge when it comes to its engineering ability but storr remains modest about the achievement the thing is he says ive got a good boss and he will support you but i do see it as a bit of a feather in my cap share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero sustainable
