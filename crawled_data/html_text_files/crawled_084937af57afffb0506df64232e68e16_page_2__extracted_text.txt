opinion in brief 75m backing for zero carbon humber to develop net zero technologies accenture and world economic forum report says humber could decarbonise quicker than any other uk industrial region mitsubishi heavy industries partners with drax supplying its advanced carbon capture technology making millions of tonnes of negative emissions possible at drax power station this decade deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs in the 2020s will have positive spillover for a net zero economy says frontier economics delaying beccs until the 2030s argues baringa research could increase energy system costs by 45bn planning consent process for beccs at drax from 2027 is underway with public consulted drax and bechtel studying global beccs deployments around the world governments industries and societies have begun to set themselves targets for reaching net zero but it is at home in the uk where real progress is starting to be made in answering some of the tougher challenges posed by the global environmental crisis eyebrows were raised when the uk set itself one of the most stretching timeframes in which to decarbonise but like many business leaders i am firmly of the belief that this ambitious target will be the catalyst to deliver the innovative thinking needed to get the planet to where it needs to be i was delighted to learn recently that government has awarded the zero carbon humber partnership 75 million in funding to develop worldleading net zero technologies mhi beccs pilot plant within ccus incubation area drax power station north yorkshire drax was one of the founder members of the partnership and its goal is to build the worlds first net zero industrial cluster and decarbonise the north of england along with the other members we worked hard to secure this government support and it consists of money from the department for business energy  industrial strategys industrial decarbonisation challenge fund with two thirds coming from private backing this financing is a vote of confidence from investors and highlights the governments commitment to developing the worlds first zerocarbon industrial cluster in the region projects of this scale backed with meaningful funding are key to accelerating a range of technologies that will be essential to advancing decarbonisation these include hydrogen production carbon capture usage and storage ccus and negative emissions through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs but more than just having a positive effect on reducing emissions delivering this in the humber will also support clean economic growth and futureproof vital industries biomass storage domes and water cooling towers at drax power station in north yorkshire i believe that in a similar way to how renewables have made huge strides in helping decarbonise power a range of new technologies are now needed to decarbonise industry and industrial regions our work as a partnership in the humber is establishing a landmark project for the uk and the worlds journey to net zero and clean growth reaching net zero depends on a diverse range of technologies there are many factors that will be essential for the world to reach net zero  but perhaps none more important than open collaboration and integration government industry and individual businesses will need to work together and share learnings and infrastructure to be able to make true progress this collaboration will of course take many forms but one that is crucially important is industrial clusters such as zero carbon humber and neighbouring net zero teesside a recent report by accenture highlighted how vital decarbonising industrial regions will be to reaching climate goals industrial carbon dioxide co 2  emissions account for as much as 11 gigatonnes or 30 of global greenhouse gas emissions ghg however the report also highlights the opportunities both environmental and economic in decarbonising clusters the market for global industrial efficiency alone is expected to receive investments worth as much as 40bn while the global hydrogen market was estimated at around 175bn in 2019 the humber is the uks largest cluster by industrial emissions emitting 10 million tonnes of co 2 per year  more than 2 of the uks total ghg emissions pioneering projects around hydrogen production ccus and negative emissions through beccs are all ready to scale in the region beginning the task of reducing and removing emissions the potential benefit to the regional economy could also be significant  its estimated these technologies could create 48000 direct indirect and induced jobs in the humber region by 2027 this new 75 million in funding will allow work to gather pace on these transformational projects the funding will be used to obtain land rights and begin frontend engineering design feed for the hydrogen facility at h2h saltend as well as onshore pipeline infrastructure for co 2 and hydrogen it marks the beginning of the vital work of putting transportation systems in place that will take captured co 2 from drax power stations beccs generating units and permanently store it under the southern north seas bed draxs beccs power generation is one of zero carbon humbers anchor projects our recently confirmed partnership with mitsubishi heavy industries mhi will see its advanced km cdr carbon capture technology deployed at drax power station the negative emissions that this longterm agreement will make possible will enable the region to reduce its emissions faster than any other uk cluster according to accenture  developing negative emissions through beccs will help us achieve our ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030 by that time drax power station could remove 8 million tonnes of co 2 from the atmosphere each year playing a major part in helping the uk meet its climate goals from beccs to a net zero uk in march 2021 drax kickstarted the process to gain the necessary planning permissions called a development consent order dco from the government  its a crucial administrative step towards delivering a beccs unit as early as 2027 and a landmark moment in developing negative emissions in the uk a report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary step on the uks path to decarbonisation developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would also have positive spillover effects that can contribute to wider decarbonisation and a net zero economy these include learnings and efficiencies that come from developing and operating the countrys first beccs power station as well as transport and storage infrastructure which will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects however the benefits of acting quickly and pioneering beccs deployment at scale can only be achieved if policy is put in place to enable the right business models for beccs and negative emissions according to the frontier report intervention is needed to instil confidence in investors while also protecting consumer energy prices from spikes inside mhi pilot carbon capture plant drax power station failure to implement negative emissions through beccs could also be costly time is of the essence for the uk to reach net zero by 2050 and research by energy consultancy baringa  commissioned by drax highlights the economic cost of hesitation findings showed that delaying beccs from 2027 to 2030 could increase energy system costs by more than 45bn over the coming decade and over 5bn by the time the uk has to reach net zero i believe what we are developing at drax can become a worldleading and exportable solution for largescale carbon negative power generation the potential in negative emissions is economic as well as environmental protecting thousands of jobs in the uks carbonintensive industries as well as overseas beccs offers great potential for the uk to export skills knowledge and equipment to an international market to help establish this market we are working with engineering and construction project management firm bechtel to explore locations globally where there is the opportunity to deploy beccs and identify how newbuild beccs plants can be optimised to deliver negative emissions for those regions pictured lr kentaro hosomi chief regional officer emea mitsubishi heavy industries mhi jenny blyth project analyst drax group at drax power station north yorkshire carl clayton head of beccs drax group multiple government and independent organisations have highlighted how essential negative emissions are to reaching net zero in the uk as well as global climate goals the recently formed coalition for negative emissions aims to advance this vital industry at a global scale by uniting a range of negative emissions providers and users from across industries we can make it a more powerful force for decarbonisation and sustainable growth it will still be a long journey towards the uks goals but the governments funding for zero carbon humber the beginning of our beccs dco and partnerships with mhi and bechtel are key steps on the path to reaching net zero by 2050 i for one am excited to be on this journey tags beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  decarbonisation  economic impact  negative emissions  will gardiner  zero carbon humber how to build a business model for negative emissions 10 may 2021 carbon capture in brief policy intervention is needed to enable enough beccs in power to make a net zero uk economy possible by 2050 early investment in beccs can insure against the risk and cost of delaying significant abatement efforts into the 2030s and 2040s a twopart business model for beccs of carbon payment and power cfd offers a clear path to technology neutral and subsidy free ggrs the uks electricity system is based on a market of buying and selling power and other services  for this to work electricity must be affordable to consumers but the parties providing power must be able to cover the costs of generating electricity emitting carbon dioxide co 2  and getting electricity to where it needs to be this process has thrived and proved adaptable enough to rapidly decarbonise the electricity system in the space of a decade with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation  the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is one of the key technologies needed at scale for the uk to reach net zero yet there is no market for the negative emissions beccs can deliver in contrast to other energy system services  beccs has been repeatedly flagged as vital for the uk to reach its climate goals owing to its ability to deliver negative emissions  the climate change committee has demonstrated that negative emissions  also known as greenhouse gas removals ggrs or carbon removals  will be needed at scale to achieve net zero to offset residual emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and agriculture but there is no economic mechanism to reward negative emissions in the energy market for decarbonisation technologies like beccs in power to develop to the scale and within the timeframe needed the government must implement the necessary policies to incentivise investment and allow them to thrive as part of the energy and carbon markets beccs is essential to bringing the whole economy to net zero the primary benefit of beccs in power is its ability to deliver negative emissions by removing co 2 from the atmosphere through responsibly managed forests  energy crops or agricultural residues then storing the same amount of co 2 underground while producing reliable renewable electricity looking down above units one through five within drax power station a new report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary cornerstone of uk decarbonisation and its wider impacts on a net zero economy developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would have positive spillover effects that contribute to wider decarbonisation green growth and the uks ability to meet its legallybinding climate commitments by 2050 drax has a unique opportunity to fit carbon capture and storage ccs equipment to its existing biomass generation units to turn its north yorkshire site into what could be the worlds first carbon negative power station plans are underway to build a co 2 pipeline in the yorkshire and humber region which would move carbon captured from at drax out to a safe longterm storage site deep below the north sea this infrastructure would be shared with other ccs projects in the zero carbon humber partnership  enabling the uks most carbonintensive region to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing beccs can also have spillover benefits for other emerging industries lessons that come from developing and operating the first beccs power stations as well as transport and storage infrastructure will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects hydrogen production for example is regarded as a key to providing low zero or carbon negative alternatives to natural gas in power industry transport and heating learnings from increased bioenergy usage in beccs can help develop biomass gasification as a means of hydrogen production as well as applying ccs to other production methods the economic value of these positive spillovers from beccs can be far reaching but they will not be felt unless beccs can achieve a robust business model in the immediate future with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation designing a beccs business model the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis outlined several key factors to consider in assessing how to make carbon capture usage and storage ccus economically viable these are also valid for beccs development engineers working within the turbine hall drax power station one of the primary needs for a beccs business model is to instil confidence in investors  by creating a policy framework that encourages investors to back innovative new technologies reduces risk and inspires new entrants into the space the cost of developing a beccs project should also be fairly distributed among contributing parties ensuring that costs to consumerstaxpayers are minimised building from these principles there are three potential business models that can enable beccs to be developed at the scale and in the timeframe needed to bring the uk to net zero emissions in 2050 power contract for difference cfd by protecting consumers from price spikes and beccs generators and investors from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power this approach offers security to invest in new technology the strike price could also be adjusted to take into account negative emissions delivered and spillover benefits as well as the cost of power generation carbon payment another approach is contractual fixed carbon payments that would offer a beccs power station a set payment per tonne of negative emissions which would cover the operational and capital costs of installing carbon capture technology on the power station this would be a new form of support and unfamiliar to investors who are already versed in cfds the advantage of introducing a policy such as fixed carbon payment is its flexibility and it could be used to support other methods of ggr or ccs the same scheme could be adjusted to reward for example co 2 captured through ccs in industry or direct air carbon capture and storage daccs it could even be used to remunerate measurable spillover benefits from frontrunning beccs projects carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two above the frontier report says it would be the most effective business model for supporting a beccs in power project carbon payments would act as an incentive for negative emissions and spillovers while cfds would then cover the costs of power generation cost and revenue profiles of alternative support options based on assuming a constant level of output over time way to go hybrid why does the hybrid business model of power cfd with carbon payment come out on top frontier considered how easy or difficult it would be to transition each of the options to a technology neutral business model for future projects and then to a subsidy free business model by looking ahead to tech neutrality the business model would not unduly favour negative emissions technologies  such as beccs at drax  that are available to deploy at scale in the 2020s over those that might come online later plus the whole point of subsidies is to help to get essential fledgling technologies and business models off to a flying start until the point they can stand on their own two feet the report concluded ease of transition to technology neutrality  all three options are unlikely to have any technology neutral elements in the shortterm although they could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral and ease of transition to subsidy free  while all of the options can transition to a subsidy free system the power cfd does not create any policy learnings around treatment of negative emissions that contribute to this transition the other two options do create learnings around a carbon payment for negative emissions that can eventually be broadened to other ggrs and then captured within an efficient co 2 market overall we conclude that the twopart business model performs best on this criterion the other two options perform less well with the power cfd performing worst as it does not deliver learnings around remunerating negative emissions assessment of business model options green indicates that the criteria is largely met yellow indicates that it is partially met and red indicates that it is not met transition to a net zero future engineer inspects carbon capture pilot plant at drax power station crucial to the implementation of beccs is the feasibility of these business models in terms of their practicality in being understood by investors how quickly they can be put into action and how they will evolve or be replaced in the longterm as technologies mature and costs go down this can be improved by using models that are comparable with existing policies these business models can only deliver beccs in power as well as other negative emissions technologies at scale and enable the uk to reach its 2050 net zero target if they are implemented now every year of stalling delays the impact positive spillovers and negative emissions can have on global co 2 levels the uk government must provide the private sector with the confidence to deliver beccs and other net zero technologies in the time frame needed go deeper explore the frontier

2021 opinion leaders from 40 countries are meeting today albeit virtually as part of president joe bidens leaders summit on climate  the event provides an opportunity for world leaders to reaffirm global efforts in the fight against climate change set a clear pathway to net zero emissions while creating jobs and ensuring a just transition since taking office president biden has made bold climate commitments and brought the united states back into the paris agreement ahead of the twoday summit he announced an ambitious 2030 emissions target and new nationally determined contributions the us joins other countries that have announced significant reduction goals for example the eu committed to reduce its emissions by at least 55 also south korea japan and china have all set netzero targets by midcentury here in the uk prime minister boris johnson this week outlined new climate commitments that will be enshrined in law the ambitious new targets will see carbon emissions cut by 78 by 2035 almost 15 years earlier than previously planned if delivered this commitment which is inline with the recommendations of the climate change committees sixth carbon budget will put the uk at the forefront of climate action and for the first time the targets include international aviation and shipping what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a global scale never seen before as a uknorth american sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic at drax we are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends borders creating a global opportunity for businesses and governments to work together towards a shared climate goal thats why we joined other businesses and investors in an open letter supporting the us governments ambitious climate actions collaboration between countries and industries its widely recognised that negative emissions technologies will be key to global efforts to combat climate change at drax were pioneering the negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at our power station in north yorkshire which when up and running in 2027 will capture millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  per year sending it for secure storage permanently locking it away deep under the north sea experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for reaching net zero  the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in removing co 2 emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050 from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change and a recent report from baringa commissioned by drax showed it will be a lot more expensive for the uk to reach its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2031 without beccs a shared economic opportunity globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but will also be a key component of a postcovid economy government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy it would also act as an anchor project for the zero carbon humber initiative which aims to create the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster could spearhead the creation and support of tens of thousands of jobs across the humber region and more than 200000 around the uk in 2039 additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south and western canada a global company as a britishnorth american company drax embodies the positive impact that clean energy investments have we directly employ 3400 people in the us canada and the uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax is strongly committed to supporting the communities where we operate by investing in local initiatives to support the environment jobs education and skills from the working forests of the us south and western canada to the yorkshire and humber region and scotland we have a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 at drax we believe the challenge of climate change is an opportunity to improve the environment we live in we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 and transformed into europes largest decarbonisation project drax power station is the most advanced beccs

renewable energy im very excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the drax family  together we will build on what we have already achieved having become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and the uks largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal the deal positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business  making us a truly international business trading biomass from north america to europe and asia it also advances our strategy to increase our self supply reduces our biomass production costs and creates a longterm future for sustainable biomass  a renewable energy source that the uns ipcc says will be needed to achieve global climate targets its also an important milestone in draxs ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our pioneering negative emissions technology beccs  thats because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax negative emissions from beccs are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery inside a pinnacle pellet mill we already know pinnacle well  it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with drax our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so im looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together we will benefit from pinnacles scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues in 2019 pinnacles production cost was 20 lower than draxs completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 49 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets at 17 plants in locations across western canada and the us south  up from 16mt now it also expands our access to three major north american fibre baskets and four export facilities giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply this positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by demand in asia biomass wood pellet storage dome drax power station we believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with c67 billion of longterm contracts with high quality asian and european customers including drax and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027 drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio we believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics helping to reduce distance time carbon footprint and cost train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station importantly  there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group we recognise that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern us where we currently operate in line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with environmental groups indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas we are determined to create a

power 1  investment in q1 2024 with the first beccs unit to be operating by 2027 the potential of beccs as part of the path to net zero has been widely recognised beccs in power is an important part of all of the climate change committee cccs net zero scenarios contributing to negative emissions of between 16 39mt co 2 e per year by 2050 2  investment needs to occur early by 2035 the ccc sees a role for 34gw of beccs as part of a mix of low carbon generation 3  the governments energy white paper commits by 2022 to establishing the role which beccs can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy and setting out how the technology could be deployed the government has also committed to invest up to 1 billion to support the establishment of carbon capture usage and storage ccus in four industrial clusters 4  national grids 2020 future energy scenarios fes indicate that it is not possible to achieve net zero without beccs 5  however at present a business model 6 which could enable this investment is not in place a business model is required because a number of barriers and market failures otherwise make economic investment impossible there is no market for negative emissions there is currently no source of remuneration for the value delivered by negative emissions and therefore no return for the investment needed to achieve them positive spillovers are not remunerated  positive spillovers that would be delivered by a firstofakind beccs power plant but which are not remunerated include providing an anchor load for carbon dioxide co 2  transport and storage ts infrastructure that can be used by subsequent ccs projects delivering learning that will help lower the costs of subsequent beccs power plants and delivering learning and shared skills that can be used across a range of ccs projects including hydrogen production with ccs beccs relies on the presence of co 2 transport and storage infrastructure  where this infrastructure doesnt already exist or where the availability or costs are highly uncertain this presents a significant risk to investors in beccs in power ccus incubation area drax power station click image to viewdownload frontier economics has been commissioned by drax to develop and evaluate business model options for beccs in power that could overcome these barriers and help deliver timely investment in beccs business model options we started with a long list of business model options after eliminating options that are unsuitable for beccs in power we considered the following three options in detail power contract for difference cfd the strike price of the cfd would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillover benefits carbon payment a contractual carbon payment would provide a fixed payment per tonne of negative emissions the payment level would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions low carbon power and for learnings and spillovers carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two options above the carbon payment would provide remuneration for negative emissions and learnings and spillovers while the power cfd would support power market revenues for the plants renewable power output we first considered if committing to any of these business model options for beccs in power now might restrict future policy options for a broader ggr support scheme we assessed whether these options could over time be transitioned into a broader ggr support scheme ie one not just focused on beccs in power and concluded that this would be possible for all of them we then considered how these business model options could be funded and whether the choice of a business model option is linked to a particular source of funds for example power cfds are currently funded by a levy paid by electricity suppliers to the low carbon contracts company lccc we concluded that business models do not need to be attached to specific funding sources all of the options can be designed to fit with numerous different funding options so the two decisions can be made independently this means that the business model options can be considered on their own terms with thinking about funding sources being progressed in parallel we then evaluated the three business model options against a set of criteria developed from principles set out in the beis consultation on business models for ccs summarised in the figure below figure 1 principles for design of business models instil investor confidence  attract

evaluation highlighted some key tradeoffs to consider when choosing a business model investor confidence the power cfd and the twopart model with a cfd performed better than the carbon payment on this measure as they shield investors from wholesale power market fluctuations feasibility the power cfd performed best on this measure because it is already established in existing legislation and is well understood it will be quick to implement introducing a mechanism to provide carbon payments may require new legislation however this will be needed in any case to support other ccus technologies 7  and could be introduced in time before projects come online and potential to become technology neutral and subsidy free all three options could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral however the standalone power cfd performed least well as it does not deliver any learnings around remunerating negative emissions overall the twopart model performed well across the criteria and would offer a clear path to a technology neutral and subsidy free world delivering learnings that will be relevant for other ggrs as well conclusions the uks net zero target will be challenging to achieve and will require investment in negative emissions technologies to offset residual emissions from hardtoabate sectors as highlighted by the ccc 8  beccs in power is a particularly important part of this picture and represents a costeffective means of delivering the scale of negative emissions needed early investment in beccs is also important in insuring against the risk and cost of back ending significant abatement effort however market failures most notably the lack of a market for negative emissions lack of remuneration for positive spillovers and learnings and reliance on availability of ts infrastructure mean that without policy intervention the required level of beccs in power is unlikely to be delivered in time to contribute to net zero there are a number of business options available in the near term to overcome these barriers in our view a twopart model combining a power cfd and a carbon payment is preferable this measure addresses identified market failures can be implemented relatively easily and in time to capture benefits of early beccs in power investment and can be structured to ensure an efficient outcome for customers including with reference to investors likely cost of capital and in a way that allocates risks appropriately viewdownload the full report pdf  1 biomass can be combusted to generate energy typically in the form of power but this could also be in the form of heat or liquid fuel or gasified to produce hydrogen the resulting emissions can then be captured and stored using ccs technology the focus of this report is on biomass combustion to generate power with ccs which we refer to as beccs in power we refer to biomass gasification with ccs as beccs for hydrogen 2 ccc 2020  the sixth carbon budget greenhouse gas

net zero future 5 march 2021 sustainable business in october last year several of our employees from policy managers to apprentices took over the energy uk young energy professional yep forums twitter account to share their experiences so far working in the energy industry and their roles at drax the yep forum consists of a network of energy industry professionals with less than 10 years experience and aims to provide them with opportunities to collaborate develop and recognise successes the following insights from employees at drax show the importance of our workforce in achieving our ambition and what they have learnt so far about starting a career in the energy industry engineer working in the turbine hall at drax power station north yorkshire meet samuel the apprentice one of our technical apprentices samuel plumb explains why he decided to kickstart his career with a drax apprenticeship plus what the selection process involves i applied for this role because its a mix of practical skills and problemsolving drax has a large site with a huge range of equipment and processes so no two days are the same working here appealed to me because im really interested in the power industry and drax plays a key role in generation i found out about this apprenticeship through online research submitted an application completed aptitude tests online sat another aptitude test onsite and then eventually attended an interview meet richard the policy manager richard gow explains that with the right policies in place drax could become a carbon negative power station enabling a zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region the drax group policy and government relations manager outlines how his role helps to develop the necessary frameworks i engage with policymakers advisors and experts across the uk to understand the policy and political landscape and how this could impact draxs commercial objectives the energy sector is at the forefront of decarbonisation and its exciting to be involved in developing policies and market frameworks to support this transition to net zero by investing in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs hydrogen and other green technologies in the humber industry can regain a competitive edge new jobs can help to rejuvenate communities and the wider region as evidenced by a recent report from vivid economics on the socioeconomic benefits of beccs this investment at drax supports the uks levelling up agenda and to build back better  emphasising the need for the uk to have a skilled workforce to achieve net zero will gardiner ceo of drax group has explained how our own ambitions will also boost our communities and local economies by helping to create a cleaner environment for future generations whilst creating new jobs and export opportunities for british businesses noting that beccs at drax is not just limited to new engineering or technician roles as a ukus company with sites from selby to the scottish highlands to louisiana and mississippi in the us south we continue to attain young professionals and apprentices across a widerange of departments including sustainable business and smart energy services engineer below cruachan power station dam meet emma the renewables engagement officer and at drax we emphasise that now is the time for action to tackle climate change  emma persson renewables engagement officer describes her motivations for joining the clean energy transition and how her role is helping to ensure the uk reaches its net zero target as a recent graduate with a masters in energy and society i wanted to work in the energy sector and be part of its real and current transition to mitigating climate change instead of contributing to it this is an exciting time and my part in this transformation involves stakeholder engagement and contributing to draxs climate policy to ensure we reach our carbon negative ambition by developing talent within schools from a young age and inspiring students to study science technology engineering and maths stem subjects drax also encourages future career opportunities we are proud to be working with a number of local schools and colleges such as selby college with whom we recently signed a new fiveyear partnership  this shows our continued commitment to ensuring students of all ages are equipped with the skills needed to progress the uks cleaner energy future while having a positive social impact on our local communities mobilising a million students from selby college collect their laptops donated by drax april 2020 we recently became the uks first energy company to announce an initiative to improve employability for a million people by 2025  draxs opportunity action plan is in partnership with the social mobility pledge  led by the former education secretary the rt hon justine greening through our mobilising a million initiative we aim to connect with one million people by 2025 improving skills education employability and opportunity this sets a new and higher standard for the levelling up agenda in britain with a wider focus on environmental social and corporate governance esg issues clare harbord drax group director of corporate affairs said of the initiative by boosting education skills and employability opportunities for a million people we can start to level the playing field and build a more diverse workforce this will make the energy sector stronger and able to make a more significant contribution to the uks green recovery during the covid19 pandemic we have also been using virtual resources to provide new ways of learning from home delivering laptops for learners  and a new series of webinars titled drax in the classroom as well as virtual work experience and tours of

communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated collaborative energy system the technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions such as the us south where our american communities operate carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help drax to be carbon negative by 2030  an ambition i announced at cop25  just over a year ago in madrid will gardiner announcing draxs carbon negative ambition at cop25 in madrid december 2019 our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but are also a vital economic force as the world begins to recover from the effects of covid19 engineer inside the turbine hall of drax power station we all want the uks recovery to be a green recovery  one which benefits the north along with the whole of the country government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station  for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south  we are also partnered with 11 other organisations in the uks humber region to develop a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200000 jobs around the uk in 2039 the expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for ccus and biomass sustainability  clear longterm policies are essential here not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment these are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact co 2 emissions and lives of people engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station at drax we directly employ almost 3000 people in the us and uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax power station is the most advanced beccs project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this
