Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO
“Drax delivered a strong performance in 2022, and played a significant role in ensuring security of supply during a challenging year for the UK’s energy system.
“Our renewable generation – biomass, hydro and pumped storage – are a major source of power in the UK and during periods of peak demand when there was low wind and solar power, these assets collectively supplied up to 70% of the UK’s renewable power in certain periods.
“We believe that BECCS can become a world-leading solution for large-scale high-quality carbon removals and we are seeing increasing global policy support for its delivery.
“Drax stands ready to invest billions of pounds in the development of this technology and, following the introduction of the US Inflation Reduction Act, we are increasingly excited about the opportunities to deploy BECCS in the US. In response, the UK Government should accelerate its policy support for BECCS to make the UK a world leader in carbon removals, while attracting investment and delivering its net zero targets.
“Drax is a growing international business with strong cash returns which we are reinvesting to produce more renewable energy and deliver carbon removals while reducing our own carbon emissions. We aim to be at the heart of the energy transition, creating the jobs, renewable power and large-scale carbon removals that the world needs.”
Financial highlights – strong financial performance underpinning investment and a sustain and growing dividend

Total dividend increased 11.7% to 21.0 pence per share (2021: 18.8 pence per share)
Proposed final dividend of 12.6 pence per share (2021: 11.3 pence per share)
Operational highlights – optimisation of supply chain and generation to support security of supply
UK’s largest source of renewable power by output – 11% of annualised total, 19% of peak (up to 70% in-day peak)
Strategy highlights – developing a pipeline for carbon removals, biomass and dispatchable, renewable power

(1)
Financial performance measures prefixed with “Adjusted” are stated after adjusting for one-off exceptional items that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group (revaluation of deferred tax balances reflecting future increases in UK corporation tax rates, acquisi-tion costs, gain on sale of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine generation assets, restructuring costs, debt restructuring costs and certain asset obso-lescence charges and impairments), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS measures exclude amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2)
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, gains or losses on disposal of assets and impairment of non-current assets, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements, earnings from associates and earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.
(3)
Borrowings including the impact of hedging instruments less cash and cash equivalents, excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling inter-ests.
(4)
FSC® license code: FSC C119787.
(5)
PEFC© Chain of Custody certification (PEFC/16-37-1769).
(6)
Total $/t cost of production in Pellet Production – raw fibre, processing into a wood pellet, delivery to Drax port facilities in US and Canada, load-ing to vessel for shipment and overheads – Free on Board (FOB). Cost of ocean freight, UK port and rail cost reflected in Generation business accounts in addition to price paid to Pellet Production for the biomass pellet.
(7)
Includes structured power sales in 2023 and 2024 (forward gas sales as a proxy for forward power), transacted for the purpose of  accessing additional liquidity for forward sales from ROC units and highly correlated to forward power prices. 2024: 1.5TWh,  2025: 0.3TWh, presented net of cost of closing out gas positions at maturity and replacing with forward power sales.
(8)
Typical estimated annual biomass generation from ROC and CfD units c.13-14TWh based on estimated biomass availability,  incrementally lower in 2023 due to major planned outages on two ROC units, expected to result in lower ROC cap versus 2022.
(9)
2023 includes forward selling of pumped storage generation (0.1TWh) resulting in higher captured prices but lower system support availability.
