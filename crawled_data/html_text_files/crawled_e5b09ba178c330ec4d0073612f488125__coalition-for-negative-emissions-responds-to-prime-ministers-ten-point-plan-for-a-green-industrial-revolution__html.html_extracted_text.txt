Coalition for Negative Emissions responds to Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution
18 Nov 2020
The UK can become a world leader in these technologies and avoid the costs of delayed action
Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through a combination of bioenergy with carbon capture, direct air capture, management of trees and other nature-based solutions will be critical to making net zero a reality in the UK.
Today’s commitment from the Prime Minister to have four industrial clusters in the UK by 2030, supported by £200m of additional funding, will be vital to unlocking the carbon capture infrastructure needed for BECCS and DACCS projects to progress in the 2020s.
In doing so, the UK can become a world leader in these technologies and avoid the costs of delayed action.
The 2030 target of 10 million tonnes per year of CO
2
removed should create a competitive market to capture and store CO
2
at large scale, as well as usage.
The
Coalition for Negative Emissions
includes Biomass UK, Carbon Engineering, Carbon Removal Centre, CBI, CCSA, Climeworks, Drax, Energy UK, Heathrow, IAG, REA, NFU and Velocys.
