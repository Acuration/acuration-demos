developers of the proposed gasfired power station at eye airfield is today publishing new information about its project 6 february 2014 the information relates to the electrical connection that will export electricity from the proposed power station on eye airfield to the existing overhead national grid transmission lines that run parallel to the a140 norwich road and near to the villages of yaxley mellis and thrandeston local parish councils people living in these villages as well as other local interests such as the suffolk preservation society and common concern are being notified of this new information after widespread consultation and extensive technical and environmental studies progress power is proposing a new underground cable connection to a new substation that is part of an electrical connection compound on land situated close to the national grid transmission lines and located north of yaxley and mellis progress power has also today published proposals on how the electrical connection compound will be accessed by construction vehicles to avoid traffic and disturbance in local villages a new junction off the a140 is being proposed chris mckerrow project director for progress power said our proposals for the electrical connection avoid the need for more overhead pylons across the countryside something that both suffolk county council and mid suffolk district council and members of the public wanted us to avoid our plans will include extensive landscaping including the planting of trees in order to minimise the visual impact of the electrical connection compound we have also heeded peoples concerns about traffic to and from the site of the compound expressed at our public exhibitions in october and since by proposing a new junction off the a140 detailed information about the electrical connection compound and the proposed access arrangements can be accessed by the public via these different ways website wwwprogresspowercouk local libraries diss eye ipswich ixworth and stradbroke mid suffolk district council at its needham market office local parish councils local mps common concern and the suffolk preservation society have received the information update from progress power and so people can also obtain the update from them as well as from the county and district councils furthermore notices about the new information
