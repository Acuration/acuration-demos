reserve drax power station visit power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station the small devices that use lots of power and the big buildings that dont smarter technology is changing how much power we consume through our devices and infrastructure both big and small 23 january 2019 electrification when texas instruments set about attempting to create the worlds first handheld calculator in the early sixties it estimated that such a complicated device might require a battery as big and powerful as a cars  with some innovative thinking the team were eventually able to power the device with just a fivevolt battery turning the calculator into a truly handheld device and kickstarting an electronics efficiency revolution continuous advances in the space mean that todays superpowered smartphones run on more efficient powerful  and smaller  sources than ever before but as more of our devices become smart and grow in usage their electricity demand is also increasing on the other hand many bigger objects that traditionally have used a lot of power are becoming more efficient and consuming less electricity than before the small devices eating up electricity think of the most electricityintensive appliance in a home something constantly running like a fridgefreezer might come to mind  or something intensive that operates in short blasts like a hairdryer or kettle however a surprising drain of electricity in homes is tv settop boxes and consoles which as recently as 2016 were reported to account for as much as half of all electricity usage by domestic electronics  this is because of how often they are left in standby mode which means they are constantly using a small amount of electricity in 1999 the international energy agency iea introduced the one watt initiative which led to the electricity consumption of many devices on standby falling from around five watts to below one watt and while this has helped reduce standby or vampire power multiplied across the country  the electricity consumption becomes significant  in the uk there are an estimated 27 million tvs this is not just a tvspecific problem however it is symptomatic of many of the modern devices increasingly found in our homes  from smart lightbulbs to amazons alexa these are constantly using small amounts of electricity listening and connecting to the cloud even when not being directly used in 2014 the iea estimated that by 2020 these networkeddevices could result in 120 billion in wasted electricity  adding to this is the increasing demand of the cloud and data storage which has been estimated could account for 20 of the worlds electricity consumption by 2025  previous alarm bells surrounding the bitcoin networks electricity usage highlights that its not just physical connected objects that will put increasing pressure on electricity supply but also entirely digital products yet even as little things become smarter and require more electricity some big things that have previously consumed huge amounts of electricity are becoming more efficient the big things becoming more efficient buildings are a big source of electricity demand globally office blocks full of lights and blasting heating and airconditioning units are among the main offenders but poorly insulated homes that leak heat also have a significant impact efforts are constantly being undertaken to reduce this via technological means such as companies generating their own electricity onsite from installed renewables  but cutting interstitial demand to a minimum doesnt always have to be hitech the bullitt centre in seattle is a 50000 ft 2 office aiming to be the greenest commercial building in the world this is achieved in part through a rooftop solar array that allows the building to generate more electricity than it consumes but is complimented by more straightforward steps such as maximising natural light and ventilation collecting rainwater and the use of geothermal heat pumps on average the building consumes 230000 kilowatthours kwhyear compared to the average of 1077000 kwhyear for seattle offices retrofitting can also make notable reductions to energy usage and new york artdeco icon the empire state building has been updated to consume 40 less electricity  this is largely thanks to straightforward renovations such as ensuring windows open properly and temperatures can be easily controlled energy efficiency is even extending beyond the confines of the planet the international space station only consumes about 90 kw to run which comes from a solar array stretching more than 2400m 2  when its solar panels are operational about 60 of their generation is used to refill batteries for when the station is in the earths shadow the mars desert research station mdrs in utah technology like this will be essential if humans are going to put buildings on other planets where we will not have vast electricity generation and transmission systems we enjoy on earth and if that is the ambition continuously striving for ever more efficient devices on a smarter power grid is only going to help progress us further share related
