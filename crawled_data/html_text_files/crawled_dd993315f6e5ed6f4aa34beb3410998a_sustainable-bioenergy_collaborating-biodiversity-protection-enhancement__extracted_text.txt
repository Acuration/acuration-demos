efforts around our own facilities drax biomass employees have been contributing to a collaborative effort run by the sustainable biomass program sbp to provide better information on how to assess whether or not there are forests with high conservation values in a catchment and what to do about them sbp expects to publish the guidance from this workgroup in early 2018 share most read
