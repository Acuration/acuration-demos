archives press release drax power chief executive why britain needs rapidresponse gas 19 december 2016 press releases nearly 45 of the uks power already comes from gas mostly generated by combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plantsbut while ccgt plants can deliver a steady supply of baseload power and flex up and down within seconds  just like drax power station does with both coal and biomass  they cant turn on and be at full capacity at very short notice starting from cold to quickly power the equivalent of a small city in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days however is exactly what the uk power network is increasingly going to need solar and wind power cant generate electricity when its dark or still so to facilitate more of these intermittent renewables coming onto the grid we need sources that can be quickly ramped up to fill the gaps when lower carbon technologies arent able to provide the essential power for the modern world this is where ocgt open cycle gas turbine stations such as millbrook power in bedfordshire come in alongside other standby technologies such as storage and demand side response read the article by drax power ceo andy koss drax given green light to complete biomass upgrade saving 12 million tonnes of carbon every year uncategorized the third generating unit at drax power station has been given european commission ec approval to be fully powered by sustainable biomass drax can now complete the upgrade of the third of its six units to run on wood pellets the third unit upgrade started in july 2015 and now half the power station will produce renewable electricity saving 12 million tonnes of carbon each year drax produces enough renewable electricity to power three million homes in the first six months of this year 20 of the countrys renewable power was provided by drax the government has set out proposals to end coalfired generation by 2025 as part of its plan to stimulate more clean energy generation the ecs decision gives approval to the governments support for the upgrade of drax power station from coal to biomass and marks the culmination of a 650 million investment andy koss drax power ceo said drax now leads the world in biomass technology  three million households are powered with renewable energy generated by drax and were the largest carbon saving project in europe we have demonstrated how to reinvent a coalfired power station using an existing asset so there are no hidden costs to the grid and it is quick to achieve this is a testament to the expertise and ingenuity of our engineering team and everyone at the power station mr koss said that what has been achieved to date at drax showed the power station could help switch from coal in an affordable way for bill payers sooner than the 2025 deadline the energy challenge facing the uk is how to replace the contribution currently made by coal biomass technology is proven ready to go and ideally placed to help the country transform to a low carbon future with reliable secure and affordable renewable power he added with the right support from the government we could upgrade the remainder of the power station to run solely on biomass and provide up to eight per cent of the uks total electricity from sustainable sources the ec approval follows the recent announcement by drax that it is diversifying its power generating capability it is developing plans to build four stateof theart rapid response open cycle gas turbine ocgt power stations which could at the flick of a switch be running at capacity within ten minutes these more flexible plants will provide system support to the grid and plug the gaps created by intermittent renewables like solar and wind the proposed rapid response gas projects would further assist in getting coal off the system and so help the government achieve carbon saving targets the uk energy system is changing and so is drax this is the next step for us in helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future said andy koss notes to editors drax calculates that with half of its six units completed it will save 12 million tonnes of carbon every year making an important contribution to helping the government meet its targets to tackle climate change upgrading to biomass saves more than 80 per cent of the carbon dioxide emissions compared to the use of coal two other units at the power station in north yorkshire were previously upgraded in 2013 and 2014  the upgrade of the third unit makes it the largest decarbonisation project in europe and britains biggest single site renewable power generator generating 20 of the uks renewable power a new report into the uks energy sector first published last month november by imperial college london in collaboration with drax showed biomass has helped contribute to a 56 fall in carbon emissions from electricity in the last four years this report titled electric insights also revealed that biomass generation has increased since 2010 from zero to 2gw enough to supply four per cent of the electricity used every day in the uk researchers at oxford economics studied the impact of drax group on the uks economy and found it contributed 493 million towards the gdp of yorkshire and the humber in 2015 and supported 4500 jobs in the regions economy  their report also estimates that the groups activities and that of companies in its supply chain last year contributed 12 billion to the uk economy and supported 14150 jobs 9 december 2016  hirwaun power to participate in 2017 auction 9

the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future drax group chief executive our plans to build flexible power stations press releases where it was once an industry dominated by coal a predictable but dirty fuel now our power increasingly comes from renewables this is a trend that will continue forcing more coal off the system drax has a role in this new future of renewable power we have already converted half of our power station in north yorkshire to run on renewable biomass and now to support the needs of a system increasingly dominated by intermittent renewables like solar and wind we are developing plans to build four new stateoftheart flexible power stations  including millbrook power in bedfordshire read the article by drax group ceo dorothy thompson drax acquires

week monday 5th december the company which operates the uks largest power station  and now the countrys biggest single site renewable power generator  is looking to recruit a further six apprentices to join its training programme beginning in 2017 the places are available in three engineering disciplines mechanical electrical and control  instrumentation applications will open online at the drax website from monday 5th december students must have or be predicted to achieve gcses at grade c or above in maths english and science and have two additional gcses at grade c or above or equivalent in any other subject to apply andy koss chief executive at drax said we are delighted to announce further expansion of our apprenticeship programme this is designed to help equip young people with the engineering skills theyll need to succeed in modern industry and is an opportunity to join a company at the forefront of innovation and technology in power generation he added the countrys energy system is changing dramatically as we move to cleaner low carbon electricity to tackle the challenge of climate change drax has made a significant contribution to the uks renewable technology mix with our upgrades to biomass our apprentices develop their skills and knowledge in a worldleading technological environment where we have achieved carbon savings of over 80 compared to coal and are now the largest carbon saving project in europe this intake of apprentices will join the programme in august next year bringing the total currently training at drax to 19 the four year drax apprenticeship scheme is managed by the apprenticeship employment agency aea for the first two years with apprentices spending most of the first year at the uniper engineering academy an industry training centre near nottingham the second year is split between drax and the academy with years three and four spent entirely at drax apprentices qualify with either a btec national diploma in engineering or nvq 3 diploma in electrical power engineering  power plant maintenance andy added our apprenticeship scheme has many success stories with former drax apprentices having progressed to become technicians and supervisors at drax power station today we have engineers sections heads and department managers that have all come from an apprenticeship background we look forward to welcoming and working with more young people keen to develop their career at drax  1  48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter to receive a regular
