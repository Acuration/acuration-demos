moves slowly across the inside of a cavernous warehouse below a team of engineers stand around a turbine spindle the size of a double decker bus but weighing four times as much at 65 tonnes waiting for the cranes descent around them other engineers work on similarsized equipment one uses a wrench the size of an arm another programs a computerised lever to carefully strip millimetres from a piece of steel its just a normal day inside drax power station s machine workshop for the last 15 years this workshop has been refurbishing repairing and manufacturing tools and equipment for use at the power station  a fact that sets drax apart from other stations like it were envied by a few stations because we do most things inhouse says turbine engineer and head of the workshop andrew storr were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people storr set up the workshop in 2001 after being asked to reverse engineer a replacement set of governor relays components that help regulate the flow of steam going into the turbines for one of draxs steam turbines today its a thriving centre of activity filled with heavyduty machinery and ingenious engineers a look inside the workshop when youre manufacturing spares its not a matter of going down to our machine shop and just saying make one of those youve got to have the correct grade of material the correct size the correct certification for the material  you cant just have a scrappy piece of steel that you find its got to have paperwork with it to say its certified up to whatever its supposed to be says storr turbine bearings need to be bored to size using a horizontal borer that very accurately shaves out the lining of the inner bearing getting it right is incredibly important explains storr if its made too large it causes the turbine shaft to vibrate if its made too small the bearing becomes too hot and the white metal will melt and pour out the bearing we need to avoid both of these issues at all cost the inside of the turbine blading needs to have seal strips administered by hand as theyre delicately made to limit any damage to the spinning shaft should they touch each other despite the wealth of equipment at the disposal of the team in the shop success depends on the skill of the engineers using it there are three 160tonne cranes in the turbine hall each installed before the turbines were built this meant the construction companies who erected the turbines could lift all heavy components into place with ease due to their size they move slowly it takes approximately 20 minutes for the largest hook to travel from the ground all the way to the top says storr in mechanical engineering its sometimes necessary to fit one part inside another and once these parts are assembled they must stay locked together and not come apart storr says one way the team does this is by shrinking some components and for this they use liquid nitrogen the team places the component that needs to fit inside another into a bath of liquid nitrogen and shrink it at 190 degrees celsius once shrunk the team assembles the two placing the now smaller component into the larger one eventually the inner part warms up to ambient temperature and grows in size making the fit very tight and preventing them from coming apart explains storr in the past drax would send the work they now do in the machine shop to companies off site and because all other power stations in the area would do the same thing wait times would often be long and the quality of the output could vary when we do it inhouse i can keep my eye on it says storr i can reprioritise things depending on what is going to be needed back on the turbine first  weve got 100 control over it we can make sure everythings hunkydory tags drax power station  electricity  electricity generation  technology how space tech helps forests 20 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy can you count the number of trees in the world accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than just a clearer view on what is happening it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening and its with this information that real differences in our future can be made tags biomass energy  forests  investors  sustainability  technology 4 amazing uses of bioenergy 5 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy bioenergy is the worlds largest renewable energy source providing 10 of the worlds primary supply  but more than just being a plentiful energy source it can and should be a sustainable one and because of this its also a focus for innovation biomass currently powers 48 of great britains electricity through its use at drax power station and smaller power plants but this isnt the only way bioenergy is being used around the world people are looking into how it can be used in new and exciting ways powering selfsufficient robots what type of bioenergy algae and microscopic animals hows it being used to power two aquatic robots with mouths stomachs and an animaltype metabolism designed at the university of bristol the 30cm rowbot is modelled on the water boatman insect the other which is smaller closer resembles a tadpole and moves with the help of its tail both are powered by microbial fuel cells  fuel cells that use the activity of bacteria to generate electricity  developed at the university of the west of england in bristol as they swim the robots swallow water containing algae and microscopic animals which is then used by their fuel cell stomachs to generate electricity and recharge the robots batteries once recharged they row or swim to a new location to look for another mouthful is there a future its hoped that within five years the rowbot will be used to help clean up oil spills and pollutants such as harmful algal bloom  there are plans to reduce the tadpole bot to 01mm so that huge shoals of them can be dispatched to work together to tackle outbreaks of pollutants purifying water whats used human waste hows it being used the omni processor  a low cost waste treatment plant funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation  does something incredible it turns sewage into fresh water and electricity it does this by heating human waste to produce water vapour which is then condensed to form water this water is passed through a purification system making it safe for human consumption best of all it does this while powering itself the solid sludge left over by the evaporated sewage is siphoned off and burnt in a steam engine to produce enough electricity to process the next batch of waste is there a future the first omni processor was manufactured by janicki bioenergy in 2013 and has been operating in dakar senegal since may 2015 a second processor which doubles the capacity of the first is currently operating in sedrowoolley washington us and is expected to be shipped to west africa during 2017 closer to home and drax power station a similar project is already underway northumbrian water was the first in the uk to use its sludge to produce renewable power but unlike the omni processor it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid resulting in a total saving in the utility companys carbon footprint of around 20 and also multimillions of pounds of savings in operating costs flying across the atlantic whats used tobacco hows it being used most tobacco is grown with a few factors in mind  taste and nicotine content being the most important but two of the 80 acres of tobacco grown at briar view farms in callands virginia us are used to grow tobacco of a very different sort this tobacco can power aeroplanes  us biofuel company tyton bioenergy systems is experimenting with varieties of tobacco dropped decades ago by traditional growers because of poor flavour or low nicotine content the lownicotine varieties need little maintenance are inexpensive to grow and flourish where other crops would fail the company is turning this tobacco into sustainable biofuel and last year filed a patent for converting oil extracted from plant biomass into jet fuel is there a future in the hope of creating a promising source of renewable fuel scientists are pioneering selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to increase tobaccos sugar and seed oil content in 2013 the us department of energy gave a 48m grant to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  in partnership with uc berkeley and the university of kentucky to research the potential of tobacco as a biofuel powering repopulation of a disaster zone whats used wood exposed to radiation by the fukushima nuclear meltdowns hows it being used last year it was announced that german energy company entrade energiesysteme ag will set up biomass power generators in the fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity using the lightly irradiated wood of the area its hoped they will help japans attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear accident entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 995 which could help japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy is there a future the prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy and solar power  tags biomass energy  investors  sustainability  technology how much does it cost to charge my iphone 4 april 2017 electrification its difficult to imagine life without electricity its ubiquity means its easy to forget the incredible feats of science engineering and infrastructure that allow us to undertake a task as simple as plugging in our smartphones in fact so expansive are the nationwide infrastructure networks that lie beyond the wall socket keeping a topoftherange mobile phone charged for a year can cost as much as 67p to work out how much electricity an appliance uses theres a relatively straightforward equation we can follow of power kilowatt kw x time hours used  energy transferred kilowatthour kwh to then work out how much that costs in real terms we need to take the wattage of the appliance worked out in kilowatts as this is the metric electricity tariffs are measured in multiply that by the number of hours it is being used for then multiply that figure kwh by your energy tariff  in the case of an iphone it works out like this a typical iphone charger is 5w 0005 kw  and a full charge from empty takes a maximum of three hours a conservative estimate the average electricity tariff in the uk is 15p per kwh which leads to an equation that looks like this 0005 x 3 x 015  000225 a day and if we assume that an iphone owner might fully charge their phone roughly 300 times a year the total annual sum amounts to a princely 675p theres no other way of looking at this  its a very low number but its important to think about this number in scale extrapolate it across the number of devices in the country and it grows significantly a 2016 study on uk smartphone owners suggests three quarters of all adults have smartphones which would put the country total somewhere in the region of 40 million per day thats 600 mwh of electricity needed to power their smartphones thats the equivalent of 200 mw of power generation or enough to power 565000 households for one hour how much electricity do my other appliances use unfortunately not all appliances are as modern efficient and cost effective as your average smartphone in fact when it comes to household appliances charging your apple iphone samsung sony or windows phone device is one of the least powerhungry activities you can undertake a bigger offender is your fridgefreezer but not because they need a lot of electricity to run instead it comes down to the fact it is plugged in and drawing power for a significant amount of time a fridge freezer is plugged in for 24 hours a day seven days a week and even though modern fridge freezers have good energy efficiency mechanisms to limit their usage they can very easily use 427 kwh a year leading to an annual cost of over 50 to put that into perspective heres how much your other household items cost per hour according to the same equation used earlier whats new as our homes workplaces and industries have become more energy efficient the country as a whole is using less power nowhere is this more evident than in our lighting  today the common led lightbulb uses just 17 of the power needed for an incandescent lightbulb of equivalent brightness the news has been full of stories about how much more power 4k tvs use compared to high definition tvs but because most of us buy a tv once every decade or so replacing your 2007 1080p full hd tv with the uks bestselling 4k model and watching it for an hour will actually use around 70 less power this continued trend towards efficiency has had a marked effect on the countrys use of power in march 2017 the government published its latest electricity demand data for the uk  showing the countrys power needs falling all the way through to 2020 but then something interesting happens from 2026 the forecast shows us beginning to use increasingly more power than we are due to in 2017 to the point where by 2035 were using more power than we are today  19 more why is this one possibility is electric cars in 2015 electric vehicles evs consumed 025 twh of power but thats set to grow significantly in its future energy scenarios report published in 2016 national grid projected evs will consume 19 twh in 2035 but it has already said it believes its projections might be understated  in short the ev revolution could drive demand far higher which leads to the question where is all of this extra power going to come from  understanding the smart home our future energy needs are not just going to be met by more electricity generation capacity  they will also be assisted by something closer to home with the introduction of smart meters  pinpointing the devices and appliances in our homes that use the most electricity will become more widespread more than this well be able to identify what time of day theyre using the most energy and when we might be able to turn them off with this information we can optimise our usage and save money and while cutting down your yearly phone charging budget from 67p to 50p might not sound like much if three quarters of the country are joining you those pennies can quickly add up tags customers  energy prices  investors  technology 5 of londons most iconic buildings made with ash 20 march 2017 sustainable business londons historic relationship with its power system is clear to see in its skyline old decommissioned power stations a reminder of the citys industrial heritage have been repurposed to house art or corporate headquarters  connecting the citys past to its present but these historical buildings arent the only physical connection to how the city is powered in fact much of modern london is built using a byproduct from electricity generation although drax power station now generates more than half its electricity using sustainable biomass  a proportion comes from coal of which ash is a byproduct but rather than discarding this ash to landfill drax sells it to companies who turn it into something useful lytag  lytag is made from transforming the ash into small round pellets and then heating them to 1100c creating very hard spheres of lightweight aggregate these can be used to create high strength concrete as well as used in filter systems roof tiles and sports surfaces here are some of the most iconic buildings in london made using lytag the gherkin the building at 30 st mary axe also known as the gherkin is a notable feature of the capitals skyline but more than being a unique landmark when constructed it was dubbed londons first ecological tall building it uses wind for heating and cooling which means it uses nearly 50 less energy than comparable office buildings and was constructed using recycled and recyclable materials where possible including lytag london city hall like the gherkin londons city hall is not only a visually unique building but an energyefficient one  too solar panels across its façade generate renewable electricity while smart meters and sensors ensure the power it does use is carefully optimised  it even recycles heat generated by its computers and lights in construction lytag was used in the flooring helping the buildings overall sustainability credentials heron tower lightweight lytag aggregate formed part of the concrete used to construct the heron tower which helped reduce structural loading this city of london skyscraper was awarded an excellent rating from breeam  the worlds leading sustainability assessors the rating owes much to the south side of the building which is studded with an incredible 48000 photovoltaic arrays  st pancras station the recent upgrade to st pancras involved widespread refurbishment as well as civil and structural modifications to facilities across the station one such modification was a 185metre extension to create 13 new platforms for additional domestic and international services wimbledon centre court in 2006 the worlds most famous tennis court began a major overhaul for the first time in its history centre court at the all england lawn tennis and croquet club was to get a retractable roof that covers the whole court but to do this it needed to undergo a fivestorey redevelopment which also increased its capacity to 15000 spectators lytag was used to create a specially formulated water resistant concrete that anchored the additional seating and helped bring the worlds biggest tennis tournament into a new era more to come although coal is fast becoming a smaller part of the uks electricity generation mix  lytag remains a part of london construction its currently being used in the one bank street development in canary wharf and the pinnacle building in the city of london which when finished will be the second tallest building in london  a noteworthy addition to the capitals skyline tags technology you wont recognise this powder but you will know what its used for 3 march 2017 power generation chances are wherever youve been today youve never been further than a few feet away from gypsum its equally likely however you dont know what gypsum is you might not recognise it in its raw form  a soft chalky white mineral made up of calcium and sulphur but you will recognise the things its used in buildings food fertilisers  the list goes on its a hugely versatile mineral and while its naturallyoccurring its also a byproduct of electricity generation where does gypsum come from gypsum is formed naturally when lakes or lagoons with a high amount of calcium and sulphates evaporate this evaporation leaves behind layers of sediments which eventually harden into a mineral gypsum which can then be mined its also sometimes found on the earths surface where it can give rise to spectacular natural environments like the white sands desert in new mexico or slowly crystallise underground into formations like the cave of the crystals in chihuahua mexico but gypsum can also be formed as a byproduct of industrial processes  electricity generation being one when coal is used to generate electricity it releases sulphur at drax power station flue gas desulphurisation fgd technology removes up to 90 of that sulphur dioxide  which takes the form of gypsum  a lot of it in 2016 80000 tonnes of gypsum was produced and sold by drax today that gypsum is sold to just one supplier who uses it to make plasterboard but there are a number of varied uses for this versatile mineral construction one of gypsums most abiding uses in human society has been in construction in ancient times it was used widely for making cement or as a construction material in its own right  the interior of the great pyramids of giza are lined with gypsum today its still a prominent feature of the building industry gypsum is the key component in plasterboard which is produced by passing a gypsum paste between two sheets of paper when the paper sets the resulting gypsum sandwich forms the tough and ubiquitous plasterboard today all gypsum created at drax power station is used to create plasterboard its also a core ingredient in several forms of cement making and can  in its paste form  be applied as a plaster covering for existing walls and surfaces agriculture after its use in construction gypsums most important historical use is as a fertiliser gypsum is rich in sulphur which plants  in particular oil and legume crops  need for healthy growth its the same reason why volcanic soils are particularly fertile gypsums high calcium content also helps strengthen plant cell walls and aids in the absorption of nutrients more than just helping the plants gypsum fertiliser can also help reduce soil toxicity and improve its structure by allowing water to be absorbed and to drain more efficiently arts beyond its many practical uses gypsum also has a long history in the fine arts gypsum in its plaster form often called plaster of paris after the montmartre hill where it was originally quarried can be used for sculpting and decorative ornamentation when left in its solid form gypsum is known as alabaster and has been used for millennia in monumental sculpting often as a softer alternative to marble alabaster sculptures and statues have been produced by ancient societies in egypt syria and byzantium gypsum powder has also been used as an ingredient in colours in delicate inks used in medieval illuminations as well as common blackboard chalk cooking and brewing the presence of nutrients like calcium in gypsum makes it an important ingredient in several recipes including in making certain kinds of tofu but it has a more interesting role in brewing the taste of beer is determined in part by the hardness of the water used in the process the higher the mineral content in water the harder the water soft water can be used to make sweet beers like pilsners but if you want to make a bitter beer gypsum can be added to harden the water with its high sulphur and calcium content which in turn strengthens the flavour its worth mentioning however that only naturallyoccurring gypsum is used in cooking and brewing gypsum acquired through desulphurisation processes is only used in industrial contexts like building medicine as it is malleable and sets quickly sometimes within just a few minutes gypsum has proven an ideal material for sculpting casts and splints and anyone who has braces fitted knows only too well the unpleasant feeling of a plaster mould settling over the inside of their mouths thats gypsum too with an end date fixed for coal  its already a diminishing form of electricity generation  this in turn means less gypsum will created as a byproduct and sold to industry and while this means therell be less of a connection between what your home is built with and what powers it it wont mean that youre any less connected to gypsum every day gypsum has been a part of life for a long time unlike coal its one that will stick around tags coal  drax power station  technology getting more from less 22 january 2017 power generation what can we do to ensure plant integrity increase plant efficiency and ultimately get more megawatts out of the door for less this is a question at the heart of luke varleys work varley is the lead engineer in the turbine section at drax power station  a team who look after arguably the heart of the plant the steam turbines that drive electricity generation as well as managing daytoday maintenance he and a team of engineers and craftspeople within tsg deliver the major overhaul activities on the turbines to keep them running efficiently and safely but as the uks largest power station its a site that needs to run all the time  any maintenance needs to fit around that consistent operation for the most part this happens in the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the station can be temporarily shut down to carry out repairs even though varley recognises theres a large cost involved in shutting part of the plant down it leads to longer term gains were taking on work to improve efficiency because the end result is were using less fuel to get more electricity he says a small percentage increase in biomass efficiency can represent huge cost savings he adds but as a relatively new fuel biomass  in draxs case compressed wood pellets  presents a unique challenge for the engineers working with it the biomass challenge in the days when drax ran only on coal at full load as part of a stable national grid turbine maintenance meant facing common problems where we had problems which were familiar from one hundred years of turbine history  we knew what to look for varley explains but now the plant generates within a far more demanding network that needs flexibility and produces more than half its power using compressed wood pellets theres a need for greater efficiency  it means more innovative thinking and new challenges for example most plants in the industry take each turbine offline to maintain it every eighttoten years but using wood pellets means the turbines need to be as efficient as possible and this means more regular inspections every four years we go back overhaul the module and maximise its efficiency again thats new to the industry within the uk nobody else is doing that he says despite the challenges varley isnt fazed the technical and management challenges they both come with experience he explains his engineering experience began before his start at drax as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game destined for grease my dads been in engineering all his life hed be building a car and id be dragged to a scrap man to help take an engine block out of an old car so he could use it at home varley says i was destined to always be covered in grease so when it came to beginning his career varley was set on what path he wanted to take two options presented themselves working as a trainee draftsman in an air conditioning company or taking an apprenticeship with national power an early visit to drax helped make his decision even though id been around engineering with my dad as a sixteenyearold i walked out into the turbine hall and looked down and thought this is a different game he took the apprenticeship which led him to a number of power plants but the impression of the drax turbine hall never left him later in my career i spent a lot of my time going around different power stations and in grandness and scale ive never come across anything that matches what weve got at drax so when this job came about and i was asked to join i said sounds good to me today his position of getting more megawatts out of the door for less whilst ensuring safe operation of the plant is one that comes with a lot of responsibility and is built on a long history the guy who was doing this job before me took a lot of pride in it he used to say ive been here man and boy i was even here when it was built and i wouldnt have retired until i knew it was in safe hands varley says i suppose thats the best recognition i could get really tags careers  drax power station  technology  turbines the problem solver power generation one of the things i like about my job is working through the challenges we get on a daily basis and finding a solution explains adam nicholson process performance section head at drax power station  that eagerness to find solutions makes him the ideal candidate for his current job managing daytoday improvements at drax im responsible for the team which ensures the plant operates at optimum efficiency he says his team make sure the turbines boiler emissions combustion and mills are not just working but running as smoothly as possible its a job that brings up constant challenges its ultimately what i became an engineer for he says to follow that problemsolving thirst through earlier in his career nicholson was involved in one of the plants biggest problemsolving missions converting it from running exclusively on coal to also run on compressed wood pellets  it was a unique test  one that required starting from scratch there wasnt a bank of existing knowledge that nicholson and his fellow engineers could call upon we did a lot of testing to learn more about the fuel he explains we had to understand how to get it to the boiler how to process it before we put it in how to convert the mills and then how exactly the combustion would work some of that learning involved experimenting with unorthodox solutions to complex problems the dog tunnel one of the big problems with biomass is you cant expose it to as high a temperature as you can coal nicholson explains this presented a challenge when it came to pulverising it before fuel at the power station can be combusted a set of mills pulverises it into a fine powder using a ring of rotating heavyduty balls  this fuel powder is then dried inside the mill with a mix of hot air drawn from the boiler house and cool air but a fundamental difference between coal and biomass meant this process had to change with coal the air can enter the mills at about 300 degrees with biomass if you get much above about 180 degrees the biomass will set on fire says nicholson as part of the rd phase he needed to work out a way to cool the mills down on a temporary basis we all took a big gulp and thought how are we going to do this part of the problem was the existing ducts werent big enough to deliver enough cool air to the mills to lower their temperature to a safe range nicholson improvised a solution it was known as the dog tunnel he says if he could get a temporary larger air supply to the mills it could provide more cool air and lower the overall temperature allowing the testing to be conducted so he found a company that could supply industrial flexible ducting which he connected to a larger cold air duct and then fed through to a mill to deliver more cool air as its informal name suggests the result didnt look like much but it worked it didnt look like a finished solution but the theory behind it was sound for occasions like this we had to think lets just do it prove it and then we can work on a permanent solution thats ultimately what i became an engineer for to follow that problemsolving thirst through the next challenge now the power station is successfully producing more than half of its electricity from biomass nicholsons daytoday responsibilities lie in ensuring safe operations and driving process efficiencies to do this he keeps tabs on the combustion process  for example by using thermal imaging cameras to monitor the inside of the furnace  and tweaks it to get as much energy as possible from the biomass fuel but at a site as large and complex as drax there will always be new engineering challenges that require inventive thinking often you dont know how youre going to do something until you do a bit more work and try and understand the problem nicholson says were nowhere near the end of our learning curve tags careers  drax power station  technology taming the electric beast power generation its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance says gareth newton as a mechanical engineer in one of the power stations maintenance teams hes a man with a closer eye on that animal than most and when something does need fixing or improving its his job to make sure it happens its a task that keeps him busy on top of the teams ive got a team servicing the filter fans ive got a team doing a filter change on a biomass unit then ive got another company doing a pipework replacement on a discharge line for me somebody else is doing a service on the belt cleaners newton says listing half a typical days responsibilities on any given day he oversees a number of different teams that carry out a variety of maintenance tasks and more often than not that list is a long one hes a part of the materials handling team who deal with all the material arriving and leaving the power station this includes the biomass and coal fuel coming in and the ash gypsum and other byproducts from the generation process going out it means he has a hand in the maintenance of almost all parts of the plant from the compressed wood pellet storage domes to the boiler with such a broad perspective of such a complex plant he knows its not always the things you expect to fail that need fixing monitoring the machine its a machine  its being used its not a showpiece or something in a museum its real and every now and then it will throw a gear out and stop he says those failures dont always happen to a schedule  so when something does go wrong it can be unexpected you might have a 50000 gearbox sat in the stores ready and waiting to replace a faulty one but it will be the 10 probe on a conveyer belt you never thought would break that fails and holds the whole system up he says when something like that happens he adds its not always about having the exact tool that can fix it right there and then its about thinking out of the box the biggest part of this job and i think its one of the biggest parts of heavy industry engineering is not fixing or modifying things with what youve got he says its about using what you havent got to try and engineer your way out he continues if you havent got a tool or part that you need can you make something new can you find a way to make it work or do you even need it its like a living animal is drax it will break it will fail it will need maintenance keeping your hands dirty newton grew up around engineering his father ran a salvage yard and precious metals business and would bring back broken bits of machinery for the kids to fix as toys ive always had dirty hands he says its something thats stuck with him today even though he now spends a large proportion of his time monitoring jobs at a computer or moving between teams its the practical side of the job that keeps him interested the best part of the job is working with your hands and even though the demands of the living animal that is drax can sometimes keep him on site longer than his working hours its a beast hes happy to look after its a job you either love or hate if you didnt enjoy the engineering side you probably wouldnt like it because theres a lot of ingenuity and thinking on your feet needed he says but there are a lot of jobs out there that i wouldnt want tags careers  drax power station  technology  1  4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email
