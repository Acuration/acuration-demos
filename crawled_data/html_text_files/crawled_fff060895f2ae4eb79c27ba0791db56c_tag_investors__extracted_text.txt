selected to be one of the uks two priority ccs projects and were now setting out a strategy to take the business forward enabling drax to make an even greater contribution to global efforts to reach net zero we believe drax can deliver growth and become a global leader in sustainable biomass and negative emissions and a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation we aim to double our sustainable biomass production capacity by 2030  creating opportunities to double our sales to asia and europe where demand for biomass is increasing as countries transition away from coal as a global leader in negative emissions were going to scale up our ambitions internationally drax is now targeting 12 million tonnes of carbon removals each year by 2030 by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs this includes the negative emissions we can deliver at drax power station in the uk and through potential newbuild beccs projects in north america and europe supporting a new sector of the economy which will create jobs clean growth and exciting export opportunities capital markets day drax is today hosting a capital markets day for investors and analysts will gardiner and members of his leadership team will update on the groups strategy market opportunities and development projects the day will outline the significant opportunities drax sees to grow its biomass supply chain biomass sales and beccs as well as longterm dispatchable generation from biomass and pumped storage purpose and ambition the groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and its ambition is to be a carbon negative company by 2030 the group aims to realise its purpose and ambition through three strategic pillars which are closely aligned with global energy policies which increasingly recognise the unique role that biomass can play in the fight against climate change strategic pillars to be a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets to be a global leader in negative emissions to be a leader in uk dispatchable renewable generation the development of these pillars remains underpinned by the groups continued focus on safety sustainability and biomass cost reduction a global leader in sustainable biomass pellets drax believes that the global market for sustainable biomass will grow significantly creating opportunities for sales to third parties in asia and europe beccs generation and other longterm uses of biomass delivery of these opportunities is supported by the expansion of the groups biomass pellet production capacity the group has 13 operational pellet plants with nameplate capacity of c4mt plus a further two plants currently commissioning and other developmentsexpansions which will increase this to c5mt once complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity to deliver this additional capacity drax is developing a pipeline of organic projects principally focused on north america drax expects to take a final investment decision on 051mt of new capacity in 2022 targeting returns significantly in excess of the groups cost of capital underpinned by this expanded production capacity drax aims to double sales of biomass to third parties to 4mt pa by 2030 developing its market presence in asia and europe facilitated by the creation of new business development teams in tokyo and london drax is a major producer supplier and user of biomass active in all areas of the supply chain with longterm relationships and almost 20 years of experience in biomass operations the groups innovation in coaltobiomass engineering supply chain management and leadership in negative emissions can be deployed alongside its large reliable and sustainable supply chain to support customer decarbonisation journeys with longterm partnerships drax expects to sell all the biomass it produces based on an appropriate market price typically with longterm indexlinked contracts continued focus on cost reduction in 2018 the groups biomass production cost was 166t 2  at the h1 2021 results through a combination of fibre sourcing operational improvements and capacity expansion including the acquisition of pinnacle renewable energy inc the production cost had reduced to 141t 2  draxs aims to use the combined expertise of drax and pinnacle to apply learnings and cost savings across its portfolio and continues to target 100t 2 50mwh equivalent 4  by 2027 a global leader in negative emissions the intergovernmental panel on climate change 5 and the coalition for negative emissions 6 have both outlined a clear role for beccs in delivering the negative emissions required to limit global warming to 15 o c above preindustrial levels and to achieve net zero by 2050 identifying a requirement of between 2bn and 7bn tonnes of negative emissions globally from beccs separately the uk government has recently published its net zero strategy and biomass policy statement reaffirming the established international scientific consensus that sustainable biomass is renewable and that it will play a critical role in helping the uk achieve its climate targets it also signposted an ambition for at least 5mt pa of negative emissions from beccs and direct air capture by 2030 23mt pa by 2035 and up to 81mt pa by 2050 the reports commit the government to the development during 2022 of a financial model to support beccs to meet these requirements subject to the right regulatory environment drax plans to transform drax power station into the worlds biggest carbon capture project using beccs to permanently remove 8mt of co 2 emissions from the atmosphere each year by 2030 the project is well developed the technology is proven and an investment decision could be taken in 2024 with the first beccs unit operational in 2027 and a second in 2030 subject to the right investment framework the group aims to build on this innovation with a new target to deliver 4mt of negative co 2 emissions pa from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets a uk leader in dispatchable renewable generation the uks plans to achieve net zero by 2050 will require the electrification of heating and transport systems resulting in a significant increase in demand for electricity drax believes that over 80 of this could be met by intermittent renewable and inflexible lowcarbon energy sources  wind solar and nuclear however this will only be possible if the remaining power sources can provide the dispatchable power and nongeneration system support services the power system requires to ensure security of supply and to limit the cost to the consumer longterm biomass generation and pumped storage hydro can provide these increasingly important services drax power station is the uks largest source of renewable power by output and the largest dispatchable plant the group is continuing to develop a lower cost operating model for this asset supported by a reduction in fixed costs associated with the end of coal operations drax is also developing an option for new pumped storage  cruachan ii  which could take a final investment decision in 2024 and be operational by 2030 providing an additional 600mw of dispatchable longduration storage to the power system in its smart systems and flexibility plan july 2021 the uk government described longduration storage technologies as essential for achieving net zero and has committed to take actions to derisk investment for largescale and longduration storage capital allocation and dividend strategic capital investment 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity beccs at drax power station and cruachan ii is expected to be in the region of 3bn between 2022 and 2030 backed by longterm contracted cashflows and targeting high singledigit returns and above no final investment decision has been taken on any of these projects and both beccs and cruachan ii remain subject to further clarity on regulatory and funding mechanisms the group believes these investments can be selffunded through strong cash generation over the period with net debt to adjusted ebitda significantly below 2x at the end of 2030 providing flexibility to support further investment such as newbuild beccs as these options develop drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017 noting that average annual dividend growth was around 10 in the last 5years webcast

model for negative emissions 10 may 2021 carbon capture in brief policy intervention is needed to enable enough beccs in power to make a net zero uk economy possible by 2050 early investment in beccs can insure against the risk and cost of delaying significant abatement efforts into the 2030s and 2040s a twopart business model for beccs of carbon payment and power cfd offers a clear path to technology neutral and subsidy free ggrs the uks electricity system is based on a market of buying and selling power and other services  for this to work electricity must be affordable to consumers but the parties providing power must be able to cover the costs of generating electricity emitting carbon dioxide co 2  and getting electricity to where it needs to be this process has thrived and proved adaptable enough to rapidly decarbonise the electricity system in the space of a decade with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation  the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs is one of the key technologies needed at scale for the uk to reach net zero yet there is no market for the negative emissions beccs can deliver in contrast to other energy system services  beccs has been repeatedly flagged as vital for the uk to reach its climate goals owing to its ability to deliver negative emissions  the climate change committee has demonstrated that negative emissions  also known as greenhouse gas removals ggrs or carbon removals  will be needed at scale to achieve net zero to offset residual emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and agriculture but there is no economic mechanism to reward negative emissions in the energy market for decarbonisation technologies like beccs in power to develop to the scale and within the timeframe needed the government must implement the necessary policies to incentivise investment and allow them to thrive as part of the energy and carbon markets beccs is essential to bringing the whole economy to net zero the primary benefit of beccs in power is its ability to deliver negative emissions by removing co 2 from the atmosphere through responsibly managed forests  energy crops or agricultural residues then storing the same amount of co 2 underground while producing reliable renewable electricity looking down above units one through five within drax power station a new report by frontier economics for drax highlights beccs as a necessary cornerstone of uk decarbonisation and its wider impacts on a net zero economy developing a firstofakind beccs power plant would have positive spillover effects that contribute to wider decarbonisation green growth and the uks ability to meet its legallybinding climate commitments by 2050 drax has a unique opportunity to fit carbon capture and storage ccs equipment to its existing biomass generation units to turn its north yorkshire site into what could be the worlds first carbon negative power station plans are underway to build a co 2 pipeline in the yorkshire and humber region which would move carbon captured from at drax out to a safe longterm storage site deep below the north sea this infrastructure would be shared with other ccs projects in the zero carbon humber partnership  enabling the uks most carbonintensive region to become the worlds first net zero industrial cluster developing beccs can also have spillover benefits for other emerging industries lessons that come from developing and operating the first beccs power stations as well as transport and storage infrastructure will reduce the cost of subsequent beccs negative emissions and other ccs projects hydrogen production for example is regarded as a key to providing low zero or carbon negative alternatives to natural gas in power industry transport and heating learnings from increased bioenergy usage in beccs can help develop biomass gasification as a means of hydrogen production as well as applying ccs to other production methods the economic value of these positive spillovers from beccs can be far reaching but they will not be felt unless beccs can achieve a robust business model in the immediate future with a 58 reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation the uks electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies as the uk pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 new technologies are needed and the market must extend to enable innovation designing a beccs business model the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis outlined several key factors to consider in assessing how to make carbon capture usage and storage ccus economically viable these are also valid for beccs development engineers working within the turbine hall drax power station one of the primary needs for a beccs business model is to instil confidence in investors  by creating a policy framework that encourages investors to back innovative new technologies reduces risk and inspires new entrants into the space the cost of developing a beccs project should also be fairly distributed among contributing parties ensuring that costs to consumerstaxpayers are minimised building from these principles there are three potential business models that can enable beccs to be developed at the scale and in the timeframe needed to bring the uk to net zero emissions in 2050 power contract for difference cfd by protecting consumers from price spikes and beccs generators and investors from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power this approach offers security to invest in new technology the strike price could also be adjusted to take into account negative emissions delivered and spillover benefits as well as the cost of power generation carbon payment another approach is contractual fixed carbon payments that would offer a beccs power station a set payment per tonne of negative emissions which would cover the operational and capital costs of installing carbon capture technology on the power station this would be a new form of support and unfamiliar to investors who are already versed in cfds the advantage of introducing a policy such as fixed carbon payment is its flexibility and it could be used to support other methods of ggr or ccs the same scheme could be adjusted to reward for example co 2 captured through ccs in industry or direct air carbon capture and storage daccs it could even be used to remunerate measurable spillover benefits from frontrunning beccs projects carbon payment  power cfd this option combines the two above the frontier report says it would be the most effective business model for supporting a beccs in power project carbon payments would act as an incentive for negative emissions and spillovers while cfds would then cover the costs of power generation cost and revenue profiles of alternative support options based on assuming a constant level of output over time way to go hybrid why does the hybrid business model of power cfd with carbon payment come out on top frontier considered how easy or difficult it would be to transition each of the options to a technology neutral business model for future projects and then to a subsidy free business model by looking ahead to tech neutrality the business model would not unduly favour negative emissions technologies  such as beccs at drax  that are available to deploy at scale in the 2020s over those that might come online later plus the whole point of subsidies is to help to get essential fledgling technologies and business models off to a flying start until the point they can stand on their own two feet the report concluded ease of transition to technology neutrality  all three options are unlikely to have any technology neutral elements in the shortterm although they could transition to a midterm regime which could be technology neutral and ease of transition to subsidy free  while all of the options can transition to a subsidy free system the power cfd does not create any policy learnings around treatment of negative emissions that contribute to this transition the other two options do create learnings around a carbon payment for negative emissions that can eventually be broadened to other ggrs and then captured within an efficient co 2 market overall we conclude that the twopart business model performs best on this criterion the other two options perform less well with the power cfd performing worst as it does not deliver learnings around remunerating negative emissions assessment of business model options green indicates that the criteria is largely met yellow indicates that it is partially met and red indicates that it is not met transition to a net zero future engineer inspects carbon capture pilot plant at drax power station crucial to the implementation of beccs is the feasibility of these business models in terms of their practicality in being understood by investors how quickly they can be put into action and how they will evolve or be replaced in the longterm as technologies mature and costs go down this can be improved by using models that are comparable with existing policies these business models can only deliver beccs in power as well as other negative emissions technologies at scale and enable the uk to reach its 2050 net zero target if they are implemented now every year of stalling delays the impact positive spillovers and negative emissions can have on global co 2 levels the uk government must

a ukus sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic we at drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders joe biden has become the 46 th president of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change starting with rejoining the paris agreement i am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this onceinalifetime challenge this is why drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic coalition of negative emissions producers this can foster collaboration and shared learning between the different technologies and techniques for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy biomass storage domes at drax power station in north yorkshire whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead clear longterm policies that spur collaboration drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the uk and us aligned targets of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 collaboration between countries and industries what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects this is why the paris agreement and this years cop26 conference in glasgow are so vital sustainable biomass wood pellets being safely loaded at the port of greater baton rouge onto a vessel destined for drax power station our effort towards delivering negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated collaborative energy system the technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions such as the us south where our american communities operate carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help drax to be carbon negative by 2030  an ambition i announced at cop25  just over a year ago in madrid will gardiner announcing draxs carbon negative ambition at cop25 in madrid december 2019 our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero experts on both sides of the atlantic consider beccs essential for net zero the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in tackling carbon dioxide co 2  emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050  from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change a variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between 10 and 20 of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon produced annually that the international energy agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change we believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry bioenergy and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies a formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management afforestation and reforestation  as well as technical solutions like direct air capture dac as well as beccs would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally direct air capture dac facility it would also offer flexibility in countries paths to net zero emissions if one approach underdelivers other technologies can work together to compensate and meet co 2 removal targets as with renewable energy working in partnership with governments is essential to develop these innovations into the costeffective large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the midcentury a shared economic opportunity i agree whole heartedly that a nations economy and environment are intrinsically linked  something many leaders are now saying including president biden the recently approved us economic stimulus bill supported by both republicans and democrats in congress and which allocates 35 billion for new clean energy initiatives is a positive step for climate technology and job creation globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but are also a vital economic force as the world begins to recover from the effects of covid19 engineer inside the turbine hall of drax power station we all want the uks recovery to be a green recovery  one which benefits the north along with the whole of the country government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station  for example would support around 17000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028 including roles in construction local supply chains and the wider economy additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain this includes the rail shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the us south  we are also partnered with 11 other organisations in the uks humber region to develop a carbon capture usage and storage ccus and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200000 jobs around the uk in 2039 the expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for ccus and biomass sustainability  clear longterm policies are essential here not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment these are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact co 2 emissions and lives of people engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station at drax we directly employ almost 3000 people in the us and uk and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the atlantic drax power station is the most advanced beccs

will be remembered for many things many are not positive but some are inspiring around the world weve seen tremendous acts of kindness and witnessed remarkable resilience from people continuing to live work and to support one another the actions we are all taking as individuals businesses and communities will not only help us get through this crisis they will shape how we emerge from it at drax we are proud of the ongoing role were playing in supporting the uk and its essential services continuing to generate and supply the electricity needed to keep people healthy and the economy running it is what we have always done and it is what we will continue to do this is possible because our people have continued to carry out their important work in these uncertain times safely and responsibly my leadership team in the uk and us must continue to support them and we must also support the communities they are a part of employees drax power station show their support and appreciation for the heroic efforts of those within the nhs by turning one of its cooling towers blue at 8pm each thursday our communities are at the core of what we do and who we are they support our business globally and enable us to supply energy to the country we have a responsibility to do what we can to help them through this crisis to do this we have put together a covid19 support package totalling more than three quarters of a million pounds that goes beyond just financing to make a positive impact id like to highlight a few of these supporting communities in great britain and the us the robinson family collect their laptop at selby community primary school the closures of schools and the need to turn homes into classrooms has been one of the biggest changes for many families with children now depending on technology and the internet for schooling theres a very real chance those without access may fall behind with a long term negative impact on their education we want to ensure no child is left out so we have donated 250000 to buy 853 new laptops each with three months of prepaid internet access and delivered them to schools and colleges local to our sites across the uk  this has been implemented by drax working closely with headteachers as one of our local heads ian clennan told us schools dont just provide education  theyre a whole support system having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and classmates more easily too  which is also incredibly important at the moment in the us were donating 30000 to support hardship funds for the communities where we operate  our colleagues in louisiana are playing an active role in the community and in amite county mississippi they have helped provide ppe to first responders as well as supporting charities for the families worse affected helping businesses starting with the most vulnerable as an energy supplier to small and medium sized businesses smes we must act with compassion and be ready to help those who are most economically exposed to the crisis to do this we are launching a number of initiatives to support businesses starting with some of the most vulnerable its clear that care homes require extra support at this time we are offering energy bill relief for more than 170 small care homes situated near our uk operations for the next two months allowing them to divert funds to their other priorities such as ppe food or carer accommodation but it is also important we understand how difficult a period this is for small businesses of all kinds many of our customers are facing financial pressure that was impossible to forecast to help relieve this we have agreed deferred payment plans with some of our customers who are unable to pay in full we have also extended current energy prices for three months for 4000 customers of opus energy who have not been able to secure a new contract during this period the impact of this crisis will be long term so we made a significant twoyear charitable donation to business debtline  a dedicated phoneline and webpage will be provided to our small businesses customers offering free debt advice and helping them to recover

drax or the group symboldrx rns number  2747e following a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with national grid ofgem and the uk government the board of drax has determined to end commercial coal generation at drax power station in 2021  ahead of the uks 2025 deadline commercial coal generation is expected to end in march 2021 with formal closure of the coal units in september 2022 at the end of existing capacity market obligations will gardiner drax group ceo said ending the use of coal at drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a worldleading carbon negative company by 2030 draxs move away from coal began some years ago and im proud to say were going to finish the job well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline by using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on we have also played a significant role in enabling the uks power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world having pioneered groundbreaking biomass technology were now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030 making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis stopping using coal is the right decision for our business our communities and the environment but it will have an impact on some of our employees which will be difficult for them and their families in making the decision to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy its vital that the impact on people across the north is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that people have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future coal in front of biomass storage domes at drax power station 2016 drax will shortly commence a consultation process with employees and trade unions with a view to ending coal operations under these proposals commercial generation from coal will end in march 2021 but the two coal units will remain available to meet capacity market obligations until september 2022 the closure of the two coal units is expected to involve oneoff closure costs in the region of 2535 million in the period to closure and to result in a reduction in operating costs at drax power station of 2535 million per year once complete drax also expects a reduction in jobs of between 200 and 230 from april 2021 the carrying value of the fixed assets affected by closure was 240 million in addition to 103 million of inventory at 31 december 2019 which drax intends to use in the period up to 31 march 2021 the group expects to treat all closure costs and any asset obsolescence charges as exceptional items in the groups financial statements a further update on these items will be provided in the groups interim financial statements for the first half of 2020 as part of the proposed coal closure programme the group is implementing a broader review of operations at drax power station this review aims to support a safe efficient and lower cost operating model which alongside a reduction in biomass cost positions drax for longterm biomass generation following the end of the current renewable support mechanisms in march 2027 while previously being an integral part of the drax power station site and offering flexibility to the groups trading and operational performance the longterm economics of coal generation remain challenging and in 2019 represented only three percent of the groups electricity

the biggest challenge of our time will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 28 july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the right thing tags about us  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  biomass energy  careers  decarbonisation  energy policy  gas  investors  sustainability is biomass demand out of control 13 april 2018 sustainable bioenergy electricity systems around the world are decarbonising and increasingly switching to renewable power sources while intermittent sources such as solar and wind are the fastest growing types of renewables being installed globally the reliability and flexibility of biomass and its ability to offer grid stabilisation services such as frequency control and inertia make it an increasingly necessary source of renewable power according to the international energy agency biomass generation is forecast to expand as planned projects come online a versatile resource biomass comes in many different forms when looking to assess future demand and use it is important to recognise benefits that different types of biomass bring compressed wood pellets are just one small part of the biomass spectrum which includes many forms of agricultural and livestock residues waste and biproducts  much of which is currently discarded or underutilised maximising the use of these wastes and residues provides plenty of scope for expansion of the biomass energy sector around the world the global installed capacity for biomass generation is expected to reach close to 140 gigawatts gw by 2026  which will be fuelled primarily by expansion in asia using residues from food production and the forestry processing industry however the use of woody biomass can also provide many benefits too such as supplying a market for thinnings providing a use for harvesting residues encouraging better forest management practices and generating increased revenue for forest owners how much surplus exists in areas like the us south traditional markets for forest products have declined whilst forest growth has significantly increased according to the usda forest inventory and analysis fia data there is an average annual surplus of growth in the us south of more than 176 million cubic metres compared to removals  thats enough to make around 84 million tonnes of wood pellets a year from just one supply region of course not all of this surplus growth could or should be used for bioenergy much of it is suitable for high value markets like sawtimber or construction and some of it is located on inaccessible or protected sites however new and additional markets are essential to maintain the health of the forest resource and to encourage forest owners to retain and maintain their forest assets in the current wood pellet supply regions for europe pöyry management consulting has calculated that there is a surplus of low grade wood fibre and residues that could make an additional 140 million tonnes of wood pellets each year  wood pellets in context compressed wood pellets on a conveyor belt it is also necessary to look at the global production of all wood products to put wood pellet production into context in 2016 the global production of industrial roundwood the raw material used for construction furniture paper and other wood products was 187 billion cubic metres while the global production of wood fuel used for domestic heating and cooking was 186 billion cubic metres 1  only around 16 of this feedstock was used to make wood pellets both for industrial energy and residential heat the total production of wood pellets in 2016 was 284 million tonnes of which only 45 was used for industrial energy 2  while forestry consulting and research firm forisk predicts demand for industrial wood pellets those used in electricity generation rather than residential heating will grow globally at an annual rate of 15 for the next five years reaching 275 megatonnes mt by 2023 they are also clear that this growth in context will not impact forest volumes or other markets the wood pellet industry in the us south is not exploding it is a tiny component of the overall market forest volumes in the south in total will continue to grow for decades no matter what bioenergy markets or housing markets do the wood pellet sector simply and unequivocally cannot compete economically with us pulp and paper mills 80 of pulpwood demand in south for raw material on a headtohead basis 3  so while demand for wood pellets is likely to increase over the next 10 years this increase will be well within the scope of existing surplus fibre the question therefore is can suppliers keep up with this demand and can they do this while ensuring it remains sustainable reliable and renewable whats driving demand in the shortterm intelligence firm hawkins wright estimates global demand will increase by almost 30 during 2018 to reach 204 mt while forisk predicts a smaller jump an almost 5 mt increase compared to 2017 most of this will continue to come from europe 73 of global demand by 2021 more than 80 in 2018 where projects such as lynemouth power station s conversion from coal to biomass as well as five cofiring units in the netherlands are all set to come online very soon while smaller in number asia is also developing a growing appetite for biomass and in 2018 demand is forecast to grow by 198 mt these estimates might paint a picture of a continually soaring demand but forisks forecast actually expect this growth to plateau levelling off around 2023 at 275 mt hawkins wright expects a similar slow down forecasting manageable growth of under 15 between 2023 and 2026 a forestry specialist at drax group believes this plateau could come even sooner current and future forecasts in industrial wood pellet demand are based on a series of planned conversions and projects coming online he explains but once these projects are active demand in europe will likely plateau around 2021 and then gradually reduce as various eu support schemes for industrial biomass come to an end any long term use of biomass is likely to be based on agricultural residues and wastes but even with this expected slowdown the biomass demand of the near future will be substantially higher than it is right now so the question remains can suppliers meet the need for biomass pellets responding to todays growing demand meeting this growing demand depends on two factors sufficient raw materials and the production capabilities to turn those materials into biomass pellets in todays market theres no shortage of raw materials and low grade fibre instead what could cause challenges is the production of pellets hawkins wright reports the capacity for global industrial pellet production was roughly 214 mt a year at the end of 2017 and will increase by a further 3 mt by 2019 as facilities currently under construction reach completion it means that to meet even forisks conservative 275 mt prediction by 2023 pellet production needs to increase however draxs forestry specialist points to the three to four years needed to complete pellet facilities and the relatively short period of time financial support programmes will remain in place as something that could lead to a slowdown in new plants coming online instead he says expansions of existing plants and the increased use of smallscale facilities will become crucial to increasing overall production however the biomass market changes and develops it remains critical that proper regulation is in place  efficiencies are found and that technological innovation continues within the forestry industry so forests are grown and managed sustainably as we move into a lowcarbon future we know that biomass demand will increase but for this to be truly beneficial and sustainable we need to ensure we are not only meeting the demand of today but also of tomorrow the day after tomorrow and beyond

energy  investors  sustainability  wood pellets building a sustainable business will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 21 march 2018 opinion the uk energy sector is changing rapidly the boundaries between users suppliers and generators are blurring as energy users are choosing to generate their own energy and are managing their energy use more proactively while conversely generators are increasingly seeing users as potential sources of generation and providers of demand management the uk is undergoing an unprecedented energy revolution with electricity at its heart  a transition to a lowcarbon society requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy in that context our groups purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future this means that sustainability in its broadest sense must be at the very core of what we do successful delivery of our purpose depends on all our people across all our businesses doing the right thing every day with the right products and services we can go even further and help our customers make the right sustainable energy choices as our businesses transform and we embrace a larger customer base different generation technologies and operate internationally the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and becoming more complex at the same time the range of stakeholders looking to drax for responsible leadership on sustainability is increasing the need for transparency is greater than ever so our websites sustainability section provides a comprehensive insight into the groups environmental social and governance management and performance during 2017 some of the highlights include carbon reduction  i am pleased that in 2017 the proportion of our energy generation from renewable sources remained high 65 of our generation during the year came from sustainable biomass and accounted for 15 of the countrys overall renewable generation we maintained our rigorous and robust approach to ensure that we only ever use biomass that is sustainably produced and legally sourced people  another key achievement was the roll out of our people strategy to 2020  one drax  which focuses on talent to deliver on our strategic and operational objectives safety  the health and safety of all our employees and contractors is of paramount importance to drax while the groups safety incident rate remained on target in 2017 the fire at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did cause an outage with disruption lasting into 2018 it highlighted once again that the risks of generating using biomass must be mitigated through robust safety procedures and a riskbased plant investment and maintenance programme safety therefore remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are determined to do even better customers  our business to business b2b energy supply business received recognition for their dedication to customer service opus energy won utilities provider of the year at the british small business awards 2017 we initiated a process which would allow us to participate in the united nations global compact ungc we are committed to the initiative and its ten principles which align with our culture of doing the right thing our websites sustainability section also sets out our commitment to achieving the united nations sustainable development goals through our operations the services we deliver to our customers and in partnership with others global ambitions and goals are important but so too are our ambitions for our local and regional communities as such we have played a key role in the uk northern powerhouse partnership  initiatives such as powerful women and a comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement  sustainability in its broadest sense must be at the very core of what we do finally i do not believe any organisation however well intentioned can get its commitment to sustainability perfect on its own and i am very keen for drax to learn from people reading our websites sustainability section  it sets out what we see as our achievements and aspects in which we believe we need to do better i would like to invite any stakeholder with an interest to comment on what were doing and help us improve where we can feedback can be submitted at contact us or
