ukraine this was particularly true in europe most notably germany where russian gas at the time accounted for a hrefhttpsreportselectricinsightscoukq22022thecostofenergycrisisaround 40 of total gas

embargo on russian gas would be introducedp p stylefontweight 400constrained gas supplies also increased global demand for alternative sources like liquified natural gas lng imports which account for about 22 of the uks gas this increase in demand has pushed up the price of these alternatives forcing countries to compete to attract suppliesp p stylefontweight 400there are several reasons why higher gas prices have such a significant impact on uk energy prices firstly a considerable proportion of uk electricity comes from gas in the second quarter of 2022 gas represented a

provide permanent carbon removal a hrefhttpswwwdraxcomcarboncapturehowdoyoustoreco2andwhathappenstoitwhenyoudo target_blank relnoopenerany risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely smallap pthe risk of reversal for naturebased credits by contrast is much greater schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for naturebased credits are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removalsp prequirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool potentially as much as 10 are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a wellmanged geological store they also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in placep pany ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators similarly where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with cosub2sub storage risk which place liabilities on storage owners operators or governments the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them and no additional liabilities should be put on project developersp pat drax we believe the ccps provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals if applied pragmatically they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product theyre buying and provide a clear

achieve thisp p stylefontweight 400there are a lot of conversations about the need for green skills and reskilling employees in carbonintensive sectors but to put a real definition on whats needed is a lot harder every company must examine its business plan and try to unpick what skills they will need in 10 20 or even 50 years down the line  and in such a fast moving world this can prove to be a real challengep p stylefontweight 400at drax were committed to building on a hrefhttpswwwdraxcomaboutuscorporategovernanceourvisionandvaluesour valuesa as an innovative and best in class place where
