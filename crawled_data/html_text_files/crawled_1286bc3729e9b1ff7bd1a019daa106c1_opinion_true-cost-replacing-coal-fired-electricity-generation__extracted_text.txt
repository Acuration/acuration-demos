power stations writes drax group ceo dorothy thompson theyre being taken off the grid for a number of reasons but a major factor is that coal  rightly  has a limited shelf life in the uk as we strive to meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 17 february 2016 opinion to make up for these closures the government is already planning to bring on new capacity a new gasfired power station will open at carrington this summer and were expecting to hear any day now that another nuclear power station will be created at hinkley point and of course more electricity from renewables must be added over the years ahead as we look to meet our go green targets in fact the government already has a plan in place to award contracts for new green energy off the back of three auctions over the next four years the first of them is due later this year drax understands that every one of those auctions is focused on offshore wind however new independent research published by nera economic consulting and imperial college london questions that single technology approach commissioned by drax group plc from leading economists the research reveals the true cost of the main forms of renewable energy  wind solar and biomass and the evidence shows that opening up these auctions to include other renewables could result in significant savings that could be passed on to consumers where could these savings come from renewables like wind and solar are vital but they are by their very nature intermittent that means other forms of power generation need to be available on standby at very short notice to meet the gap between supply and demand the costs of providing this standby electricity are passed on to consumers in their energy bills but crucially they are not reflected in how the government ranks the support that each type of renewable energy requires essentially the costs are hidden the neraicl research shows that if these hidden costs are added in the true picture is very different when the true costs are taken into account the governments preferred option  offshore wind  turns out to be the most expensive in fact the cheapest option is deploying new technology to existing power stations enabling them to use biomass  essentially replacing coal with compressed wood pellets all in all getting cheaper renewables into the mix could save consumers up to 22bn how support for renewables is already funded through a portion of your energy bill and bringing in a more costeffective mix reduces the support needed that is why we at drax are urging the government to look at the true costs of new renewable capacity and include us in the mix for new power contracts to do so would not only lead to a potential 2bn saving for consumers but replacing more coal with biomass gives the uk that reliable standby power we know we will need when other renewables cant deliver it using the latest technology weve already upgraded half of our power station to run on compressed wood pellets the jobs not done with the right support we want to carry on with the work were doing and help the government to achieve its target of getting coal off the
