thompson as chief executive drax group as of 1 st january 2018 read the announcement to the london stock exchange  this story was written by will two months prior to that announcement and remains unedited below the uk electricity market used to be simpler coal gas and nuclear plants generated energy and fed power into the national grid  retail companies then delivered that power to homes and businesses across the country thanks to regional distribution network operators  today its not as simple the energy system of great britain has grown more complex  it needed to the push to lower carbon emissions led to the introduction of an array of different power generation technologies and fuels to the energy mix these all generate power in different ways at different times and in different conditions added to this are government schemes that have changed how this is all funded in short our electricity market is now more complex drax group has transformed itself to align with this new system it is now an energy company with complementary operations across its supply chain  sourcing fuel  generating 17 of great britains renewable power and then selling much of that electricity directly to business customers in the retail market  this has fundamentally changed both how we do business and the financial mechanisms behind the business where are we now draxs financial and operating strategies are very much interlinked shifting how we generate energy changes how we generate revenue the company is structured according to a set of distinct business segments each of which is treated in a slightly different way the generation business drax has adapted its business model to the uk governments regulatory framework which through successive administrations has broadly promoted investment in renewable and low carbon power generation three of our six electricity generation units  accounting for 68 of our output in the first half of 2017  have been upgraded from coal to produce renewable electricity from sustainable compressed wood pellets  these units are a core part of britains renewable energy mix guaranteed income from the third unit conversion has given us a significantly higher degree of earnings visibility and reduced our exposure to commodity prices h1 2017 107 twh total generation 73 twh biomass generation our coal generation units no longer provide 247 baseload electricity this means we primarily use our coal generation as a support system when the grid needs it we can ramp up and down coal generation responding to demand and ancillary service needs  our renewable generation units do this too ultimately however our longterm goal is to convert the remaining coal units  either to renewables or to gas our research and innovation team is currently looking into how we might be able to do this but early indications show that coaltogas conversion could be an attractive option for delivering flexible and reliable generation capacity for the uk drax power is doing well and generated 137m of ebitda in the first half of this year a 51m increase compared to the first half of 2016 we are confident about the projected growth of our power generation business to 300 million ebitda by 2025 that plan is aided by our move into rapid response gas  a technology that can meet urgent needs of a power system that includes an increasing amount of weatherdependent renewables two of the four rapid response gas projects were developing are ready to bid for 15year capacity market contracts this coming february they are designed to start up from cold faster than coal and combined cycle gas turbine ccgt units these smallyetpowerful plants will respond to shortterm power market price signals and be capable of providing other ancillary services to further enhance security of supply these projects should add an attractive additional source of earnings to our generation business they also will have attractive characteristics as a significant element of their earnings will come from the capacity market  guaranteed government income for 15 years the retail business we directly serve the retail market through haven power  which supplies renewable electricity primarily to industrial and commercial customers last week we announced that haven power was able to breakeven six months ahead of schedule retail is an area were growing and in february 2017 we acquired opus energy  the largest nondomestic uk energy company by meters installed outside the big six this has had a marked effect  today were the largest challenger b2b energy retailer in the uk there is a healthy and regular annuity coming in through the existing retail business and we believe this can generate 80 million of ebitda by 2025 which together with our growing biomass supply business will make up a third of our earnings we demonstrated good progress in the first half of the year earning 11m of ebitda the biomass business our two operational wood pellet manufacturing plants in louisiana and mississippi are progressing well they are both still ramping up to full production and have seen marked improvements in pellet quality and production we are looking to grow our us business and as part of this well need to build on the recent addition of lasalle bioenergy with further acquisitions expansion will grow our capacity for the selfsupply of pellets from 15 to 30 of drax power stations requirements adding an additional one million tonnes of production in the second half of 2017 we expect the profitability of drax biomass to increase lasalle will be commissioned in the first half of 2018 and reach capacity in 2019 whats next the energy landscape continues to change and well need to change with it phasing out coal entirely is priority number one for this well continue to look at options how and when we can convert more units to sustainable biomass depends on trials that we are conducting at drax power station during 201718 the right government support would also make further conversions cost effective we also recognise that its important to look at alternative possibilities for our remaining coal units this is why we are seeking planning permission to convert one or more of our 645 mw megawatt coal units to 1300 mw of gas such an upgrade would be at a discount to a newbuild combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power station of equivalent capacity and thats simply because we would use much of the existing infrastructure and equipment another major prospect is in the technology space and so were continuing to invest in research and innovation batteries and storage are a huge opportunity for us  both in how they could benefit our retail customers and how they could provide solutions for largescale centralised energy systems in short its an area with huge potential we welcome the governments recent initiatives designed to stimulate the development of battery technology  as well as encourage the use of electric vehicles drax has gone through a period of considerable change and that will continue as we meet the uks lowcarbon energy demands we are improving the quality of our earnings reducing our exposure to commodities and positioning to take advantage of future opportunities as we told investors in june if we deliver on these plans we can expect 425 million of ebitda in 2025  tags financial reports  supply chain  gas  investors  electricity generation  will gardiner forbes drax jointsecond most trustworthy company in europe will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 22 april 2016 opinion im delighted that drax group plc has been named by forbes magazine and msci esg research as one of the 50 most trustworthy companies in europe  in fact drax came joint second across the whole continent among companies judged who consistently demonstrated transparent accounting practices and solid corporate governance its a massive tribute to everyone involved with drax that worldleading business experts have recognised our commitment to trust and integrity in this way of course that commitment goes much further than our accounting practices alone i believe my british colleagues would say that it runs right through drax like the writing in a stick of rock indeed it was one of the reasons i was so honoured to be asked to join drax as cfo  from my very first meeting with ceo dorothy thompson i could see that drax would always strive do the right thing in the right way thats just as true for our sustainability data as it is for our business data it was our commitment to doing the right thing that led drax to take on the decision to convert drax power station from coal to compressed wood pellets  it is our commitment to doing the right thing that means drax is reducing emissions by over 80 per cent while giving people and businesses all over the uk the reliable renewable power that they need and we know we can save billpayers money at the same time the uk is lagging far behind the rest of europe when it comes to generating energy from compressed wood pellets drax is committed to bringing us closer to the european average while helping us move from the fossil fuels of the past to the renewables of the future and yes you can trust us on that tags investors  sustainability  corporate governance  will gardiner three ways to judge a cfo will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 17 december 2015 opinion its a good question because you cant build a great company without a great chief financial officer cfo but as a shareholder how can you judge how well your cfo is doing without setting myself up for a fall the answer i gave our investor broke down into these three questions are they keeping control at its heart the first part of any cfos role is to make sure that their business is under control and that all risks are being properly managed they need to maintain a strong balance sheet and keep reporting and communications clear and transparent above all they need to make sure there are no surprises are they improving efficiency the second part is making sure the organisation is always working as efficiently as possible keeping a strong hand on costs and ensuring that current revenue streams are always optimised above all they need to be making sure that less money is going out and more money is coming into the organisation are they allocating capital wisely the final task of any cfo is investing shareholders money in the best projects  first internally and second externally above all they need to have a clear consideration of cash returns for shareholders so now the next time you wonder how well your cfo is doing you know how to judge them this article was originally published by will on linkedin
