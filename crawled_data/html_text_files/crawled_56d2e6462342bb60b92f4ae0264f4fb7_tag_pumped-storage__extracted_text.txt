was an issue resolved by complex continentwide gas pipelines which stretched from russia into the heart of europe we now know this reliance on russian gas didnt strengthen europes energy security  in fact it weakened it the uk is less reliant on foreign gas than many countries in europe in part due to the renewables revolution which has transformed our energy system over the last decade the rollout of biomass wind and solar power has enabled the uk to decarbonise its power grid at a faster rate than any other major economy and in order to reduce energy bills in the years ahead we need to have more clean green renewable power which is generated in the uk for the uk getting more green energy onto the grid can only be achieved through partnerships between government and private companies for businesses like drax that means having the right policies now to make largescale investment decisions for the future in vital green energy technologies like pumped storage hydro and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs drax has submitted planning applications for two major infrastructure projects designed to deliver both of these vital technologies in the 2020s they form part of a 3bn investment strategy which drax stands ready to implement this decade underlining the companys significant role as a growing global business at the heart of the green energy transition alongside strengthening the uks longterm energy security these projects will support thousands of jobs and provide a real opportunity for economic growth engineers at cruachan power station we aim to double the capacity of our cruachan pumped hydro storage facility in scotland supporting energy security and further decarbonisation of the grid at lower costs over the last two years due to bottlenecks on the transmission system and a lack of energy storage capacity enough wind power to supply 800000 homes each year with renewable electricity went to waste as household bills and global temperatures continue to rise we cant afford to let renewable power go to waste like this we need more storage to harness the wind power available now as well as the increased capacity being developed the coming years the only proven grid scale technology that can store vast quantities of energy for long durations is pumped storage hydro sites like cruachan act like giant water batteries using excess power from the grid to pump water to an upper reservoir where it is stored before rereleasing it to generate electricity while the uks policy and market support mechanisms have evolved to support new build renewables the current framework isnt suitable for pumped storage projects that can have a lifespan of many decades draxs plans would enable more homegrown renewable power to come online to strengthen the uks energy security and lower carbon emissions this additional capacity could be available within eight years to secure private investment in these projects get shovels in the ground and work underway developers need to know the policy environment they will be operating in abandoning or delaying net zero will not save the country money it will increase our reliance on foreign gas leaving households at the mercy of international markets which no uk government can control find out more about cruachan 2 here  in scotland alone there is more than 43 gw of storage projects in planning or awaiting construction  this is enough capacity to power around three million homes drax alongside the developers of some of these other projects has put forward plans for policies which would create the certainty needed to incentivise investment and kick start work to build the storage capacity this country needs for energy security these include introducing a cap and floor regime  the same support mechanism which was instrumental in the successful rollout of interconnectors in britain i urge the new conservative party leader to make the governments response to these proposals a priority as part of the package of measures needed to bolster the uks long term energy security and to bring the longerterm cost of energy down with the right policies to unlock investment the uk can lead the world in energy storage technologies which are urgently needed to keep the lights on cut carbon emissions and keep us on track to reach net zero this article was first published by business green  tags cruachan  cruachan power station  energy storage  pumped storage  will gardiner getting britain ready for the next generation of energy projects 15 july 2022 power generation key takeaways as the uk continues to expand its renewable capacity the cost of curtailing wind generation at times of low demand is increasing adding 806 million to bills over the last two years curtailment costs arise from the grid paying to turn down generation due to energy balancing or system balancing issues longduration storage such as pumped storage hydro offers a way to absorb excess wind power reducing the cost of keeping the system balanced draxs plans to expand cruachan power station would increase the amount of excess power it can absorb from 400 mw to over one gigawatt and rapidly deliver the same amount back to the grid when needed new financial mechanisms such as a cap and floor regime are needed to enable investors to back capitalintensive longterm projects that will save consumers and the grid millions meeting big ambitions takes big actions and therere few ambitions as big or as urgent as achieving a net zero power sector by 2035 this energy transition must mean more low carbon power sources and fewer fossil fuels but delivering that future requires new ways of managing power balancing the grid and a new generation of technologies innovation and thinking to make big projects a reality as the system evolves and more renewables particularly wind come online the uk is forecast to need 10 times more energy storage to deliver power when windlevels drop as well as absorb excess electricity when supply outstrips demand and to maintain grid stability pumped hydro storage offers a tried and tested solution but with no new longduration storage projects built for almost 40 years in the uk the challenges of bringing longterm projects to fruition are less engineering than they are financial draxs plan to expand cruachan power station to add as much as 600 megawatts mw of additional capacity will help support a renewable more affordable net zero electricity system but government action is needed to unlock a new generation of projects that deliver electricity storage at scale reigning in excess wind power wind is the keystone power source in the uks renewable ambitions wind capacity increased from 54 gw in 2010 to 257 gw in 2021  enough to provide renewable power for almost 20 million homes  and the government aims to increase this to 50 gw by 2030 however wind comes with challenges the volume of electricity being generated must always match the level of demand if there is a spike in electricity demand when there are low windlevels other technologies such as electricity storage or carbonemitting gas power are required to make up the shortfall conversely if there is too much wind power being generated and not enough demand for electricity the grid often has to pay windfarms to stop generating this is known as wind curtailment and its becoming more expensive growing from 300 million during 2020 to more than 500 million in 2021 an independent report by lane clark  peacock lcp by drax found that over the last two years curtailing wind power added 806 million to energy bills in britain there can also be a carbon cost to curtailing wind power as more intermittent renewables come onto the system the grid can become more unstable and difficult to balance in such an event the national grid is required to turn to fossil fuel plants like gas generation that can deliver balancing and ancillary services like inertia voltage control and reserve power that wind and solar cant provide its loselose for everyone says richard gow senior government policy manager at drax consumers are paying money to turn off wind and to turn up gas generation because therere not enough sources of ancillary services on the system or renewable power cant be delivered to where its needed curtailment costs have spiked this year because of gas prices and while they might dip in the next two or three years curtailment costs are only ever going to increase if theres wind power on the system without an increase in storage the cost of managing the system is only going to go up and up source the lcps renewable curtailment and the role of long duration storage report click to viewdownload here  the proposed cruachan 2 expansion would help the grid avoid paying to turn off wind farms by increasing the amount it would be able to absorb from 400 mw to over 1000 mw and rapidly deliver the same amount of zero carbon power back to the grid should wind levels suddenly drop or the grid need urgent balancing adding this kind of capability is a huge engineering project involving huge new underground caverns tunnels and waterways carved out of the rock below ben cruachan however the challenge in such a project lies less with the scale of the engineering than with its financeability from blueprints to real change the original cruachan power stations sixyear construction period began in 1959 the work of digging into the mountainside was carried out by a team of 1300 men known affectionately as the tunnel tigers  armed with hand drills and gelignite explosives in an era before modern health and safety practices engineer working at cruachan power station expanding cruachan in the 21 st century will be quite a different and safer process and one thats practically straightforward there is no reason why we physically couldnt build cruachan 2 says gow detailed engineering work has indicated that this is a very feasible project theres no technological reason or physical constraint that would prevent us it has a large upfront cost and requires drilling into a mountain but the challenge is much more on the financial particularly securing the investment side of the project pumped storage hydro facilities today generate their revenues from three different markets the capacity market where they receive a flat rate per kilowatt they deliver to the grid the wholesale and balancing market where they buy power to store when its abundant and cheap and sell it back to the grid when its needed more valuable and used to support the electricity system operator in matching supply and demand on a secondbysecond basis and through ancillary services contracts dedicated to specific stability services  these available markets present challenges for ambitious capitalintensive projects designed to operate at scale with the exception of the capacity market revenues from these markets are often volatile and difficult to forecast with no longterm contracts available sourcing the investment needed to build projects on the scale of cruachan 2 requires mechanisms to attract investors comfortable with long project development lead times that offer stable low risk rates of return in the longterm cap and floor an approach that can provide sufficient certainty to investors that income will cover the cost of debt and unlock finance for new projects is known as a cap and floor regime with cap and floor a facilitys revenues are subject to minimum and maximum levels if revenues are below the floor consumers would topup revenues while earnings above the cap would be returned to consumers this means investors can secure upfront funding safe in the knowledge of revenue certainty in the long term whilst also offering protection to consumers such an approach wont attract investors looking to make a fast buck but the vital role that it could play in the ongoing future of the uk energy system offers a longterm stable return at the same time the system would save both the grid and energy consumers hundreds of millions of pounds the cap and floor system is also not unique with a similar approach currently used for interconnectors  the submarine cables that physically connect the uks energy system to nearby countries allowing the uk to trade electricity with them this means investors are already familiar with cap and floor structures how they operate and what kind of returns they can expect its not just pumped storage hydro that this could apply to explains gow there are other different largescale longduration storage technologies that this could also apply to it would give us revenue certainty so that we can invest to support the system and reduce the cost of curtailment while ensuring consumers get value for their money the turbine hall inside cruachan power station cruachan was originally only made possible through the advocacy and actions of mp and wartime secretary of state for scotland tom johnston then it was needed to help absorb excess generation from the countrys new fleet of nuclear power stations and release this to meet short term spikes in demand today its renewable wind the system must adapt to for the uk to continue to meet an everchanging energy system the government must be prepared to act and enable projects at scale that bring longterm transformation for a
