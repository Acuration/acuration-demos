archives press release uk tops global decarbonisation league amid renewable revolution 30 november 2020 press releases uks electricity system has more than halved its carbon intensity in the last decade decarbonising twice as fast as any other major economy demonstrating the uks climate leadership ahead of cop26 the rise of renewables means british households have reduced their co 2 emissions by three quarters of a tonne per year  equivalent to the co 2 emitted when a family of four flies off on holiday to spain new ambitious targets to grow offshore wind to 40 gigawatts by 2030 in the uk will require the expansion of energy storage technologies able to capture excess power independent analysis conducted via imperial consultants by academics from imperial college london for drax electric insights shows the uks move away from coal to renewable power sources such as biomass and wind has dramatically driven down carbon emissions the change in electricity carbon intensity in the worlds thirty largest markets over the last decade click to viewdownload renewable power has grown sixfold in the last decade helping the uk to cut its carbon intensity by 58 this is double the reduction seen in other major economies over the same period generation from coal fell from 30 per cent to just two per cent of power produced over the period with renewables rising at the same time from eight per cent to supplying 42 per cent of the countrys electricity the changes to where our electricity comes from means british households have each reduced their co 2 emissions by three quarters of a tonne per year compared to the start of the decade which is roughly equivalent to the co 2 generated by a family of four taking a return flight from the uk to spain dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly electric insights reports said the uk has decarbonised its power grid at an astonishing rate over the last decade the country has transformed itself from relying on coal to keep the lights on to having its first coalfree month since the industrial revolution while this progress in the power sector has been rapid we now need to decarbonise wider society by using electricity to heat our homes and power our cars to achieve net zero by 2050 as the world marks five years since the paris agreement the uk offers an example of how fast energy transitions can be made the uks power system is set to grow even greener after the prime minister set a new target of installing 40 gigawatts gw of offshore wind by 2030 however the drax electric insights report also outlines the need for the uk grid to become more flexible to deliver this ambition with careful management required to keep the system stable once this ambition is realised upwards of 37 twh of excess electricity will be generated annually amid diverging weather and demand by 2030  with wind and solar power being unable to provide all the services needed to stabilise the system and maintain secure supplies one solution to this challenge is to expand storage capacity by increasing the role pumped storage hydro plays in storing excess power when supply outstrips demand and then to rapidly plug gaps when the wind is not blowing to provide fast flexible power and greater system stability will gardiner drax group ceo said the uk has made incredible progress decarbonising the electricity system over the last decade  for its part drax has drastically reduced its carbon emissions by 85 as a result of transforming the power station in north yorkshire to use sustainable biomass instead of coal making it the largest decarbonisation project in europe we share the governments ambition to go even further by embracing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and flexible technologies liked pumped storage hydro we will enable the uks power system to evolve and provide the secure and sustainable electricity supplies a zero carbon economy needs supporting the governments ten point plan for climate change whilst levelling up the economy drax recognises the potential of pumped storage hydro and is considering how its iconic cruachan site could be expanded  the group aims to become carbon negative by 2030 through pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire which could deliver millions of tonnes of negative emissions and simultaneously provide the grid with vital stability services while creating thousands of new jobs ends media contacts aidan kerr drax group media manager e email

fallen from from 450 grams of co 2 per kwh to 195gkwh since 2010 the co 2 emissions per passenger emitted by a return flight from london heathrow to madrid is 195kg  which adds up to 780kg for a

generate thousands of jobs from as early as 2024 kickstarting a whole new industry in the uk carbon capture and hydrogen could deliver more than 205000 jobs nationally attracting investment as well as new export opportunities to support a green industrial revolution this is a huge opportunity for the humber and the uk to demonstrate global climate leadership ahead of cop26 in 2021 cutting edge green energy technologies in the humber could boost skills create tens of thousands of jobs and transform the regions fortunes in the face of economic uncertainty caused by the covid crisis according to a new report from vivid economics  the report was commissioned by drax group a founding member of the zero carbon humber partnership to evaluate the socioeconomic potential largescale deployment of cuttingedge green energy technologies would have on the region and the uk vivid economics analysis shows that scaling up bioenergy with carbon capture technology beccs which drax has already successfully proven at its power station in north yorkshire would support almost 17000 jobs during construction in 2028 will gardiner drax group ceo said drax group ceo will gardiner in the control room at drax power station click to viewdownload the boost to the economy created by developing these new green energy technologies in the yorkshire and humber region would be huge  and we can do it quickly the technologies are ready to go so tens of thousands of jobs could be created as early as 2024 this would deliver a real shot in the arm to communities struggling as a result of the covid crisis the positive impacts of these new green energy schemes arent limited to the humber region either this could kickstart a whole new industry in the uk enabling us to show the world what can be achieved for the environment and the economy when governments businesses and communities work together using carbon capture technology across draxs four biomass units would accelerate the uks efforts to reach net zero by permanently removing 16 million tonnes of co 2 from the atmosphere each year  a significant proportion of the negative emissions the uk needs to meet its net zero targets with the right policies from government beccs could be operational at drax as soon as 2027 accelerating the humbers efforts to become the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster other industries across the

investment in these sectors we can hope to unlock yet more economic potential for the north companies like drax play a vital role in decarbonising the economy and closing the north  south divide to build back better british chamber of commerce director general adam marshall said coronavirus has had a significant impact on our business communities to help them restart rebuild and renew the

report found that as many as 49000 jobs would be created and supported in the humber region if bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs as well as hydrogen and other carbon removal technologies are deployed to decarbonise industry with government backing for the proposals these new jobs could begin to be created as early as 2024 peaking at 49000 jobs in 2027 within the jobs created in the humber there would be around 25000 high quality roles in construction  as well as welders pipe fitters machine installers and technicians with a further 24000 supported across the supply chain and wider economy in 2027 in addition there would be 3300 longer term operational and maintenance roles created the initiative would also deliver over 3bn in gva for the regional economy in 2027 without

almost 50 years ago when the first half of the power station was built and came into operation in 1974 the power station works by using boilers to heat water and make high pressure steam which is used to spin turbines and generate electricity the steam is then cooled inside the cooling towers and the water is returned to the boiler to be heated again about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a
