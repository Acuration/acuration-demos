technology available and can be deployed quickly  playing a key role in achieving net zero by 2050 what is beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide co2 that is generated during the production of electricity from sustainable biomass this is the only carbon removal technology that also generates low carbon renewable power why is beccs important for decarbonisation unlike the linear irreversible process of emitting carbon from fossil fuels sustainable biomass exists in a closed carbon cycle by adding carbon capture and storage technology the carbon cycle is broken instead of being released into the atmosphere carbon is transported and stored in a secure geological formation underground producing whats known as an engineered carbon dioxide removal the impact of beccs in the uk our cuttingedge carbon removal technologies will help the uk and the world hit net zero ccus and beccs present significant export opportunities since the uk has ample storage space for significant levels of co2 beneath its territorial waters there is also a significant opportunity for the uk to store co2 for other countries as part of a larger carbon capture use and storage ccus export of technology and expertise the early development of a ccus industry in the uk will allow us to seize this export and storage opportunity early otherwise other countries will take our place the uk has developed a substantial biomass import logistics network and supply chains that can continue to be utilised in the long term deployment of beccs at plants such as drax means that these existing supply chains  where significant investment has already been made  would lower the overall capital costs of developing new infrastructure the economies of scale that large power plants like drax provide mean that this co2 can be captured more cost effectively than in smaller plants beccs careers beccs consultation support beccs at drax 40 the first unit of beccs at drax power station will deliver 40 of the negative emissions which are required to reach net zero in the uk according to the ccc 10000 developing beccs at drax power station will deliver significant advantages for local communities and help revitalise the north of england the technology will support 10000 jobs and make the region a global centre for excellence in green skills 80 during the beccs construction phase at drax power station in north yorkshire drax will spend 100 million across our supply chain  with an ambition that 80 of construction spend will go to uk

frequently asked questions what is beccs how does beccs achieve negative emissions is beccs a proven technology is beccs sustainable will beccs at drax create any new jobs how will beccs be funded is transporting and storing co2 safe how will the captured carbon be stored click to viewdownload beccs is an innovative technology that has been developed to permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere beccs provides negative emissions as well as stable renewable electricity and will play a vital role in tackling the climate crisis and supporting energy security what is beccs negative emissions are created when you permanently remove more co2 from the atmosphere than is created across your operations with beccs flue gases are produced when sustainable biomass is used to generate renewable electricity these gasses are captured through a chemical reaction the captured co2 is then stored permanently in deposits such as saline aquifers found under the sea the process of electricity generation becomes carbon negative as more co 2 has been removed from the atmosphere than has been added what are negative emissions yes drax has been testing a number of carbon capture technologies since our first trail began in 2018 carbon capture technology is not new and has been used in the fossil fuel and oil  gas industries for many years there are currently 26 ccs facilities operating worldwide with a further 39 either planned or under construction research commissioned by drax shows there is enough sustainable biomass available globally to support beccs projects to capture up to 4gt of co 2 without adversely impacting forest health biodiversity or food security this is equivalent to four times the annual co 2 emissions from commercial aviation learn more about sustainable biomass beccs by drax offers a decarbonisation route that protects and creates jobs retaining highquality jobs and boosting local economies beccs at drax power station could create and support over 10000 jobs locally and across the entire supply chain by deploying cuttingedge green technologies across the humber this could rise to 47800 jobs at peak according to a report by vivid economics beccs careers in the current energy crisis and economic climate its vital that new projects such as beccs provide cost effective solutions that not only support energy security but also deliver on net zero targets by having the right policies which incentivise investment we could see a repeat of the success seen with the cfds for offshore wind  that sector has reached grid parity and no longer requires subsidies a recent report commissioned by drax by consultancy frontier economics looked into the optimum funding methods that would allow negative emissions technologies like beccs be delivered cost effectively the drax beccs project would be financed through private investment however as negative emissions in the uk are not currently rewarded or incentivised today we need the uk government to create an investment framework that would provide the necessary confidence to drax and its investors to commit capital to the project this approach has been very successful previously with the support given to renewables like wind solar and biomass  as a result the uks electricity system has decarbonised at a faster rate than any other countrys beccs delivery yes drax alongside our partners  national grid ventures and equinor  have decades of experience safely transporting gas by pipeline and injecting and storing co 2 in saline aquifers offshore in the uk the north sea is already home to significant ccs projects such as the equinoroperated sleipner field in the norwegian sector which is now capturing and storing around 1 million tonnes of co2 each year from natural gas since the sleipner project started in 1996 around 20 million tonnes of co 2 has been safely captured and stored under the seabed estimates suggest the uk could have up to 80 billion tonnes of co 2 storage accessible offshore and the sleipner field ccs project demonstrates the feasibility of this technology and the potential for britain to use the north sea in the fight against climate change transporting carbon  how to safely move co 2 from the atmosphere to permanent storage captured carbon can be safely and permanently injected deep underground into naturally occurring porous rock formations the carbon is trapped in multiple ways structurallyanimpermeable caprock above the reservoir stops co2 migrating back to the surface in solution  porous rocks often contain salty water
