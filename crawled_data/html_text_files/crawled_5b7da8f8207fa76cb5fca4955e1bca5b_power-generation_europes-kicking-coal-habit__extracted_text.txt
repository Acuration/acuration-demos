power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station europes kicking its coal habit ambitious goals and lowcarbon alternatives are helping the continent make coal history 19 april 2018 power generation from roman mines to the fuel behind the continentwide industrial revolution europe has a long history with coal  but with reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions now firmly on the global agenda europes love for coal is rapidly declining collectively the eu aims for renewable sources to account for 20 of gross final energy consumption by 2020 and 27 by 2030  countries in and outside the eu as well as businesses and organisations are setting ambitious targets to phase out coal as part of the uk and canadaled powering past coal alliance which drax recently signed up to  european countries coalfree date according to europe beyond coal updated september 2020 austria  2020 france  2022 portugal  2023 uk  2024 ireland  italy  2025 greece  2028 finland  netherlands  2029 denmark  hungary  portugal  2030 germany  2038 czech republic  spain  phase out under discussion bosnia herzegovina bulgaria  croatia  kosovomontenegro  poland  romaniaserbia slovakia slovenia  spain  turkey  no phase out date belgium  cyprus  estonia  iceland  latvia  lithuania  luxembourg  malta  norway  sweden switzerland  no coal in electricity mix this movement is not only being fuelled by an increased capacity in wind and solar generation but also by other lowcarbon energy sources enabling countries to kick their coal habits aiming for 100 renewable as myth after myth is dispelled about renewables  there are countries proving it is possible to power a modern developed nation entirely through renewable energy sources up in the northernmost reaches of europe iceland already generates all its electricity from renewable sources this is split between 75 hydropower and 25 geothermal power  geothermal not only offers a renewable source of electricity but also hot water for heating the volcanic island nation a geothermal power station steams on a cold day in iceland hydropower is also a key contributor to norways renewable ambitions with more than 31 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower capacity norway is able to rely on it as a source of electricity and export its plentiful oil and natural gas reserves to countries still dependent on fossil fuels many parts of europe are well suited to hydropower with reliable rainfall and the mountainous topography necessary to construct dams and power stations parts of austria romania and georgia also make substantial use of hydropower as a source of electricity artificial lake behind the bicaz dam at sunset romania for countries without this access to largescale hydropower its the increased installation of renewables that holds the key to eliminating the need for coal growing renewable generation last year saw electricity generation from renewable sources overtake that from coal for the first time thanks to continuous expansion of wind solar and biomass capacity around the continent between 2010 and 2017 generation from wind solar and biomass installations in eu countries more than doubled from 302 terawatt hours twh to 670 twh according to eurostat  driven primarily by an increase in wind capacity as a source of renewable electricity wind has already proved capable of generating major portions of a countrys demand managing to meet 44 of denmarks overall demand in 2017  this was after previously producing a 40 electricity surplus one day for the country  allowing it to export the emissionfree electricity to neighbours wind turbines on the east coast of sweden across the eu generation from wind more than doubled from 150 twh to 364 twh from 2010 to last year while solar generation grew five times from 23 twh to 119 twh and biomass jumped from 129 twh to 196 twh by contrast coal and lignite fell from 818 twh to 669 twh these renewable electricity sources along with hydropower now account for 30 of eu countries collective electricity generation and while coal generation continues to drop other low carbon energy sources particularly nuclear still play essential roles in many european energy systems from coal to low carbon sweden is one of the leaders in renewable electricity generation setting 2040 as the date to move to totally renewable energy however while it currently counts 65 gw of wind capacity installed and has already exceeded its 2020 renewable generation goals  the countrys 10 nuclear reactors still make up 40 of its electricity output  sweden aims to phasenuclear out of its energy mix but this will force it to import more power from neighbours to meet demand  france is even more dependent with nuclear making up 75 of its electricity production and earning more than 3 billion a year for the country in exports it aims to reduce its nuclear generation to 50 with president emmanuel macron claiming continued nuclear generation offers  the most carbonfree way to produce electricity with renewables  fessenheim nuclear and hydroelectric power plants in alsace france as a reliable and lowcarbon source of electricity the most modern nuclear power stations add a certain amount of flexibility to grids enabling greater adoption of intermittent renewable sources across the eu nuclear made up a quarter of electricity generation in 2017  gas in the transition much more flexible than nuclear gas plays an essential role in many countries it accounted for 19 of electricity generation in the eu last year and produces around half the co 2 and just one tenth of the air pollutants of coal  gas turbines can begin generating electricity at full power in just 30 minutes from a cold start  or 10 minutes from warm standby allowing it to plug any gaps in demand left by intermittent renewables its ability to provide many system services such as reserve power and frequency response will see it play an important transition role over the coming decades until cleaner technologies are able to take over artists impression of a drax rapidresponse gas power station ocgt with planning permission coal is not gone yet making up 11 of eus electricity generation in 2017 but the momentum behind decarbonisation is keeping europe on track to meet its ambitious emissions target and take the final step away from coal share related stories
