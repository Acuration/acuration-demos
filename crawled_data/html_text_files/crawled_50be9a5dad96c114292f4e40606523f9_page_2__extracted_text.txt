power station tag flexibility and stability and power system security how close is great britains electricity to zerocarbon emissions 15 may 2019 power generation demand for electricity might have been 6 lower in the first three months of 2019 than in last years first quarter but the demand for lower carbon power is only growing and theres more pressure than ever for global industries to decarbonise more rapidly aided by a significantly milder winter than last year  great britains electricity sector continued to make further progress in reducing carbon emissions in the first quarter q1 of 2019 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity was almost 20 lower in q1 2019 than in the same period last year this was driven by a significant decrease in coal usage with 581 coalfree hours in total over the period  eight times more than in q1 2018 this trend has only increased with may seeing the countrys first coalfree week in modern times the findings come from electric insights  a report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london that analyses great britains electricity consumption and looks at what the future might hold as public commercial and political demand for lower carbon emissions mounts the question for the power system is can it truly reach zeroemissions keeping a zerocarbon system stable quarter after quarter the carbon intensity of great britains electricity system has declined from 545 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatt hour gkwh in q1 2012 to just over 200 gkwh last quarter for a single hour carbon emissions have fallen as low as just 56 gkwh but how soon can that figure reach all the way down to netzero carbon emissions the national grids electricity system operator eso believes it could be as soon as 2025  but some serious changes are needed to make it possible for the system to operate safely and efficiently when you have fewer sources offering balancing services like reserve power inertia frequency response and voltage control  the national grid eso believes an approach that establishes a marketplace for trading services holds the solution the hope is that competition will breed new innovation and bring new technologies such as gridscale storage and ai into the commercial energy markets offering reserve power and more accurate forecasting for solar and wind power for the meantime weatherdependent technologies are a key source of renewable electricity in great britain with wind making up more than 20 of all generation in q1 2019 however with wind capacity only expected to increase how should the system react when its not an option read the full article coauthored by julian leslie head of national control national grid eso how low can we go we cannot control the weather  but we can harness its power today there are around 20 gigawatts gw of wind capacity installed around great britain and this is forecast to double to 40 gw in the next seven years however average wind output can fluctuate between 2 gw one day and 12 gw the next  as happened twice in january it highlights the ongoing needs for flexibility and diversity of sources in the electricity system even as it decarbonises there are a number of ways to make up for shortfalls in wind generation the most obvious of which is through other existing sources there is more solar installed around the county than any source of generation except gas at 129 gw and sun power helped meet demand during a wind drought last summer  solar averaged 13 gw over the last 12 months this is more than coal which accounted for 11 gw however storage will also be important in delivering low or zerocarbon sources of electricity when there is neither wind nor sufficient sunlight at present this includes pumped storage and some battery technologies but in future will include greater use of gridscale lithiumion batteries as well as vehicletogrid systems that can take advantage of power stored in idle electric cars httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 new fuels particularly hydrogen also have the potential to meet demand and help create a wider lowercarbon economy for heating  as well as vehicle fuel with water as the only emission hydrogen can be produced from natural gas or using excess electricity from renewable sources or through carbon capture from industrial emissions  it can then be stored for a long time and at scale before being used to generate electricity rapidly when needed another increasingly important source of great britains electricity is interconnectors however they are not yet being used in a way that can support gaps in the electricity system with northern european countries normally all experiencing the same weather  and wind levels  at the same time read the full article what to do when the wind doesnt blow a bigger future for interconnection great britain added a new power source to its electricity system in q1 2019 in the form of belgium the opening of the 600 million nemo link between kent and zeebrugge added another 1 gw of interconnection capacity it joins connections to france the netherlands northern ireland and the republic of ireland to bring great britains total interconnection capacity to 5 gw these links accounted for 79 of the 78 terawatt hours twh of electricity consumed over the quarter electricity from imports also set new records for a daily average of 43 gw on 24 february  accounting for 129 of total consumption and a monthly average in march when it made up 106 of consumption  these records represent the first time great britain fell below 90 for electricity selfsufficiency with 34 gw of new interconnectors under construction coming online by 2022 and 91 gw more planned to be completed over the next five years great britains neighbours are set to play a growing role in the countrys electricity mix however while interconnectors offer an often costeffective way for great britain to ensure electricity supply meets demand the carbon intensity of neighbouring countries electricity should also be considered read the full article 10 of electricity now generated abroad the need for crossborder decarbonisation the new link to belgium has imported rather than exported electricity every day since it began operations as belgium has the lowest natural gas prices in europe and its power stations pay 16 per tonne less for carbon emissions than their british counterparts this makes it cheaper to import and less carbon intense than electricity from the more coaldependant netherlands and ireland planned links to germany and denmark could allow great britain to import more renewable power however if there is a wind drought across northern europe these countries often turn to their emissionsheavy coal or even dirtier lignite sources france is currently great britains cleanest source of imports mostly using nuclear and renewable generation however when the north sea link opens in 2021 it will give great britain access to norways abundance of hydropower to plug gaps in renewable generation considering the carbon intensity of great britains imports is important because the decarbonisation needed to address the global climate change emergency cant be solved by one country alone for electricity emissions to go as low as they can it takes collaboration that goes across borders read the full article where do britains imports come from explore the quarters data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk  read the full report

future 6 july 2018 power generation its not news to say great britains electricity system is changing low carbon electricity sources are on course to go from 22 of national generation in 2010 to 58 by 2020 as installation of wind and solar systems continue to grow but while there has been much change in the sources fuelling electricity generation the system itself is still adapting to this transformation when the national grid was first established in the 1920s it was designed with coal and big spinning turbines in mind it meant that just about every megawatt coming onto the system was generated by thermal power plants as a result the mechanisms keeping the entire system stable  from the way frequency and voltage is managed to how to start up the country after a mass black out  relied on the same technology these ancillary services  those that stabilise the system  are crucial to maintaining a balanced electricity system ancillary services are needed to make sure demand is met by generation and that generation gets from one place to the next with no interruptions explains ian foy head of ancillary services at drax because whats important is that all demand must be met instantaneously in todays power system however weather dependent technology like offshore wind and home solar panels are increasingly making up the countrys electricity generation their intermittency or variability is in turn impacting both the stability of the grid and how ancillary services are provided running a large power system with as much as 85 intermittent generation  for example on a very windy clear sunny day  is thought to be achievable it isnt a scenario anticipated for the large island of great britain but to deal with the fastpace of change on its power system which recently managed to briefly achieve 47 wind in its fuel mix  there is a need to develop new techniques technologies and ways of working to change how the countrys grid is balanced new storage tech takes on balancing services one of the technologies thats expected to provide an increasing amount of balancing services is gridscale batteries  one stabilisation function offered by batteries and other electricity storage options is to provide reserve at times when demand peaks or troughs this matches electricity demand and generation combined with their ability to respond quickly to changes in frequency batteries can be a significant source of frequency response batteries can also absorb and generate reactive power  which can then be deployed to push voltage up or down when it starts to creep too far from the 400kv or 275kv target depending on the powerlines the electricity is travelling along needed to safely move electricity around the grid the challenge with batteries is that the quantity of megawatt hours mwh required to compensate for intermittency is very large the difference between the peak and trough on any day may be more than 20 gw for several hours see for yourself at electric insights  the significant price reductions in battery storage apply to technologies with short duration or low volume mwhs these are the technologies which have been developed at scale recently but will probably struggle to make up in any large quantity any shortfalls in generation resulting from prolonged periods of low intermittent generation a challenge currently being addressed relates to maintenance of battery state of charge this is a consequence of battery storage having a cycle efficiency of less than 100 this means that losses from continuous charging and recharging will have to be replenished from the available generation to avoid batteries going empty and being unavailable for grid services ultralow carbon advances rather than relying on batteries to provide ancillary services to support intermittent generation technical advancements are allowing the wind and solar facilities  which are generating more and more of the countrys electricity  to do so themselves the traditional photovoltaic pv inverters found on solar arrays were initially designed to push out as much active or real power as possible however new smart pv inverters are capable of providing or absorbing reactive power when it is needed to help control voltage as well as continuing to provide active power the major advantage of smart inverters is the limited equipment update required to existing solar farms to allow them to offer reactive power control the challenge here is that pv is embedded in distribution systems and therefore reactive services they provide may not cure all the problems on the transmission system similarly existing wind installations have traditionally focused on getting the greatest amount of megawatts from the available resources but with fewer thermal power stations on the grid ways of balancing the system with wind turbines are also being developed inertia is the force that comes from heavy spinning generators and acts as a damper on the system to limit the rate of change of frequency fluctuations while wind turbines have massive rotating equipment they are not connected to the grid in a way that they automatically provide inertia however research is exploring whats known as inertial response emulation that may allow wind turbines to offer faster frequency response this works through an algorithm that measures grid frequency and controls the power output of a wind turbine or whole farm to compensate for frequency deviations or quickly provide increases or decreases in power on the system inertial response emulation cannot be a complete substitute for inertia but can reduce the minimum required inertia on the system even in a future where the majority of the countrys electricity comes from renewable sources thermal generators may still be able to provide benefits to the system by running in synchronous compensation mode ie producing or consuming reactive power without real power however what is vitally important for the future of balancing services in great britain is a healthy transparent and investable market for generators demand side response and storage whether connected on the transmission or distribution networks a market for the future grid one of the primary needs of balancing service providers is greater transparency into how national grid procures and pays for services currently national grid does not pay for inertia with it becoming more important to grid stability incentive is needed to encourage generators with the capability to provide it those technologies that cant provide inertia could be encouraged to research and develop ways they could do so in the future standardising the services needed will help ensure providers deliver balancing products to the same level needed to support the grid it would also benefit from fixed requirements and timings for such services bundling related products such as reserve and frequency control and active power and voltage management will also offer operational and cost efficiencies to the providers driving investment in balancing services for the future ultimately requires the availability of longerterm contracts to offer financial certainty for the providers and their investors bridge to the future click to view larger graphic for the challenges of decarbonisation to be met in a socially responsible way great britains power system must be operated at as low a cost as possible to consumers with new technologies almost anything could be possible but operating them has to be affordable in many cases

ancillary services the night shift 21 june 2018 power generation things are different at night as darkness falls the familiar sights and sounds that make up daily life retreat creating a strange yet familiar world theres less activity but that doesnt mean there is no activity while great britain sleeps phones charge and fridges hum electricity is a 24hour need and so the stations generating it must be 24hour operations but the life of a power station by night is very different to that by day walking around the power station at night can almost feel like the mary celeste says simon acaster drax power stations generation manager there may be as few as 50 to 60 people on site which isnt a lot when you consider the size of the plant and compare it to the day when there are some 650 people around drax power station by day is a hive of activity alongside generation there are maintenance engineering  trading and contract support at night this is all stripped back work is focused on the core production issues looking after the asset and maintaining power generation output to meet our contract position keeping the teams safe and making sure we stay environmentally compliant  says mark rhodes shift manager at drax its a quieter place he adds keeping power flowing typically teams at drax swap over at 8pm and 8am on a cycle of day and night shifts during the summer months when one or more of the stations six 600 megawatt mw units can be on outage and maintenance is carried out across the station work often continues around the clock right through the night but during a period of normal operation the night workforce is reduced to basic operations and maintenance teams material handling teams receiving biomass deliveries  which continue through the night  and security staff  demand for electricity typically falls overnight so drax shuts down unneeded generation units around 10pm as morning approaches teams prep them to restart in time for when people wake up and turn on kettles  even when we shut the units down the turbine is still turning throughout the night says acaster all the hydraulic pumps and lube oil systems are still functioning a lot of plant is in service even when the units are shut down this means theres still the potential as during the day for something to need maintenance or attention at any moment requiring the teams to jump into action we aim to sort any shortterm issues through the night says rhodes but for any technical issues that can wait we tackle them when the day team returns and were fully staffed at night its more about safely managing the asset the hardest part of a running the power station overnight however is not a technical one its a human one theres no doubt about it working nights is tiring says acaster the biggest challenge is keeping everybody focused and aware of whats happening he continues unit controllers regularly talk to their plant operators checking in every hour so we know theyre safe supervisors need to be out on plant engaging and talking to employees checking on what theyre doing and keeping them active and alert the shifting of the night shift the decarbonisation of great britains electricity system has changed the way drax operates during the day and the same is true of the night historically we had six units and they would be baseload generating 645 mw each says rhodes they would operate continuously day and night but with the demand profile changing  lower power prices and other methods of generation coming onto the system  that model is changing overnight is normally the time of least demand and when the price of power becomes most depressed rhodes continues so we take units off and prepare them for the morning returning when there is value regularly shutting down and starting the units takes a tougher toll on the equipment than running them continuously which increases the need for maintenance teams on night shifts theres also a need for teams to be on standby to ramp up or down generation  the increased volatility of the countrys power network brought on in part by increasing levels of intermittent renewables means national grid can often ask drax to increase or decrease generation at short notice to provide balancing services like inertia frequency response or reserve power  our units can come down to 300 mw and stay at that level says acaster across three units that gives national grid 900 mw of spare capacity that can be turned up its like a sleeping giant awaiting start up at any time but unlike other sleeping giants this one is never truly at rest the demands of the network keep it and the men and women operating it humming through the night 24hours a day the power station at night is a quieter place but it is never a silent one tags power station  engineering  drax power station  flexibility and stability and power system security the great balancing act what it takes to keep the power grid stable 8 june 2018 power generation what does it mean to say great britains electricity network needs to be balanced it doesnt refer to the structural stability of pylons rather balancing the power system is about ensuring electricity supply meets demand second by second from the side of a consumer the power system serves one purpose to deliver electricity to homes and businesses so that it powers our lives but from a generator and a system operator perspective there is much more at play electricity must be transported the length of the country levels of generation must be managed so they are exactly equal to levels being used and properties like voltage and frequency must be minutely regulated across the whole network to ensure power generated at scale in industrial power stations can be used by domestic appliances plugged into wall sockets ensuring all this happens smoothly relies on the system operator  national grid  working with power generators to provide ancillary services  a set of processes that keep the power system in operation stable and balanced here we look at some of the most important ancillary services at play in great britain frequency response one of the foundations of great britains power system stability is frequency the entire power network operates at a frequency of 50 hz  which is determined by the number of directional changes alternating current ac electricity makes every second however just a 1 deviation from this begins to damage equipment and infrastructure so it is imperative it remains consistent this is done by national grid instructing flexible generators such as thermal steampowered turbines like those at drax power station or our planned battery facility  to either increase or decrease generation so electricity supply is matched exactly to demand if this is unbalanced it affects the networks frequency and lead to instability and equipment damage generators are set up to respond automatically to these request correcting frequency deviations in seconds reactive power and voltage management the electricity that turns on light bulbs and charges phones is whats known as active power however getting that active power around the transmission system efficiently economically and safely requires something called reactive power  reactive power is generated the same way as active power and assists with pushing the real power around the system but unlike active power its does not travel very far the influence of reactive power is local and the balance in any particular area is very important to maintain power flows and a stable system this means national grid must work with generators to either generate more reactive power when there is not enough or absorb it when there is an excess which can happen when lines are lightly loaded meaning they have a low level of power running through them draxs ability to absorb reactive power is also vital in controlling the grids voltage  great britains system runs at a voltage of 400 kilovolts kv and 275 kv scotland also uses 132kv before it is stepped down by transformers to 230 volts for homes or 11 kv for heavy industrial users voltage must stay within 5 of 400 kv before it begins to damage equipment by producing reactive power a generator increases the voltage on a system but by switching to absorbing reactive power it can help lower the voltage keeping the grids electricity safe and efficient system inertia as well as being able to automatically adjust to keep the country on the right frequency draxs massive turbines spinning at 3000 rpm also have the advantage of adding inertia to the grid  inertia is an objects natural tendency to keep doing what it is currently doing this system inertia of the spinning plant is effectively stored energy this can be used to act as a damper on the whole system to slow down and smooth out sudden changes in system frequency across the network  much like a cars suspension it helps maintain stability reserve power humans are creatures of habit this means the whole country tends to load dishwashers turn on tvs and boil kettles at roughly the same time each day making the rise and fall in electricity demand easy enough for national grid to predict however if something unexpected happens  a sudden cold snap or a power station breaking down  the grid must be ready for this national grid keeps reserve power on the system to jump into action and fill any sudden gaps in demand and fluctuations in voltage and frequency it could cause ancillary services in an evolving system as with how electricity is generated across the country balancing services are undergoing major change as more intermittent renewables such as wind and solar come onto the system to provide low carbon power necessary for great britain to decarbonise  that same system becomes more volatile and more difficult to balance click to viewdownload more than that the ancillary services needed to stabilise a more volatile grid cant be generated by every generation source many depend on a turbine rotating at 3000 rpm generating electricity at a steady frequency of 50hz as is found in thermal generators such as drax intermittent also known as variable sources of power are weather dependent  they are often unable to provide the same services as biomass and gas power stations while attempts to supply some of these ancillary services by colocating wind or solar facilities with giant batteries are underway thermal power stations that can quickly and reliably balance the system at scale still play an essential role in making the

flexible energy this winter 20 october 2017 power generation preparing for winter is one of the uk power systems biggest challenges shorter days and falling temperatures ramp up demand for electricity and gas to power lights and heating across the country this can put strain on the grid even leading to blackouts if not carefully managed in anticipation of potentially difficult times national grid assesses britains winter energy system to determine how much power were going to need and more importantly to ensure generators can produce enough to meet demand in its most recent report looking at winter 201718  national grids take is a positive one there will be enough power to meet demand more than that it has the potential to be cleaner than ever before  what to expect from electricity this winter in the report national grid forecasts a surplus power margin how much generation capacity will exceed estimated demand of 103  a significant increase from last years 57 margin what does this mean in real terms the report predicts a peak electricity demand of nearly 51 gw during the darkest coldest days of middecember by contrast the total possible capacity of the uks energy system during winter is 1012 gw not including interconnectors importing power from abroad it is important to note however that 1012 gw is more a theoretical number than an expected one considering normal occurrences such as planned outages breakdowns or other operational issues that prevent power stations generating their usual output a more accurate estimate is 661 gw but electricity isnt the only resource put under strain in the winter months  gas is also in high demand for heating and for electricity generation in the report national grid predicts this winter to have a lower gas demand than last year owing largely to a decrease in gasfuelled electricity generation however where gasfired electricity is likely to remain integral is in plugging the gaps in electricity supply left by intermittent renewables the system under stress weather plays a huge part in both the consumption and generation of power  during the winter when days are shorter and darker and the wind calmer solar and wind cannot generate and feed into the power grid as they normally would this means when there are sudden spikes in demand such as in a cold snap national grid must secure other sources to avoid disruption which can sometimes include carbonintensive coal diesel generators or importing power from europe this growing pressure on the system requires flexible and reliable sources of energy that can quickly react to these sudden surges biomass is a reliable flexible renewable and available at scale its able to provide the full range of support services the grid needs to retain stable supplies

role in allowing the country to operate with less dependence on fossil fuels weve already made significant headway in this field last year christmas day was powered by more renewable electricity than ever before while each quarter of 2017 has seen new clean energy records broken  as we move into another winter its imperative generators and operators focus on the security of supply that the
