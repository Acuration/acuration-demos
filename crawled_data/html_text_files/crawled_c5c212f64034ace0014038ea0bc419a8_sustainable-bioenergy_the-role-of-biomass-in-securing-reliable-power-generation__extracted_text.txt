power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station the role of biomass in securing reliable power generation at a time of uncertainty around global fuel supplies biomass and pumped storage hydro offer reliable sources of power to secure the uk electricity grid 5 december 2022 power generation  sustainable bioenergy key takeaways since 2021 there has been a sharp rise in the price of electricity driven by a steep increase in wholesale gas prices in europe in particular a number of factors including the impact of covid19 and the effects of the war in ukraine have contributed to driving gas prices to record highs the volatility of gas prices means the uk needs to find replacements for the role of gas in helping to balance the electricity grid biomass and pumped storage hydro have the capacity to provide reliable renewable energy to uk homes and businesses while contributing to keeping the grid stable great britain and many other parts of the world are in a phase of energy uncertainty since 2021 soaring power prices have caused energy bills to escalate as much as fivefold and led to a string of collapses of uk energy suppliers as of october 2022 the annual energy bill for a uk household with typical energy consumption has been capped at 2500 a year  96 higher than the winter 202122 price cap  the upper limits the rates suppliers can charge for their default tariffs the costs of energy to end consumers would be even higher were it not for this energy price guarantee introduced by the uk government on 1 october and currently due to be in place until 31 march 2023 in germany the government has committed 200 billion towards a defensive shield against surging energy prices while france has capped energy price increases at 4 for 2022 and 15 from january 2023  the primary factor in this change is the rise in natural gas prices periods of turbulence driven by commodity prices emphasises the need for a diverse secure supply of power generation available to the uk grid as the energy system works through the necessary transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources the need for a reliable lowcarbon affordable power becomes even greater electricty lines carrying power to the people of south wales whats driving up gas prices as the world went into lockdown in 2020 the demand for energy including gas dropped  and so did supply when countries began to emerge from lockdown in 2021 and economies started to reboot supply struggled to keep up with renewed demand triggering a rise in the price of wholesale gas and other fuels the cold winter in 20202021 and unusually hot summers in 2021 and 2022 also dented european gas storage levels further contributing to rising gas prices an already uncertain energy market was further destabilised by russias invasion of ukraine this was particularly true in europe most notably germany where russian gas at the time accounted for around 40 of total gas consumption  gas prices began increase rapidly as a result of factors including fears that russia would restrict the supply of gas to europe in response to sanctions against the country or that an embargo on russian gas would be introduced constrained gas supplies also increased global demand for alternative sources like liquified natural gas lng imports which account for about 22 of the uks gas this increase in demand has pushed up the price of these alternatives forcing countries to compete to attract supplies there are several reasons why higher gas prices have such a significant impact on uk energy prices firstly a considerable proportion of uk electricity comes from gas in the second quarter of 2022 gas represented 42 of the uk energy mix  making it the countrys single largest source of electricity the uk also relies heavily on gas to heat its homes and with those homes being some of the oldest and least energyefficient in europe it takes more gas to heat them up and keep them warm click to viewdownload the role of biomass and pumped storage hydro in ensuring security of supply in addition to the pressures placed on gas and electricity supplies since 2021 the uks journey to net zero depends on increasing reliance on intermittent sources of power such as wind and solar as such there is a renewed need to ensure a diverse range of power generation sources to secure electricity supply globally as gas becomes less economical biomass offers a renewable reliable dispatchable source of power that can balance the grid and supply baseload power regardless of weather conditions the turbine hall at cruachan power station our four 645 mw biomassfuelled generating turbines at drax power station make it the largest single renewable source of power in the uk the plant can produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of five million homes come rain or shine draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station in the scottish highlands also offers national grid the capacity to store 440 mw of renewable power by absorbing excess electricity from zero carbon sources like wind and solar cruachan can store and deploy power when the grid needs it most the ability of pumped storage hydro and biomass plants to store energy and quickly adjust output as required will become ever more important as the uks use of renewables grows and there are fewer spinning turbines connected to the grid as renewable nonintermittent sources of electricity biomass and pumped storage hydro are central to a safe economic and stable electricity grid  and to the uks lowcarbon energy
