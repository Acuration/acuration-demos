and china in absolute terms china has 25 times more renewable capacity than the us fossil fuels twofifths of the worlds electricity comes from coal the share of coal generation is a key driver for the

contains inside information the revised contractual arrangements are designed to mitigate the risk to 2019 capacity payments arising from the recent suspension of the capacity market commenting on todays announcement will gardiner chief executive officer of drax group said the strategic merits of this acquisition remain unchanged and the board believes there is a compelling logic in our move to add further flexible sources of power to our offering which will accelerate our ability to deliver our strategic vision of a lowercarbon lowercost energy future for the uk the capacity market is a central pillar of the uks energy policy and ensures security of supply while minimising costs to consumers the government has stated it is working closely with the european commission to aid their investigation and to reinstate the full capacity market regime including existing agreements as soon as possible to mitigate the risk that capacity payments take time to be restored we have agreed revised terms which provide protection in 2019 beyond 2019 while reinstatement of the capacity market is the most likely outcome we considered other outcomes the more plausible of which would still deliver returns in excess of draxs weighted average cost of capital the acquisition makes financial and strategic sense delivering material value to our shareholders through longterm earnings and attractive returns capacity market on 15 november 2018 the general court of the european union issued a ruling annulling the european commissions 2014 decision not to undertake a more detailed investigation of the uk governments scheme establishing the capacity market the ruling the ruling imposed a standstill period while the european commission completes a further state aid investigation into the capacity market payments to generators scheduled under existing capacity agreements and the holding of future capacity auctions have been suspended cruachan power station on loch awe argylle and bute contracted capacity payments make up a significant proportion of the earnings of the portfolio for the period from 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2022 the cruachan pumped storage hydro asset has contracted capacity payments of 29 million the galloway runofriver hydro assets have contracted capacity payments of 5m million and the combined cycle gas turbine assets have contracted capacity payments of 122 million in aggregate drax notes the uk governments statement in response to the ruling that it is working closely with the european commission to aid their investigation and to seek a timely state aid reapproval decision for the capacity market the uk government also confirmed that the ruling does not change its belief that capacity market auctions are the most appropriate way to deliver secure electricity supplies at the lowest cost and that the ruling was decided on procedural grounds and did not constitute a direct challenge to the design of the capacity market itself lanark hydro scheme lanarkshire based on the information available and legal advice it has received drax believes that the most likely outcome is that the european commission will reapprove the existing capacity market in its current or a broadly similar form despite the above drax recognises there is some uncertainty whether the contracted capacity payments for the 201819 capacity market year which are currently suspended will be paid by the uk government to mitigate the risk that these payments are not received for the 201819 capacity market year drax has agreed with iberdrola certain amendments to the agreement signed on 16 october 2018 arrangements with iberdrola in respect of 201819 capacity payments drax and iberdrola have agreed a risk sharing mechanism in respect of capacity payments for the period 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2019 worth 36 million if less than 100 of these payments are received and the gross profit of the portfolio for the full year 2019 the 2019 gross profit is lower than expected drax will receive a payment from iberdrola of up to 26 million the mechanism also gives iberdrola the opportunity to earn an upside of up to 26 million if less than 100 of these payments are received but the portfolio performs better than expected in 2019 1  under these arrangements if less than 100 of these capacity payments are received iberdrola will make a payment to drax if the 2019 gross profit is less than 155 million the payment will be an amount equal to 72 of any shortfall in the 2019 gross profit below 155 million the amount of the payment is capped at the lower of the amount in respect of capacity payments due to the portfolio but not received and 26 million and drax will make a payment to iberdrola if the 2019 gross profit is more than 165 million the payment will be an amount equal to 72 of any amount by which the 2019 gross profit exceeds 165 million the amount of the payment is capped at the lower of the amount in respect of capacity payments due to the portfolio but not received by drax and 26 million a pylon carries electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe in the mountains of the west highlands of scotland if subsequently drax receives any capacity payments in respect of the period 1 january 2019 to 30 september 2019 drax will pay 72 of those amounts to iberdrola capped at the amount paid by iberdrola to drax under the mechanism above drax and iberdrola have agreed that capacity payments due to the portfolio in respect of the period before completion will be passed through to iberdrola any payments pursuant to the arrangements with iberdrola will be cash adjustments to the consideration and not included in ebitda 2  benefits of the acquisition shoreham power station west sussex based on draxs expectations of the position that is most likely to be achieved in relation to the capacity market following the ruling drax believes the acquisition represents an attractive opportunity to create significant value for shareholders and is expected to deliver returns significantly in excess of draxs weighted average cost of capital drax has considered other possible outcomes for the capacity market which are less likely but may ensue and if they did the financial effects of the acquisition may be adversely affected drax believes that if the more plausible of these outcomes were to ensue the returns from the acquisition would still be in excess of the draxs weighted average cost of capital drax has not attempted to quantify the effect if the less plausible of these other outcomes were to ensue  if there were no capacity market or similar mechanism or if significant structural changes were made to the capacity market drax sees these as a remote possibility and notes that in those circumstances it believes the loss or reduction of capacity payments could be mitigated by increases in wholesale power prices the acquisition strengthens draxs ability to pay a growing and sustainable dividend drax remains committed to its capital allocation policy and to its current 50 million share buyback programme with 42 million of shares purchased to date 2019 profit forecast daldowie fuel plant glasgow based on recent power and commodity prices and assuming that all contracted capacity payments are received the portfolio is expected to generate ebitda in 2019 in a range of 90 million to 110 million from gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments rocs 3 and the daldowie energyfromwaste plant if in light of the ruling the contracted capacity payments payable in 2019 in respect of the portfolio are not received or accrued in 2019 the expected ebitda for the portfolio in 2019 would be reduced by up to 47 million from a range of 90 million to 110 million down to a range of 43 million to 63 million before considering mitigating factors drax believes that the arrangements agreed with iberdrola mitigate in economic terms the majority of the risk that those suspended capacity payments will not be paid assuming performance in line with current expectations and if all capacity payments due in 2019 are received before the end of 2019 net debt to ebitda is expected to fall to draxs longterm target of around 2x by the end of 2019 if capacity payments are not received in 2019 net debt to ebitda is expected to fall to around 2x during 2020 drax current trading and 2018 outlook following the ruling 7 million of contracted capacity payments relating to 2018 principally in relation to draxs remaining two coalfired units will not be paid as and when expected taking this into account and following draxs recent good trading performance and assuming continued good operational availability for the remainder of the year draxs full year ebitda outlook remains in line with previous expectations with net debt to ebitda expected to be around 15x for the full year excluding the impact of the acquisition process the clatteringshaws dam in dumfries and galloway built by sir alexander gibb  partners in 193238 it is part of the galloway hydro scheme on 1 november 2018 the competition and markets authority informed drax that it had no further questions in connection with the proposed acquisition at that stage which resulted in the competition condition under the acquisition agreement being satisfied completion of the acquisition is therefore currently expected to occur on 31 december 2018 assuming that the shareholder approval condition is satisfied by that date a combined shareholder circular and notice of general meeting containing the unanimous recommendation of the board to approve the acquisition will be posted as soon as practicable other matters drax expects to announce its full year results for the year ending 31 december 2018 on 26 february 2019 notes

more ambitious than the paris agreements 2 o c of these scenarios 101 use negative emissions technologies nets at a scale of between 100 to 1000 gigatonnes  over the 21st century given the scale of the ambition the task of capturing enough carbon to be truly negative will need to rely on many sources here are some of the techniques technologies and innovations aiming to push the world towards negative emissions forests weyerhaeuser nursery camden alabama cdr doesnt have to utilise complex tech and chemistry the planets natural carbon cycle already removes and stores huge amounts of carbon from the atmosphere  primarily through trees the worlds forests have absorbed as much as 30 of annual global humangenerated co 2 emissions over the last few decades regenerating depleted forests reforestation planting new forests afforestation and protecting and helping existing forests thrive through active management can all contribute to offsetting emissions the ipcc report estimates that reforestations and afforestation could potentially capture 05 and 36 billion tonnes of co 2 a year at a cost of usd5 to 50 390 to 39 per metric tonne there are potential drawbacks of extensive afforestation it could compete with food crops as well as reducing the reflection of heat and light back into space that arid lands currently offer to prevent global warming bioenergy with carbon capture and storage europes first beccs pilot project at drax power station biomass on its own is an important fuel source in lowering emissions from industries such as power generation on one hand its created by organic material which during its lifetime absorbs carbon from the atmosphere often enough to offset emissions from transportation and combustion on another it creates a sustainable market for forestry products encouraging landowners to responsibly manage forests which in turn can lead to growing forests and increased co 2 absorption but when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs or ccus technology it becomes a negative carbon emissions process known as beccs drax is partnering with carbon capture company ccapture in a 400000 pilot to develop ccs technology which will remove a tonne of carbon from its operations a day combined with the carbon removed by the forests supplying the biomass it could turn drax into the worlds first negative emissions power station  beyond just storing the captured carbon underground however it can be used to create a range of products  locking in and making use of the carbon for much longer the ipcc report estimates between 05 and 5 billion metric tonnes of carbon could be captured globally this way at a cost of 100 to 200 80160 per metric tonne increased blue carbon mangrove roots its not only forests of fastgrowing pines or eucalyptus that remove co 2 from the atmosphere in fact coastal vegetation such as mangroves salt marshes and sea grasses suck in and store carbon in soil at a greater rate than plants on land  the carbon stored in these waterside ecosystems is known as blue carbon human encroachment and development on coastlines has depleted these environments however efforts are underway to regenerate and expand these hyperabsorbent ecosystems turning them into carbon sinks that can remove more emissions from the atmosphere than conventional forests apple is currently throwing its financial weight behind a mangrove expansion project in colombia to try and offset its global operations boosting ocean plants productivity beyond costal mangroves the ocean is full of plants that use co 2 to photosynthesise  in fact the oceans are thought to be one of the worlds largest carbon sinks but there are some people who think we could enhance marine plants absorption abilities eelgrass bed one such approach involves injecting iron nutrients into the ocean to prompt a bloom in microscopic plants called phytoplankton which float in the upper part of the ocean absorbing the co 2 absorbed from the atmosphere when the plants eventually die they then sink trapping the absorbed carbon on the seabed an additional positive effect would be an increase in dimethyl sulphide which marine plants emit this could alter the reflectivity of clouds that absorb water from the ocean and further act to cool the earth enhanced rock weathering plants absorbing co 2 through photosynthesis is the mostcommonly known part of the carbon cycle however rocks also absorb co 2 as they weather and erode the co 2 usually reaches the rock in the form of rain which absorbs co 2 from the atmosphere as it falls it then reacts with the rocks very slowly breaking them down and forming a bicarbonate that is eventually washed into the ocean locking the carbon on the seabed the problem is it takes a long time one idea that seeks to use this natural process more effectively is to speed it up by pulverising rocks and spreading the resulting powder over a larger area to absorb more co 2 from rain and air natural rock weathering currently absorbs around 03 of global fossil fuel emissions annually but the ipcc estimates at scale it could capture 2 and 4 billion metric tons at a cost of between 50 and 200 39160 per metric ton this approach also requires extensive land use and has not been trialled at scale sequestering carbon in soil soil is another major carbon sink plants and grasses that die and rot store carbon in the soil for long periods however modern farming techniques such as intensive ploughing and fertilisation causes carbon to be released and oxidised to form co 2  adjustments in farming methods could change this and at scale make agriculture carbon neutral  straightforward techniques such as minimising soil disturbance crop rotation and grassland regeneration could sequester as much as 5 billion tonnes of carbon into the soil annually according to the ipcc at potential zero cost a challenge to this method is that once soil is saturated it cant hold any more carbon that material would also be easily released if methods are not maintained in the future increasing soil carbon with biochar a way to supercharge how much carbon soil can store is to add a substance called biochar to the earth a type of charcoal made by burning biomass  such as wood or farm waste in the absence of oxygen biochar can increase the amount of carbon locked into the soil for hundreds or thousands of years it also helps soil retain water and reduce methane and nitrogen emissions biochar has only been trialled at a small scale but the ipcc estimates that between 05 and 2 billion metric tonnes could be captured annually through this means however it predicts a cost of between 30 and 120 2394 per metric tonne additionally producing biochar at scale would require large amounts of biomass that must be sustainably sourced direct air capture co 2 is in the air all around us and so removing it from the atmosphere can effectively take place anywhere direct air capture dac or daccs proposes that the carbon capture and storage technology many power stations are now trialling can be carried out almost anywhere direct air capture of co2 by a climaworks startup kezo involving garbage incineration in switzerland swiss startup climeworks is one company attempting to make dac viable  its technology works by passing air through a surface that reacts with co 2 to form a compound but releases the remaining air the newly formed compound is then heated so the reactive chemical agent can be separated and reused the co 2 is then stored underground with gas and water where it reacts with basalt and turns to stone in less than two years the main challenge for this technique is the cost  between 200 and 600 156468 per metric tonne  and that it requires large amounts of energy creating further demand for electricity one hundred million tonnes wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the primary challenge for negative emission technology as a whole is that so few have actually been implemented at a global scale however trials are in motion around in the world including at drax to remove emissions and help limit the effects of climate change even if the uk decarbonises heavily across all sectors of the economy by 2050 theres still projected to be 130 mtco 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide net emissions but a royal academyroyal society report released earlier this year was optimistic it concluded that the country can become net zero and do its part in mitigating man made climate change  with beccs identified as the negative emissions technology
