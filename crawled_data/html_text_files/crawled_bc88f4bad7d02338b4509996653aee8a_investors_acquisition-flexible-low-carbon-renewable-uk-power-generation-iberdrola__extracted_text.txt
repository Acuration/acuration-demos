asset base the portfolio principally consists of 26gw of assets which are highly complementary to draxs existing generation portfolio and play an important role in the uk energy system the assets include turbine hall at cruachan power station cruachan pumped storage hydro 440mw of largescale storage and flexible lowcarbon generation situated in argyll and bute scotland cruachan provides a wide range of system support services to the uk energy market in addition to providing merchant power generation cruachan has 35 million of contracted capacity payments for the period 2019 to 2022 cruachan which provides over 35 of the uks pumped storage by volume can provide longduration storage with the ability to achieve full load in 30 seconds which it can maintain for over 16 hours making it a strategically important asset remunerated by a broad range of noncommodity based revenues galloway hydro scheme river dee galloway and lanark runofriver hydro 126mw of stable and reliable renewable generation situated in southwest scotland both locations benefit from indexlinked roc revenues extending to 2027 and galloway in addition to renewable power generation operates a reservoir and dam

capacity payments of 127 million for the period 2019 to 2022 damhead creek power station isle of grain kent damhead creek also benefits from an attractive option for the development of a second ccgt asset damhead creek ii which provides additional gas generation optionality alongside draxs existing coaltogas repowering and ocgt6 projects all options could be developed subject to an appropriate level of support damhead creek ii is eligible for the 2019 capacity market auction along with two of draxs existing ocgt projects other smaller sites the portfolio also includes a small ccgt in blackburn 60mw and a 50k tonne biomassfromwaste facility in daldowie which benefits from a firm offtake contract agreement with scottish water until 2026 benefits of the acquisition a leading provider of flexible lowcarbon and renewable generation in the uk the uk has a target to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2050 the transition to a lowcarbon economy requires decarbonisation of heating transport and generation this will in turn require additional lowcarbon sources of generation to be developed in the uk as much as 85 7 of future generation could come from renewables  predominantly wind and solar this will lead at times to high levels of power price volatility and increasing demand for system support services managing an energy system with these characteristics will only be possible if it is supported by the right mix of flexible assets to manage volatility balance the system and provide crucial nongeneration services which a stable energy system requires pylon and electricity transmission lines from cruachan power station above loch awe the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility increased earnings potential aligned with generation strategy and uk energy needs the acquisition is closely aligned with this structural need and the operation of draxs existing biomass and gas options which provide the flexibility required to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation the acquisition is in line with these system needs and when combined with draxs existing flexible biomass generation and gas options offers the group increased exposure to the growing need for system support and power price volatility high quality earnings two thirds of the gross profits of the portfolio is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs in addition to power generation activities due to the expected growing demand for these assets and the contractbased nature of many of these services drax expects to improve longterm earnings visibility through structured noncommodity earnings streams whilst retaining significant opportunity to benefit from power price volatility when combined with renewable earnings and system support from existing biomass generation the acquisition is expected to lead to an increase in the quality of earnings diversified generation and portfolio benefits wood pellet storage domes at drax power station selby north yorkshire the acquisition accelerates draxs development from a singlesite generation business into a multisite multitechnology operator with the acquisition of this portfolio a fall in gas prices could be mitigated by an increase in gasfired generation reflecting the relative dispatch economics of the different technologies drax expects to benefit from the management of generation across a broader asset base leveraging the groups expertise in the operation trading and optimisation of large rotating mass generation drax believes that the team operating the portfolio has a strong engineering culture which is closely aligned with the drax model and will enhance the groups strong capabilities across engineering disciplines around 260 operational roles will transfer to drax as part of the acquisition complementing and reinforcing draxs existing engineering and operational capabilities financing and capital structure drax has entered into a fully underwritten 725 million secured acquisition bridge facility to finance the acquisition with a term of 12 months from the

group appendix 2 profit forecast profit forecast for the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 including bases and assumptions the portfolio is expected based on recent power and commodity prices to generate ebitda in a range of 90110 million profit forecast and gross profits of 155 million to 175 million of which around two thirds is expected to come from noncommodity market sources including system support services capacity payments daldowie and rocs pumped storage and hydro activities represent a significant proportion of the earnings associated with the portfolio for the purpose of the profit forecast ebitda is stated before any allocation of group overheads as these will be an allocation of the existing drax group cost base which is not expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the portfolio basis of preparation the profit forecast has been compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and on the basis of the accounting policies of the drax group adopted in its financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 subsequent accounting policy changes include the application of ifrs15 and ifrs9 which are not initially expected to change the ebitda results of the portfolio it also does not reflect the impact of ifrs16 which would apply in respect of the 2019 annual report and accounts the profit forecast has been prepared with reference to unaudited 2017 financial statements based on the audited financial statements of scottish power generation limited and smw limited adjusted to exclude results of assets that do not form part of the portfolio and restated in accordance with drax accounting policies the audited financial statements of the entities forming the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2017 the unaudited management accounts of the portfolio for the nine months ending 30 september 2018 and on the basis of the projected financial performance of the portfolio for the year ending 31 december 2019 the profit forecast is a best estimate of the ebitda that the portfolio will generate for a future period of a year in respect of assets and operations that are not yet under the control of drax accordingly the degree of uncertainty relating to the assumptions underpinning the profit forecast is inherently greater than would be the case for a profit forecast based on assets and operation under the control of drax andor which covered a shorter future period the profit forecast has been prepared as at today and will be updated in the shareholder circular the forecast cost base reflects the expectations of the drax directors of the operating regime of the portfolio under draxs ownership and the central support it will require principal assumptions the profit forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions assumptions within managements control there is no change in the composition of the portfolio there is no material change to the manner in which these assets are operated there are no material changes to the existing running costs  operating costs of the portfolio there will be no material restrictions on running each of the assets in the portfolio other than those that would be envisaged in the ordinary course no material issues with the migration of services including trading and information technology from scottish power to drax no hedges are transferred as part of the transaction transaction costs and oneoff costs associated with the integration are not included assumptions outside of managements control the acquisition of the portfolio is completed on 31 december 2018 there is no material change to existing prevailing uk macroeconomic and political conditions prior to 31 december 2019 there are no material changes in market conditions in electricity generating market and no change to the uk energy supply mix there are no material changes in legislation or regulatory requirements eg rocs capacity market grid charges impacting the operations or accounting policies of the portfolio there are no changes to recent market prices for clean spark spread power carbon and other commodities there is no material
