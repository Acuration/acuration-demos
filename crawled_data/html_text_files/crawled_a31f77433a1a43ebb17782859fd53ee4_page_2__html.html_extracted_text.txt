End of coal generation at Drax Power Station
27 February 2020
Investors

Drax Group plc
(“Drax” or the “Group”; Symbol:DRX)
RNS Number : 2747E
Following a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with National Grid, Ofgem and the UK Government, the Board of Drax has determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in 2021 – ahead of the UK’s 2025 deadline.
Commercial coal generation is expected to end in March 2021, with formal closure of the coal units in September 2022 at the end of existing Capacity Market obligations.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Ending the use of coal at Drax is a landmark in our continued efforts to transform the business and become a world-leading carbon negative company by 2030. Drax’s move away from coal began some years ago and I’m proud to say we’re going to finish the job well ahead of the Government’s 2025 deadline.
“By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK’s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.
“Having pioneered ground-breaking biomass technology, we’re now planning to go further by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to achieve our ambition of being carbon negative by 2030, making an even greater contribution to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis.
“Stopping using coal is the right decision for our business, our communities and the environment, but it will have an impact on some of our employees, which will be difficult for them and their families.
“In making the decision to stop using coal and to decarbonise the economy, it’s vital that the impact on people across the North is recognised and steps are taken to ensure that people have the skills needed for the new jobs of the future.”
Coal in front of biomass storage domes at Drax Power Station, 2016
Drax will shortly commence a consultation process with employees and trade unions with a view to ending coal operations. Under these proposals, commercial generation from coal will end in March 2021 but the two coal units will remain available to meet Capacity Market obligations until September 2022.
The closure of the two coal units is expected to involve one-off closure costs in the region of £25-35 million in the period to closure and to result in a reduction in operating costs at Drax Power Station of £25-35 million per year once complete. Drax also expects a reduction in jobs of between 200 and 230 from April 2021.
The carrying value of the fixed assets affected by closure was £240 million, in addition to £103 million of inventory at 31 December 2019, which Drax intends to use in the period up to 31 March 2021. The Group expects to treat all closure costs and any asset obsolescence charges as exceptional items in the Group’s financial statements. A further update on these items will be provided in the Group’s interim financial statements for the first half of 2020.
As part of the proposed coal closure programme the Group is implementing a broader review of operations at Drax Power Station. This review aims to support a safe, efficient and lower cost operating model which, alongside a reduction in biomass cost, positions Drax for long-term biomass generation following the end of the current renewable support mechanisms in March 2027.
While previously being an integral part of the Drax Power Station site and offering flexibility to the Group’s trading and operational performance, the long-term economics of coal generation remain challenging and in 2019 represented only three percent of the Group’s electricity production. In January 2020, Drax did not take a Capacity Market agreement for the period beyond September 2022 given the low clearing price.

Will Gardiner’s Drax carbon negative ambition remarks at COP25
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
10 December 2019
Opinion

Thank you very much Nick, it’s a pleasure to be here in Madrid. My name is Will Gardiner and I am the CEO of the Drax Group. We have been proud members of the
Powering Past Coal Alliance
for a year now, but our journey beyond coal began more than a decade ago, when we realised that we had a responsibility to our communities, our shareholders and our colleagues to be part of the solution to the escalating climate crisis.
And so at Drax we did something that many believed wasn’t possible and began to
replace coal generation with sustainable, renewable biomass
.
With the right support and commitment from successive UK ministers, and through the ingenuity of our people, within a decade we transformed into Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and its biggest source of renewable power –
generating 12% of the UK’s renewable electricity last year
while reducing our carbon emissions by more than 80% since 2012.
We have reduced our emissions, we believe, more than any other energy company in the world and we have enabled a just transition for thousands of UK workers who began their career in coal but will end it by producing renewable, flexible and low carbon power for 13 million British homes.
But as the climate crisis intensifies and the clock counts down, we can’t stand still. So today I am pleased to share our new ambition: to move beyond carbon neutrality, to achieve something that nobody has before, and
become the world’s first carbon negative company by 2030
.
By applying carbon capture and storage technology to our bioenergy generation we can become the first company in the world to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we produce, while continuing to produce about 5% of the UK’s overall electricity needs.
As the IPCC and UK government’s Committee on Climate Change make clear –
negative emissions are vital if we are to limit the earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees
.
At Drax we can be the first company to produce negative emissions at scale, helping to arrest climate change and redefining what is possible in the transition beyond coal.
If we are to defeat the climate crisis we must do it in a way that unlocks jobs and economic growth, unleashes entrepreneurial spirit and leaves nobody behind. The UK is unrivalled in decarbonising in this way. We are second to none in deploying renewables like
offshore wind
and
bioenergy
, which have transformed lives and our post-industrial communities.
We need to apply a similar framework to Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage as made offshore wind so successful. Fundamentally, an effective strategic partnership of government and the private sector was critical. The government provided support and an effective carbon tax regime. With confidence in that regulatory framework, many businesses provided investment and innovation. As a result, offshore wind has grown from less than 600 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity in 2008 to more than 8,000 MW in 2018 — an increase of more than 13 times in 10 years to produce 7.5% of the UK’s electricity.
At the same time, the
cost of that electricity has declined
from £114/MWh in 2015 to £39/MWh in 2019, the latter being a cost that will make offshore wind viable without subsidy. With government support and an effective regulatory regime to give the private sector the confidence to invest and innovate, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will trace that same path. At the same time, investing in this technology will both save lots of existing jobs and create many next generation green technology jobs.
That is why we have founded, along with Equinor and National Grid,
Zero Carbon Humber
, to work with the government to bring carbon capture and storage infrastructure to the northeast of the UK. We can save 55,000 existing heavy industry jobs, while capturing as much as 30 million tons of CO
2
per year. At the same time we will create a new industry and also the infrastructure for a new hydrogen economy to take our decarbonisation further.
By creating the right conditions for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to flourish, Britain can continue to benefit – socially, economically and environmentally from being at the vanguard of the fight against climate change.
And at the same time, it is our ambition at Drax to play a major role in that fight by becoming the first carbon negative company.
Thank you

Negative emissions


Capturing carbon emissions from the atmosphere could transform these industries
24 April 2019
Carbon capture

Countries, companies and industries around the world are racing to find ways to reduce their emissions. But looking slightly further down the line there is in fact a grander aim:
negative
emissions.
Negative emissions technologies
(NETs) can actually absorb more carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from the atmosphere than they emit, and they’re vitally important for avoiding catastrophic, man-made climate change. Without NETs it could be impossible to achieve the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s ambition of keeping temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
One example already being implemented is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It is what its name suggests. Using technologies to capture and store the CO
2
generated during the process of energy generation from biomass or organic materials rather than releasing it into the atmosphere.
BECCS holds vast potential in the electricity generation industry. Drax Power Station is currently
piloting one form of this technology
on one of its biomass units to capture as much as a tonne of CO
2
a day. But if it were deployed across all its biomass units, BECCS technology could make it the world’s first negative emissions power station.
Beyond the power industry, however, there’s scope for growth across other industries once the biomass is sourced sustainably. There are already five sites around the world where BECCS is being trialled and implemented at scale, laying the road to negative emissions.
Storing CO
2
from ethanol production in the Illinois Basin
The ethanol production industry is already seeing significant deployment of BECCS, including the largest installation of the technology operating in the world. The Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage project is part of a corn-to-ethanol plant in the US that has the capacity to capture
1 million tonnes of CO
2
every year
.
Here, corn is used to create ethanol by fermenting it in an oxygen-deprived environment. This process creates CO
2
as a by-product, which is captured and stored permanently in pores within the sandstone of the Illinois Basin under the facility.
Researchers believe with further development the site could capture as much as 250 million tonnes each year.
Norway’s cement challenge

Concrete is one of the world’s most versatile building materials. As a result it is the
second most-consumed material in the world behind water
– more than 10 billion tonnes of it is produced every year. However, its key ingredient – cement, which acts as concrete’s binding agent – is made using a hugely carbon-intensive manufacturing process and now accounts for as much as 6% of all global carbon emissions.
The Norcem Cement plant in Brevik, South-East Norway, has been experimenting with using biomass to power the kilns used to create its cement (which must heat ingredients to 1,500 degrees Celsius). Now it’s taking this a step further by becoming part of the country’s ambitious Full Chain CCS project.
The project will see 400,000 tonnes of CO
2
captured annually, which will then be transported by ship to a storage site on Norway’s western coast. From here a pipeline will transport the CO
2
50 kilometres away and deposit it deep below the North Sea’s bed.
The plan has the potential to work at an even bigger scale. The pipeline will be
capable of receiving as much as 4 million tonnes of CO
2
per year
, meaning it could even import and store carbon from other countries.
Burning waste and growing algae
In a world that seems increasingly unsure how to safely deal with its waste, the idea of incinerating it and making use of the heat this produces seems widely beneficial. But combusting any solid means releasing carbon emissions.
In Japan, however, a biomass-fired waste incineration plant is changing this by being the first in the world to capture its carbon emissions.
To get this project up and running, Toshiba, the firm behind the project, had to overcome unique challenges. For example,
waste incineration produces a greater mix of chemicals
than in ethanol or power production, including some that are corrosive to the metal pipes normally used in carbon capture.
Now running at commercial scale, the Saga City waste incineration plant isn’t just capturing CO
2
, it’s also utilising it to
cultivate crops at a nearby algae farm
. The carbon is being absorbed and used to grow algae for use in commercial scale cosmetic products, such as body and skin lotions.
Carbon isn’t the only thing finding new use at the facility. Reconstituted scrap metal from the plant is being used to make the medals for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The carbon capture system has been operational since 2016 and is capable of capturing 3,000 tonnes of CO
2
a year, but it isn’t the region’s first deployments of BECCS.

Fully integrating BECCS into biomass power
Nearby, the Mikawa power plant on the Fukuoka Prefecture, is leading the race in Asia to fully integrate carbon capture technology into a biomass power station.
The 50 MW power station successfully piloted carbon capture in 2009 through a partnership with Toshiba. At the time it was powered by coal, however, in 2017, the plant
upgraded to a 100% biomass boiler
fuelled by palm kernel shells – a waste product from palm oil extraction mills. Now it’s in the process of ramping up its carbon capture capabilities, with a target of being operational in 2020.
The system – which after Drax will be the second plant in the world to capture carbon using 100% biomass feedstock – will have the
capacity to capture more than 50% of the biomass plant’s CO
2
emissions, or as much as 180,000 tonnes per year
. Japan’s government is now supporting efforts to develop CO
2
transportation and potential offshore storage solutions for next year.
Pulping wood and growing food
BECCS technology has yet to be deployed in the paper industry to the same extent as in other organic-matter-based industries. But with many pulp and paper mills already using
by-products, such as hog fuel
, in generating power for their sites, it’s a prime area for BECCS growth.
In Saint-Felicien, Quebec, commercial-scale
carbon capture technology
is being deployed at a pulp mill run by Resolute Forest Products, and, as of March 2019, had a capacity of capturing 11,000 tonnes of CO
2
a year. Rather than storage, however, it supplies the carbon
to a cucumber-growing greenhouse next door to the mill
, as well as supplying enough warm water to meet 25% of the greenhouses’ heating needs.
Both long established biomass-based industries like ethanol and paper, and new sectors like electricity, are now adopting BECCS technology and driving innovation.
The biomass feedstocks involved in BECCS must, however, be sourced sustainably – or else a positive climate impact could be at the expense of environmental degradation elsewhere. ‘It should be possible to expand biomass supply in a sustainable way,’ found a recent
‘Global biomass markets’ report
from Ricardo AEA for the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).
While it’s still a complex technology to deploy, BECCS is increasingly operating at larger scales and growing to the level needed to seriously reduce industrial CO
2
emissions and help to combat climate change.

The electric transport revolution
16 April 2018
Electrification

With rapid technological improvements and falls in battery prices, improving performance and reducing the cost, experts predict that
by 2050, 90% of new-build cars will be powered by electricity
.
However, it’s not only roads where transport is decarbonising; electricity may soon power more of the world’s trains, plus its planes and boats.
Taking trains forward
The electrification of the rail industry has arguably been in the making for a lot longer than EVs but there’s still progress to be made. Trains are already one of the most-efficient modes of long-distance transport, and Network Rail claims electric models’
carbon emissions are 20% to 35% lower than diesel trains.
Electric trains also accelerate and brake faster than diesel-powered models, and cause less wear to tracks.
Electrified trains are already commonplace in many parts of the world – Japan’s famously fast and reliable Shinkansen railways are electric. Meanwhile in the UK,
less than 50% of the rail network is electrified
, with
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling’s recent ‘pause’ on development
casting doubts on previous ambitious plans to electrify 850-miles of track.
Nevertheless, advancements are still being made to enable the sector to utilise solar energy as an alternative to the national power grid. The concept would prove cost effective and reduce the carbon footprint of trains even further.
According to
a report
by climate change charity 10:10 and researchers at Imperial College’s Energy Futures Lab, rail companies could cut their annual running costs by millions of pounds through installing their own trackside solar panels to power electric trains directly. With companies spending around
£500 million a year on power
, the savings on self-generation would enable them to cut fares for passengers, as well as emissions.
Take off for electric planes
Of all transport modes, air travel has made the least progress in electrification but there’s hope yet. Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens recently teamed up to develop the technology needed to create electrically-powered aircraft. The companies plan to fly a demonstrator aircraft with one of its existing jet engines replaced by an electric unit in 2020.
Paul Stein, chief technology officer at Rolls-Royce, said: “Aviation is the last frontier of the electrification of transport. It could lead to a step change in the way we fly with greater efficiency and less noise.”
These proposed hybrid-electric aircraft are not powered by on-board batteries like EVs but with
a gas turbine that generates electricity to drive the propellers
. This could reduce fuel consumption by up to 10%, predicted Mark Cousin, head of flight demonstration at Airbus.
Moving to electric aircraft would also help the aviation industry meet EU targets of a 60% reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) by 2020, as well as 90% less nitrogen oxides and a noise reduction of around 75%.
UK-based airline EasyJet also announced it could be flying electric planes within a decade and is teaming up with US firm Wright Electric to build battery-powered aircraft.
According to EasyJet, the move would enable battery-powered aeroplanes to travel short-haul routes such as London to Paris and Amsterdam, and Edinburgh to Bristol. Wright Electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles, which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of EasyJet passengers. The challenge comes in making lithium-ion batteries light and safe enough for the air.
The airline said this was the next step in making air travel less harmful for the environment, after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by
31% between 2000 and 2016
. Wright Electric claims that electric planes will
save up to 15% in fuel burn and CO
2
emissions
, be 50% quieter and 10% cheaper for airlines to buy and operate, with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers.
Testing new waters
There’s a lot of buzz coming out of the maritime industry too. Every year marine transport
emits 1,000 million tonnes of CO
2
, which is why the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has agreed that a reduction of 50% should come by 2050 compared with 2008 levels. Although
the deal
fell short of more ambitious targets preferred by those ranging from the European Union to environmental NGOs, the IMO did also commit to pursue efforts toward phasing out CO
2
emissions entirely.
As Paris Agreement goals to cut carbon dioxide emissions loom, businesses around the world are innovating.

Small fleets of battery-powered boats designed for fjords and inland waterways in
Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands are preparing to set sail
, including some able to run
autonomously without a crew
.
Dutch company Port-Liner is also gearing up to launch the first fully-electric, emission-free barges in Europe. Dubbed ‘Tesla’ ships, Port-Liner Chief Executive Officer Ton van Meegen
claims these barges would be the first in the world to sail on carbon-neutral batteries
. The first six barges alone are expected to remove 23,000 trucks from the roads annually in the Netherlands, replacing them with zero-emission methods of transport.
China also recently launched an
electric cargo ship
to haul coal which, whilst not doing much for its ambitions to cut pollution, will at least eliminate shipping emissions from diesel engines. Electric ships may not yet be the norm globally but progress is underway to cut the 2.5% of global greenhouse emissions that result from the maritime transport industry.
Once a far-flung fantasy in some areas, electrified transport is fast becoming a reality. EVs and rail are leading the way, but it’s clear the electric transport revolution has a long way to travel.

Giving up coal
Tony Juniper, Author, adviser and environmental campaigner
7 December 2017
Opinion

Tony Juniper* is an environmental campaigner, author and director at Robertsbridge, a consultancy helping advise Drax on its sustainability programmes
Back in 2006 while working as Director at Friends of the Earth I approved a new
report
to be published in support of our then campaign for a new Climate Change Act. We wanted to show UK government ministers how it would indeed be possible to make cuts in emissions so that by 2050 the UK could progressively have reduced greenhouse gas pollution by 80 per cent compared with emissions in 1990. It was a radical and demanding agenda that we’d adopted and it was important to show the practical steps that could be made in achieving it.
The analysis we presented was based on an electricity sector model that we had developed. Different data and assumptions could be inputted and using this we set out six possible lower carbon futures.
In our best case scenario we foresaw how it would be feasible to slash emissions by about 70 per cent by 2030.
This was based on an ambitious energy efficiency programme and a shift away from fossil energy and toward renewables, including wind and solar power. In that renewables mix was also an important role for biomass to replace coal in the country’s largest power station – Drax.
This was not only crucial for backing up intermittent renewable sources but also a key piece in a future electricity sector that we believed should avoid the construction of new nuclear power stations. In November 2008 our campaign succeeded and the UK was the first country in the world to adopt a new national law for the science-based reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Since then I’ve been working as an independent sustainability advisor, including with the advisory group Robertsbridge, of which I was a co-founder.
My work has included assisting various companies in meeting the targets set out in that new law. For example, I was the Chair of the industry campaign Action for Renewables which sought government and public support for the large-scale expansion of wind, tidal and wave power.
Different campaigners tried to stop the expansion of these renewable sources of electricity, however, and succeeded in derailing support for on-shore wind power developments.
Although in its infancy, concerns were also raised about proposals for different kinds of tidal power.
In the years after the Climate Change Act I was encouraged to see that Drax began to switch over to wood pellets to generate power but concerned to see that this too had come under attack. The broadly agreed view that sustainable biomass could have a role in the phase out of coal had gone, and in its place were claims  that it was actually worse than burning coal. It was against this backdrop of changed perspectives that myself and Robertsbridge colleagues were pleased to be invited to help Drax in devising a new sustainability plan.
Early on in our conversations with Drax it became clear that part of the challenge with biomass — deciding the extent to which it is a rational choice to help with the process of decarbonisation, is how the answer to that touches so many different issues.
For example, when it comes to the exit from coal, cleaner alternatives must be brought forward to replace it, including wind and solar power.
But although these sources of renewable energy are growing rapidly, they still come with their own challenges, especially because wind can’t generate on still days and solar ceases at night. This intermittency raises issues about what the best electricity storage or complementary clean power sources might be to back them up when needed.
There are important questions about the best sources of biomass and the extent to which long-distance transport of that fuel is desirable. On top of that are issues linked with the management of the forests from which the raw material is sourced, and whether the extraction of wood to generate power can be compatible with carbon neutrality. There is the matter of nature conservation and the extent to which wood fuel demand will affect the status of species and habitats of conservation concern. For example, to what extent might the wood pellet industry be driving the conversion of semi-natural woodlands to plantations?
All of this is bound up with the economic and social conditions prevailing in the landscapes from which the wood is derived and the extent to which those buying wood fuel can pursue positive outcomes for the environment, even when carbon and wildlife are at best of marginal concern to the local forest owners growing the wood.
Then there is the extent to which economic incentives might be linked with the carbon stocks held in the forest. For example, strong demand for wood is held to be the main reason why
since the 1950s the volume of carbon stored in standing timber in the forests of the US South has
increased
by over 100%.
Demand for wood might seem counter-intuitive as a positive factor in maintaining tree cover, but in the US South it has been a big part of the picture.
On top of all this is the question of what would happen if there were no demand for wood fuel. In landscapes that have seen volatility in demand arising from the decline in newsprint in favour of digital devices and the slowdown in US house building following the 2008 financial crisis, this is not easy to answer.
Although seeking answers is a complex task, our advice to Drax was that it should work with its many stakeholders in finding the best possible fit between its business planning and these and other questions.
One way of doing that would be to set out the different issues in an accessible manner and hence the production of the film that can be seen
here
.
It’s called ‘
The biomass sustainability story
’
And while most of us can agree with the basic idea that we have to stop burning coal, it seems the big questions are about what might be the best ways to do it? Might biomass have a role? I believe it does.
Have a look at the film
and see what you think, especially if you feel as though you’ve already made up your mind.

What’s next for bioenergy?
11 July 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Discussions about our future are closely entwined with those of our power. Today, when we talk about electricity, we talk about climate change, about new fuels and about the sustainability of new technologies. They’re all inexplicably linked, and all hold uncertainties for the future.
But in preparing for what’s to come, it helps to have an idea of what may be waiting for us. Researchers at universities across the UK, including the University of Manchester and Imperial College London, have put their heads together to think about this question, and together with the Supergen Bioenergy programme they’ve created a unique
graphic novel on bioenergy
that outlines three potential future scenarios.
Based on their imagined views of the future there’s plenty to be optimistic about, but it could just as easily go south.
Future one: Failure to act on climate change
In the first scenario, our energy use and reliance on non-renewable fuels like oil, coal and gas continues to grow until we miss our window of opportunity to invest in renewable technology and infrastructure while it’s affordable.
Neither the beginning nor the end of the supply chain divert from their current trends – energy providers produce electricity and end users consume it as they always have. Governments continue to pursue growth at all costs and industrial users make no efforts to reverse their own rates of power consumption. In response, electricity generation with fossil fuels ramps up, which leads to several problems.
Attempts to secure a dwindling stock of non-renewable fuels lead to clashes over remaining sources as nations vie for energy security. As resources run out, attempts to put in place renewable alternatives are hampered by a lack of development and investment in the intervening years. The damages caused by climate change accelerate and at the same time, mobility for most people drops as fuel becomes more expensive.
Future two: Growing a stable, centralised bioenergy
A future of dwindling resources and increasing tension isn’t the only way forward. Bioenergy is likely to play a prominent role in the energy mix of the future. In fact, nearly all
scenarios
where global temperature rise remains within the two degrees Celsius margin (recommended by the Paris Agreement) rely on widespread bioenergy use with
carbon capture and storage
(BECCS). But how far could the implementation of bioenergy go?
A second scenario sees governments around the world invest significantly in biomass energy systems which then become major, centralised features in global energy networks. This limits the effects of a warming climate, particularly as CCS technology matures and more carbon can be sequestered safely underground.
This has knock-on effects for the rest of the world.
Large tracts of land are turned over to forestry
to support the need for biomass, creating new jobs for those involved in managing the working forests. In industry, large-scale CCS systems are installed at sizeable factories and manufacturing plants to limit emissions even further.
Future 3: The right mix bioenergy
A third scenario takes a combined approach – one in which technology jumps ahead and consumption is controlled. Instead of relying on a few concentrated hubs of BECCS energy, renewables and bioenergy are woven more intimately around our everyday lives. This relies on the advance of a few key technologies.
Widespread adoption of advanced
battery technology
sees
wind and solar implemented at scale
, providing the main source of electricity for cities and other large communities. These communities are also responsible for generating biomass fuel from domestic waste products, which includes wood offcuts from timber that makes up a larger proportion of building materials as wooden buildings grow more common.
Whether future three – or any of the above scenarios – will unfold like this is uncertain. These are just three possible futures from an infinite range of scenarios, but they demonstrate just how wide the range of futures is. It’s up to us all – not just governments but businesses, individuals and academics such as those behind this research project too – to to make the best choices to ensure the future we want.

How quickly will these countries reach their climate targets?
28 June 2017
Power generation

It was no surprise when President Donald Trump echoed his election campaign stance and announced his intention to renegotiate – or failing that withdraw the US – from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. It raised the question, would other countries back away from their own climate change targets?
In fact, many reaffirmed their commitment to the pact and continue their progress towards becoming low carbon economies. For those in the European Union, this means meeting the
2030 climate and energy framework
, which sets three key targets for member states: cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40% from 1990 levels, produce at least 27% of their energy through renewable sources, and improve energy efficiency by at least 27%.
Many countries across Europe, however, have set climate objectives that go beyond these. Whether they can meet those goals is another matter.
Portugal
What are its climate targets?
The Portuguese government has pressed the EU to go further than its 2030 targets and is aiming for
40% of total energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030
. This target is part of its Green Growth Commitment 2030, which also sets out to create more green – or low carbon economy – jobs and improve overall energy efficiency across the country.
How is it achieving this?
Portugal has rapidly increased its renewable energy production by investing in wind (mainly onshore) and hydro power, although it is rapidly developing its solar capabilities. It is also looking at small scale renewable energy generation through wave, thermal and biomass power.
Portugal has two operational coal plants that together are responsible for 16% of the country’s carbon emissions. However, the government is seeking to phase these out prior to 2025.
How is it doing so far?
The growth in renewable energy within the power industry specifically has been a big success story for Portugal. In 2005, renewables accounted for only 16% of total electricity production – by 2015 they produced an average of 52%.
The country made headlines in May 2016 for running on 100% renewable electricity for four days in a row. Unsurprisingly, this means the government is confident of achieving a target of
31% renewables in gross final energy consumption
by 2020, which would mean 57.4% renewable electricity generation.
Germany
What are its climate targets?
Germany set its current climate targets as far back as 2007. It subsequently agreed to the Paris Agreement and the EU’s 2014 climate and energy framework.
Added to this, the country has its own
ambitious aims for 2050
: cut GHG emissions by up to 95% compared to 1990 levels (with an interim target of 40% by 2020), increase the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption to 60%, and increase all electricity generated from renewables to 80%.
How does it plan to achieve this?
Germany’s Climate Action Programme 2020 and
Climate Action Plan 2050
, set out its plans for reducing GHG emissions. Much of this is based around the Energiewende (energy transition), a strategy that will see the country phase-out nuclear power and decarbonise the economy through renewable energy initiatives.
According to these plans, Germany’s energy supply must be
almost completely decarbonised
by 2050, with coal power slowly phased out and replaced with renewables, especially wind power. The utilisation of biomass will be limited and sourced mostly from waste. It also stresses the role of the
European Union Emission Trading System
to meet targets.
How is it doing so far?
Between 1990 and 2015, emissions reduced by 27%. In 2015, the share of renewable sources in German domestic power consumption
amounted to 31.6%.
However, German energy-related
CO₂ emissions rose almost 1% in 2016
, despite a fall in coal use and the ongoing expansion of renewable energy sources. This rise is due in part to an overall increase in energy consumption and an increase in natural gas use and diesel for electricity, heat and transport.
Projections from the environment ministry in September 2016 indicated that Germany will
likely miss its 2020 climate target
.
UK
https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AdobeStock_90651791.mp4
What are its climate targets?
Alongside its EU and Paris commitments, the UK Houses of Parliament approved the Climate Change Act in 2008, which commits to reducing GHG emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050.
The Act requires the government to set legally-binding
carbon budgets
, a cap on the amount of GHG emitted in the UK over a five-year period. The first five carbon budgets have been put into legislation and will run up to 2032. These include reducing emissions 37% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 57% by 2030.
A key milestone in the UK’s decarbonisation is to entirely phase out coal by 2025, which will mean either closing or converting (as in the case of
Drax Power Station
) existing coal power stations.
How does it plan to achieve this?
Under its legally binding
carbon budget system
, every tonne of GHG emitted between now and 2050 will count. Where emissions rise in one sector of the economy (be it agriculture, heavy industry, power, transport, etc.), the UK must achieve corresponding falls in another.
The UK’s initial focus has been to transition to renewable electricity production. Wind, biomass and solar power have all grown significantly, aided by government support, and by
initiatives like the carbon price floor.
How is it doing so far?
The UK’s progress towards its targets is positive, but leaves room for improvement. Renewables generated 14.9% of the UK’s electricity in 2013. In 2015 they accounted for nearly a quarter of electricity generation and by 2016,
low carbon power sources contributed an average of 40% of the UK’s power
, with wind generating more power than coal for the first time ever.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy estimates that as of
2016 GHG emissions fell 42% since 1990
. Despite this, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said that the government is
not on track to meet its pledge of cutting emissions 80% by 2050
.
However, it points out the UK
is
likely to meet the target of making electricity almost entirely low-carbon by early 2030s, but only if further steps are taken such as including increasing investment in more low-carbon generation (such as biomass), and developing
carbon capture and storage (CCS)
technologies. The UK government is due to publish an
emissions reduction plan
in the autumn of 2017.

Norway
What are its climate targets?
Norway’s climate policy is based on
agreements reached in the Storting
(the Norwegian Parliament) in 2008 and 2012. They stipulate a commitment to reduce global GHG emissions by at least 30% by 2020 from 1990 levels. The government also approved the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
As well as signing the Paris Agreement, Norway has aligned itself with the European Union’s climate target and intends to fulfil its commitment collectively with the EU (of which it is not a member state). This means using the EU emissions trading market, international cooperation on emissions reductions, and project-based cooperation.
How does it plan to achieve this?
Around
98% of Norway’s electricity production
already comes from renewable energy sources, mostly through its more than 900 hydropower plants. The remainder is through wind and thermal power.
Norway exports hydropower to the Netherlands and exchanges renewable energy with Denmark, Sweden and Finland. There are plans for similar green exchanges with Germany and the United Kingdom via interconnectors within the next five years.
Norway is also aided by a substantial carbon sink in its forests which cover 30% of its land surface. They sequester (absorb and store) carbon from the atmosphere to such an extent that it equals approximately half of the Scandinavian country’s annual emissions.
How is it doing so far?
While Norway already has one of the world’s most carbon neutral electricity sectors, its significant domestic oil and gas sector means it still struggles to reduce its overall emissions. As such, the government is expected to rely on carbon trading with the EU or international offsets to meet its ambitious goals.
Nonetheless, earlier this year the
government said
that GHG emissions will fall to around 1990 levels by 2020, although it did not stipulate whether this included buying carbon credits from abroad or not.
