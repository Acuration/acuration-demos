Press Release
Power station rail project named as best in class
19 September 2018
Press releases

The partnership between Drax Power Station, near Selby, in North Yorkshire and
Davis Wagon Services
saw a new fleet of freight wagons designed and built to deliver the biomass needed to produce renewable electricity for millions of homes.
It also enabled Davis Wagon Services, a North Lincolnshire-based rail firm, to invest £850,000 in revamping a mothballed Ferrybridge rail yard as a dedicated site to rebrand and maintain the power station’s fleet of 225 unique freight wagons, securing local jobs in the process.
Now, the programme has been named as the ‘Project of the Year’ by industry body the Rail Freight Group in recognition of the innovation involved in the work by Drax and Davis Wagon Services, the UK’s last independent freight wagon manufacturer.
The wagons, which transport biomass from ports on the east and west coasts of the UK to Drax, are maintained at the newly re-opened Ferrybridge yard, just over 20 miles away from the power station.
John Hall, MD of Davis Wagon Services, said:
“This is a monumental achievement for us and to be recognised in this way for the work we’ve done is incredible. We couldn’t have done it without the support of Drax.
“There are so many outstanding projects in our industry, and so to be singled out like this is a huge compliment to everyone who worked on the project.”
Drax Power CEO Andy Koss said:
“This was an important project for us and I’m delighted that the innovation and hard work of everyone involved has been recognised in this way.
“These trains deliver up to 20,000 tonnes of biomass every day to the power station playing a vital part in supplying renewable power to millions of homes and businesses. Furthermore, the project has helped support a local business and revitalise a disused facility within the Northern Powerhouse region, which we’re very proud to be a part of.”
The rail project – described as a ‘
Northern Powerhouse success story’
in July by government minister Jake Berry – began in 2011 when Drax appointed Davis, along with Lloyds Register Rail (Ricardo) to design and develop bespoke rail wagons to ferry biomass to the power station, the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
It also saw Davis take on the work to maintain the 225 wagons and the firm will also now re-brand each one over the next two years in new livery featuring both Drax and the Northern Powerhouse logos.

Editor’s Notes
The majority of the biomass Drax uses comes from North America and Europe on ships to ports on the east and west coasts of the UK (Immingham, Hull, Port of Tyne and Liverpool). It is then taken to the power station from the ports by rail.
Drax has an average of 17 biomass trains arriving at the power station per day (over a six-day working week) in order to supply the pellets needed to generate and supply 15 per cent of the UK’s renewable electricity.
Each train contains sufficient fuel to provide 815 houses in the UK with enough electricity for a year.
The fuel is transported to Drax via rail rather than road, to further reduce carbon emissions, as it is more efficient than road transportation. Using rail saves approximately 270,000 truck journeys per year and is estimated to save 32,622.50 tonnes of C02 per year
Independent research by Oxford Economics using 2016 data showed that Drax supported over 18,500 jobs across the country – more than 6,000 of which were across the North of England (Yorkshire and Humber, North West and North East). In addition Drax generated £577m for the Northern Powerhouse regional economy and £1.7 billion for the whole of the UK.

Drax Power CEO Andy Koss comments on Electric Insights report ‘Coal comeback pushes up UK’s carbon emissions’
17 September 2018
Press releases

“The carbon price has been the driving force behind Britain’s decarbonisation. This analysis shows that even with the carbon price, market conditions can be such that coal power can have a resurgence. The UK is getting closer to removing coal from the power system by 2025, but we’re not there yet.
“Even now, with so much coal already removed from the system, emissions from power generation would rise significantly without a strong carbon price, making it very difficult to deliver the clean growth required to meet our climate targets.”

Next generation of engineers kick start careers at Drax
30 August 2018
Press releases

The technical apprentice scheme at Drax
offers apprentices the chance to learn a trade, develop new skills and launch their career in engineering at the UK’s biggest power station and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.
The nine apprentices will be trained in engineering to work within the maintenance department at Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire. They will work on new and recently upgraded plant designed to process biomass and the maintenance of the power station.
Having upgraded two thirds of the power station from coal to use renewable biomass, nearly 70% of the power produced at Drax Power Station, is now renewable – enough for four million households.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“I welcome this year’s apprentices – they have a really bright future ahead of them.
“Apprenticeships are vital to our success as a business. Having talented people at all stages of their careers is important in building and retaining the skilled workforce we need, if we are to continue to innovate and enable the business to grow.
“As one of the major employers in the Northern Powerhouse region, we have an important role to play in helping to drive up standards in education by making sure children and young people have inspirational experiences in the world of work.
“At Drax we’re delivering on that, both by increasing the number of apprenticeships we’re offering and through the outreach work we do with schools and colleges which enables thousands of students to visit the power station each year.”
This year’s apprentices, from Selby, Goole, Doncaster, North Lincolnshire and Gainsborough, are aged between 16 and 19.
Jamie Goodall, 16, from Addingfleet, near Goole, said, “I’m really looking forward to getting some hands-on, practical experience. I was really ready to get out of a school classroom and start learning in a different way, so it’s exciting to be here.”
18-year-old Cameron Shipstone, from Hemingbrough, near Selby, added, “My dad works at Drax and has done so his whole working life. I visited the power station when I was young and saw the scale of everything, and all the interesting things that were going on.
“I then did some work experience at Drax, and realised a career in engineering was so much more appealing than going to uni – I can’t wait to get started now.”
Andy Koss continued, “Many of our engineers, section heads and department managers are former Drax apprentices who have spent 30 years or more at the plant.
“We’re doing a lot of exciting things at the moment so it’s a great time to join – we’ve just successfully converted our fourth generating unit from coal to biomass and we’re also exploring options for repowering our two remaining coal units to gas and developing large-scale battery storage.”
The Drax Apprenticeship Training Scheme is a four-year programme, and specialises in three engineering disciplines: Mechanical, Electrical and Control & Instrumentation.
Drax offers apprenticeships in engineering disciplines as well as business support areas, such as Finance and Business Administration.

Drax Power Station in Selby, North Yorkshire, welcomed Nigel Adams MP, for the official switch on of its fourth biomass generating unit.
22 August 2018
Press releases

The Selby MP joined Drax Group CEO Will Gardiner, Drax Power CEO Andy Koss and project manager Adam Nicholson to celebrate the power station moving closer to achieving its coal-free ambitions. Work got under way on the conversion as part of a planned maintenance programme in June, with Drax’s team of engineers completing the work required, on schedule, in just over two months.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO said:
“This is another major milestone in the transformation of the power station. It will extend the life of the plant, protecting jobs, whilst delivering cleaner, reliable power for millions of homes and businesses.”
Drax is already the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe, and the conversion of a fourth generating unit means it is on course to be off coal before the government’s 2025 deadline. Drax will now continue its work to replace its remaining two coal units with gas-fired power generating units.

Drax closer to coal-free future with fourth biomass unit conversion
20 August 2018
Press releases

Drax has switched on its fourth biomass generating unit – taking the power station in North Yorkshire a step closer to achieving its coal-free ambitions.
Work got under way on the conversion as part of a planned maintenance programme in June, with Drax’s team of engineers completing the work required, on schedule, in just over two months.
Having upgraded three of its coal units to use biomass, Drax is already the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe. The conversion of a fourth unit means it is on course to be off coal before the government’s 2025 deadline.
To convert the unit the project team has re-used some redundant infrastructure left from when the company was first co-firing biomass with coal on a large scale, around eight years ago.

A trial last year confirmed that by modifying the old co-firing fuel transportation system, compressed wood pellets can be delivered in the quantities required to fully convert the fourth generating unit.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“This is another major milestone in the transformation of the power station. It will extend the life of the plant, protecting jobs, whilst delivering cleaner, reliable power for millions of homes and businesses.
“It is testament to the engineering expertise, skill and ingenuity we have at Drax. The team has developed some very innovative solutions for this upgrade, using all the knowledge we’ve gained throughout the work we have done so far to transform the business using sustainable biomass.”
The cost of conversion of the fourth generating unit is significantly below the level of previous conversions, at around £30 million.
Drax has already invested around £700 million in upgrading the first three units and associated supply chain infrastructure to use sustainable biomass instead of coal.
Nigel Adams MP for Selby said:
“I’m delighted to see Unit 4 in operation as a biomass unit, continuing the good work Drax is doing with its Beyond Coal strategy, protecting jobs and ensuring it continues to play a vital role in the Northern Powerhouse economy.”
The fourth unit will help the power station, at Selby in North Yorkshire, to deliver vital reliable and flexible power needed by the grid to maintain secure supplies as more renewables come online and the sector continues to decarbonise.
Drax will now continue its work to replace its remaining two coal units, with gas-fired power generating units. The Combined Cycle Gas Turbines it is looking to develop could deliver up to 3.6GW of capacity, as well as up to 200MW of battery storage.
Drax’s plans for the gas project have been submitted to the Planning Inspectorate, which accepted the application for examination. The proposals will now be examined by the Planning Inspectorate and then considered by the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy with a decision expected in 2019.
In the UK there has been an 84 per cent reduction in coal-fired power generation in the last five years as low carbon generation has increased.

Editor’s Notes
Drax welcomed
the UK Government’s response to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the Renewable Obligation scheme, published in January.
It proposed that, rather than imposing a cap on Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) support for any future biomass unit conversions, a cap would be applied at the power station level across all units receiving ROCs.
This will protect existing converted generating units and limit the amount of incremental ROCs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125,000 per annum.
As a result, once the unit is converted this summer, Drax expects to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three ROC units under the cap, whilst supporting the Government’s objective of controlling costs under the Renewable Obligation scheme.
Drax also has a biomass generating unit which receives support under the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme. This unit is unaffected by the government consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the RO scheme.
The fourth generating unit at Drax was switched on in 1986 when the second half of the power station known as ‘Drax B’ began generating power from coal. This was 12 years after the first half of the power station began generating power in 1974
Drax converted its first three coal units to use biomass between 2013 and 2016.
65% of the electricity Drax produced in 2017 was renewable – enough to power four million households.
Drax signed up to the Powering Past Coal Alliance
in April
. The UK-Canadian initiative seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries.
Drax is the most efficient power station in the UK’s coal fleet and Drax’s fourth unit would have been one of the last to close under the Government’s coal phase out plans. This means Drax is closing a coal unit nearly seven years earlier than anticipated.
In 2016
Drax supported
more than 6,000 jobs in the Northern Powerhouse region, whilst generating £577m for the local economy.

Drax could help keep the fizz in the drinks sector
10 August 2018
Press releases

But now the country’s biggest power station has met with the British Beer & Pub Association to see if it can keep the pep in the nation’s pints.
Drax, which owns Britain’s biggest power station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, is about to begin a pilot trialling the first Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) project of its kind in Europe, which could make the renewable power generated at Drax carbon negative.
If successful the BECCS project could also help to secure future access to CO
2
for the UK’s breweries and pubs.
During a six month trial, due to get underway in the next few months, a tonne of CO
2
could be captured and stored each day from one of the power station’s biomass fuelled generating units.
That’s enough to produce the fizz for 32,000 pints of beer a day – equivalent to 5.7 million over the course of the six month project, which is more than enough to put the bubbles in a pint for everyone in Yorkshire.
If successful, the technology being trialled could be scaled up to capture even more CO
2
at the power station – the largest single site renewable power generator in the country.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“We’re excited to be discussing our BECCS project with the BBPA. This pilot not only has the potential to ensure the UK meets its climate targets, but for the carbon captured to also help to keep the nation’s beer from going flat – and we’d certainly raise a glass to that.”
Brigid Simmonds, British Beer & Pub Association CEO, said:
“Beer is the nation’s favourite alcoholic beverage and on average pubs serve as much as 10 million pints of beer per day, so the recent shortfall of CO
2
was most unwelcome. We hope that these discussions with Drax Group and the potential to increase access to a new source of CO
2
in the UK will help ensure that a shortage does not happen again.”
Enabling other industries to use the CO
2
produced from Drax’s renewable power generation, has the potential to allow businesses to use the carbon dioxide from a renewable source without contributing additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere – making their processes carbon neutral.

Drax
announced its BECCS pilot
in May. The carbon captured will be stored on site in compressed form with a view to working with partner organisations able to use the carbon to create further value in their own processes.
Editor’s notes
Drax is working with Leeds-based
C-Capture
which has developed the technology for the project.
Drax has invested £400,000 in the trial which could be the first of several pilot projects undertaken at the power station to deliver a rapid, lower cost demonstration of BECCS.
BECCS is vital to global efforts to combat climate change because the technology will mean the gases that cause global warning can be removed from the atmosphere at the same time as electricity is produced. This means power generation would no longer contribute to climate change, but would start to reduce the carbon accumulating in the atmosphere.
A report by the Energy Technology Institute
in 2016 has suggested that by the 2050s BECCS could deliver roughly 55 million tonnes of net negative emissions a year in the UK – approximately half the nation’s emissions target.

Drax signs £40 million contract with Siemens for turbine upgrades
31 July 2018
Press releases

Drax Power, which operates the biggest power station in the UK, has signed a new £40 million contract with
Siemens
for the upgrade of turbines on three of its biomass units over the next three years.
The upgrades will deliver efficiencies, as well as maintenance savings, which will cut the cost of biomass electricity production at the plant in North Yorkshire.
The work, which starts in 2019, will take three years to complete, with one biomass unit being upgraded each year as part of its planned major overhaul. The efficiencies will be gained by fitting new, high tech pipework and valves, with new high efficiency blading and long life seals within the turbines on biomass units 1, 2 and 3.
Since transforming half of the power station to run on compressed wood pellets instead of coal it has become Europe’s biggest decarbonisation project – and the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator.
Andy Koss, Drax Power CEO, said:
“We firmly believe that biomass has a long-term role to play in the UK’s energy infrastructure. We’re looking at a number of ways to bring down the costs of our biomass generation – and these turbine upgrades are an important part of that work.
“Reducing the costs of our biomass operations will help to preserve the life of the plant and protect jobs, whilst we continue to produce the flexible, renewable power millions of homes and businesses rely on.”
Darren Davidson, Managing Director, Power Generation Services, Power and Gas, Siemens added:
“Siemens and Drax have a long-standing and proud partnership so it’s fantastic that we will now help them further develop their biomass solution. Once delivered this project will improve plant efficiency and flexibility and provide a further source of low carbon power to UK homes, businesses and services.”
Drax has upgraded three of its coal units to run on biomass with
a fourth unit currently being converted
– due to return to service later in the summer. It also plans to
repower its remaining two coal units
to use gas and develop up to 200MW of battery storage.
The cost of the upgrades are within Drax’s existing plans with payment upon completion of the works.

Heatwave electricity demand surges as we battle to keep cool
27 July 2018
Press releases

Soaring temperatures have seen Great Britain’s electricity demand spike as we crank up the air conditioning and turn up our freezers – with demand increasing by almost 900MW. The increased demand is the equivalent of an extra 2.5 million households, or an area the size of the whole of Scotland, new data from Drax Electric Insights reveals.
Demand for electricity rises 350MW for every degree the temperature rises above 20°C. With temperatures peaking at 36°C, the electricity system has really been feeling the heat.
Dr
Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, who compiles the Electric Insights reports, said:
“As the temperature rises, we use more cooling technology – that’s everything from office air conditioning, to fans, all of which use electricity. Places like supermarkets, with their large freezer sections, are some of the biggest energy users – as the temperature hots up, everything has to work that bit harder to keep cool.
“Global demand for cooling technology is only going to increase as temperatures, and global income, rise. More people will be willing and able to invest in the technology, which will add greater stress to the system during the summer months. That being said, it’s still far easier to manage this demand in the summer, as with hot weather comes plenty of solar power.
“Thankfully, we’re able to provide electricity for cooling that’s relatively low in carbon thanks to this solar technology – it’s still the winter months that are the most carbon intensive as we need to ramp up gas and coal generation.”
The increased summer demand is only expected to grow with National Grid predicting that the peak load from air conditioners will triple in the coming decade.
Andy Koss, CEO of Drax Power, said:
“It’s no surprise that the recent heatwave has equated to a surge in demand. The summer months are much greener in terms of electricity production thanks to the country’s reliance on renewables, but the challenge of balancing the system is very real.
“When there is increased solar and wind generation, our biomass units not only work to meet the demand caused by the greater need for cooling but also to balance the system and provide support services to the Grid.”
Drax has upgraded half of its power station in North Yorkshire from coal to use sustainable biomass, and is in the process of converting a fourth. It is now the biggest single site renewable generator in the country and the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.

About Electric Insights
Electric Insights Quarterly was commissioned by Drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from Imperial College London, facilitated by the College’s consultancy company – Imperial Consultants. The report analyses raw data that are made publicly available by National Grid and Elexon, which run the electricity and balancing market respectively. Released four times a year, it will focus on supply and demand, prices, emissions, the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them.
Along with Dr Iain Staffell, the team from Imperial included Professors Richard Green and Tim Green, experts in energy economics and electrical engineering, and Dr Rob Gross who contributed expertise in energy policy. The work to date has revealed scope for further research in this area, to inform both government and organisations within the energy industry.
The quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website
electricinsights.co.uk
which provides live data from 2009 until the present.
