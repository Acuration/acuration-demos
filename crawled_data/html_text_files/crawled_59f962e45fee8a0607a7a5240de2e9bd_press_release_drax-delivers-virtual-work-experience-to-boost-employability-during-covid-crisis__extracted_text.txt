power station drax delivers virtual work experience to boost employability during covid crisis employees at britains biggest power station have teamed up with educational charity teach first to ensure that students dont miss out on valuable work experience during the covid crisis 19 april 2021 drax group has offered students a virtual insight into the world of work as part of the energy companys continued support for stem education supporting its efforts to increase social mobility for one million people the virtual work experience programme ran online during the school holidays providing students with an insight into working in the energy sector drax power station usually hosts dozens of school pupils during its work experience programmes each year as well as thousands of visitors from schools and colleges who enjoy free educational tours however during the covid crisis all educational visits to the site have had to stop to reduce covid risks and protect draxs keyworkers who operate its power stations and keep the lights on for millions of homes and businesses across england and scotland to ensure theyre not missing out on the valuable insights they gain from work experience programmes the energy company put together a fourday online programme for disadvantaged students from schools across england it has plans to roll the virtual work experience programme out nationally supporting the companys mobilising a million initiative which aims to increase social mobility by creating opportunities to support education and improve employability ensuring the country has the skilled workforce needed to support a postcovid green economic recovery drax groups head of sustainable business vicky bullivant said we work closely with schools in our communities to inspire children from all backgrounds to study stem subjects so the next generation has the education and skills needed to support businesses like ours as we continue to develop and grow with students unable to visit our sites during the covid crisis its essential they dont miss out on the opportunities businesses like drax would usually provide virtual work experience builds on the work weve already done to provide laptops free internet access and virtual tours of the power station to ensure no students are left behind in their studies during the lockdown students who applied to take part in draxs virtual work experience programme could choose from four different business streams engineering business support it and project management  finance minister for apprenticeships and skills gillian keegan said giving young people the chance to gain a first glimpse into the workplace is vital to inspire their career goals and open their eyes to the wide range of opportunities available to them its fantastic to see drax offering these brilliant opportunities drax partnered with teach first to deliver its virtual work experience programme  an educational charity which aims to build a fair education for all by tackling inequality in the sector russell hobby ceo of teach first said even before the pandemic hit the poorest pupils were too often left behind their odds of succeeding at school and in the working world are now even tougher as a result of covid19 work experience is a vital opportunity for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to gain the skills and connections they need to succeed were grateful to businesses like drax for helping to make sure that every child can maximise their potential participants in draxs virtual work experience programme learnt about the energy company focusing on developing employability skills and learning about their business area through conversations with employees and targeted projects they also had the opportunity to ask members of draxs executive committee about their careers during a qa session engineering student tahmid md said this was a great week and ive learnt a lot from the experience the cv building and interview sessions were especially helpful and i really enjoyed the engineering projects i took part in this years covid lockdown resulted in many students being home schooled for months so the drax virtual work experience programme took place during the easter holidays so that participants did not miss any more vital classroom time during the school term drax plans to host two more virtual work experience programmes during the summer and october school holidays ends media contacts ben wicks media manager e email protected t 07761525662 megan hopgood media and pr intern e email protected t
