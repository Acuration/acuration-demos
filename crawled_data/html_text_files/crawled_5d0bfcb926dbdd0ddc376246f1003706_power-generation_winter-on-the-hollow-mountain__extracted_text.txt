power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station winter on the hollow mountain how a power station in the highlands uses the harsh scottish weather to its advantage 15 january 2020 power generation scotlands landscape is defined by its weather the millennia of wind rain and snow has battered the country ebbing away at its rivers mountains valleys and deep lochs forged by ice ages and volcanos weather also plays an important role in the countrys power generation the country has more than 9 gigawatts gw of installed wind power  enough to sometimes meet double scotlands electricity demand  as well as having a long history of hydropower but while it is an intrinsic part of the country scotlands weather can be anything but pleasant rain can be persistent and when the temperature drops in winter it turns to snow  a lot of it scotland gets more snow than any other part of the uk scottish poet robert burns described the harshness of the winter months in his 1781 poem winter a dirge the wintry west extends his blast and hail and rain does blaw or the stormy north sends driving forth the blinding sleet and snaw sleet and snaw snow fall occurs on average for 38 days a year in scotland compared to an average of 23 days across the rest of the united kingdom and can remain covering mountaintops long into spring ben cruachan the peak of ben cruachan in the western highlands is no exception cruachan power station  on the slopes of the mountain however must be ready to either generate or absorb electricity through all forms of weather  even the most severe on a few occasions the snowfall has been so extreme that weve been unable to access the dam for a few weeks at a time says gordon pirie a civil engineer at cruachan thankfully we have enough controls in place where we are still able to monitor and operate things remotely mountain road from cruachan power station to its dam blocked due to snow this mountainside location and winter weather can make for tough working conditions but cruachan is designed to handle it in fact in some cases it benefits from it taking advantage of wet weather cruachan is built around the geography and climate of the highlands it stores water in an upper reservoir 400 meters 1312 feet up ben cruachan and uses its elevation to run it down the mountain spin a turbine and generate power and when there is excess electricity being generated nationally the same turbines reverse and use the excess electricity to pump water from loch awe up to the reservoir helping to balance the grid this acts as a form of energy storage by essentially stockpiling the excess electricity in the form of water held in the top reservoir for the most part the water used to generate electricity comes exclusively from loch awe and is passed up and down the mountain however 10 of it comes for free as its collected from natural rainfall and surface water that makes its way to the upper reservoir through cruachans aqueducts this system of 14 kilometres of interconnected concrete pipes covers a 23 square kilometre radius around the reservoir and is designed to bring in water from 75 intakes dotted around the top of the mountain a north of scotland hydroelectric board diagram from c1960s showing the aqueducts feeding cruachans dam click to viewdownload some of these intakes are as small as street drains while others are large enough to drive a land rover into its part of piries job to keep them in good working order so they continue to deliver water to the reservoir as the intakes are scattered around the mountaintop they must be able to deal with whatever the scottish winter throws at them gordon pirie civil engineer and cruachan power station dam even in freezing conditions the water will still flow through the aqueduct system the intakes have a builtin feature which allows the water to flow into them even if the surface is frozen solid explains pirie any snow or frost on the ground eventually thaws and makes its way to the reservoir as spring arrives and snow begins to thaw across the highlands greater volumes of water will run off into the reservoir and the power stations engineers work to manage the water level keeping water pressure under control thawing snow can bring greater volumes of water into the reservoir the power station must be able to pump water and absorb excess electricity from the grid at a moments notice this ability to turn excess electricity into stored energy makes cruachan hugely useful in controlling the grids voltage frequency and in keeping it stable  however there must be enough space available in the reservoir for the water being pumped up the mountainside to enter  even when excessive rainfall or melting snow begins to naturally fill it up the power station can control the reservoir levels through a number of means this includes the ability to close off an aqueduct or to run the turbines without generating electricity so the team can move water from the reservoir into loch awe below if the water level and pressure on the dam reaches dangerous levels a dispenser valve can be opened in an emergency sending a jet of water flying out the dam to cascade safely down the mountainside however outside of testing this has never been necessary to do and while the weather might be the most persistent natural force the power station must deal with its not the only one recently we had an issue with a bat roosting within one of the tunnels in which we were carrying out stabilisation works recalls pirie it was looking for a suitable location to hibernate for the winter and the tunnel provided the ideal environment we had to stop works to have a bat survey undertaken and apply for a bat license cruachans location makes for stunning views of the highlands but occasionally brutally cold and perilously wet conditions come with the territory for the power station team working with the sometimesdespairing weather is all part of what allows the hollow mountain to operate as it has done for more than half a century the highlands around ben cruachan are rich with wildlife educational information on areas flora and fauna can
