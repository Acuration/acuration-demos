5 projects proving carbon capture is a reality
4 March 2020
Carbon capture

The concept of capturing carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from power station, refinery and factory exhausts has long been hailed as crucial in mitigating the climate crisis and getting the UK and the rest of the world to
net zero
. After a number of false starts and policy hurdles, the technology is now growing with more momentum than ever. Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) is finally coming of age.
Increasing
innovation
and
investment
in the space is enabling the development of CCUS schemes at scale. Today, there are over 19 large-scale CCUS facilities in operation worldwide, while a further 32 in development as confidence in
government policies
and
investment frameworks
improves.
Once CO
2
is captured it can be stored underground in empty oil and gas reservoirs and naturally occurring saline aquifers, in a process known as sequestration. It has also long been used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a process where captured CO
2
is injected into oil reservoirs to increase oil production
.
Drax Power Station is already trialling
Europe’s first
bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project. This combination of sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of CO
2
a year and put Drax Power Station at the centre of wider decarbonisation efforts across the region as part of
Zero Carbon Humber
.
Here are five other projects making carbon capture a reality today:
Snøhvit & Sleipner Vest

Who:
Sleipner – Equinor Energy, Var Energi, LOTOS, KUFPEC; Snøhvit – Equinor Energy, Petoro, Total, Neptune Energy, Wintershall Dean
Where:
Norway
Sleipner Vest offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS) plant, Norway [Click to view/download]
Sleipner Vest
was the world’s first ever offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS) plant, and has been active since 1996. The facility separates CO
2
from natural gas extracted from the Sleipner field, as well as from at the Utgard field, about 20km away. This method of carbon capture means CO
2
is removed before the natural gas is combusted, allowing it to be used as an energy source with lower carbon emissions.
Snøhvit
, located offshore in Norway’s northern Barents Sea, operates similarly but here natural gas is pumped to an onshore facility for carbon removal. The separated and compressed CO
2
from both facilities is then stored, or sequestered, in empty reservoirs under the sea.
The two projects demonstrate the safety and reality of long-term CO
2
sequestration – as of 2019, Sleipner has captured and stored over 23 million tonnes of CO
2
while Snøhvit stores 700,000 tonnes of CO
2
per year.
Petra Nova
Who:
NRG, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, Inc. (MHIA) and JX Nippon, a joint venture with Hilcorp Energy

Where:
Texas, USA
In 2016, the largest carbon capture facility in the world began operation at the
Petra Nova
coal-fired power plant.
Using a solvent developed by Mitsubishi and Kansai Electric Power, called
KS-1
, the CO
2
is absorbed and compressed from the exhausts of the plant after the coal has been combusted. The captured CO
2
is then transported and used for EOR 80 miles away on the West Ranch oil field.
Carbon capture facility at the Petra Nova coal-fired power plant, Texas, USA
As of January 2020, over 3.5 million tonnes of CO
2
had been captured, reducing the plant’s carbon emissions by 90%. Oil production, on the other hand, increased by 1,300% to 4,000 barrels a day. As well as preventing CO
2
from being released into the atmosphere, CCUS has also aided the site’s sustainability by eliminating the need for hydraulic drilling.
Gorgon LNG, Barrow Island, Australia [Click to view/download]
Gorgon LNG
Who:
Operated by Chevron, in a joint venture with Shell, Exxon Mobil, Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas, Jera
Where:
Barrow Island, Australia
In 2019
CCS operations began
at one of Australia’s largest liquified natural gas production facilities, located off the Western coast. Here, CO
2
is removed from natural gas before the gas is cooled to -162
o
C, turning it into a liquid.
The
removed CO
2
is then injected via wells
into the Dupuy Formation, a saline aquifer 2km underneath Barrow Island.
Once fully operational (estimated to be in 2020), the project aims to reduce the facility’s emissions by about 40% and plans to store between 3.4 and 4 million tonnes of CO
2
each year.
Quest
Shell’s Quest carbon capture facility, Alberta, Canada
Who:
Operated by Shell, owned by Chevron and Canadian Natural Resources
Where:
Alberta, Canada
The Scotford Upgrader facility in Canada’s oil sands uses hydrogen to upgrade bitumen (a substance similar to asphalt) to make a synthetic crude oil.
In 2015, the
Quest
carbon capture facility was added to Scotford Upgrader to capture the CO
2
created as a result of making the site’s hydrogen. Once captured, the CO
2
is pressurised and turned into a liquid, which is piped and stored 60km away in the Basal Cambrian Sandstone saline aquifer.
Over its four years of crude oil production, four million tonnes of CO
2
have been captured. It is estimated that, over its 25-year life span, this CCS technology could capture and store over 27 million tonnes of CO
2
.
Chevron estimates that if the facility were to be built today, it would cost 20-30% less, a sign of the falling cost of the technology.
Boundary Dam
Who:
SaskPower
Where:
Saskatchewan, Canada
Boundary Dam
, a coal-fired power station, became the world’s first post-combustion CCS facility in 2014.
The technology uses
Shell’s Cansolv solvent
to remove CO
2
from the exhaust of one of the power station’s 115 MW units. Part of the captured CO
2
is used for EOR, while any unused CO
2
is stored in the Deadwood Formation, a brine and sandstone reservoir, deep underground.
As of December 2019, more than three million tonnes of CO
2
had been captured at Boundary Dam. The continuous improvement and optimisations made at the facility are proving CCS technology at scale and informing CCS projects around the world, including a possible retrofit project at SaskPower‘s 305 MW
Shand Power Station

What is net zero?
21 January 2020
Carbon capture

For age-old rivals Glasgow and Edinburgh, the race to the top has taken a sharp turn downwards. Instead, they’re in a race to the bottom to earn the title of the first ‘net zero’ carbon city in the UK.
While they might be battling to be the
first
in the UK to reach net zero, they are far from the
only
cities with net zero in their sights. In the wake of the growing climate emergency, cities, companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting ‘net zero’.
It has become a global focus based on necessity – for the world to hit the Paris Agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees Celsius, it’s predicted the world must become
net zero by 2070
.
Yet despite its ubiquity, net zero is a term that’s not always fully understood. So, what does net zero actually mean?
Glasgow, Scotland. Host of COP26.
What does net zero mean?
‘Going net zero’ most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions. But this doesn’t just mean cutting all emissions down to zero.
Instead, net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted
[
*
]
and removed by a company, geographic area or facility is in balance.
In practice, this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions, an entity must capture, absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases. The result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes, so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere. Its carbon contributions are effectively zero – or more specifically, net zero.
The
Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment
likens the net zero target to running a bath – an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps (the mechanism
adding
emissions) or draining some of the water from the bathtub (the thing
removing
of emissions from the atmosphere). If these two things are equally matched, the water level in the bath doesn’t change.
To reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change, a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved.
But while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple, actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries, countries and governments.
How to achieve net zero
The UK’s
Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommends that to reach net zero
all industries must be widely decarbonised, heavy good vehicles must switch to low-carbon fuel sources, and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions, such as biomass production.
However, given the nature of many of these industries (and others considered ‘hard-to-treat’, such as aviation and manufacturing), completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible. Instead, residual emissions must be
counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions
.
Natural solutions can include afforestation (planting new forests) and reforestation (replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland), which use trees’ natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions.
On the other hand, engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before it’s released into the atmosphere. It is estimated this technology can
capture in excess of 90% of the carbon
released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production.

Zero Carbon Humber
.
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere, often referred to as
negative
emissions.
BECCS
combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with CCUS. When that biomass comes from trees grown in
responsibly managed working forests
that absorb carbon, it becomes a low carbon fuel. When this process is combined with CCUS and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass’ use, the overall process removes more carbon than is released, creating ‘negative emissions’.
According to the
Global CCS Institute
, BECCS is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emission-heavy industries. A joint report by The Royal Academy of Engineering and Royal Society estimates that
BECCS could help the UK to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050
– eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy.
The UK’s move to net zero
In June 2019, the UK became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It is one of a small group of countries, including France and Sweden, that have enacted this ambition into law, forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero.
Electrical radiator
Although this is an ambitious target, the UK is making steady progress towards it. In 2018 the UK’s emissions were 44% below 1990 levels, while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising – June 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an all-time low, falling below
100 g/kWh for the first time
. This is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid.
Hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions, however. An increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required. On the whole, the CCC predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by CCUS solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the UK’s net zero target.
This will need substantial financial backing. The CCC forecasts that, at present, a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 1-2% of GDP between now and 2050. However, there is still much debate about the role the
global carbon markets
need to play to facilitate a more cost-effective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms.
Industries across the UK are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target. In the energy sector, projects such as
Drax Power Station’s carbon capture pilots
are turning BECCS increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale.
Along with these individual projects, reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors. The
Zero Carbon Humber
partnership between energy companies, industrial emitters and local organisations, for example, aims to deliver the UK’s first zero carbon industrial cluster in the Humber region by the mid-2020s.
Nonetheless, efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the UK stays on course to meet all its immediate and long-term emissions targets. And regardless of whether or not Edinburgh or Glasgow realise their net zero goals first, the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and society’s drive for real change across the UK.
Drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030 – removing more carbon from the atmosphere than produced in our operations, creating a negative carbon footprint. Track our progress at
Towards Carbon Negative
.
[*] In this article we’ve simplified our explanation of net zero. Carbon dioxide (CO
2
) is the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG). It is also a long-lived GHG that creates warming that persists in the long term. Although the land and ocean absorb it, a significant proportion stays in the atmosphere for centuries or even millennia causing climate change. It is, therefore, the most important GHG to abate. Other long-lived GHGs include include nitrous oxide (N
2
O, lifetime of circa 120 years) and some F-Gasses (e.g. SF
6
with a lifetime of circa 3,200 years). GHGs are often aggregated as carbon dioxide equivalent (abbreviated as CO
2
e or CO
2
eq) and it is this that net zero targets measure. In this article, ‘carbon’ is used for simplicity and as a proxy for ‘carbon dioxide’, ‘CO
2
‘, ‘GHGs’ or ‘CO
2
e’.

What is LNG and how is it cutting global shipping emissions?
5 July 2019
Sustainable business

Shipping is widely considered the most efficient form of cargo transport. As a result, it’s the transportation of choice for around
90% of world trade
. But even as the most efficient, it still accounts for roughly 3% of global carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions.
This may not sound like much, but it amounts to
1 billion tonnes
of CO
2
and other greenhouse gases per year – more than the UK’s total emissions output. In fact, if shipping were a country, it would be the sixth largest producer of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. And unless there are drastic changes, emissions related to shipping could increase from
between 50% and 250% by 2050
.
As well as emitting GHGs that directly contribute towards the climate emergency, big ships powered by fossil fuels such as bunker fuel (also known as heavy fuel oil) release other emissions. These include two that can have indirect impacts – sulphur dioxide (SO
2
) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Both impact air quality and can have human health and environmental impacts.
As a result, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is introducing measures that will actively look to force shipping companies to reduce their emissions. In January 2020 it will bring in new rules that dictate all vessels will need to use fuels with a sulphur content of below 0.5%.
One approach ship owners are taking to meet these targets is to fit ‘
scrubbers
’– devices which wash exhausts with seawater, turning the sulphur oxides emitted from burning fossil fuel oils into harmless calcium sulphate. But these will only tackle the sulphur problem, and still mean that ships emit CO
2
.
Another approach is switching to cleaner energy alternatives such as
biofuels
, batteries or even sails, but the most promising of these based on existing technology is liquefied natural gas, or LNG.
What is LNG?
In its liquid form, natural gas can be used as a fuel to power ships, replacing heavy fuel oil, which is more typically used, emissions-heavy and cheaper. But first it needs to be turned into a liquid.
To do this,
raw natural gas
is purified to separate out all impurities and liquids. This leaves a mixture of mostly methane and some ethane, which is passed through giant refrigerators that cool it to -162
o
C, in turn shrinking its volume by 600 times.
The end product is a colourless, transparent, non-toxic liquid that’s much easier to store and transport, and can be used to power specially constructed LNG-ready ships, or by ships retrofitted to run on LNG. As well as being versatile, it has the potential to reduce sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides by
90 to 95%
, while emitting 10 to 20% less CO
2
than heavier fuel alternatives.
The cost of operating a vessel on LNG is
around half
that of ultra-low sulphur marine diesel (an alternative fuel option for ships aiming to lower their sulphur output), and it’s also future-proofed in a way that other low-sulphur options are not. As emissions standards become stricter in the coming years, vessels using natural gas would still fall below any threshold.
The industry is starting to take notice. Last year 78 vessels were fitted to run on LNG, the highest annual number to date.
One company that has already embraced the switch to LNG is Estonia’s Graanul Invest. Europe’s largest wood pellet producer and a supplier to Drax Power Station, Graanul is preparing to introduce custom-built
vessels that run on LNG
by 2020.
The new ships will have the capacity to transport around 9,000 tonnes of
compressed wood pellets
and Graanul estimates that switching to LNG has the potential to lower its CO
2
emissions by 25%, to cut NOx emissions by 85%, and to almost completely eliminate SO
2
and particulate matter pollution.

Is LNG shipping’s only viable option?
LNG might be leading the charge towards cleaner shipping, but it’s not the only solution on the table. Another potential is
using advanced sail technology to harness wind
, which helps power large cargo ships. More than just an innovative way to upscale a centuries-old method of navigating the seas, it is one that could potentially be retrofitted to cargo ships and significantly reduce emissions.
Drax is currently taking part in a study with the Smart Green Shipping Alliance, Danish dry bulk cargo transporter Ultrabulk and Humphreys Yacht Design, to assess the possibility of retrofitting innovative sail technology onto one of its ships for importing biomass.
What a Pamamax ship carrying wood pellets may look like when retrofitted with sails

Manufacturers are also looking at battery power as a route to lowering emissions. Last year, boats using
battery-fitted technology
similar to that used by plug-in cars were developed for use in Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, while Dutch company
Port-Liner
are currently building two giant all-electric barges – dubbed ‘Tesla ships’ – that will be powered by battery packs and can carry up to 280 containers.
Then there are projects exploring the use of
ammonia
(which can be produced from
air and water
using renewable electricity), and
hydrogen fuel cell technology
. In short, there are many options on the table, but few that can be implemented quickly, and at scale – two things which are needed by the industry. Judged by these criteria, LNG remains the frontrunner.
There are currently just 125 ships worldwide using LNG, but these numbers are expected to increase by between 400 and 600 by 2020. Given that the world fleet boasts more than 60,000 commercial ships, this remains a drop in the ocean, but with the right support it could be the start of a large scale move towards cleaner waterways.

What is a fuel cell and how will they help power the future?
27 June 2019
Carbon capture

NASA Museum, Houston, Texas
How do you get a drink in space? That was one of the challenges for NASA in the 1960s and 70s when its Gemini and Apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space.
The answer, it turned out, surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules’ control modules. Primitive by today’s standard, these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells, which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity. The by-product of this reaction is heat but also
water – pure enough for astronauts to drink
.
Fuel cells offered NASA a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s, and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology, presenting the opportunity to clean up roads, power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions from power stations.
Power through reaction
At its most basic, a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions.
All fuel cells consist of three segments, two catalytic electrodes – a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other, and an electrolyte separating them. In a simple fuel cell, hydrogen, the
most abundant element in the universe
, is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other. Two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water.
What
allows this reaction to generate electricity
is the electrolyte, which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other. These charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur. When the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes, it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source.
https://www.drax.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Drax_Fuel_Cells_v6-2.mp4
Many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell, such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen. A fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used. Different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across. The catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate.
For the Apollo missions, for example, NASA used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes, but other types such as phosphoric acids, molten carbonates, or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist.
The by-products to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it, however, their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions, means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation.
Fuel cells as a battery alternative
Fuel cells, like batteries, can store potential energy (in the form of chemicals), and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed. Their key difference, however, is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged, fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in.
One of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles.
Rachel Grima, a Research and Innovation Engineer at Drax, explains:
“Because it’s so light, hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles, like trucks and boats. Whereas battery-powered trucks are more difficult to design because they’re so heavy.”
These vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen, producing only heat and water vapour as waste products. Which – coupled with an expanding
network of hydrogen fuelling stations
around the UK, Europe and US – makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future.
Fuel cells, in conjunction with electrolysers, can also operate as large-scale storage option. Electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells, using excess electricity from the grid to
produce hydrogen from water and storing it
until it’s needed. When there is demand for electricity, the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell.
A project on the islands of Orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local, community-owned wind turbines to power a
electrolyser and store hydrogen
, that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago.
Fuel cells’ ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at Drax for one of the most important areas in energy today: carbon capture.
Turning CO
2
to power
Drax is already piloting bioenergy
carbon capture and storage
technologies, but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to Drax Power Station.
“We’re looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas, oxygen and CO
2
,” says Grima. “It’s basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture.”
The molten carbonate, a 600 degrees Celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell. Natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and CO
2
.
On the other side, flue gas – the emissions (including
biogenic CO
2
) which normally enter the atmosphere from Drax’s biomass units – is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere. The CO
2
and oxygen (O
2
) pass over the electrode where they form carbonate (CO
3
2-
) which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen (H
2
), creating an electrical charge.
“It’s like combining an open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) with carbon capture,” says Grima. “It has the electrical efficiency of an OCGT. But the difference is it captures CO
2
from our biomass units as well as its own CO
2
.”
Along with capturing and using CO
2
, the fuel cell also reduces
nitrogen oxides
(NOx) emissions from the flue gas, some of which are destroyed when the O
2
and CO
2
react at the electrode.
From the side of the cell where flue gas enters a CO
2
-depleted gas is released. On the other side of the cell the by-products are water and CO
2

The everyday and future ways you use forest products
24 August 2018
Sustainable bioenergy

Think of the products that come from forests and you might think of the centuries of shipbuilding, construction and cooking made possible by civilisations utilising this plentiful natural resource.
What you might not think of is the complex construction of chemicals and matter that make up the trees of a forest – nor of the countless ways these can be broken down and used. Yet this is the reality of forests. From essential oils to sturdy packaging to powerful adhesives, trees are used to create a range of products that make daily life possible.
And as awareness of the need to reduce plastic consumption grows, research into forest products and how they can replace the less-environmentally friendly objects is growing.
Here we look at five of the most common products used today, and maybe in the future, that owe something to forests.
Adhesives from tall oil
Anyone who has encountered tree sap can attest: trees are made up of some pretty sticky stuff. And it’s because of this that they have long been a source for adhesives production – from glue to cement.
The substance that makes this possible is known as tall oil.
Named after the Swedish word Tallolja
, meaning pine oil, it is a by-product of pulping coniferous trees.
Tall oil has been produced commercially since the 1930s when the invention of the recovery boiler made it possible to extract it from the
Kraft pulping process
. However, the resins and waxes tall oil is made up of have a longer history. These are also known as ‘Naval Products’ due to their historic use in ship building and can be tapped directly from living trees.
Today, tall oil is also used in asphalt roofing, as well as medical and cosmetic applications. One of tall oil’s most exciting uses is as
BioVerno
– a renewable alternative to diesel made in the world’s first commercial-scale biorefinery in Finland.
Disinfectants and detergents from turpentine
Tapping trees has historically been a means of extracting multiple useful substances and one of the most versatile of these is turpentine. This yellowish liquid is produced from distilled tree resin and has a long history of uses.
Turpentine has been used since Roman times as torch or lamp fuel, but its antiseptic properties also means it was often used as medicine. While doctors today would
advise against drinking turpentine
(as was prescribed in the past), it is still used today in disinfectants, detergents and cleaning products, giving off a fresh, pine-like odour.
Fuels to replace fossils
Biomass pellets
from working forests
are just one of the ways trees are providing renewable energy. One other form is cellulosic ethanol, a new, second generation of liquid biofuel. Rather than competing with food supply (often a concern in the creation of biodiesels), cellulosic ethanol is made from non-food based materials such as forest and agricultural residues left behind after harvest – wheat straw, – and timber processing wastes including sawdust. It is now being produced at a
commercial scale in Europe, the US and Brazil
.
Woody biomass can also be converted into a petroleum substitute known as pyrolysis oil or bio-oil. Biomass is transformed into this dark brown liquid by heating it to 500
o
C in an oxygen-deprived environment and then allowing it to cool. Bio-oil has a much higher energy density than biomass in chip or pellet form and after upgrading can be
used as jet fuel or as a petroleum alternative in chemical manufacturing
.
Vanilla ice cream and carbon fibre from lignin
Lignin is what
gives trees their tough, woody quality
, and after cellulose is the world’s second most abundant natural polymer. Polymers are
very long molecules made up of many smaller molecules
joined end-to-end most often associated with plastic, (which is a synthetic polymer).
Lignin is generally a waste product from the paper pulping process and is often burnt as fuel. However, it can also serve as a vanilla flavouring – a property that may make lignin an important resource in the face of an
impending vanilla pod shortage
.
Future-looking research, however, aims to unlock much more from
the 50 million tonnes of lignin produced every year globally
. One of the most promising of these is as an
alternative source of a family of organic compound known as phenylpropanoids
. These are normally extracted from petroleum and are hugely useful in producing plastics and carbon fibre, as well as drugs and paint.

Nanocellulose and the future of forest products
Cellulose is already one of the most important products to come from forests thanks to its role in paper production. However, this abundant substance – which is also the primary material in the cell walls of all green plants – holds even more potential.
By
shrinking cellulose down to a nano level it can be configured to be very strong while remaining very light
. This opens it up as a product with many possibilities, including using it as a source of
bioplastics
. Some bioplastics – polylactic acid, PHA, PBS and starch blends – are biodegradable alternatives to fossil fuel-based plastics and could potentially help solve some of the world’s most-pressing waste issues.
Not all bio-based plastics are biodegradable, however. The property of biodegradation doesn’t depend on the resource basis of a material – it is linked to its chemical structure. In other words, 100% bio-based plastics may be non-biodegradable, and 100% fossil-based plastics can biodegrade.
Bio-based plastics that are not biodegradable include polyethylene terephthalate, polyurethanes, polyamide, polyethylene. Polyethylenefuranoate or PEF is recyclable, can be manufactured without fossil fuels and while not biodegradable, has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to the oil-based plastic used to make water bottles.
Cellulose’s combination of strength and light weight has also attracted interest from the auto industry in the ability to help
cars become much lighter and therefore more fuel efficient
. Its flexible, strong, transparent nature can also make Nanocellulose – an important material in helping
bring bendable screens
, batteries, cosmetics, paper, pharmaceuticals, optical sensors and devices to market.
The idea of using trees as a source of goods and products in everyday life might sound archaic, but, in reality, we’ve only just tapped the surface of what the chemicals and materials they’re made of can do. Markus Mannström from Finnish renewables company
Stora Enso
said
recently
that: “We believe that everything made from fossil-based materials today, can be made from a tree tomorrow.” As research advances, trees and forests will only play a bigger role in a more sustainable future.

6 start-ups, ideas and power plants shaping biomass
4 June 2018
Sustainable bioenergy

Humans have used wood as a source of fuel for
over a million years
. Modern biomass power, however, is a far cry from human’s early taming of fire and this is down to constant research and innovation. In fact, today it’s one of the
most extensively researched areas
in energy and environmental studies.
With biomass accounting for
64% of total renewable energy production
in the EU in 2015, the development isn’t likely to stop. Ongoing advancements in the field are helping the technology become more sustainable and efficient in reducing emissions.
Here are seven of the projects, businesses, ideas and technologies pushing biomass further into the future:
Torrefaction – supercharging biomass pellets
When it comes to making biomass as efficient as possible it’s all down to each individual pellet. Improving what’s known as the ‘calorific value’ of each pellet increases the overall amount of energy released when they are used in a power station.
One emerging process aiming to improve this is torrefaction, which involves heating biomass to between 250 and 300 degrees Celsius in a low-oxygen environment. This drives out moisture and volatiles from woody feedstocks, straw and other biomass sources before it is turned into a black ‘biocoal’ pellet which has a very high calorific value.
This year,
Estonian company Baltania
is constructing the first industrial-scale torrefaction plant in the country with the target output of 160,000 tonnes of biocoal pellets per year. If it’s successful, power stations worldwide may be able to get more power from each little pellet.
bio-bean – powered by caffeine
Biofuels don’t just come from forest residues. Every day more than two billion cups of coffee are consumed globally as people get themselves caffeinated for the day ahead. In London alone, this need for daily stimulation results in more than 200,000 tonnes of coffee waste produced every year. More often than not this ends up in landfills.
bio-bean
aims to change this by collecting used coffee grounds from cafes, offices and factories and recycling them into biofuels and biochemicals. The company now recycles as much as 50,000 tonnes of coffee grounds annually while one of its products, B20 biodiesel, has been used to power London buses. bio-bean also produces briquettes and pellets, which, like woody biomass, can serve as an alternative to coal.
Biomass gasification – increasing the value of biomass waste
Biogas is often seen as a promising biofuel with fewer emissions than burning fossil fuels or biomass pellets. It’s an area undergoing significant research as it points to another means of creating higher-value products from biomass matter.
The Finnish town of Vaasa is
home to the world’s largest gasification plant
. The facility is part of a coal plant where co-firing biogas with coal has allowed it to reduce carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions by as much as 230,000 tonnes per year.
As well as reducing emissions, co-firing allows the power plant to use 25% to 40% less coal and when demand is low in the autumn and spring months, the plant runs entirely on biogas. More than that, the forestry residues which are used to produce the biogas are sourced locally from within 100 km of site.
(As part of our transition away from coal, co-firing biomass with that fossil fuel took place at Drax Power Station from 2003 until full unit conversions became a reality in 2013.)
Lynemouth Power Station – powering the move away from coal
After 44-years, the coal-fired
Lynemouth Power Station
in Northumberland is the latest UK power producer converting to biomass-fuel. Set for completion this year, the plant will supply 390 MW of low-carbon electricity to the National Grid, enough to
power 700,000 homes
.
Every new power station conversion poses different challenges as well as the opportunity to develop new solutions, but none are as crucial as the conversion of the materials handling equipment from coal to biomass pellets. While coal can sit in the rain for long periods of time and still be used, biomass must be kept dry with
storage conditions constantly monitored
and adjusted to prevent sudden combustion.
At Lynemouth the handling of 1.4 million tonnes of biomass annually has required the construction of three, 40-metre high concrete storage silos, as well as extensive conveyor systems to unload and transport biomass around the plant.

BioTrans – two birds with one stone
Energy and food are both undergoing serious changes to make them more sustainable. Danish startup
BioTrans
is tackling both challenges by using one of the food industry’s key pain points – wastage – to create energy with its biogas systems.
The company installs systems that collect leftover food from restaurants and canteens and stores it in odour-proof tanks before collecting and turning it into biogas for heating and electricity production. More than just utilising
this
waste stream, the by-product of the gasification process can also be sold as a fertiliser.
Drax and C-Capture – cutting emissions from the source
Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) is one of the most important fields in the energy sector today. The technology’s ability to capture CO
2
from the electricity generation process and turn it into a revenue source before it can enter the atmosphere means it’s attracting significant investment and research.
Drax is partnering
with
C-Capture
, a company spun out of the University of Leeds’ chemistry department, to trial a new form of CCUS. The pilot scheme will launch in November and aims to capture a tonne of CO
2
per day from one of Drax’s biomass units.
C-Capture’s technology could make the process of capturing and storing CO
2
less costly and energy intensive. It does this using a specially developed solvent
capable of isolating CO
2
before being recycled
through the system and capturing more.
If the pilot proves successful, the technology could be implemented at an industrial scale, seeing up to 40% of the CO
2
in the flue gases from Drax’s biomass units captured and stored. If the technology tested at Drax leads to the construction of a purpose-built carbon capture unit elsewhere, scientists and engineers at C-Capture believe the CO
2
captured could exceed 90%.
Back in North Yorkshire, the eventual goal is negative carbon emissions from Drax Power Station – its biomass units already deliver carbon savings of more than 80% compared to when they used coal. And if a new revenue stream can be developed from the sale of the carbon captured then the power produced from biomass at the power station could become even more cost effective.

The wooden buildings of the future
22 January 2018
Sustainable bioenergy

When we think of modern cities and the buildings within them, we often think of the materials they’re constructed from – we think of the concrete jungle.
Since the 19
th
century, steel, glass and concrete enabled the building of bigger and more elaborate buildings in rapidly-growing cities, and those materials quickly came to define the structures themselves. But today that could be changing.
New technologies and building techniques mean wood, a material humans have used in construction for millennia, is making a comeback and reducing the carbon footprint of our buildings too.
Return of the treehouse
Civilisation has been building structures from wood for longer than you may realise.
The 32-metre tall Pagoda of Horyu-Ji temple in Japan, was built using wood felled in 594 and still stands today. The Sakyumuni Pagoda of Fogong Temple in China is nearly twice as tall with a height of 67 metres. It was built in 1056.
Today, wood is once again finding favour.
The 30-metre tall Wood Innovation and Design Centre of the University of British Columbia (UNBC) in Canada was completed in October 2014 and is among the first of this new generation of wooden buildings. And they’re only getting bigger.
This year, the completion of the 84-metre, 24-storey
HoHo Tower
in Vienna will make it the tallest wooden building in the world. But this will be far surpassed if plans for the
Oakwood Tower
in London are approved. Designed by a private architecture firm and researchers from the University of Cambridge, the proposed building will be 300-metres tall if construction goes ahead, making it London’s second tallest structure after The Shard. And it would be made of wood.
Falling back in love with wood
Wood construction fell out of favour in the 19
th
century when materials like steel and concrete, became more readily available. But new developments in timber manufacturing are changing this.
Researchers in Graz, Austria, discovered that by gluing strips of wood with their grains at right angles to each other the relative weakness of each piece of wood is compensated. The result is a wood product known as cross-laminated timber (CLT), which is tougher than steel for its weight but is much lighter and can be machined into extremely precise shapes. Think of it as the plywood of the future, allowing construction workers to build bigger, quicker and lighter.
Glued laminated timber, commonly known as glulam, is another technology technique enabling greater use of wood in more complex construction. Manufactured by bonding high-strength timbers with waterproof adhesives,
glulam can also be shaped into curves and arches
, pushing wood’s usage beyond straight planks and beam.
These dense timbers don’t ignite easily either. They are designed to act more like logs than kindling, and feature an outer layer that is purposefully designed to char when exposed to flame, which in turn insulates the inner wood.
Susceptibility to mould, insect and water damage is indeed a concern of anyone building with wood, but as the centuries-old Pagodas in Japan and China demonstrate, care for wood properly and there’s no real limit to how long you can make it last.
So, wood is sturdy. But so is steel – why change?
Green giant
Construction with concrete and steel produces an enormous carbon footprint. Concrete production on its own
accounts for 5%
of all our carbon emissions. But building with wood can change that. UNBC’s Innovation and Design centre saved
400 tonnes
of carbon by using wood instead of concrete and steel.
On top of that, building with wood ‘freezes’ the carbon captured by the trees as they grow. When trees die naturally in the forest they decompose and release the carbon they have absorbed during growth back in the atmosphere. But wood felled and used to construct a building has captured that carbon for as long as it stands in place. A city of wooden buildings could be a considerable carbon sink.
This can have further ripple effects. The more timber is required for construction, the more it increases the market for wood and the
responsibly-managed forests
that material comes from. And the more forests that are planted, and managed with proper governance,
the more carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere
.
According to research from Yale university, a worldwide switch to timber construction would, on its own, cut the building industry’s carbon emissions
by 31%
.
Granted, that will be a difficult task. But if even a fraction of that can be achieved, it could mean a future of timber buildings and greener cities.

What’s next for bioenergy?
11 July 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

Discussions about our future are closely entwined with those of our power. Today, when we talk about electricity, we talk about climate change, about new fuels and about the sustainability of new technologies. They’re all inexplicably linked, and all hold uncertainties for the future.
But in preparing for what’s to come, it helps to have an idea of what may be waiting for us. Researchers at universities across the UK, including the University of Manchester and Imperial College London, have put their heads together to think about this question, and together with the Supergen Bioenergy programme they’ve created a unique
graphic novel on bioenergy
that outlines three potential future scenarios.
Based on their imagined views of the future there’s plenty to be optimistic about, but it could just as easily go south.
Future one: Failure to act on climate change
In the first scenario, our energy use and reliance on non-renewable fuels like oil, coal and gas continues to grow until we miss our window of opportunity to invest in renewable technology and infrastructure while it’s affordable.
Neither the beginning nor the end of the supply chain divert from their current trends – energy providers produce electricity and end users consume it as they always have. Governments continue to pursue growth at all costs and industrial users make no efforts to reverse their own rates of power consumption. In response, electricity generation with fossil fuels ramps up, which leads to several problems.
Attempts to secure a dwindling stock of non-renewable fuels lead to clashes over remaining sources as nations vie for energy security. As resources run out, attempts to put in place renewable alternatives are hampered by a lack of development and investment in the intervening years. The damages caused by climate change accelerate and at the same time, mobility for most people drops as fuel becomes more expensive.
Future two: Growing a stable, centralised bioenergy
A future of dwindling resources and increasing tension isn’t the only way forward. Bioenergy is likely to play a prominent role in the energy mix of the future. In fact, nearly all
scenarios
where global temperature rise remains within the two degrees Celsius margin (recommended by the Paris Agreement) rely on widespread bioenergy use with
carbon capture and storage
(BECCS). But how far could the implementation of bioenergy go?
A second scenario sees governments around the world invest significantly in biomass energy systems which then become major, centralised features in global energy networks. This limits the effects of a warming climate, particularly as CCS technology matures and more carbon can be sequestered safely underground.
This has knock-on effects for the rest of the world.
Large tracts of land are turned over to forestry
to support the need for biomass, creating new jobs for those involved in managing the working forests. In industry, large-scale CCS systems are installed at sizeable factories and manufacturing plants to limit emissions even further.
Future 3: The right mix bioenergy
A third scenario takes a combined approach – one in which technology jumps ahead and consumption is controlled. Instead of relying on a few concentrated hubs of BECCS energy, renewables and bioenergy are woven more intimately around our everyday lives. This relies on the advance of a few key technologies.
Widespread adoption of advanced
battery technology
sees
wind and solar implemented at scale
, providing the main source of electricity for cities and other large communities. These communities are also responsible for generating biomass fuel from domestic waste products, which includes wood offcuts from timber that makes up a larger proportion of building materials as wooden buildings grow more common.
Whether future three – or any of the above scenarios – will unfold like this is uncertain. These are just three possible futures from an infinite range of scenarios, but they demonstrate just how wide the range of futures is. It’s up to us all – not just governments but businesses, individuals and academics such as those behind this research project too – to to make the best choices to ensure the future we want.

This is how you unload a wood chip truck
30 June 2017
Sustainable bioenergy

A truck arrives at an industrial facility deep in the expanding forestland of the south-eastern USA. It passes through a set of gates, over a massive scale, then onto a metal platform.
The driver steps out and pushes a button on a nearby console. Slowly, the platform beneath the truck tilts and rises. As it does, the truck’s cargo empties into a large container behind it. Two minutes later it’s empty.
This is how you unload a wood fuel truck at
Drax Biomass’ compressed wood pellet plants in Louisiana and Mississippi
.
What is a tipper?
“Some people call them truck dumpers, but it depends on who you talk to,” says Jim Stemple, Senior Director of Procurement at Drax Biomass. “We just call it the tipper.” Regardless of what it’s called, what the tipper does is easy to explain: it lifts trucks and uses the power of gravity to empty them quickly and efficiently.
The sight of a truck being lifted into the air might be a rare one across the Atlantic, however at industrial facilities in the United States it’s more common. “Tippers are used to unload trucks carrying cargo such as corn, grain, and gravel,” Stemple explains. “Basically anything that can be unloaded just by tipping.”
Both of Drax Biomass’ two operational pellet facilities (a third is currently idle while being upgraded) use tippers to unload the daily deliveries of bark – known in the forestry industry as hog fuel, which is used to heat the plants’ wood chip dryers – sawdust and raw wood chips, which are used to
make the compressed wood pellets
.
How does it work?
The tipper uses hydraulic pistons to lift the truck platform at one end while the truck itself rests against a reinforced barrier at the other. To ensure safety, each vehicle must be reinforced at the very end (where the load is emptying from) so they can hold the weight of the truck above it as it tips.
Each tipper can lift up to 60 tonnes and can accommodate vehicles over 50 feet long. Once tipped far enough (each platform tips to a roughly 60-degree angle), the renewable fuel begins to unload and a diverter guides it to one of two places depending on what it will be used for.
“One way takes it to the chip and sawdust piles – which then goes through the
pelleting process
of the hammer mills, the dryer and the pellet mill,” says Stemple. “The other way takes it to the fuel pile, which goes to the furnace.”
The furnace heats the dryer which ensures wood chips have a moisture level between 11.5% and 12% before they go through the pelleting process.
“If everything goes right you can tip four to five trucks an hour,” says Stemple. From full and tipping to empty and exiting takes only a few minutes before the trucks are on the road to pick up another load.
Efficiency benefits
Using the power of gravity to unload a truck might seem a rudimentary approach, but it’s also an efficient one. Firstly, there’s the speed it allows. Multiple trucks can arrive and unload every hour. And because cargo is delivered straight into the system, there’s no time lost between unloading the wood from truck to container to system.
Secondly, for the truck owners, the benefits are they don’t need to carry out costly hydraulic maintenance on their trucks. Instead, it’s just the tipper – one piece of equipment – which is maintained to keep operations on track.
However, there is one thing drivers need to be wary of: what they leave in their driver cabins. Open coffee cups, food containers – anything not firmly secured – all quickly become potential hazards once the tipper comes into play.
“I guess leaving something like that in the cab only happens once,” Stemple says. “The first time a trucker has to clean out a mess from his cab is probably the last time.”
