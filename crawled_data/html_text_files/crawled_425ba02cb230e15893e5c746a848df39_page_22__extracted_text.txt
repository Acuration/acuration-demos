investors should the carbon tax be scrapped definitely not andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 21 november 2016 opinion carbon emissions from electricity consumption in britain are at their lowest level ever  each unit of electricity produced now contains less than half the carbon it did four years ago this pace of decarbonisation is ahead of expectations  its also entirely necessary carbon dioxide co2 contributes to the warming of the planet and so limiting how much of it is released into the atmosphere is critical nowhere is this more important than in the power sector  one that has relied on carbonintensive fossil fuels like coal for its lifetime the uk government has recently ramped up plans to end coal power generation by 2025  and since 2013 one of its methods for doing so has been an economic one making organisations pay for every tonne of co2 they release it makes carbon emissions an economic disincentive for businesses but surprisingly some of co2s biggest emitters fully support it  drax included how do you put a price on carbon the eu was the first region to put such a scheme in place when in 2005 it introduced the eu emissions trading system eu ets under this system energy companies have to buy permits that allow them to emit co2 but the price of those permits has historically been volatile  dropping as low as below 3 per tonne in 2014 in 2013 the uk introduced the carbon price floor cpf  a means of bolstering the eus cost of carbon by setting a minimum price on emissions currently this is set at 18 per tonne more than four times the value of an eu carbon permit more recently the cpf has become a point of contention as some industries claim it stifles progress and have called for it to be scrapped in the upcoming autumn statement  this opposition has already caused blockers plans to raise the cpf to 30 per tonne by 2020 were halted by previous chancellor george osborne who instead froze it at 18 until the end of the decade but this view isnt universally shared drax along with a number of other energy companies including sse and calon energy recently wrote to the current chancellor philip hammond to argue to keep the price in place until at least 2025  in the letter we state the reason for our support plainly we believe the carbon price floor is central to the uks efforts to decarbonise its electricity system in short if we want a cleaner future the cpf needs to remain in place why price carbon not only does a carbon tax disincentivise using co2heavy fuels and processes it encourages investment in lower carbon and renewable energy sources by making them more cost effective relative to coal diesel and fuel oil more than that it places the decisions on how to reduce co2 emissions into the hands of those making them as long there is a societal cost to global warming it makes sense to put a cost to the emissions that cause it  in 2009 drax began an upgrade of our power station to run on biomass  it was a decision to pursue decarbonisation on our own terms made by people with the knowledge of how best to achieve it today three of our six units are powered by compressed wood pellets which has seen an 80 reduction in carbon emissions when compared to coal its also a significant revenue driver for the country the levy is expected to raise 1 billion this year while globally the world bank estimates the value of implementing carbon pricing initiatives at a little under 50 billion dollars  the revenue is significant but so too are the impacts on emissions since 2012 the uks carbon emissions have fallen by over 45 a year and on may 5th the country reached a milestone the first time since 1881 the uk was powered without burning any coal  this evidence sets out a clear argument the cpf contributes to reducing carbon emissions and for this reason its important it remains a part of the uks decarbonisation strategy scrapping it would be a grave error in the uks future energy plans and could limit our ability to meet the paris agreement targets 2016 has already been an historic year for the electricity industry in britain  but if the cpf is scrapped it will become a milestone year for different reasons rather than the year in which lowco2 power generation took a step forward it will be the year a decarbonised electricity future drifted further from our reach tags investors  about us  coal hinkley may be an important milestone but its no silver bullet to the uks energy challenges dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 7 october 2016 opinion in september the prime minister gave the goahead for the construction of two new nuclear reactors at hinkley point in somerset setting in motion the process for what could be the biggest and most expensive nuclear power station ever built while this monumental decision will provide some long overdue clarity for britains energy sector it has dangerously diverted the attention from a far bigger energy challenge facing the uk  replacing the contribution currently made by coal in november last year the government made a commitment that the uk must stop generating power from coal by 2025 for the sake of future generations this was the right decision to take  coal is after all a fossil fuel of the past thats damaging the environment however it still provides up to one fifth of the uks electricity and plugging that gap will be far from easy doing so in a way that allows the country to meet its carbon targets while supporting technologies that will deliver a modern energy system fit for the 21st century only adds to this challenge hinkley point c will play an important role in the future energy mix but lets be clear  its no silver bullet when finally complete hinkley point c is expected to provide seven percent of the uks electricity  less than a third of what is needed to replace coal whats more this new generation isnt even expected to come on grid much before 2030 by which point all but one of the uks operating nuclear reactors which provide around 20 of the uks current needs are scheduled to close in short hinkley will be replacing lost nuclear capacity and nowhere near all of it rather than providing the new energy we desperately need to plug the gap the end of coal will create this raises the question  what can replace outgoing coal in the necessary timescale while we have seen a huge and welcome expansion in renewable sources of generation like wind and solar in the uk they are intermittent so cannot fill the void alone they still need to be supported by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine  a regular scenario on these shores gas and nuclear will form part of the solution but as weve seen with hinkley planning funding and building new power stations can be a long and costly process  it took over a decade to reach the decision on hinkley point gas fired power stations can be up and running far quicker but obviously planning and approval are still required and only a handful have been built in the last 10 years alternative technologies  like small modular nuclear reactors and electricity storage  held in some quarters as the answer certainly hold potential however the reality is they arent yet fit for purpose at scale and will need much more research and development and in some cases regulatory approval before they become viable dorothy thompson ceo drax group time unfortunately is not a luxury we have this year alone more than six gigawatts gw of coal power generation could come off grid  almost twice the generating capacity of hinkley point every day lost adds to the cost and complexity of addressing the challenge we face  making a solution less likely a recognised costeffective renewable option does exist though but it is often unmentioned in the debate  its called biomass using the latest technology at drax power station we have upgraded half of the coal facilities to generate electricity using sustainable compressed wood pellets instead of coal since this reuses existing coal infrastructure its quicker and more efficient than building new power stations while also providing a reliable and flexible flow of electricity that can help the uk meet its carbon targets the compressed wood pellets we use for example perform in much the same way as coal but deliver a more than 80 co 2 saving this solution is proven and ready to go already draxs facility is powering more than three million homes and delivering 20 of the uks renewable electricity making it the biggest single site renewable generator in the country drax can go further though with the right government support and a levelplaying field  delivered via technologyneutral auctions for energy contracts with all six drax generation units converted plus lynemouth power station  which already has that future secured  and one or two other smaller biomass power stations around 10 of the uks electricity could be generated using this technology well before 2025 finding the right mix of power generation will not be easy but it is important to make every effort to get it right like hinkley point c biomass is no silver bullet but it is ideally placed to play an even greater role in helping the country transform to a lowcarbon future tags investors  energy policy black start the most important back up plan youve never heard of 6 october 2016 power generation movies where major cities are razed to the ground or overrun by zombies are good fun when watched safe in the knowledge that such disasters are never likely to happen in the uk but how prepared would britains infrastructure be if faced with a real disaster if for example something were to happen that caused the national electricity grid to shut down what would happen next of course the chance of this ever happening is remote in the extreme nonetheless britain has had a contingency plan in place for decades britains ultimate power back up first things first  if the whole of the network including the power stations supplying the national high voltage electricity distribution network the grid loses power you would need to restart those individual power stations before they can get the grid powered up again the challenge normally all power stations need electrical supply to start up but with a total electricity blackout theres no electricity to restart the system thats why the reboot procedure is called black start  and its one the most important yet littleknown back up plans in the uk the good news there has never been a blackout so widespread that drax has been asked to do a black start preparing for the unlikely but thats not to say that such a procedure may never be needed in october 1987 there was a regional black start in the wake of the powerful hurricane that hit the south of the country the storm damage left kent and sussex disconnected from the national grid  but thanks to black start contingency plans most people barely noticed kingsnorth power station restored power to the area and it ran independently cut off from the rest of the grid until repairs enabled it to be connected up again a total nationwide grid blackout may be unlikely but that doesnt mean its not prepared for tests happen regularly to assess how long it would take to restart an individual generation unit at a major power station bring it up to capacity and make sure that any black start would run smoothly the most recent test took place at drax in july 2011 with representatives from the national grid witnessing the procedure to simulate blackout conditions three of the generating units were disconnected from the grid in that test it took 83 minutes to return one unit back to service a simple plan not all power stations can do a black start  some simply do not have control ability to be the starting point of a system reboot but modern coal gas and biomass power plants are able to restart rapidly on demand this is why drax  first operational in the 1970s  is modern and responsive enough to be a key part of todays black start planning the way it works is actually relatively simple using smaller power sources to start ever bigger ones scaling up and up until the entire country is powered up again draxs auxiliary generating units consist of three gas turbines which can be started from batteries these would in turn generate enough power to restart one or two main generating units the restarted generating units would be used as the backbone of an island network  a network operating independently of the national grid  that would be grown by adding pockets of supply the generating units would match the speed and frequency to create normal grid conditions and to restore supplies fast locally finally the affected areas island networks would be hooked up to each other so electricity can be distributed around the country with the reliability and stability we have become accustomed to staying prepared when the electricity market was privatised there was a risk that such nationwide plans as black start could have fallen apart to prevent this formal contracts were put in place to continue to restart from scratch if necessary drax recently renewed its contract this makes black start  and drax  as important as ever if a disaster

has long been a proving ground for the kind of engineering innovations that have transformed the world the heartland of the first industrial revolution it is now at the centre of a new revolution focused on clean energy production and sustainable power led by organisations like drax europes largest decarbonisation project over the last decade drax has been carrying out a major hightech engineering and infrastructure project to upgrade half its generating units to use sustainable biomass in place of coal these converted units now produce enough electricity to power birmingham leeds sheffield liverpool manchester and newcastle  all using compressed wood pellets cutting carbon emissions by more than 80 but more than just having environmental benefits its provided a huge boost to the economy boosting the uk economy in 2015 drax contributed more than 1 billion to the uks gdp and supported some 14000 jobs across the country the economic benefit has reached all parts of the country says ceo dorothy thompson  weve been the catalyst for rejuvenation and growth across the northern powerhouse with port expansion on the coasts of east yorkshire the north west and north east this boost was particularly significant in the north where drax generated over 620 million for the local economy innovation driving a better future for britain its these kinds of innovative upgrades that are helping to tackle the urgent environmental challenges that our society faces as we make the transition to lower carbon and renewable power and changing the way we think about producing energy in the uk having nurtured the industrial revolution today the north of england is again the focus of a major paradigm shift where once coal fields and smoke stacks dominated the local landscape now

opinion im delighted that drax group plc has been named by forbes magazine and msci esg research as one of the 50 most trustworthy companies in europe  in fact drax came joint second across the whole continent among companies judged who consistently demonstrated transparent accounting practices and solid corporate governance its a massive tribute to everyone involved with drax that worldleading business experts have recognised our commitment to trust and integrity in this way of course that commitment goes much further than our accounting practices alone i believe my british colleagues would say that it runs right through drax like the writing in a stick of rock indeed it was one of the reasons i was so honoured to be asked to join drax as cfo  from my very first meeting with ceo dorothy thompson i could see that drax would always strive do the right thing in the right way thats just as true for our sustainability data as it is for our business data it was our commitment to doing the right thing that led drax to take on the decision to convert drax power station from coal to compressed wood pellets  it is our commitment to doing the right thing that means drax is reducing emissions by over 80 per cent while giving people and businesses all over the uk the reliable renewable power that they need and we know we can save billpayers money at the same time the uk is lagging far behind the rest of europe when it comes to generating energy from compressed wood pellets drax is committed to bringing us closer to the european average while helping us move from the fossil fuels of the past to the renewables of the future and yes you can trust us on that tags investors  sustainability  corporate governance  will gardiner we can make a difference in 2016 and beyond dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 23 february 2016 investors today we released our financial results for 2015  ill be the first to admit that they are not good what makes it all the more painful is that one of the strongest operational performances the business has achieved in the last decade was more than wiped out by factors well outside of our control lets be frank for any business operating in the uk energy market 2015 was a tough year the deterioration in the commodity markets were some of the most severe i have seen in my career this was then accompanied by a series of unexpected regulatory announcements which caused many to question the uk governments commitment to decarbonisation like any ceo on results day i have spent this morning speaking to investors journalists and financial analysts instead of focusing too much on what hasnt gone our way in 2015 ive focused on where i think we can make a difference in 2016 and beyond and ive been pleased with their positive reaction the affordable way to end coal in november amber rudd announced the governments proposal to consult on setting a clear end date for coal of march 2025 given it still provides around 25 of the countrys electricity this is an ambitious target part of the solution is new nuclear and gas but as a recent report by the institute of mechanical engineers noted the country will find it very hard to build enough new facilities to replace coal capacity in time  instead of having to take all the existing coal power stations off the grid and build new facilities the country could use the world leading biomass technology that drax has pioneered to upgrade some of them to use compressed wood pellets instead of coal the economic consultancy nera found that more biomass conversions are one of the most sensible ways for the uk to get off coal at the fairest price to the taxpayer  with the right support we stand ready to convert our remaining coal units to become a fully renewable generator helping society and creating shareholder value i fundamentally believe that drax is making a valuable contribution in helping society deal with one of the most pressing issues of our time  cutting carbon emissions to limit climate change we have an approach which is both affordable and reliable so long as we remain operationally strong which i am very confident about then shareholder value will accrue throughout 2016 and beyond we will build on our expertise and continue to evaluate a range of longer term strategic options i lead a strong business that will use the opportunities available to us to create value for our shareholders and help bring about a reliable renewable future that we can all afford tags investors  financial reports three ways to judge a cfo will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 17 december 2015 opinion its a good question because you cant build a great company without a great chief financial officer cfo but as a shareholder how can you judge how well your cfo is doing without setting myself up for a fall the answer i gave our investor broke down into these three questions are they keeping control at its heart the first part of any cfos role is to make sure that their business is under control and that all risks are being properly managed they need to maintain a strong balance sheet and keep reporting and communications clear and transparent above all they need to make sure there are no surprises are they improving efficiency the second part is making sure the organisation is always working as efficiently as possible keeping a strong hand on costs and ensuring that current revenue streams are always optimised above all they need to be making sure that less money is going out and more money is coming into the organisation are they allocating capital wisely the final task of any cfo is investing shareholders money in the best projects  first internally and second externally above all they need to have a clear consideration of cash returns for shareholders so now the next time you wonder how well your cfo is doing you know how to judge them this article was originally published by will
