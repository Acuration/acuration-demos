sets out just what sort of action could be needed 27 june 2017 sustainable business mitigating climate change is a difficult challenge but its one well within the grasp of governments companies and individuals around the world if we can start thinking strategically on the behalf of the german government the internal energy agency iea and the international renewable energy agency irena have jointly published a report outlining the longterm targets of a worldwide decarbonisation process and how those targets can be achieved through longterm investment and policy strategies at the heart of the report is a commitment to the 66 two degrees celsius scenario which the report defines as limiting the rise in global mean temperature to two degrees celsius by 2100 with a probability of 66 this is in line with the paris agreement which agreed on limiting global average temperature increase to below two degrees celsius here are three of the findings from the report that highlight how decarbonisation could change the world the energy landscape will change  and thats a good thing decarbonisation will by definition mean reducing the use of carbonintensive fossil fuels today 81 of the worlds power is generated by fossil fuels but by 2050 that will need to come down to 39 to meet the 66 two degrees celsius scenario according to the report but this doesnt mean all fossil fuels will be treated equally coal will be the most extensively reduced while other fossil fuels will be less affected oil use in 2050 is expected to stand at 45 of todays levels but will likely still feature in the energy landscape due its use in industries like petrochemicals gas will likely also remain a key part of the energy makeup thanks to its ability to provide auxiliary grid functions like frequency response and blackstarting in the event of grid failure renewables like biomass will likely play an increasing role here as well particularly when combined with carbon capture and storage ccs technology overall renewable energy sources will need to increase substantially in the reports global roadmap for the future renewables make up two thirds of the primary energy supply reaching this figure will be no mean feat  it will mean renewable growth rates doubling compared with today everyday electricity use will become more efficient the report highlights the need for enduse behaviour to change this can mean everyday energy users choosing to use a bit less heat power and fuel for transport in our daytoday activities but a bigger driver of change will be by investment in better more efficient enduse technology  the technology devices and household appliances we use every day  in fact the study argues that net investment in energy supply doesnt need to increase beyond todays level  what needs to increase is investment in these technologies for instance by 2050 70 of new cars must be electric cars to meet decarbonisation targets infrastructure design could also be improved for energy efficiency  smart grids battery storage and buildings retrofitted with energy efficient features such as led lighting will be essential theres also the possibility of increased use of cleaner building materials and processes  for example constructing large scale buildings out of wood rather than carbonintensive materials such as concrete and steel decarbonisation will cost but not decarbonising will cost more the upfront costs of meeting temperature targets will be substantial a case study used in the report estimates that 119 trillion would need to be spent on lowcarbon technologies between 2015 and 2050 but it also suggests another 29 trillion may be needed to meet targets however failure to act could mean the world will pay out an even higher figure in healthcare costs or in other economic costs associated with climate change such as flood damage or drought therefore the sum for decarbonisation could end up costing between two and six times less than what failing to decarbonise could cost on top of this the new jobs including those in renewable fuel industries that will replace those lost in fossil fuels and opportunities that will be created between 2015 and 2050 could add 19 trillion to the global economy more than that global gdp could be increased by 08 in 2050 thanks to added stimulus from the low carbon economy achieving a cleaner future wont be easy  it requires planning effort and the will to see beyond shortterm goals and think about the longterm benefits but as the report demonstrates get it right and the results could be
