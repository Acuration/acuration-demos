technology the life of an electrical engineer 22 january 2017 power generation a station like drax doesnt run itself its six turbines generate nearly 4000mw of power when operating at full load unsurprisingly for a site that produces 7 of britains electricity needs the role of an electrical engineer is an important one  both when managing how power is connected to the highvoltage electricity transmission grid  and how the giant electrical machines generating the energy work it doesnt get much bigger than drax you need to be at the top of your game every day says lead engineer gary preece a man at the top of his game is a fair way to describe preece he has been an electrical engineer almost his entire life beginning as an apprentice working at the liverpool dockyards at age 16 preece has worked a range of increasingly demanding projects and roles including engineering consultancy and work for the royal navy on their type 26 global combat ship  where he was in charge of designing the onboard power infrastructure he became a member of the drax team five years ago life on the job on a station the size of drax you dont have a typical day there are just too many systems that can change status that can fail or that require immediate attention to remain operational its neverending preece says working as an electrical engineer in a plant the size of drax doesnt just mean getting called down to help out when a fuse blows his responsibilities as lead engineer encompass a broad range of functions theres lots to do theres a lot of handson work but theres also a lot of study work tasks can include scoping out planning and budgeting new projects working with contractors and suppliers fault analysis and power level studies this last role is what preece has come to like most about the job  working with sophisticated computer simulations to model output and crisis scenarios all so drax can operate at its optimal level with national grid i really enjoy a lot of the theoretical work he says we can do so much with this software of course there are times when he does have to fix things and in a power plant mistakes can have major consequences the energy levels in a power plant are so high that when something fails it usually fails spectacularly this means preece needs to be on call all day and all night if theres a technology failure he needs to be on the site finding out what went wrong and directing recovery efforts theres no hiding place if something goes wrong you have to fix it transforming draxs electric infrastructure sometimes individual projects can occupy all aspects of preece engineer thinker and planner one of the most challenging was when drax wanted to import a largely unused industrial generator transformer unit from kent to the station in yorkshire the transformer was split into three 200tonne components before transit preece and his team conducted extensive checks on the components and oil transformers contain oil to insulate the coil to evaluate the state of the machinery and these steps had to be repeated after every stage of the journey to ensure no damage had been sustained after checks were completed the units needed to be transported via the m25 motorway to ports in the south of england from which they would travel by ship on the north sea ready to be unloaded and transported to drax for installation however the team hit complications this time with the highways agency the structures were so heavy that we had to take a ferry from a different port because authorities were worried the bridges we were planning on using to get there wouldnt take the weight of the units we had to do a turnaround in the middle of the motorway getting the extra transformers installed gave the plant some important breathing room in the unlikely event of a failure some power stations dont have spares if there was a failure they could be out of commission for months says preece for a power station as large as drax that would be disastrous but even with the extra transformers on site the number of ways the electrical infrastructure at a power plant can go wrong is huge thats why experienced engineers like preece are as indispensable as the machinery itself drax is one of the best opportunities youre going to get for artistic licence it doesnt get much bigger tags careers  drax power station  technology these three inches of copper can power a city 17 january 2017 electrification a series of unassuming cables extend out of the turbine hall at drax power station  theyre easily missed but these few inches of copper play an instrumental role in powering your home surging through each one is enough electricity to power a city but the process of getting electricity from power station to plug isnt as simple as connecting one wire to a live turbine and another to your iphone charger we need an entire network of power stations cables and transformers linking the network when the country first became electrified it did so in stages each region of the uk was powered by its own selfcontained power supply that changed in 1926 when the uk set up the central electricity board and began what was at the time the biggest construction project britain had ever seen the national grid the project took 100000 men and five years to complete and when it was finished it connected 122 of the countrys most efficient power stations via 4000 miles of overhead cabling it had a sizeable effect in 1920 there were roughly 750000 electricity consumers by 1938 that had risen to 9 million the grid has changed in the 80 years thats passed but it remains the network that transfers power across the country to where its needed whenever its needed the strange thing about electricity is that you could live 10 miles from a power station and you cant be sure the electricity youre using is coming from that station says callan masters an engineer with national grid whose job it is to maintain and upgrade the network the whole system works together  the whole system has a demand and the whole system has to deliver it and to do this the network has to be able to deliver electricity quickly and efficiently masters explains it acts like a motorway for power riding the motorway for power the process of transporting electricity involves a series of stages the first of which is stepping up the voltage when electricity is transported via cables or wires it loses some of its energy as heat think of a lightbulb  as it illuminates it heats up because its losing energy the lower the current of that electricity however the less energy is lost so to reduce these losses when transporting power national grid transmits electricity at low currents which it can do by increasing its voltage at the power station electricity is generated at 23500 volts and is then stepped up to 400000 volts by a transformer the first of these is located on a substation on site at the power station once stepped up the electricity is transported through high transmission cables  before being stepped down via a transformer on the other end this stepped down electricity is passed onto a regional distribution system such as the overhead cables you might find on top of wooden poles before being stepped down a final time thats the role of a little transformer at the end of your street masters explains finally the electricity is transported via a final cable into your home  this time at 230 volts all this needs to happen incredibly quickly as thousands of kettles are switched on to herald the end of eastenders  the demand of electricity surges delivering that electricity at the touch of a button relies on a complex network but it starts with those inconspicuous few inches of copper at the power station tags drax power station  energy policy  national grid  power station  technology this is how smart meters will change how you use power 5 january 2017 electrification homes in the uk rely on energy almost 24 hours a day whether powering your computer boiling your kettle or heating your home electricity and heating fuels are absolutely integral parts of modern life the same is the case with businesses and transport but how the gas and electricity we use to power our lives is tracked recorded and fed back to utility companies is changing it could mean lower bills and a more stable energy network and its all thanks to a small inconspicuous box called a smart meter what is a smart meter between now and 2020 every household and business in the uk will be offered smart meters for both electricity and where they are on the network gas too a smart meter is a device that tracks your energy use in realtime and then automatically feeds this information back to your energy provider better yet in the uk theyll be coupled with an inhome display showing what youre using and how much its costing its a simple piece of technology that can have a serious impact on how you use energy and how much you pay for it will smart meters help reduce my energy bills the crucial difference a smart meter will make to household bills is seeing off estimated bills in the past utility companies would either ask you to take a reading from your meter or send a representative to your home or office to get one when theyve not been able to do this utility companies estimate your usage within a certain time frame and create a bill based on that with smart meters the automaticallydelivered details will mean utility companies have uptotheminute accuracy on customers energy usage no more estimated bills no more searching for your awkwardlyplaced meter no more unannounced meter readers arriving at your door will smart meters change how i use electricity more than just improving accuracy and saving time smart meters can help you use energy in a  smarter way they can pinpoint powerheavy home appliances as well as the times of day when you are using the most energy with this information you can optimise your usage to find where there are cost saving opportunities the data collected by your smart meter might show that you use most electricity in the evening when power demand is at its highest based on this you can change your habits to make the most of offpeak times and potentially lower tariffs for example charging your batterybased appliances overnight are smart meters good for the uk more accurate information is not only a benefit to home and business owners  the country as a whole could end up in a better place too armed with accurate numbers on how and when the country uses power the national grid which manages the gas and high voltage electricity network and elexon which manages the balancing market for electricity will be able to better predict energy supply if they track that electricity is being used at a certain time of day they can ensure generation by uk power stations like drax the uks biggest is planned to match it the aim is a more stable and efficient grid utility companies could also use this data to create peak and offpeak times with different tariffs opening the door for further cost savings and the smarter use of electricity nationwide coupled with the new market in battery technology such as the powervault and teslas powerwall 2  households and businesses will also be able to take even greater advantage of offpeak tariffs how can i get a smart meter

technology your christmas lights were powered by more renewables than ever before 29 december 2016 electrification late into the evening of christmas day 2016 millions of people sat down to watch rowan atkinson solve a grisly murder it was the tv drama maigrets dead man and although it wasnt the most watched tv show on christmas day that honour went to the strictly come dancing finale it did cause the biggest televisionrelated sudden surge in electricity demand of the day says sumit gumber energy forecasting analyst at national grid  during a critical ad break in the show demand jumped 400 mw  roughly equivalent to 160000 kettles being switched on  as viewers raced to make cups of tea or go to the bathroom this is known as a tv pickup  while this may have provided the biggest sudden rise in electricity usage of the day it was not the overall peak as is typical on christmas day this years spike in demand came just before one oclock when families were preparing their festive feasts at 371 gw this peak was not only lower than previous years the power used to supply it was generated by more renewables than any christmas before it more than 40 of the electricity generated on christmas day came from renewable sources  what characterises christmas day christmas is a day when electricity usage is at one of its lowest points to put this years 371 gw peak into context an average weekday during december weekday electricity use is higher than on weekends has an electricity peak of nearly 50 gw usually occurring between five and seven oclock when people arrive home and street lighting is switched on the cause for the lower demand during christmas is simple  over the festive period schools as well as a number of offices shops and factories are closed over the last few years average christmas day demand has been fairly typical sitting in a bracket of between 29 gw and 39 gw in 2010 however extreme cold hitting minus three degrees celsius drove lunchtime peak demand as high as 46 gw showing just how important a driver of our electricity use temperature is  but while demand on christmas in 2016 may not have deviated largely from the average over the last few years there were some major leaps forward in how it was generated a greener christmas than ever before this year christmas was characterised by a huge jump in renewable electricity generation  on average 124 gw came from renewable sources  more than ever before of that figure wind contributed the most generating on average 94 gw  equivalent to 31 of all power supplied on christmas day compared to 2015 its a 63 increase and a staggering 195 uplift from five christmases ago in 2012 when just 12 of all electricity generated came from renewable sources biomass generation has also increased providing 2 gw in 2016 compared to the 05 gw it averaged on december 25 th  2012 the increase in renewables also marks an important step towards decarbonisation at its peak emissions from electricity generation this 25 th december were just 168 gkwh a significant drop compared to the 2012 peak of 506 gkwh and the 303 gkwh seen in 2015 this year has been a year of impressive stats in clean energy between july and september for the first time in its 130yearold history more than half of britains power came from lowcarbon sources  on 5 th may the uk did not burn any coal to generate electricity

insights  national grid  technology power and the rise of electric cars 12 december 2016 electrification all great technological innovations need infrastructure to match the world didnt change from candles to lightbulbs overnight  power stations had to be built electricity cables rolled out and buildings fitted with wiring the same is true of electric vehicles ev think of the number of petrol stations lining the uk roads if evs continue their rise in popularity the country will need electric carcharging facilities to augment and then replace these petrol stations this could mean big extensions of electricity grid infrastructure both in the building of new power generation capacity to meet demand and in the extension of the networks themselves in short it could mean a significant change in how electricity is used and supplied the need for better electricity infrastructure in 2013 only 3500 of newly registered cars in the uk were plugin electric or hybrid evs in 2016 that number jumped to 63000 their use is rising rapidly but the lack of infrastructure has kept a cap on the number of evs on uk roads that is starting to change as of 2019 all new and refurbished houses in the eu will have to be fitted with an electric car charging point  according to a draft directive announced by brussels the uk will probably no longer be an eu member by the time the directive comes into effect but nevertheless the uk government is pursuing its own ways to account for the rise of evs it has pledged more than 600 million between 2015 and 2020 to support ultralowemission vehicles  38 million of this has already been earmarked for public charging points there are more innovative responses to ev rise too nissan in partnership with italian energy provider enel has announced it will install around one hundred cartogrid charging points across the uk with their innovative v2g technology  cars plugged into these sites will be able to both charge their batteries and feed stored energy back to the national grid when necessary so when there is a peak in demand the grid could access the cars stored energy to help meet it the total capacity of the 18000 nissan electric vehicles currently operational on uk roads comes to around 180 mw so even today  before electric vehicles have really taken off  this could give the national grid an additional supply roughly the size of a small power station peaks in electricity demand however tend to occur in the late afternoon or evening as it gets dark and more lighting and heating gets switched on this also happens to be rush hour so under this scheme the time of day the cars are most likely to be on the roads is also when itd be most helpful to have them plugged in this could lead to financial incentives for people to give up the flexibility of driving their cars only when they need to more electric cars more demand for electricity more pollution more evs on the road makes sound environmental sense  they enable a 40 reduction in co2 emissions  but ultimately the energy still has to come from somewhere that means more power stations the scale of this new demand shouldnt be underestimated if european drivers were to go 80 electric some studies have suggested it would require 150 gw of additional ondemand capacity  the equivalent of 40 draxsized power stations but if evs are to live up to their green potential that additional power needs to come from innovations in storage such as in the nissan example and from renewable sources like wind solar and biomass fossil fuels would ideally be used only to plug any gaps that intermittency creates  for example by briefly firing up the small gas power stations drax plans to build in england and wales what does this mean for generators drax as operator of the uks largest biomass power station and with plans for new rapid response open cycle gas turbines ocgts is well placed to be at the forefront of providing reliable affordable power in the event of a widespread rollout of electric vehicles the ocgts in particular are designed for use in peak times which in the future could be when the nations electric vehicles are plugged in overnight  today this is when electricity demand is at its lowest a future of more electric cars is a positive one theyre cleaner more efficient and they are well suited to our increasingly urban lives but now that we have the technology we need to ensure we can deliver the lowercarbon infrastructure they need tags electric vehicles evs  transport  energy policy  technology  national grid retooling for a postcoal future dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 6 december 2016 opinion the energy system in great britain is dramatically changing where it was once an industry dominated by coal  a predictable but dirty fuel now our power increasingly comes from renewables  this is a trend that will continue forcing more coal off the system drax has a role in this new future of renewable power we have already converted half of our power station in north yorkshire to run on renewable biomass  and now to support the needs of a system increasingly dominated by intermittent renewables like solar and wind we are developing plans to build four new stateoftheart flexible power stations  two in england and two in wales each will be 299 mw in size and powered by gas two of them could be producing electricity by 2020 its the next step for us in helping change the way energy is generated for a better future supporting a renewable energy mix wind and solar accounted for 15 of britains electricity mix between july and september from an installed capacity that has increased six fold in just six years biomass generation at drax rose from almost nothing to producing 20 the countrys renewable power in the first half of this year renewable energy has come on leaps and bounds this decade  perhaps more than anyone ever thought it would but as well as being much lower in carbon emissions renewables like wind and solar operate very differently to the fuels the gb grid was built on  theyre intermittent they only work when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing so when it suddenly becomes still or dark we need alternatives that plug the gap deliver power and boost security of supply biomass is one part of how we can do this using lower carbon fuels compressed wood pellets the biomass used at drax is a renewable fuel that can be used to generate baseload power that can also be dialled up and down to meet demand like coal it can also provide the ancillary services the grid needs to stay stable unlike combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plants which currently supply roughly 40 of the uks power and take 15 hours to start up from cold our new open cycle gas turbine ocgt plants are like big jet engines  generating electricity at full power in just 20 minutes from cold or 10 minutes from a warm standby its an incredibly fast turnaround and its what the energy network needs and because its a lower carbon fuel than coal with higher flexibility it will support the uks decarbonisation targets  by enabling more wind and solar on the grid we plan to use ocgts to plug the gaps that intermittency creates  essentially flicking the switch on and off at very short notice we anticipate they would run for no more than 1500 hours per year  only at times when the electricity system is under stress through supporting more intermittent renewables we also help to enable more coal off the system a better future for customers this new future will not only mean changes for us the generators but for customers too how energy is supplied and used is evolving and this is something that drax can support with the growing retail side of our business were a company with a wealth of expertise in renewable power and we can use this to help deliver electricity to business customers in a way that caters for todays market were already doing this with haven power  but now were extending this with the acquisition of opus energy  with this new company as part of drax group we will be able to grow our existing retail offering providing more of the uks growing businesses and established industrial and corporates not only with electricity but also with gas our retail offering will provide businesses with a route to sell the power they generate but do not need  plus expertise in how they can use energy more efficiently rd these are the first steps in a new chapter for drax there will be more research and development to come in the future well be looking at how we can extend our american compressed wood pellet supply business drax biomass  and at the potential for power storage systems if we want to continue to be a truly modern energy company that delivers on our aim of changing the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future we need to be able to adapt its always been a part of draxs history and it will be a part of our future tags technology  energy policy  gas  customers  about us this train isnt like any other in the uk 25 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy for decades the sight was the same day after day trains pulling opentop wagons filled with coal would arrive at drax power station coal was the fuel on which the station ran but as that changes and the world moves from the dirtiest of fossil fuels to renewables and other lower carbon technologies so too do the makeup of draxs daily deliveries now more than half of draxs power is generated from compressed wood pellets instead of coal the trains still arrive daily but in addition to coal carriages more are pulling stateoftheart biomass wagons theyre not only the first of a kind theyre bigger than any others on uk railways moving a modern fuel coal and biomass are fundamentally different whereas coal is a durable fuel that can be left open to the elements without concern if compressed wood pellets are left in the rain they become unusable in short traditional hoppers the large opentop train wagons used to transport coal arent big enough nor do they provide enough protection for transporting biomass to deliver roughly 20000 tonnes of wood pellets to the power station every day it would need an entirely new railway wagon for this drax turned to lloyds register rail now ricardo rail  and wh davis  putting a lid on it one of the first things to solve was the open top the team designed a pneumatically operated roof for each wagon that could open and close on demand  providing easy access for loading but suitable protection for the pellets when in transit a similar system on each wagons base was introduced to make unloading just as simple a typical hopper design includes a wide roof that narrows into a shoot at its base for releasing fuel the drax wagons are different when they arrive at the power station automated flaps on their underside open in stages as they pass through the biomass unloading area this releases pellets into a sorter that delivers them into storage ready to be used for generation with this system in place each train can unload in under 40 minutes the big problem space a more significant hurdle to overcome was the question of space the obvious answer was to make the wagons bigger but uk railways have some of the most restrictive dimensions in the world thanks to its bridges and tunnels  some of which were constructed in victorian times so to get a similar efficiency out of the compressed wood pellet loads as previously obtained with coal the wagons needed to be bigger  not in physical size but in volume the team looked to the normally unused space at the ends of traditional wagons to house the braking and control equipment cubicle while the pipework was designed to run inside the wagons siding creating more inside storage space the result is a wagon with 116m 3 capacity almost a 30 increase in volume compared to the coal wagons they are not only the first ever bespoke biomass wagons theyre also the largest on uk railways bigger wagons better economy the impact of these wagons is felt beyond just the railway lines wh davis is the uks last independent freight wagon manufacturer and relationships like this are not only good for drax but positively impact the wider uk economy a joint study by oxford economics for drax calculated that in the east midlands where wh davis is headquartered drax supports 1100 jobs through its supply chain and the resulting economic activity in total the report found drax had added 603 million to the local economy through indirect and induced means nationwide in 2015 that impact extended to a total of 124 billion in contribution to the uk gdp and more than 14000 jobs theres potential for this impact to be even greater roughly 14 trains arrive every day at the power station from ports in liverpool  tyne immingham and hull delivering up to 20000 tonnes every day to fuel the three of draxs six generating units that run on wood pellets but if all six are upgraded it will mean more biomass more deliveries and more trains the railways have always been a part of the power station and in the foreseeable future its likely they always will be tags technology  engineering  supply chain  railways and trains  visit us what does an instrument craftsperson do 10 november 2016 power generation how do you go about fixing a turbine that on a normal day spins 3000 times every minute the first port of call is to call in someone like alice gill an instrument craftsperson at drax power station what does an instrument craftperson do what i do is maintain and repair the equipment that links the outside power plant and the control room  equipment that tracks temperature levels or positioning that then informs our operators in the control room whats happening on the plant things like an oxygen analyser its a probe that sits in the boiler and monitors the oxygen level so the operator can ensure the correct ratio of fuel to air is going into the boiler to reach optimum combustion i might be called on to do calibration checks on that sensor to ensure that its working properly or i might be asked to completely remove it and then to repair it how did you come to be doing this job im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person my dad was always working and fixing things in the garage at home and i liked being in there with him when i was at school i decided i didnt want to go to university so started applying for apprenticeships and looking into engineering opportunities drax was one of those schemes and was the one i most wanted to be selected for  luckily enough i was offered a place the apprenticeship was four years and there are loads of training courses and so much to learn including hands on experience and working in the plant i remember first arriving to the power station and not really believing the scale of the place you think how am i ever going to find my way around but you soon get used to it and it becomes the norm in september i became a full instrument craftsperson so now i can really get stuck in im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person what sort of challenges do you face over the summer ive been doing a lot of work on the turbines its a big job as theyre one of the most important elements driving the plant and generating the power during outages the whole thing gets overhauled and given a full health check the turbine team needs to get into machinery which is densely constructed and put together so its my job to go in and carefully remove instrumentation so they can access it when theyre done i have to go back in refit everything and check its all working again how do you do that when youre removing the instruments its a bit more of a just get it off approach  you just make sure you get it off safely without damaging it then when were refitting it were out there with our multimeters making sure were setting different probes at the right voltages and that everything is calibrated correctly theres a screen in our workshop we use to watch the activity of the turbine so we can see the speed of the turbine creeping up as they switch it back on its always a big moment you know things are going to be alright because youve done everything but there are still some nervous people in the room the turbines are spinning at 3000rpm so you really need it all to be working properly is there anything that could wrong on an average day one of the biggest things that could go wrong in my area is the potential to trip an entire generating unit it might be that you overpressurise something or you accidentally trigger a switch that then sets off a daisy chain of events that ends up in a unit tripping tripping is where the unit turns off which basically leads to a total shutdown in electricity generation from one sixth of drax power station theres something called the 660 club  at full load the units are operating at 660 mw so if you trip one you enter into this infamous club there are a few guys in the 660 club but thankfully i havent joined when operating at full load of 660 mw our units supply the national grid with around 645 mw enough to power an entire city what do you do outside of work ive got a horse called red  ive had him for seven years but ive been riding since i was eight its quite different to working with things that do exactly what you tell them when you get on the horse he just does what he wants  hes got a mind of his own its a big change tags careers  apprenticeships  power station  technology  engineering if youre afraid of heights dont do this job 27 october 2016 power generation be they for nuclear coal or biomass power cooling towers and their colossal tapering silhouettes are the most iconic element of the architecture of energy drax has 12 of them but a structure of that size poses a considerable maintenance challenge for the first time since draxs six towers were constructed between 1967 and 1974  one of them was in need of repair what could possibly go wrong no matter how well you build something things can go wrong after more than five decades of continuous operation each tower is made from concrete that varies in thickness from seven inches in the middle to around 15 inches at the top and bottom over time even a structure this solid can begin to weaken cooling towers are reinforced with steel bars embedded within their concrete which can rust and expand causing the concrete around it to crack  a process called spalling water vapour which passes through the towers on an almost constant basis can also migrate into poorly compacted concrete inside the tower and cause further cracks before the drax team could set about repairing the towers they needed to know where these cracks were inspecting a structure that tall needed an innovative solution it needed drones surveying the damage drones were used to make a comprehensive photographic record of the towers that could be inspected for signs of damage the drones also helped produce a 3d model of the structure to visualise the towers defects it was the firstofakind for the company the drone survey found that on tower 3b there were a number of cracked concrete patches on the towers that needed repairing and maintenance was scheduled to coincide with draxs 2016 outages  periods during the summer months when electricity demand is lower and parts of the power station undergo routine repair work the next challenge was how to carry out these repairs on a structure taller than the statue of liberty to inspect the cooling tower drax created a 3d model with the help of cyberhawk  engineering at an altitude drax tower 3b is nearly 115 metres tall enough to fit in the statue of liberty or st pauls cathedral with room to spare how do you go about repairing a structure like this the answer steeplejacks steeplejacks were called so because originally they were the people used for scaling the side of church steeples to make repairs but a cooling tower presents a distinctly different structure that cant necessarily be climbed up from the bottom to scale it and make the repairs a different approach was needed drax reached out to specialist steeplejack contractors zenith structural access  who build devices that allow the scaling of industrialscale structures zeniths solution was to fix a metal frame to the top of the tower which then lowers a walkway suspended by strong metal cables down its side from a perch suspended from the top of tower 3b workmen were deployed to make the repairs  more than 100 metres above ground suspended in their cradles the teams sealed the surface of each crack and then injected resin to fix the cracks in the concrete shell where the concrete had spalled new specialist repair mortars were applied regular repairs with the identified defects on the tower fully repaired attention can now move on to others on site routine inspections using drones and binoculars have been planned to take place every three years these will monitor the condition of all the towers and allow for future maintenance to be planned in advance two more towers are already scheduled for repair in 2017s outages once again itll be case for engineering work at elevation tags technology  biomass energy  engineering  cooling tower  drax power station  visit us  1  5 6 7 8 9 10 11  name email comment sign up for
