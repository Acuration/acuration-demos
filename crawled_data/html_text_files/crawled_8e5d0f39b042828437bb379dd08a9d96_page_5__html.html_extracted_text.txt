Press Release
Scottish Planning Minister visits iconic ‘Hollow Mountain’ power station
6 April 2023
Press releases

Cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built in a hollowed-out cavern 1km inside Ben Cruachan – Argyll’s highest mountain. Constructed in 1965, its reversible turbines are still at the cutting edge of energy storage technology, enabling the plant to act like a giant water battery.
As part of the visit, Drax Group’s Director of Scottish Assets, Ian Kinnaird, outlined the company’s exciting work on plans to build a new second underground pumped hydro storage power station at the Cruachan complex.
Drax is progressing plans to build a new 600 MW underground plant adjacent to its existing underground Cruachan facility in Argyll, Scotland. Increasing the UK’s pumped storage hydro capacity is critical to enabling more wind and solar power to come online, strengthening the country’s energy security while helping Scotland and the whole of the UK to decarbonise.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director, said:
“Cruachan plays a critical role in stabilising the electricity system, balancing supply and demand by storing excess power from the national grid. When Scotland’s wind turbines are generating more power than we need, Cruachan steps in to store the renewable electricity so it doesn’t go to waste.
“Drax has exciting plans to more than double Cruachan’s generating capacity, a project that will support new green jobs and help our homes and businesses go greener by bringing more renewable power online.”
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director and Joe FitzPatrick, the Scottish Government’s Planning Minister
The Scottish Government’s Planning Minister Joe FitzPatrick said:
“Scotland has a proud history of hydro power and currently accounts for around 88% of total UK capacity.
“Our recently adopted National Planning Framework 4 is clear about the importance of pumped hydro storage and continues its designation as a national development. Scotland’s facilities have the potential to play a significantly greater role in the energy transition, while contributing to the resilience of electricity supply and creating jobs in rural locations.
“We continue to press the UK Government to ensure that the appropriate market and regulatory arrangements are put in place to support the further development of hydro projects.”
Pumped storage hydro plants act like giant water batteries, using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from wind farms and other low carbon technologies when supply outstrips demand. These same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when it is needed.
Drax acquired Cruachan alongside the Galloway and Lanark hydro schemes in 2019, helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible, renewable power generation.
When all four of its generating units are operating at maximum capacity, the plant can supply enough flexible power for around 800,000 homes.

Global hydro experts appointed to enhance Cruachan expansion design
8 March 2023
Press releases

Drax is progressing plans to build a new 600 MW underground plant adjacent to its existing underground Cruachan facility in Argyll, Scotland. Increasing the UK’s pumped storage hydro capacity is critical to enabling more wind and solar power to come online, strengthening the country’s energy security while helping Britain decarbonise.
Studio Pietrangeli will act as Owner’s Engineer on the project, supporting key activities including optimising the detailed design and layout of the new plant, providing expertise around the major civil engineering components of the project, such the excavation and tunnelling of rock within Ben Cruachan and preparing the specifications for a Front End Engineering and Design study. This will ensure that Cruachan 2, once constructed, is one of the most modern and efficient pumped storage plants in Europe.
Ian Kinnaird, Drax’s Scottish Assets Director, said:
“This is a significant moment in Drax’s planned expansion of Cruachan.
“The scale of the proposed development matches Drax’s ambitions when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. More than 2 million tonnes of rock will be excavated to create a new cavern inside the mountain which will be big enough to house Big Ben on its side.
“Pumped storage hydro is vital to strengthening the UK’s energy security by enabling more homegrown renewable electricity to come online, cutting the need to import power or fossil fuels from abroad. This will be a major infrastructure project which will support hundreds of jobs and provide a real boost to Scotland’s economy.”
Antonio Pietrangeli, Managing Partner of the firm and Project Director for this assignment said:
“SP is delighted to have been appointed as Owner’s Engineer to assist Drax in developing this important pumped storage plant. Pumped storage is becoming increasingly valuable in facilitating countries’ efforts to meet their carbon-reduction goals and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The Cruachan 2 plant will be a crucial step towards the UK’s achievement of these goals.”
Pumped storage hydro plants act like giant water batteries, using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from wind farms and other low carbon technologies when supply outstrips demand. These same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when it is needed.
In order to deploy this critical technology, Drax must secure consent from the Scottish Government alongside an updated policy and market support mechanism from the UK Government.
The existing lack of an appropriate framework for new long-duration, large-scale electricity storage technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects, with no new plants built anywhere in the UK since 1984 despite their critical role in security of supply and decarbonisation.

Britain breaks record for ‘greening its grid’
28 February 2023
Press releases

Clean, or low-carbon, power includes renewable sources – biomass, hydro, wind and solar – as well as nuclear, and these sources also combined to break the record for the volume of clean surplus power produced – 2.9GW. During 2022 there were nearly 100 hours where the grid delivered more clean power than it needed.
Despite this surplus, some fossil fuel generators were required to stay running in order to provide the
flexibility and inertia
that National Grid ESO relies on to stabilise the power system, although the minimum safe amount of fossil fuels is continuously falling, inching National Grid ESO closer to its 2025 goal of being able to eradicate this during surplus periods.
Clean Power: The electricity generation mix over the last week of 2022. Periods when total supply from low-carbon sources exceeded demand are highlighted in pale green
Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and lead author of the quarterly Drax Electric Insights report, said:
“Britain’s power grid has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last decade with surplus clean electricity having switched from being a pipe dream to becoming a reality. Electricity is the only form of energy where we produce more than we consume – in comparison to our coal and gas requirements where 60-75% are still imported from abroad.
“Completely eliminating fossil fuels during periods of high renewable output and low demand in the next two years requires significant policy and infrastructure decisions to be made now. Having a new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero is a positive step to focus government attention on this and other key targets, such as delivering the large amount of carbon removals from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) that will make a critical contribution to its legally binding decarbonisation targets.
“The UK has led the world in ‘greening its grid’ further and faster than
any other major economy
and we need to ensure we don’t lose the momentum to make net zero a reality.”
Drax was the first energy company in the world to
announce
an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030. The company has radically decarbonised its business by transforming its largest power plant – Drax Power Station – to use sustainably sourced biomass to generate renewable electricity instead of coal.
The company plans to deploy BECCS technology at its UK plant by 2027, alongside removing four million tonnes of CO2 from new-build BECCS outside of the UK by 2030.
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Being able to generate a surplus of clean, low-carbon electricity is a landmark achievement for the UK.
“At Drax, we believe the UK can go even further in the years ahead by removing millions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year while generating reliable, secure renewable electricity through BECCS.
“While countries across the world, and particularly the U.S., are stepping up to address climate change, we believe the UK Government must accelerate its policy support for BECCS to give this country the best chance of establishing itself as a world leader in carbon removals, attracting further clean energy investment and delivering its net zero targets.
“Drax has helped keep the UK’s power grid secure for the past 50 years and through BECCS we will continue to do so for another 50 years.”

Drax helps Bawtry Air Cadets get an I.T. upgrade!
21 February 2023
Press releases

Drax’s Charity Committee has awarded £2,500 to the squadron to go towards upgrading its IT suite which they use for online training, presentations, flight simulation and general admin of the organisation. The equipment will replace the old technology which no longer supports the software they use.
The Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC) is a youth organisation for 12–20-year-olds with an interest in aviation and the Air Force which teaches valuable skills in leadership, teamwork, First Aid and much more while the disciplinary aspect encourages self-improvement and high personal standards. In addition to aviation, the RAFAC also teaches cadets about related topics such as space, radio, cyber and engineering disciplines.
Jane Breach, Drax UK Community & Education Manager, said: “Drax has a long history of supporting the communities local to its operations and promoting STEM education. It’s so important that the next generation have the tools needed to become the skilled workforce of the future. We’re pleased to be able to support the valuable work that the Cadets do and hope that this donation will have a positive impact on the squadron in developing their IT skills.”
Flight Lieutenant Andrew Archer RAFAC said: “We are always striving to give our cadets the best experience possible and help them develop skills they can take with them into their future careers. This donation from Drax to upgrade the old equipment we are currently using in our IT suite will really help our young people with their technology skills. We currently have 35 cadets in the squadron and donations like these are so important for topping up the funding we receive and allowing us to keep offering life enhancing experiences for our young people.”
2008 (Bawtry) Squadron, Royal Air Force Air Cadets in front of Drax’s 114m tall cooling towers
The group recently visited Drax Power Station near Selby for a full tour to learn how renewable electricity is generated from sustainable biomass and to see Drax’s Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) pilot project.
BECCS is a vital negative emissions technology which Drax plans to use to permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, whilst also generating the reliable, renewable electricity the country needs.
They saw the 427-metre turbine hall that houses the huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity, as well as the wood pellet storage domes – each large enough to fit The Royal Albert Hall inside, and the 115m high cooling towers, which are taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Drax is committed to supporting the communities local to its operations through various initiatives including fundraising for
local charities
and supporting
education and skills

Drax helps businesses save money and support energy security
17 February 2023
Press releases

Renewable energy leader Drax is one of the first providers of a new service aimed at incentivising businesses to reduce their electricity demand at peak times to support energy security
Enough power to supply 574,000 homes has been saved so far by a number of Drax’s participating business customers, from large organisations including Ford to SME’s like FI Real Estate Management, generating over £875,000 for them, and supporting their net zero goals
The Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) includes businesses with assets where demand can be flexed, including batteries, manufacturing processes and electric vehicle charge points Through the scheme Drax has already generated over £875,000 for its customers.
National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is running the DFS to financially incentivise businesses to reduce electricity consumption when national demand is at its highest, typically on weekdays between 4pm and 7pm. Between November 2022 and March 2023, the ESO has announced that it will operate a maximum of 12 tests for participants.
Drax Energy Solutions has worked with a number of customers, including global vehicle manufacturer Ford and SME FI Real Estate Management, to reduce their collective power demand by 287MWh during these test periods – the equivalent amount of electricity needed to power 574,000 UK homes.
This additional flexibility helps National Grid ESO balance supply and demand amid the ongoing energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Drax’s customers are paid £3,000 per MWh to reduce their power consumption and with a reduction in demand of 287MWh observed during the test events conducted so far, a revenue of over £875,000 was achieved for participating customers.
Adam Hall, Director of Energy Services
Adam Hall, Drax’s Director of Energy Services said: “Drax Energy Solutions is one of the first approved providers of this service. Our business customers with flexibility in their operations can play a significant role in boosting Britain’s energy security whilst cutting their own electricity bills.
“Customers including Ford and FI Real Estate Management have agreed to be part of the scheme, adjusting their manufacturing processes and EV charging. This will deliver more flexibility and stability to the grid, by cutting their energy use at key times, which in turn contributes to their own net zero goals.”
FI Real Estate Management is one of the UK’s largest privately-owned commercial property management firms.  They have over 40 years’ experience of owning and managing properties across the industrial, office, retail and residential sectors. John Corker, Advisor to the Managing Director & Chief Operating Officer said:
“We are constantly reviewing how we can reduce the environmental impact of our real estate portfolio, so we jumped at the opportunity to support this important UK initiative and look forward to increasing our participation in the scheme as future opportunities arise. We are committed to becoming a more sustainable company by implementing smart building technology wherever possible and installing electric vehicle charging points across the estate.”
The scheme was recently approved by Ofgem, and Drax is one of the first approved providers for DFS this winter.

Demand Flexibility Scheme
The Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) has been developed to allow the ESO to access additional flexibility when the national demand is at its highest – during peak winter days – which is not currently accessible to the ESO in real time. This new innovative service will allow consumers, as well as some industrial and commercial users (through suppliers/aggregators), to be incentivised for voluntarily flexing the time when they use their electricity.
As part of a range of tools designed to help manage the electricity system this winter, National Grid are collaborating with energy suppliers/aggregators to allow participating consumers and businesses to reduce their bills this winter.
