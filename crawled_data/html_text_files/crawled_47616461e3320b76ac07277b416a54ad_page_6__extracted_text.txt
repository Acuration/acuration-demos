technology how turbines came to power the world 5 september 2018 power generation charles algernon parsons knew he was onto something in 1884 the young engineer had joined a ship engineering firm and developed a steam turbine engine which he immediately saw had a bigger potential than powering boats he connected it to a dynamo turning it into a generator capable of producing up to 75 kilowatts kw of power and in the process kickstarted an electrical and mechanical revolution that would reshape how electricity was produced and how the world worked today turbinebased generation is the dominant method for electricity production throughout the world and even now  almost a century and a half later  parsons turbine concept remains largely unchanged even if the world around it has steam dreams throughout the 20 th and into the current century electricity generation has depended on steam power be it in a coal nuclear or biomass power plant heating water into highly pressurised steam is at the core of production greek mathematician and inventor hero of alexandria is cited as building the first ever steam engine of sorts with his aeolipile  which used steam to spin a hollow metal sphere but it wasnt until the 18 th century when english ironmonger thomas newcomen designed an  albeit inefficient  engine to pump water out of flooded mines that steam became a credible power in industry scottish engineer james watt from whose name the unit of energy comes from built on these humble beginnings and turned steam into the power behind the industrial revolution around 1764 when he added an condensing chamber to newcomens original design  it was the combination of this engine with thomas edisons electrical generator late in the 19 th century that first made largescale electricity production from steam a reality the turbine takes over steam engines and steam power was not a new concept when parson began his explorations in the space in fact nor were steam turbines others had explored ways to use streams velocity to spin blades rather than using its pressure to pump pistons in turn allowing rotors to spin at much greater speeds while requiring less raw fuel what made parsons design so important was its ability to keep rotational speeds moderate while also extracting as much kinetic energy from steam jets as possible he explained in a 1911 rede lecture that this was done by splitting up the fall in pressure of the steam into small fractional expansions over a large number of turbines in series which ensured there was no one place the velocity of the blades was too great the designs strength was also apparent at scale in 1900 his company which was eventually acquired by siemens  was building turbinegenerator units capable of producing 1000 kw of electricity by 1912 however the company was installing a 25000 kw unit for the city of chicago parsons would live to see units reach 50000 kw and become the primary source of electricity generation around the world turbines in the modern grid the world is a vastly different place to the one in which parson designed his turbine yet the fundamentals of his concept have changed very little the results of what they achieve and the scales at which they work however have increased significantly today the turbines that make up draxs six generating units are each capable of producing more than 600 mw or 6000000 kw of electricity with the shape materials and arrangement of blades carefully designed to maximise efficiency and while that first design was purely with steam in mind turbine technology has advanced beyond dependency on a single power source and has been developed to accommodate for the shift towards lowercarbon power sources one such example is gas turbines which work by sucking in air through a compressor which is then heated by burning natural gas in turn spinning a turbine as it expands these can jump into action much faster than other turbines as they dont require any steam to be created to power them renewable sources such as hydro and wind power also depend on spinning turbines to generate electricity where these differ from gas or steampowered turbines is that rather than being encased in metal and blasted with gases wind and hydro turbines blades are exposed so flowing air or water can spin them powering a generator in turn turbine technology helped bring access to electricity around the world but the ingenuity and flexibility of the design means it is now serving to adapt electricity production for the postcoal age tags turbines  history  engineering  power station  technology the everyday and future ways you use forest products 24 august 2018 sustainable bioenergy think of the products that come from forests and you might think of the centuries of shipbuilding construction and cooking made possible by civilisations utilising this plentiful natural resource what you might not think of is the complex construction of chemicals and matter that make up the trees of a forest  nor of the countless ways these can be broken down and used yet this is the reality of forests from essential oils to sturdy packaging to powerful adhesives trees are used to create a range of products that make daily life possible and as awareness of the need to reduce plastic consumption grows research into forest products and how they can replace the lessenvironmentally friendly objects is growing here we look at five of the most common products used today and maybe in the future that owe something to forests adhesives from tall oil anyone who has encountered tree sap can attest trees are made up of some pretty sticky stuff and its because of this that they have long been a source for adhesives production  from glue to cement the substance that makes this possible is known as tall oil named after the swedish word tallolja  meaning pine oil it is a byproduct of pulping coniferous trees tall oil has been produced commercially since the 1930s when the invention of the recovery boiler made it possible to extract it from the kraft pulping process  however the resins and waxes tall oil is made up of have a longer history these are also known as naval products due to their historic use in ship building and can be tapped directly from living trees today tall oil is also used in asphalt roofing as well as medical and cosmetic applications one of tall oils most exciting uses is as bioverno  a renewable alternative to diesel made in the worlds first commercialscale biorefinery in finland disinfectants and detergents from turpentine tapping trees has historically been a means of extracting multiple useful substances and one of the most versatile of these is turpentine this yellowish liquid is produced from distilled tree resin and has a long history of uses turpentine has been used since roman times as torch or lamp fuel but its antiseptic properties also means it was often used as medicine while doctors today would advise against drinking turpentine as was prescribed in the past it is still used today in disinfectants detergents and cleaning products giving off a fresh pinelike odour fuels to replace fossils biomass pellets from working forests are just one of the ways trees are providing renewable energy one other form is cellulosic ethanol a new second generation of liquid biofuel rather than competing with food supply often a concern in the creation of biodiesels cellulosic ethanol is made from nonfood based materials such as forest and agricultural residues left behind after harvest  wheat straw  and timber processing wastes including sawdust it is now being produced at a commercial scale in europe the us and brazil  woody biomass can also be converted into a petroleum substitute known as pyrolysis oil or biooil biomass is transformed into this dark brown liquid by heating it to 500 o c in an oxygendeprived environment and then allowing it to cool biooil has a much higher energy density than biomass in chip or pellet form and after upgrading can be used as jet fuel or as a petroleum alternative in chemical manufacturing  vanilla ice cream and carbon fibre from lignin lignin is what gives trees their tough woody quality  and after cellulose is the worlds second most abundant natural polymer polymers are very long molecules made up of many smaller molecules joined endtoend most often associated with plastic which is a synthetic polymer lignin is generally a waste product from the paper pulping process and is often burnt as fuel however it can also serve as a vanilla flavouring  a property that may make lignin an important resource in the face of an impending vanilla pod shortage  futurelooking research however aims to unlock much more from the 50 million tonnes of lignin produced every year globally  one of the most promising of these is as an alternative source of a family of organic compound known as phenylpropanoids  these are normally extracted from petroleum and are hugely useful in producing plastics and carbon fibre as well as drugs and paint nanocellulose and the future of forest products cellulose is already one of the most important products to come from forests thanks to its role in paper production however this abundant substance  which is also the primary material in the cell walls of all green plants  holds even more potential by shrinking cellulose down to a nano level it can be configured to be very strong while remaining very light  this opens it up as a product with many possibilities including using it as a source of bioplastics  some bioplastics  polylactic acid pha pbs and starch blends  are biodegradable alternatives to fossil fuelbased plastics and could potentially help solve some of the worlds mostpressing waste issues not all biobased plastics are biodegradable however the property of biodegradation doesnt depend on the resource basis of a material  it is linked to its chemical structure in other words 100 biobased plastics may be nonbiodegradable and 100 fossilbased plastics can biodegrade biobased plastics that are not biodegradable include polyethylene terephthalate polyurethanes polyamide polyethylene polyethylenefuranoate or pef is recyclable can be manufactured without fossil fuels and while not biodegradable has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to the oilbased plastic used to make water bottles celluloses combination of strength and light weight has also attracted interest from the auto industry in the ability to help cars become much lighter and therefore more fuel efficient  its flexible strong transparent nature can also make nanocellulose  an important material in helping bring bendable screens  batteries cosmetics paper pharmaceuticals optical sensors and devices to market the idea of using trees as a source of goods and products in everyday life might sound archaic but in reality weve only just tapped the surface of what the chemicals and materials theyre made of can do markus mannström from finnish renewables company stora enso said recently that we believe that everything made from fossilbased materials today can be made from a tree tomorrow as research advances trees and forests will only play a bigger role in a more sustainable future tags forestry and forest management and arboriculture  forests  technology how to switch a power station off coal 22 august 2018 sustainable bioenergy in 2003 the uks biggest coal power station took its first steps away from the fossil fuel which defined electricity generation for more than a century it was in that year that drax power station began cofiring biomass as a renewable alternative to coal it symbolised the beginnings of the power stations ambitious transformation from fossilfuel stalwart to the countrys largest singlesite renewable electricity generator this plan presented a massive engineering challenge for drax with significant amounts of new knowledge quickly needed fifteen years later three of its generating units now run entirely on compressed wood pellets a form of biomass while coal has been relegated to stepping in only to cover spikes in demand and improve system stability  now drax has converted a fourth unit from coal to biomass this development represents the passing of a two thirds marker for the power stations coalfree ambitions and adds 600plus megawatts mw of renewable electricity to great britains national transmission system  building on the past drax first converted a coal unit to biomass in 2013 with two more following in 2014 and 2016 this put drax in an interesting position going into a new conversion on one hand it is one of the most experienced generators in the world when it comes to dealing with and upgrading to biomass on the other its still relatively new to the low carbon fuel compared with its dealings with coal adam nicholson weve decades of understanding of how to use coal but weve only been operating with biomass since we started the full conversion trials in 2011 says adam nicholson section head for process performance at drax power weve got few running hours under our belts with the new fuel versus the hundreds of man years of coal knowledge and operation all around the country when converting a generating unit the steam turbine and generator itself remain the same the difference is all in the material being delivered stored crushed and blown into the boiler and burned to heat up water and create steam and because biomass can be a volatile substance  much more so than coal  this process must be a careful one drax could build on the learnings and equipment it had already developed for biomass such as specially built trains and pulverising mills  but storage proved a bigger issue the giant biomass domes at drax that make up the ecostore are advanced technological structures carefully attuned to storing biomass but for unit 4 they were off limits instead drax engineers had to come up with another solution the journey of a pellet through the power station normally wood pellets are brought into drax by train unloaded and stored in the biomass domes before travelling through the power station to the mills and then boilers  unit 4 however sits in the second half of the station  built 12 years after the first this slight change in location presented a problem theres no link from the eco store to unit 4 at all explains nicholson you cant use the storage domes and that whole infrastructure to get anything to unit 4 drax engineers set about designing a new conveyor system that could connect the domes to the mills and boiler that powers unit 4 after weeks of design the team had a theoretical plan to connect the two locations with one problem it was entirely uneconomical rail unloading building 1 and storage silos if we were building a new plant it would be relatively easy because you could plan properly and wouldnt have existing equipment in the way says nicholson we had to plan around it and make use of the preexisting plant within that preexisting plant though were vital pieces of equipment some of which had laid dormant since drax stopped fuelling its boilers with a mixture of coal and biomass and opted instead for full unit conversions drax began cofiring across all six units in 2003 using two different materials  a mix of around 5 biomass and 95 coal a direct injection facility was added in 2005 it involved blowing crushed wood pellets into coal fuel lines from two of the power stations 60 mills  then the amount of renewable power drax was able to generate roughly doubled in the summer of 2010 when a 400 mw cofiring facility became operational back to the present day its fortunate for the unit 4 conversion that the cofiring facility includes its own rail unloading building rub 1 and storage silos they are located much closer to the unit than the bigger rub 2 and the massive biomass domes this solved the problem of storage but moving the required volumes of biomass through the plant without significant transport construction still posed a challenge rail unloading building 1 and storage silos for unit 4 left ecostore biomass domes for units 13 right to tackle this the team modified a pneumatic transport system previously tested during cofiring to have the capability to blow entire pellets from the storage facilities around the power station at speeds of more than 20 metres per second the success of this system proved key  it was the final piece necessary to make the conversion of unit 4 economical  the postcoal future andy koss for now draxs fifth and sixth generating unit remain coalpowered but are called upon less frequently with great britain set to go completely coalfree by 2025 there are plans to convert these too but as part of a system of combined cycle gas turbines and giant batteries rather than biomass powered units its an opportunity for drax to again leverage its preexisting plant and provide the grid with a fast actingsource of lowercarbon electricity as with converting to biomass it will pose a complex new engineering challenge  one that will prepare drax to meet the future needs of grid as it continues to change and demand greater flexibility from generators the speed at which the unit 4 project has been delivered is testament to the engineering expertise skill and ingenuity we continue to see at drax were nimble and innovative enough to meet future challenges says andy koss chief executive drax power we may look very different in 10 or 20 years time but the ethos of that innovation and agility is something that will persist repowering the remaining coal plant with gas and up to 200 mw of batteries will sit alongside research into areas such as carbon capture use and storage ccus that is all geared towards expanding drax power beyond a single site generator into a portfolio of flexible power production facilities unit 4s conversion is more than just a step beyond halfway for the power stations decarbonisation but a significant step towards becoming entirely coalfree  find out more about unit 4  tags investors  coal

brits  not hot enough for aircon not too cold to put the heating on in march we saw how the beast from the east caused a surge in demand now the long summer heatwave is doing the same june 23 rd marked the start of the heatwave with daytime temperatures surpassing 30c in scotland and wales the last week of june was 33c warmer than the previous week and demand was 860 mw higher see chart below  this rise is equivalent to power demand from an extra 25 million households this reflects the growing role of air conditioning and refrigeration in shops and cooling for data centres global electricity demand from cooling is rising dramatically and is seen as a  blind spot  in the global energy system this will become more important as global temperatures and more importantly global incomes rise however it is easier to deal with than cold spells during winter because demand is low and solar pv output is high below 14c demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it gets colder as buildings need more heating around a tenth of british homes have electric heating as do half of commercial and public buildings  and while the uk is not synonymous with air conditioners demand rises by 350 mw for each degree that temperature rises above 20c this effect may well grow stronger in the coming years national grid expect that the peak load from air conditioners will triple in the coming decade perhaps events such as the current prolonged heatwave may spur more households to invest in air conditioning read the press release explore power grid data during the heatwave beginning

many of the worlds most evocative smells often need electricity to make them but does electricity itself have a smell the short answer is no an electric current itself doesnt have an odour but in instances when electricity becomes visible or audible it also creates a distinctive smell the smell electricity emits is the contents of the gasses created when electricity conducts through air says drax lead engineer gary preece in an instance of a failure on a switch board for example and theres a flash of electricity gasses are created from the charged air including ozone its the same ozone gas that makes up the lower layer of the earths atmosphere and is often described as having a clean chlorinelike but burnt smell while it can sometimes be dangerous ozone is also a very useful gas what is ozone ozones scientific name is trioxide as it is made up of three oxygen molecules while the normal oxygen we breathe is o 2  ozone is o 3 and is created by electricity in a similar way to how it forms naturally in the atmosphere there are large amounts of oxygen and nitrogen floating around in the atmosphere protecting life on earth from the suns intense uv radiation these rays are so powerful they can ionise the oxygen ripping it apart into two individual molecules however these lonely molecules are highly reactive and will sometimes collide and bond with nearby o 2 to create ozone an electric current at a high voltage  given the right conditions  will conduct through the air ionising oxygen in its wake and creating ozone just as the suns uv rays do when electricity behaves like this its known as a corona discharge  which makes a crackling sound and creates a visible plasma the most common time people may come into contact with a whiff of ozone is when a storm is approaching lighting is essentially a massive plasma that creates ozone as it conducts through the air with the smell often arriving before the storm hits it highlights quite how pungent ozone is considering humans can smell it in concentrations as low as 10 parts per billion in ordinary air the concerns and capabilities of ozone while ozone protects the planet when its in the atmosphere it can be dangerous at ground level where it can also form through naturally occurring gases reacting with air pollution sources high exposure to ozone at ground level can lead to lung throat and breathing problems however because it also has a damaging effect on bacteria ozone can be very useful in the medical field and electricity is being used to deliberately create it in fact ozone has been experimented with in medicine for more than a century with its ability to attack and kill bacteria making it useful as a disinfectant during the first world war it was used to treat wounds and prevent them becoming inflamed and was also found to aid blood flow electricity plays an important role in almost everything we interact with on a daily basis affecting all our senses even smell tags electricity  technology  engineering 6 startups ideas and power plants shaping biomass 4 june 2018 sustainable bioenergy humans have used wood as a source of fuel for over a million years  modern biomass power however is a far cry from humans early taming of fire and this is down to constant research and innovation in fact today its one of the most extensively researched areas in energy and environmental studies with biomass accounting for 64 of total renewable energy production in the eu in 2015 the development isnt likely to stop ongoing advancements in the field are helping the technology become more sustainable and efficient in reducing emissions here are seven of the projects businesses ideas and technologies pushing biomass further into the future torrefaction  supercharging biomass pellets when it comes to making biomass as efficient as possible its all down to each individual pellet improving whats known as the calorific value of each pellet increases the overall amount of energy released when they are used in a power station one emerging process aiming to improve this is torrefaction which involves heating biomass to between 250 and 300 degrees celsius in a lowoxygen environment this drives out moisture and volatiles from woody feedstocks straw and other biomass sources before it is turned into a black biocoal pellet which has a very high calorific value this year estonian company baltania is constructing the first industrialscale torrefaction plant in the country with the target output of 160000 tonnes of biocoal pellets per year if its successful power stations worldwide may be able to get more power from each little pellet biobean  powered by caffeine biofuels dont just come from forest residues every day more than two billion cups of coffee are consumed globally as people get themselves caffeinated for the day ahead in london alone this need for daily stimulation results in more than 200000 tonnes of coffee waste produced every year more often than not this ends up in landfills biobean aims to change this by collecting used coffee grounds from cafes offices and factories and recycling them into biofuels and biochemicals the company now recycles as much as 50000 tonnes of coffee grounds annually while one of its products b20 biodiesel has been used to power london buses biobean also produces briquettes and pellets which like woody biomass can serve as an alternative to coal biomass gasification  increasing the value of biomass waste biogas is often seen as a promising biofuel with fewer emissions than burning fossil fuels or biomass pellets its an area undergoing significant research as it points to another means of creating highervalue products from biomass matter the finnish town of vaasa is home to the worlds largest gasification plant  the facility is part of a coal plant where cofiring biogas with coal has allowed it to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions by as much as 230000 tonnes per year as well as reducing emissions cofiring allows the power plant to use 25 to 40 less coal and when demand is low in the autumn and spring months the plant runs entirely on biogas more than that the forestry residues which are used to produce the biogas are sourced locally from within 100 km of site as part of our transition away from coal cofiring biomass with that fossil fuel took place at drax power station from 2003 until full unit conversions became a reality in 2013 lynemouth power station  powering the move away from coal after 44years the coalfired lynemouth power station in northumberland is the latest uk power producer converting to biomassfuel set for completion this year the plant will supply 390 mw of lowcarbon electricity to the national grid enough to power 700000 homes  every new power station conversion poses different challenges as well as the opportunity to develop new solutions but none are as crucial as the conversion of the materials handling equipment from coal to biomass pellets while coal can sit in the rain for long periods of time and still be used biomass must be kept dry with storage conditions constantly monitored and adjusted to prevent sudden combustion at lynemouth the handling of 14 million tonnes of biomass annually has required the construction of three 40metre high concrete storage silos as well as extensive conveyor systems to unload and transport biomass around the plant biotrans  two birds with one stone energy and food are both undergoing serious changes to make them more sustainable danish startup biotrans is tackling both challenges by using one of the food industrys key pain points  wastage  to create energy with its biogas systems the company installs systems that collect leftover food from restaurants and canteens and stores it in odourproof tanks before collecting and turning it into biogas for heating and electricity production more than just utilising this waste stream the byproduct of the gasification process can also be sold as a fertiliser drax and ccapture  cutting emissions from the source carbon capture usage and storage ccus is one of the most important fields in the energy sector today the technologys ability to capture co 2 from the electricity generation process and turn it into a revenue source before it can enter the atmosphere means its attracting significant investment and research drax is partnering with ccapture  a company spun out of the university of leeds chemistry department to trial a new form of ccus the pilot scheme will launch in november and aims to capture a tonne of co 2 per day from one of draxs biomass units ccaptures technology could make the process of capturing and storing co 2 less costly and energy intensive it does this using a specially developed solvent capable of isolating co 2 before being recycled through the system and capturing more if the pilot proves successful the technology could be implemented at an industrial scale seeing up to 40 of the co 2 in the flue gases from draxs biomass units captured and stored if the technology tested at drax leads to the construction of a purposebuilt carbon capture unit elsewhere scientists and engineers at ccapture believe the co 2 captured could exceed 90 back in north yorkshire the eventual goal is negative carbon emissions from drax power station  its biomass units already deliver carbon savings of more than 80 compared to when they used coal and if a new revenue stream can be developed from the sale of the carbon captured then the power produced from biomass at the power station could become even more cost effective with thanks to biomass uk and the european biomass association  aebiom   tags biomass energy  technology  wood pellets keeping the electricity systems voltage stable 15 may 2018 power generation in daytoday life the electricity system normally plays a consistent unfluctuating role powering the same things in the same way however behind the scenes electricity generation is a constant balancing act to keep the grid stable power stations themselves are like living animals  in need of continuous adjustment transmission networks need continual maintenance and keeping the whole grid at a frequency of 50 hz takes careful monitoring and finetuning one of the other constant challenges for great britains electricity system is keeping voltage under control keeping the volts in check voltage is a way of expressing the potential difference in charge between two points in an electrical field in more simplistic terms it acts as the pressure that pushes charged electrons known as the current through an electric circuit great britains national grid system runs at a voltage of 400 kilovolts kv and 275kv scotland also uses 132kv it is then reduced in a series of steps by transformers to levels suitable for supply to customers for example 11kv for heavy industrial or 230 volts v when delivered to homes by regional distribution networks  keeping the voltage steady requires careful management a deviation as small as 5 above or below can lead to increased wear and tear of equipment  and additional maintenance costs or even largescale blackouts power stations such as drax can control the voltage level through whats known as reactive power  if voltage is high absorbing reactive power back into the generator reduces it says drax lead engineer gary preece by contrast generating reactive power increases the voltage reactive power is made in an electricity generator alongside active power the electricity that powers our lights and devices and national grid can request generators such as drax to either absorb or produce more of it as its needed to control voltage so how is a generator spinning at 3000 rpm switched from producing to absorbing reactive power all it takes is the turn of a tap absorbing reactive power taps along a transformer allow a certain portion of the winding  which make up a transformers active part with the core  to be selected or unselected this allows the transformer to alter whats known as the phase angle which refers to the relationship between apparent power made up of reactive power and active power and active power this change in the phase angle regulates the power factor power factor is measured between 0 and 1 between 1 and 0 lagging means a generator is producing reactive power and increasing overall voltage whereas between 1 and 0 leading means it is absorbing reactive power and reducing voltage that absorbed reactive power doesnt just disappear rather it transfers to heat at the back end of the power stations generator temperatures can be in excess of 60 degree celsius says preece theres also a lot of vibration caused by the changes in flux at the end of the generator this can cause long term damage to the winding as the generators continue to produce active power while absorbing reactive power the conditions begin to reduce efficiency and if prolonged begin to damage the machines draxs advantage here is that it operates six turbines all of which are capable of switching between delivering or absorbing reactive power or vice versa in under two minutes voltage management in a changing grid the changing nature of great britains energy supply means voltage management is trickier than ever voltage creeps up when power lines are lightly loaded the increase of decentralised generation  such as solar panels and smallscale onshore wind farms operating to directly supply specific localities or a number of customers embedded on regional electricity networks  means this is becoming more common around the grid this creates a greater demand for the kind of reactive power absorption and voltage management that drax power station carries out gridscale batteries are being increasingly developed as a means of storing power from weather dependent renewable sources this power can then be pumped onto the grid when demand is high in a similar manner these storage systems can also absorb reactive power when theres too much on the system and discharge it when its needed  bringing the voltage down and up respectively the trouble is gridscale battery storage systems need to be absolutely huge and a 100 mw facility would be close to the size of football field and double stacked explains preece they are also not synchronised to the grid as a thermal turbine generator would be subsequently there is no contribution to inertia  as great britains power system continues to evolve maintaining its stability also needs to adapt where once the challenge lay in keeping voltage high and enough reactive power on the grid today its absorbing reactive power and keeping voltage down  it highlights the need for thermal generators that are designed to quickly switch between generating and absorbing to support the wider network this story is part of a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the areas of balancing services

investors  electricity system balancing and ancillary services can we see electricity 4 may 2018 electrification a 14 th century carrack quietly sails through the currents of the atlantic ocean in the middle of the night its navigation relies on the stars shining above its power on the wind blowing behind its a far cry from the technologically advanced vessels sailing todays seas it was here long before civilisation began using and generating electricity that the ghostly bluewhite glow of electricity acting upon air molecules was often seen as it hovered around ships masts this phenomenon is known as st elmos fire after saint erasmus of formia  the patron saint of sailors  and occurs following thunderstorms when the electric field still present around an object such as a lightning rod or a ships mast causes air molecules to break up and become charged creating whats known as a plasma st elmos fire on a cockpit window for sailors in an era long before satellite guidance it was a good omen what they didnt realise however was it was one of the rare instances when electricity acts in a way that changes it from an unseen force to something we can see hear and even smell the science behind seeing electricity normally we cant see electricity its like gravity  an invisible force we only recognise when it acts upon other objects in the instance of electricity the most common way it affects objects is by charging electrons and because these are so small so plentiful and move so quickly once charged they are all but invisible to the naked human eye however there are instances when conditions enable an electric current to conduct through the air which can create sound and generate a visible plasma you can see electricity in certain instances because its ionising the air says drax lead engineer gary preece in the process of ionising the molecules that make up air become electrically charged which can create a plasma the electric current is able to bridge the air gap through the ionised air and to earth explains preece you need to have that path to earth for it to create a spark its a similar process to how a spark plug works or how lightning becomes visible while there is still scientific debate around how clouds become electrically charged the flashes seen on the ground are caused by discharges between clouds or from clouds to the earth creating a very hot and bright plasma the atmospheric conditions of our earth being largely oxygen and nitrogen give lightning a whitishblue colour  like st elmos fire altering these conditions so electricity passes through a gas such as neon changes the colour to a redorangey shade which is the principle on which neon lights and signs are built to achieve different colours different gases such as mercury and helium are used to fill the tube long before we learned how to manipulate electricity to create different coloured signs we were battling with how to create visible useful electricity and it began with the use of arcs the architecture of electric arcs electric arcs occur when an electric current bridges an air gap while air is an insulator electricitys constant attempts to conduct to earth sometimes enable it to find paths through it ionising the air molecules and creating a visible plasma bridge along the way the higher the voltage the greater the distance it can arc between electrodes this property of electricity presents dangers such as arc flashes which can occur during electrical faults or short circuit conditions and expel huge amounts of energy sometimes creating temperatures as high as 35000 degrees fahrenheit  hotter than the suns surface when controlled electrical arcs can be very useful these bright glowing bridges were used in the first practical electric lights after humphry davy began showcasing the technology in the early 19 th century but the need to replace carbon electrodes frequently their buzzing sound and the resultant carbon monoxide emissions meant the technology was soon replaced with the incandescent bulb today arcing is used in welding and in more sophisticated plasma cutting which focuses a concentrated jet of hot plasma and can make highly precise cuts while arc furnaces are used in industrial conditions such as steel making in fact some thought has even gone into how we could use an incredibly powerful beam of plasma to create a working lightsabre and although compelling the theory of creating this super advanced star wars technology is far from being a practical possibility in the 14 th century seeing electricity was a rare and positive omen today seeing electricity has become far more common yet when it does happen  through plasma spheres neon lighting or naturally occurring lightning  the effect is the same human wonder at seeing an aweinspiring and seldomseen force tags electricity  technology why does electricity have a sound 11 april 2018 electrification on cold misty mornings the powerlines pylons and transformers that make up great britains electricity system sometimes sound a little different stand in a field under a powerline and in the right conditions the usual sounds of the countryside might be interrupted by the crackling of electricity this buzzing crackle which can be referred to as a corona discharge occurs when theres a change from the normal conditions of a power lines insulators enabling the electric current to partially conduct along it or through the surrounding air to earth this can come as a result of weather conditions or deterioration of the insulators its just one of the instances where electricity changes from an unseen force powering our lights and devices to something we can hear see and even smell why can we hear electricity the source of electricitys sound is also determined by one of its inherent properties frequency  frequency is the measurement of multiple occurrences from events such as sound waves from vibrations over a period of time any equipment that has a frequency causing mechanical parts to undergo repeated change can be audible for example if we hit a cymbal with a drumstick we can hear a crash because of the frequency of the vibrations the mechanical part in this case the cymbal makes we hear a guitar because its strings are plucked and pulled to create vibration at different frequencies and we can hear an audible hum in a transformer because electric currents affect its internal structure and cause vibrations the buzzy tone this creates can be referred to as mains hum and is ever present although not always perceptible to the human ear it becomes audible however when electricity specifically alternating current  ac is applied to a transformer transformers are made of lengths of copper or aluminium which are wound around a steel laminated core when ac is applied it magnetises the core and causes steel laminations in the transformer to expand and contract in a process known as magnetostriction although only small physical changes these movements are enough to cause vibration which in turn creates an audible hum the crackling overhead with more than 7200 km of overhead powerlines humming away constantly around the country corona discharges are inevitable and common this happens when part of the insulators on a highvoltage line begins to deteriorate is exposed to weather conditions is damaged or contaminated allowing electricity to partially flow along it the surrounding air becomes electrically charged through a process known as ionisation and causes molecules to become charged and collide its these collisions in the air that make the corona audible it can also be visible and gives off a distinct smell of ozone the gas produced when air is ionised although not dangerous to someone on the ground below if the insulator on the powerline is left to deteriorate further it can fail completely leading to earth faults that trip power systems making use of electric hums the sounds electricity creates may seem like a nuisance but they can also have important uses one of the most innovative applications is in forensic analysis a technique called electric network frequency enf enables forensic scientists to validate audio recording by observing the frequency of the mains hum picked up by audio recordings which is not audible to humans by comparing the frequency of the hum in a recording to a database of the countrys frequencies at given times its possible to verify when and in which country the recording took place and detect any editing it highlights not only an innovative use of electricity but just how pervasive and consistent a presence it is so while the ebb and flow of electricity through our lives often goes on without thought it is always there humming away while it powers modern life in great britain can you hear this httpstcoroslxjqsnh pictwittercomhqshlmovgg  drax draxgroup april 23 2018 tags electricity  technology  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  name
