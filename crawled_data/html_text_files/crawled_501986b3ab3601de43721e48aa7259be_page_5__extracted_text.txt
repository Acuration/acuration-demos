the us south  carried out by supply chain consultancy forest2market and commissioned by drax group the national alliance of forest owners and the us endowment for forestry and communities  found that over the last 60 years as demand for forestry products has increased the productivity of the areas forests has increased too in short the more weve come to use them the more forests have grown a forest is not like a mine  there is not a finite amount of wood in the ground that disappears when it is extracted never to return forests are a renewable resource that can be replanted improved and harvested for as long as the land is managed responsibly whats more landowners have a strong financial incentive to not only maintain their holdings but to improve their productivity  after all the more of something you have the more of it you have to sell it is an economic incentive that works six decades of growth the forest2market report found that increased demand for wood is statistically correlated with more annual tree growth more wood volume available in the forest and more timberland for example between 1953 and 2015 tree harvests increased by 57 largely driven by us economic growth and increased construction over the same period annual wood growth increased by 112 and inventory increased by 108 in total annual growth exceeded annual removals by 38 on average annual forest growth in the us south increased from 193 million cubic metres in 1953 to 408 million cubic metres in 2015 inventory increased from 4 billion to 84 billion cubic metres the forest products industry funded privatepublic research projects to enhance the quality and performance of seedlings and forest management practices to ensure a stable supply of wood because of these efforts landowners saw the value of active management techniques changing their approach to site preparation fertilization weed control and thinning  and the use of improved planting stock healthy demand made it easy for landowners to take a longterm view investing in more expensive management practices up front for greater returns in the future and the results were extraordinary seedlings established in the last 20 years have helped plantations to become nearly four times as productive as they were 50 years ago a changing market markets for wood have changed over the last two decades precipitated by decreased demand for writing paper and newsprint increased demand for absorbent hygiene products and containerboard and increased demand for biomass these changes in demand have not impacted the way that landowners manage timberland however as sawtimber the largest trees in the forest remains the most valuable timber crop it also remains the crop the landowners want to grow  pulpwood is harvested from the forest only when the forest is being thinned to create optimal conditions for growing sawtimber or when sawtimber is harvested and the forest is being cleared for replanting pellet production has expanded rapidly in the us south though its overall footprint is still small in comparison to more traditional forest product industries in some local wood basins however like the one surrounding bastrop louisiana the location of one of draxs us production facilities the use of biomass to create pellets has filled a gap left by the closure of an 80year old paper mill  draxs decision to locate in this area is integral to supporting forest industry jobs and landowners who carefully consider local demand when deciding whether to continue growing trees according to tracy leslie director of forest2market s biomaterials and sustainability practice as history has shown forests in the us south have benefitted from increased demand for all types of wood the rise of the pulp and paper industry did not detract from landowner objectives to maximize production of higher value sawtimber nor did it result in a shift in focus to growing only pulpwood this new demand did however provide landowners with important interim and supplemental sources of income forest2markets research shows that an increase in demand for pellets will have the same effect incentivizing landowners to grow and regrow forests increasing both forest inventory and carbon storage the real threat to forests not only does demand for forest products increase the productivity and carbon storage of forests and provide an incentive for landowners to continue growing trees but it also helps counter factors that irrevocably destroy this natural resource the real threat to forests in the us is not demand for wood but urbanisation nearly half of all us forestland that converted to another use between 1982 and 2012 was cleared for urban development commercial forestry protects forested lands from development between 1989 and 1999 just 1 of managed pine plantations in the us south were cleared for nonforest development compared to 3 of naturallyregenerated forest types urbanisation not the forest products industry places the most pressure on forests in the us south forest2markets findings demonstrate that demand associated with healthy timber markets promotes the productivity of forests and mitigates forest loss by encouraging landowners to continue to grow harvest and regenerate trees read the full report historical perspective on the relationship between demand and forest

science behind keeping soil healthy 27 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy read here tags biomass energy  forests this is how you unload a wood chip truck 30 june 2017 sustainable bioenergy a truck arrives at an industrial facility deep in the expanding forestland of the southeastern usa it passes through a set of gates over a massive scale then onto a metal platform the driver steps out and pushes a button on a nearby console slowly the platform beneath the truck tilts and rises as it does the trucks cargo empties into a large container behind it two minutes later its empty this is how you unload a wood fuel truck at drax biomass compressed wood pellet plants in louisiana and mississippi  what is a tipper some people call them truck dumpers but it depends on who you talk to says jim stemple senior director of procurement at drax biomass we just call it the tipper regardless of what its called what the tipper does is easy to explain it lifts trucks and uses the power of gravity to empty them quickly and efficiently the sight of a truck being lifted into the air might be a rare one across the atlantic however at industrial facilities in the united states its more common tippers are used to unload trucks carrying cargo such as corn grain and gravel stemple explains basically anything that can be unloaded just by tipping both of drax biomass two operational pellet facilities a third is currently idle while being upgraded use tippers to unload the daily deliveries of bark  known in the forestry industry as hog fuel which is used to heat the plants wood chip dryers  sawdust and raw wood chips which are used to make the compressed wood pellets  how does it work the tipper uses hydraulic pistons to lift the truck platform at one end while the truck itself rests against a reinforced barrier at the other to ensure safety each vehicle must be reinforced at the very end where the load is emptying from so they can hold the weight of the truck above it as it tips each tipper can lift up to 60 tonnes and can accommodate vehicles over 50 feet long once tipped far enough each platform tips to a roughly 60degree angle the renewable fuel begins to unload and a diverter guides it to one of two places depending on what it will be used for one way takes it to the chip and sawdust piles  which then goes through the pelleting process of the hammer mills the dryer and the pellet mill says stemple the other way takes it to the fuel pile which goes to the furnace the furnace heats the dryer which ensures wood chips have a moisture level between 115 and 12 before they go through the pelleting process if everything goes right you can tip four to five trucks an hour says stemple from full and tipping to empty and exiting takes only a few minutes before the trucks are on the road to pick up another load efficiency benefits using the power of gravity to unload a truck might seem a rudimentary approach but its also an efficient one firstly theres the speed it allows multiple trucks can arrive and unload every hour and because cargo is delivered straight into the system theres no time lost between unloading the wood from truck to container to system secondly for the truck owners the benefits are they dont need to carry out costly hydraulic maintenance on their trucks instead its just the tipper  one piece of equipment  which is maintained to keep operations on track however there is one thing drivers need to be wary of what they leave in their driver cabins open coffee cups food containers  anything not firmly secured  all quickly become potential hazards once the tipper comes into play i guess leaving something like that in the cab only happens once stemple says the first time a trucker has to clean out a mess from his cab is probably the last time tags biomass energy  investors  technology  transport  wood pellets how space tech helps forests 20 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy can you count the number of trees in the world accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than just a clearer view on what is happening it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening and its with this information that real differences in our future can be made tags biomass energy  forests  investors  sustainability  technology 4 amazing uses of bioenergy 5 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy bioenergy is the worlds largest renewable energy source providing 10 of the worlds primary supply  but more than just being a plentiful energy source it can and should be a sustainable one and because of this its also a focus for innovation biomass currently powers 48 of great britains electricity through its use at drax power station

type of bioenergy algae and microscopic animals hows it being used to power two aquatic robots with mouths stomachs and an animaltype metabolism designed at the university of bristol the 30cm rowbot is modelled on the water boatman insect the other which is smaller closer resembles a tadpole and moves with the help of its tail both are powered by microbial fuel cells  fuel cells that use the activity of bacteria to generate electricity  developed at the university of the west of england in bristol as they swim the robots swallow water containing algae and microscopic animals which is then used by their fuel cell stomachs to generate electricity and recharge the robots batteries once recharged they row or swim to a new location to look for another mouthful is there a future its hoped that within five years the rowbot will be used to help clean up oil spills and pollutants such as harmful algal bloom  there are plans to reduce the tadpole bot to 01mm so that huge shoals of them can be dispatched to work together to tackle outbreaks of pollutants purifying water whats used human waste hows it being used the omni processor  a low cost waste treatment plant funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation  does something incredible it turns sewage into fresh water and electricity it does this by heating human waste to produce water vapour which is then condensed to form water this water is passed through a purification system making it safe for human consumption best of all it does this while powering itself the solid sludge left over by the evaporated sewage is siphoned off and burnt in a steam engine to produce enough electricity to process the next batch of waste is there a future the first omni processor was manufactured by janicki bioenergy in 2013 and has been operating in dakar senegal since may 2015 a second processor which doubles the capacity of the first is currently operating in sedrowoolley washington us and is expected to be shipped to west africa during 2017 closer to home and drax power station a similar project is already underway northumbrian water was the first in the uk to use its sludge to produce renewable power but unlike the omni processor it uses anaerobic digestion to capture the methane and carbon dioxide released by bacteria in sludge to drive its gas turbines and generate power any excess gas generated is delivered back to the grid resulting in a total saving in the utility companys carbon footprint of around 20 and also multimillions of pounds of savings in operating costs flying across the atlantic whats used tobacco hows it being used most tobacco is grown with a few factors in mind  taste and nicotine content being the most important but two of the 80 acres of tobacco grown at briar view farms in callands virginia us are used to grow tobacco of a very different sort this tobacco can power aeroplanes  us biofuel company tyton bioenergy systems is experimenting with varieties of tobacco dropped decades ago by traditional growers because of poor flavour or low nicotine content the lownicotine varieties need little maintenance are inexpensive to grow and flourish where other crops would fail the company is turning this tobacco into sustainable biofuel and last year filed a patent for converting oil extracted from plant biomass into jet fuel is there a future in the hope of creating a promising source of renewable fuel scientists are pioneering selective breeding techniques and genetic engineering to increase tobaccos sugar and seed oil content in 2013 the us department of energy gave a 48m grant to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  in partnership with uc berkeley and the university of kentucky to research the potential of tobacco as a biofuel powering repopulation of a disaster zone whats used wood exposed to radiation by the fukushima nuclear meltdowns hows it being used last year it was announced that german energy company entrade energiesysteme ag will set up biomass power generators in the fukushima prefecture that will generate electricity using the lightly irradiated wood of the area its hoped they will help japans attempts to repopulate the region following the 2011 earthquake tsunami and nuclear accident entrade says its plants can reduce the mass of lightly irradiated wood waste by 995 which could help japanese authorities reduce the amount of contaminated material while at the same time generating sustainable energy is there a future the prefecture aims to generate all its power from renewable energy by 2040 through a mix of bioenergy and solar power  tags biomass energy  investors  sustainability  technology sustainability certified 24 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy of all the changes to drax power station over the last decade perhaps the biggest is one you cant see since converting three of its six generating units from coal to run primarily on compressed wood pellets  drax has reduced those units greenhouse gas ghg emissions by over 80  and while this is a huge improvement it would mean nothing if the biomass with which those reductions are achieved isnt sustainably sourced  for this reason drax works with internationallyrecognised certification programmes that ensure suppliers manage their forests according to environmental social and economic criteria thanks to these certification programmes drax can be confident it is not only reducing ghg emissions but supporting responsible forestry from wherever wood fibre is sourced sustainability certifications the compressed wood pellets used at drax power station come from various locations around the world so drax relies on a number of different forest certification programmes the three main ones being the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council  fsc   1 and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc the programmes share a common goal of demonstrating responsible forest management but adoption rates vary by region european landowners and regulators are most familiar with the fsc and national pefc standards while north american landowners generally prefer sfi and american tree farm system also members of the pefc family in instances in which drax sources wood pellets carrying these certifications or in instances in which drax purchase pellets sourced from certified forests these certifications offer an additional degree of assurance that the pellets are sustainable over 50 of the pellets used at drax power station come from the southern usa  where sfi and american tree farm system are the most widely implemented certification programmes overall adoption levels in this region are relatively modest however the sfi offers an additional level of certification that can be implemented by woodprocuring entities such as sawmills pulp mills and pellet mills this programme is referred to as sfi fiber sourcing and to obtain it participants must demonstrate that the raw material in their supply chains come from legal and responsible sources these sources may or may not include certified forests the programme also includes requirements related to biodiversity water quality landowner outreach and use of forest management and harvesting professionals together these certification systems have long contributed to the improvement of forest management practices in a region that provides drax with a significant proportion of its pellets and since the sfi and atfs programmes are endorsed by pefc north american suppliers have a pathway for their regions sustainable forest management practices to be recognised by european stakeholders these certification programmes have been in use for many years but with recent growth in the market for wood pellets a new certification system has emerged to deal specifically with woody biomass new kid on the block the sustainable biomass program sbp was set up in 2013 as a certification system to provide assurance that woody biomass is sourced from legal and sustainable sources but rather than replacing any previous forest certification programmes it builds on them for example sbp recognises the evidence of sustainable forest management practices gathered under these other programmes however the pefc sfi and fsc programmes do not include requirements for reporting ghg emissions a critical gap for biomass generators as they are obligated to report these emissions to european regulators sbp fills this gap by creating a framework for suppliers to report their emissions to the generators that purchase their pellets when a new entity such as a wood pellet manufacturer first seeks certification under sbp that entity is required to assess its supply base feedstock which has already been certified by another established certification programme sfi fsc   pefc or pefc approved schemes is considered sbpcompliant all other feedstock must be evaluated against sbp criteria and the wood pellet manufacturer must carry out a risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance against each of the 38 sbp indicators if during the process a specific risk is identified for example to the forest ecosystem the wood pellet manufacturer must put in place mitigation measures to manage the risk such that it can be considered to be effectively controlled or excluded these assessments are audited by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee in conducting the risk assessment the wood pellet manufacturer must consult with a range of stakeholders and provide a public summary of the assessment for transparency purposes sustainable energy for the uk counting major energy companies including dong energy eon and drax as members the sbp has quickly become an authoritative voice in the industry at the end of 2016 the sbp had 74 certificate holders across 14 countries  including draxs pellet manufacturing arm drax biomass  in mississippi and louisiana its a positive step towards providing the right level of certification for woody biomass and together with the existing forestry certifications it provides drax with the assurance that it is powering the uk using biomass from legal and sustainable sources like the fastreducing carbon dioxide emissions of britains power generation sector  its a change you cant see but one that is making a big difference read the drax principles for sustainable sourcing  1 drax power ltd fsc license code fsc  c119787 tags biomass energy  energy policy  sustainability  sustainable biomass program sbp forests are more powerful than you think  heres why 21 march 2017 sustainable bioenergy almost one third of the earths land mass is covered by forests thats an area of around 4 billion hectares or roughly four times the size of the us in addition to being a prominent feature across the global landscape forests also play a significant role in how we live they make the air cleaner in cities and absorb carbon from the atmosphere they provide biodiversity and habits for wildlife they also provide essential forest products such as paper building materials and wood pellets for energy to celebrate the uns international day of forests  were looking at some of the reasons why forests and wood fuel are more powerful than you might think theyre a major source of renewable energy nearly half of the worlds renewable energy comes from forests in the form of wood fuel roughly 24 billion people around the world use it for things like cooking heating and generating electricity in fact about 50 of the total global wood production is currently used for these purposes however it is critical that this resource is managed sustainably and responsibly  one of the key aims of the international day of forests is to encourage people to utilise their local forest resources sustainably to ensure it endures for future generations they can revitalise economies because wood fuel is such a widely used energy source it also supports a healthy vibrant industry roughly 900 million people work in the wood energy sector globally  more than that rural economies built on wood energy can be revitalised by modernisation which can then stimulate local business  investment can help finance better forest management which in turn leads to forest growth improvements in sustainability standards and in some cases increased employment they can help mitigate climate change the worlds forests have an energy content about 10 times that of the global annual primary energy consumption which makes it a hugely useful resource in helping meet energy demand in a sustainable and renewable way when wood is used as fuel it releases carbon dioxide co 2  however if this fuel is drawn from a responsibly managed forest or sustainable system of growing forests this carbon is offset by new tree plantings the only emissions produced therefore are the ones involved in transporting the wood itself the us food and agriculture organization predict that by 2030 forestry mitigation with the help of carbon pricing could contribute to reductions of 02 to 138 gigatonnes gt co 2 a year  tags biomass energy  forests  sustainability building a 21st century port 16 november 2016 sustainable bioenergy in its long history the port of liverpool has dealt with a number of industries its a port characterised by its ability to adapt to the needs of the time in 1715 it emerged as one of the worlds first ever wet docks in the 18 th century it was used as a hub for the slave trade when slavery was abolished in the early 19th century liverpool switched to bringing in the goods of the thriving empire such as cotton when goods like cotton dried up it switched to the fuel of the industrial revolution coal now as the world and the uk government moves away from fuels like coal and towards lowercarbon and renewable resources the port of liverpool needed to adapt once again gary hodgson chief operating officer at peel ports  explains about three years ago everyone was asking what happens after coal what happens after coal peel ports is one of the biggest operators of liverpools shipping infrastructure including liverpool port seeing that the future of coal was finite it recognised there was a need for a port that could bring in alternative renewable fuels at the same time drax was looking for a logistics partner to facilitate the importing of compressed wood pellets since 2009 drax power station had begun a process of upgrading its coalfired boilers to run on sustainable biomass sourced from huge wellestablished working forests  more than this it had plans to set up its own pellet manufacturing plants in the us south and needed to import large quantities of wood pellets the relationship with peel ports and liverpool was obvious this began a 100 million investment that helped transform the regions portstation transport infrastructure its about working in partnerships with companies says hodgson working this way helps develop solutions that really work the central element of the partnership between drax and peel ports was a radical redesigning of the technical infrastructure not only do compressed wood pellets have fundamentally different physical properties to other fuels like coal they are more combustible and need to be handled safely for the threemilliontonnecapacity facility that peel ports and drax wanted to build innovative supply chain solutions had to be developed shifting biomass in bulk the first challenge was getting the highdensity pellets off giant ships for this peel and drax designed a solution that uses an archimedean screw  a long tube with a spiral winding up the inside that allows liquids or materials that can behave like a liquid like wood pellets to defy gravity and travel upwards at the top of the screw the pellets are emptied onto a conveyor belt and carried to one of three purposebuilt silos tailored to safely storing thousands of tonnes of biomass  here the pellets wait until another conveyor belt deposits them onto speciallydesign biomass trains where they are transported across the peaks of the pennines to drax power station near selby in north yorkshire each step at the port is automated designed with supreme efficiency in mind by a team of drax and peel port engineers endtoend port to power station the whole process can take as little as 12 hours a new chapter for the north in the varied history of the port of liverpool the new facility is another chapter one that is helping transform the logistics infrastructure and the economic growth of the north west now open and operational the facility directly employs 50 people  around 500 additional contractors have worked on the project during its construction and development more than that its an investment in the countrys energy future it secures a fourth port for drax  three others are on the east coast  helping with security of supply we made this investment because we recognised this as the future of the energy mix of the country hodgson explain we cant just rely on one form of power  there has to be an energy mix and we see biomass as a key part of that tags biomass energy  ships and shipping  supply chain  sustainability how one company helped transform the biomass business 6 october 2016 sustainable bioenergy if asked to picture canada its beautiful forests often spring to mind in fact 38 of the country is covered by them little wonder that canada has one of the worlds biggest lumber industries but all that lumber milling means a lot of sawdust it was in this sawdust and the other waste products the milling process creates that one fledgling canadian company spotted an opportunity making the most of waste started by two brothers in the 1980s pinnacle originally made animal feed for farmers  compressed pellets of grass and grain then in the late eighties after hearing about wood pellet production in scandinavia and taking a look at all the sawmilling residues being burned up around them they had an idea for a new direction at the time the canadian government was looking to make the sawmilling industry a lot cleaner and more sustainable there was a lot of fibre around that needed to find a home explains vaughan bassett a senior executive with the company canada needed a way to put to good use materials that were previously just thrown away or even burnt out in the open releasing greenhouse gas emissions and wood pellets seemed like a natural fit even better because there was so much waste fibre around at the time pinnacle was able to get its raw material for free and help to avoid the unnecessary emissions all it had to do was pick it up and take it away finding a new business model making the transition from feed pellets to wood pellets involved a lot of trial and error there was a lot of entrepreneurial spirit that went into this thing says bassett it was untried untested unknown and there was no real market it was just a couple of entrepreneurs trying stuff out initially pinnacle produced its wood pellets for local domestic markets  people looking to heat their homes local businesses and schools that used wood burners this is a particularly convenient and efficient form of fuel for communities in offthegrid remote areas of canada but pinnacle was keen to grow and make an even greater impact rising demand for sustainability by the early 2000s some in the power generation industry were starting to rethink their longterm futures looking to shift from fossil fuels like coal to cleaner alternatives in order to meet the challenges of sustainable energy production central to pinnacles business is a commitment to sustainability  something being based in canada where forest management is particularly advanced makes possible being owned by the crown there are very tight controls over how canadian forests are run  and how the trees are used weve probably got the most sustainable wood fibre in the world the numbers are just mad something like 95 of all the forests in canada are forest management certified which is unbelievable look at the next best country and its probably nearer 30 says bassett its left us with an incredible asset that keeps growing every year the industry never takes more wood than what grows indeed carefully managed forestry is key to environmental sustainability fullygrown older trees dont absorb as much co 2  so replacing them with younger growing trees that do can benefit the environment meanwhile the waste product of sawmilling is converted into biomass which produces further benefits by reducing reliance on fossil fuels pinnacle and drax a sustainable partnership pinnacle first started supplying drax with compressed wood pellets in 2009 marking a turningpoint for the company since 2011 our production has doubled says bassett pinnacle now contracts a fleet of ships and has its own dedicated port facility each vessel can transport 60000 tonnes given that drax uses around 16000 tonnes a day with two of its three biomass units at full capacity one shipment keeps a third of the huge power station in north yorkshire going for nearly four days pinnacle now produces in the region of 15m tonnes of pellets a year about half of which goes to drax so theyre a very important part of what we do says
