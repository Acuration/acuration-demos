of drax group i send my deepest condolences to the royal family at this incredibly difficult time the queens dedication to public service both in the uk and across the commonwealth ensured that she was loved and respected by the global community and through the good times and the bad she provided the inspirational leadership that we all need from a head of state some of the people living in the community near our cruachan power station in argyll scotland will no doubt fondly recall when the queen visited in 1965 to formally open the site as the world enters a period of mourning her majesty queen elizabeth ii will be remembered with great admiration and affection drax progresses plans to upgrade existing cruachan power station press releases the project which is separate from the companys proposals to build a brandnew underground power station at the site could see two of the existing generating units upgraded increasing their generating capacity by a total of 40mw so they could power around 80000 more homes  equivalent to a town the size of paisley the work would increase the output of two of the stations existing units from 100mw to 120mw each by utilising new design capability in pumped storage turbines whilst maximising water cycle efficiency local people will have the opportunity to learn more about the proposals during an exhibition at taynuilt village hall on wednesday 14 th september 2pm  630pm when members of the project team will be on hand to answer questions and discuss the plans ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director said  ian kinnaird draxs scottish assets director standing infront of a generating unit at cruachan for more than half a century cruachan has played a pivotal role in balancing the grid and keeping the lights on across the uk by investing in this 40mw upgrade alongside the creation of a new 600mw power station at the site draxs cruachan pumped storage hydro power station would continue to play a vital role in bolstering the countrys energy security for many years to come we are keen to hear from as many people as possible during the consultation event in taynuilt so we encourage local people to come along cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built inside a hollowedout cavern 1km inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain its reversible turbines enable the plant to act like a giant water battery by pumping water from loch awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid the stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases this process helps stop wind farms being paid to turn off when they are generating excess power helping the country to decarbonise whilst cutting household energy bills in order to carry out the 40mw upgrade on the two existing generating units at cruachan drax must secure consent under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 from the scottish government this process is expected to take around one year to complete from the applications submission if planning permission is granted work to upgrade the existing two turbines could commence in 2026 the 40mw upgrade to the existing plant involves replacing existing turbines and generators and will not require excavation or blasting works ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected

demand variations caused by daily peaks weather events and seasonal patterns providing power for more than four hours at their full capacity a recent report by aurora showed that the uk may need an eightfold increase in longduration electricity storage capacity by 2035 separately a report by lcp published earlier this year showed the practice of curtailing wind power  which ldes technologies

atmosphere every year whilst also generating the reliable renewable electricity the country needs they also met two of draxs leading experts dr cat reynolds beccs strategy  engagement senior manager and michael goldsworthy head of climate change  carbon strategy on how the company has transformed to become the uks biggest producer of renewable electricity and plans to go even further by deploying beccs dr cat reynolds said it was great to have the students from the university of oxford here at drax the subject matter of their course is extremely relevant to us and reflects what drax is trying to achieve in moving towards becoming a carbon negative company and developing an environmentally and economically sustainable business model for beccs i hope the tour helped them get a better understanding of the cutting edge technologies were pioneering at drax and the decisionmaking challenges that businesses at the forefront of addressing the climate crisis face the students asked some fantastic questions which show they are ready to put their studies into practice as they move on from academia and into business roles during the tour the group were shown how renewable electricity is generated and how sustainable wood pellets have enabled drax to reduce its carbon emissions by 95 in a decade making it europes biggest decarbonisation project they saw the 427metre turbine hall that houses the huge turbines which power the generators to produce electricity as well as the wood pellet storage domes  each large enough to fit the royal albert hall inside and the 115m high cooling towers which are taller than the statue of liberty dr laurence wainwright course director msc in sustainability enterprise and the environment said the inaugural cohort of the msc in sustainability enterprise and the environment at the university of oxford were thrilled to visit the drax biomass power station in selby the new course addresses two pervasive and unmet challenges of our time making the transition to a zerocarbon and environmentally sustainable economic model whilst simultaneously enabling sustainable development for all touring the power station and hearing from their top scientists enabled students to better understand the challenges and opportunities involved in the transition to net zero particularly in terms of understanding the nuances and operational realities that often arent visible from a lecture theatre the students greatly enjoyed and benefitted from the visit ends photo caption university of oxford students in front of draxs biomass domes media

activities introducing them to future skills training and employment opportunities its important for innovative companies like drax to work with schools and colleges to engage with and inspire the next generation because they will eventually become our workforce of the future a group of draxs graduate engineers and analysts delivered an its all about energy session where students explored and debated the pros and cons of new energy technologies jane breach drax visitor centre and community engagement team leader who organised the activities said it was great to see everyone enjoying the activities and using their problemsolving and analytical thinking skills it builds on what theyve already learnt in their school curriculum and gives them an insight in the wide range of applications for stem subjects students also had the opportunity to try out virtual reality headsets use electromagnetics and have a go at coding in sessions run by selby college tutors they also spent time in the colleges stateoftheart institute of technology laboratory where they were able to see firsthand how an automated manufacturing line works lorraine cross group executive director of external relations  development at the heart of yorkshire education group said encouraging young people to excel in stem subjects is high on our agenda so its fantastic that we are able to work with leading employers like drax to facilitate events such as this they give students a unique opportunity to further explore stem subjects and the career options and opportunities which they can open doors too at a crucial stage in their learning we hope the students enjoyed the event and left feeling inspired to pursue their progression in stem areas in march 2022 selby college officially merged with wakefield college to form the heart of yorkshire education group as part of its school partnership programme the group works with local schools employers and learning providers to transform learning raise attainment and achievement and encourage progression across the region in 2020 drax announced a 180000 fiveyear partnership with selby college aimed at supporting education and skills last year selby college and

accepted draxs application for a development consent order for its uk beccs project in june and will examine the plans before making a recommendation to the secretary of state with a final decision expected next year the world leading climate scientists at the uns ipcc say beccs is a vital negative emissions technology required globally to reach the climate targets set out in the parish climate accord in 2015 negative emissions technologies are essential because they can permanently remove the co 2 accumulating in the atmosphere which is causing temperatures to rise once up and running draxs co 2 from draxs beccs units would be transported via pipeline to the endurance storage site under the north sea this part of the process is being developed and by the northern endurance partnership  drax is part of the east coast cluster a partnership between zero carbon humber and net zero teesside the east coast cluster was selected by the uk government to be one of two priority industrial clusters to progress plans for carbon capture in the 2020s the humber and teesside account for more than half the uks industrial emissions so decarbonising these regions would have a major impact on
