power station budding engineers wanted at iconic hollow mountain power station five apprentice engineers at scottish sites including one at cruachan power station in argyll and bute are being recruited 14 august 2019 drax wants to hear from budding engineers in the argyll and bute area interested in an exciting vacancy for an apprentice engineer role at one of its most iconic power stations the uks biggest renewable power generator acquired a portfolio of generation assets in scotland at the beginning of this year and has reinstated an apprenticeship scheme as part of its efforts to support education and learning and encourage science technology engineering and maths stem subjects it is appointing five apprentice engineers at its scottish sites including one at cruachan power station in argyll and bute this is the final call for applicants to get in touch for the role at the pumped storage hydro power station also known as the hollow mountain as a result of the feat of engineering required to bury its turbines within the stunning ben cruachan mountain andy koss ceo generation said at our power station in selby north yorkshire we understand that attracting ambitious apprentices to learn from our world class engineers is helping us to retain and develop a skilled workforce for the future and we want to do the same at our scottish sites  including at cruachan the opportunity at cruachan really is a plum role  the successful candidate will get to work with a fantastic team of engineers on some exciting engineering challenges at what is one of the most fascinating power stations in the world i encourage anyone thinking about a career in engineering to get in touch draxs apprenticeship scheme has been running for over fifteen years at the selby plant but since the acquisition of a portfolio of thermal and hydro assets it has started to expand the scheme across the other sites including at cruachan andy koss ceo generation at drax added ever since we started our apprenticeship programme over fifteen years ago weve seen the value that these ambitious young people bring to our business were excited to now be recruiting apprentices across our expanded portfolio including at cruachan which plays a critical role in not only our business but also across the wider electricity system well continue to support young people from our local communities to help build a sustainable workforce with the right skills at all levels the drax apprenticeship training scheme is a fouryear programme and specialises in three engineering disciplines mechanical electrical and control  instrumentation drax offers apprenticeships in engineering disciplines as well as business support areas such as finance and business administration all opportunities are advertised on our website  ends media contacts ali lewis drax group head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 joshua atkins drax group press officer e email protected t 07970256355 editors notes draxs technical apprenticeship scheme gives apprentices the opportunity to learn a new trade and begin their career in engineering at one of the uks leading energy companies cruachan has been operating since 1965 as the uk deploys evergrowing volumes of renewable power the dispatchable power and electricity storage which cruachan provides is increasingly important and valuable the cruachan apprenticeship follows draxs support of the oban high school careers fair and local work experience opportunities in january drax group completed the acquisition of a portfolio of renewable lowcarbon and flexible power stations in strategic locations across the country  from scotland to the south east coast drax power station in north yorkshire is the uks largest power station and the countrys biggest renewable electricity generator since converting two thirds of the power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it is producing enough renewable electricity for four million households and delivering carbon savings of more than 80 if drax is able to scale up its successful bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs pilot project to become the worlds first negative emissions power station it would be reducing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the same time as producing flexible renewable power and supporting grid stability about drax drax groups ambition is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future its 2600strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england for more
