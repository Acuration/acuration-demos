customers 3d to drive an energy revolution jonathan kini ceo customers 1 february 2019 opinion think of the phrase 3d and may people instantly think of video games television or cinema along with the special glasses you needed to watch it but another form of 3d is i believe going to be at the heart of the energy revolution which is rapidly gathering place the three ds in this case are data diversification and decarbonisation together they will transform the way businesses buy use and sell their energy help companies take control of their energy use and save money and also play a key part in our journey towards a zero carbon lower cost energy future were already seeing some real innovations in the energy sector our trial of a storage battery with a customer of opus energy is an example offering a farming business in northampton the chance to sell stored energy generated by solar panels back to the grid at times of peak demand  a potential new revenue stream but other innovations and advances will maintain the pace of change and data will be at the core of this now the new generation of smart meters are being installed in businesses  revolutionising customer relationships with their energy suppliers the data from the new meters will finally give customers insight into where and when they use energy suppliers will have to work much more closely with customers to help them access new opportunities for cost savings access to new markets and even new revenue streams an example would be a restaurant with the data smart meters will provide the restaurants supplier will be able to tell the owners how their energy use compares to the local competition and where improvements can be made the detail could go as far as identifying whether the restaurants equipment is older and less efficient whether rivals have installed newer kit or whether other businesses are switching off their equipment earlier or using it at different cheaper times using energy during the peak weekday morning and early evening hours is often the most expensive time to do so data will give businesses the insight into how they can use energy more efficiently and when they use it offering them the chance to avoid buying at peak times whenever possible and driving efficiencies this is why haven powers trading team is now working closely with gridbeyond  the partnership allows our customers to trade the power they produce as well as optimise their operations to help balance the grid at times of peak demand the really smart thing is that in doing so customers are reducing their energy costs and making their operations more sustainable trading desks at haven powers ipswich hq the way demand changes and is managed by businesses and consumers on a diversified power system will also be key the business energy sector is already diversifying as many customers are able to generate and store their own power but the next step is for more customers to be paid to reduce their usage at peak times think of a busy time for the national grid  half time in the fa cup final or after the results in strictly come dancing previously the grid would have to pay a power station to ramp up generation to meet demand but these days customers are paid to reduce demand for 30 minutes or so  in effect becoming a huge virtual power station  this has happened for some time of course with larger industrial customers but now smaller companies can benefit from this too thanks to the data and insight they will have from their smart meters this empowers customers and puts them not the energy companies in control of the key decisions about their energy a close advisory relationship between energy suppliers and their customers will become ever more important to make sure business can choose to avoid the high demand periods and maximises use during the lower cheaper times in fact i can see a time when customers will end up paying more for insight and advice than they do for the power they buy  and theyll save money overall in doing so and if we get all this right it will help drive one of the most important of the three ds  decarbonisation sustainability is increasingly becoming a primary focus for businesses and demand for renewable energy is growing because it is now costeffective that will help us in our drive towards a zero carbon future as more and more renewable energy comes onstream though the uk will continue to need power generated from more flexible assets as well so there are huge opportunities out there to transform our energy landscape but they have to be viewed positively the smart metering programme can be viewed as a regulatory burden or it can be seen as an opportunity we take the positive view likewise batteries were once the preserve of massive companies only but now as technology develops they are becoming available for smaller firms too the more we can innovative on a larger scale the more the technology will work its way into smaller markets too adding momentum to the energy revolution the opportunities are huge if we get it right so too will be the benefits to one of the biggest priorities of all  the work to decarbonise the uk and create the lower carbon future we all want tags sustainability  technology  national grid  energy policy  customers  electricity  smart grid building a sustainable business will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 21 march 2018 opinion the uk energy sector is changing rapidly the boundaries between users suppliers and generators are blurring as energy users are choosing to generate their own energy and are managing their energy use more proactively while conversely generators are increasingly seeing users as potential sources of generation and providers of demand management the uk is undergoing an unprecedented energy revolution with electricity at its heart  a transition to a lowcarbon society requiring new energy solutions for power generation heating transport and the wider economy in that context our groups purpose is to help change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future this means that sustainability in its broadest sense must be at the very core of what we do successful delivery of our purpose depends on all our people across all our businesses doing the right thing every day with the right products and services we can go even further and help our customers make the right sustainable energy choices as our businesses transform and we embrace a larger customer base different generation technologies and operate internationally the range of sustainability issues we face is widening and becoming more complex at the same time the range of stakeholders looking to drax for responsible leadership on sustainability is increasing the need for transparency is greater than ever so our websites sustainability section provides a comprehensive insight into the groups environmental social and governance management and performance during 2017 some of the highlights include carbon reduction  i am pleased that in 2017 the proportion of our energy generation from renewable sources remained high 65 of our generation during the year came from sustainable biomass and accounted for 15 of the countrys overall renewable generation we maintained our rigorous and robust approach to ensure that we only ever use biomass that is sustainably produced and legally sourced people  another key achievement was the roll out of our people strategy to 2020  one drax  which focuses on talent to deliver on our strategic and operational objectives safety  the health and safety of all our employees and contractors is of paramount importance to drax while the groups safety incident rate remained on target in 2017 the fire at our biomass rail unloading facilities in december did cause an outage with disruption lasting into 2018 it highlighted once again that the risks of generating using biomass must be mitigated through robust safety procedures and a riskbased plant investment and maintenance programme safety therefore remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are determined to do even better customers  our business to business b2b energy supply business received recognition for their dedication to customer service opus energy won utilities provider of the year at the

means its easy to forget the incredible feats of science engineering and infrastructure that allow us to undertake a task as simple as plugging in our smartphones in fact so expansive are the nationwide infrastructure networks that lie beyond the wall socket keeping a topoftherange mobile phone charged for a year can cost as much as 67p to work out how much electricity an appliance uses theres a relatively straightforward equation we can follow of power kilowatt kw x time hours used  energy transferred kilowatthour kwh to then work out how much that costs in real terms we need to take the wattage of the appliance worked out in kilowatts as this is the metric electricity tariffs are measured in multiply that by the number of hours it is being used for then multiply that figure kwh by your energy tariff  in the case of an iphone it works out like this a typical iphone charger is 5w 0005 kw  and a full charge from empty takes a maximum of three hours a conservative estimate the average electricity tariff in the uk is 15p per kwh which leads to an equation that looks like this 0005 x 3 x 015  000225 a day and if we assume that an iphone owner might fully charge their phone roughly 300 times a year the total annual sum amounts to a princely 675p theres no other way of looking at this  its a very low number but its important to think about this number in scale extrapolate it across the number of devices in the country and it grows significantly a 2016 study on uk smartphone owners suggests three quarters of all adults have smartphones which would put the country total somewhere in the region of 40 million per day thats 600 mwh of electricity needed to power their smartphones thats the equivalent of 200 mw of power generation or enough to power 565000 households for one hour how much electricity do my other appliances use unfortunately not all appliances are as modern efficient and cost effective as your average smartphone in fact when it comes to household appliances charging your apple iphone samsung sony or windows phone device is one of the least powerhungry activities you can undertake a bigger offender is your fridgefreezer but not because they need a lot of electricity to run instead it comes down to the fact it is plugged in and drawing power for a significant amount of time a fridge freezer is plugged in for 24 hours a day seven days a week and even though modern fridge freezers have good energy efficiency mechanisms to limit their usage they can very easily use 427 kwh a year leading to an annual cost of over 50 to put that into perspective heres how much your other household items cost per hour according to the same equation used earlier whats new as our homes workplaces and industries have become more energy efficient the country as a whole is using less power nowhere is this more evident than in our lighting  today the common led lightbulb uses just 17 of the power needed for an incandescent lightbulb of equivalent brightness the news has been full of stories about how much more power 4k tvs use compared to high definition tvs but because most of us buy a tv once every decade or so replacing your 2007 1080p full hd tv with the uks bestselling 4k model and watching it for an hour will actually use around 70 less power this continued trend towards efficiency has had a marked effect on the countrys use of power in march 2017 the government published its latest electricity demand data for the uk  showing the countrys power needs falling all the way through to 2020 but then something interesting happens from 2026 the forecast shows us beginning to use increasingly more power than we are due to in 2017 to the point where by 2035 were using more power than we are today  19 more why is this one possibility is electric cars in 2015 electric vehicles evs consumed 025 twh of power but thats set to grow significantly in its future energy scenarios report published in 2016 national grid projected evs will consume 19 twh in 2035 but it has already said it believes its projections might be understated  in short the ev revolution could drive demand far higher which leads to the question where is all of this extra power going to come from  understanding the smart home our future energy needs are not just going to be met by more electricity generation capacity  they will also be assisted by something closer to home with the introduction of smart meters  pinpointing the devices and appliances in our homes that use the most electricity will become more widespread more than this well be able to identify what time of day theyre using the most energy and when we might be able to turn them off with this information we can optimise our usage and save money and while cutting down your yearly phone charging budget from 67p to 50p might not sound like much if three quarters of the country are joining you those pennies can quickly add up tags investors  customers  energy prices  technology retooling for a postcoal future dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 6 december 2016 opinion the energy system in great britain is dramatically changing where it was once an industry dominated by coal  a predictable but dirty fuel now our power increasingly comes from renewables  this is a trend that will continue forcing more coal off the system drax has a role in this new future of renewable power we have already converted half of our power station in north yorkshire to run on renewable biomass  and now to support the needs of a system increasingly dominated by intermittent renewables like solar and wind we are developing plans to build four new stateoftheart flexible power stations  two in england and two in wales each will be 299 mw in size and powered by gas two of them could be producing electricity by 2020 its the next step for us in helping change the way energy is generated for a better future supporting a renewable energy mix wind and solar accounted for 15 of britains electricity mix between july and september from an installed capacity that has increased six fold in just six years biomass generation at drax rose from almost nothing to producing 20 the countrys renewable power in the first half of this year renewable energy has come on leaps and bounds this decade  perhaps more than anyone ever thought it would but as well as being much lower in carbon emissions renewables like wind and solar operate very differently to the fuels the gb grid was built on  theyre intermittent they only work when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing so when it suddenly becomes still or dark we need alternatives that plug the gap deliver power and boost security of supply biomass is one part of how we can do this using lower carbon fuels compressed wood pellets the biomass used at drax is a renewable fuel that can be used to generate baseload power that can also be dialled up and down to meet demand like coal it can also provide the ancillary services the grid needs to stay stable unlike combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power plants which currently supply roughly 40 of the uks power and take 15 hours to start up from cold our new open cycle gas turbine ocgt plants are like big jet engines  generating electricity at full power in just 20 minutes from cold or 10 minutes from a warm standby its an incredibly fast turnaround and its what the energy network needs and because its a lower carbon fuel than coal with higher flexibility it will support the uks decarbonisation targets  by enabling more wind and solar on the grid we plan to use ocgts to plug the gaps that intermittency creates  essentially flicking the switch on and off at very short notice we anticipate they would run for no more than 1500 hours per year  only at times when the electricity system is under stress through supporting more intermittent renewables we also help to enable more coal off the system a better future for customers this new future will not only mean changes for us the generators but for customers too how energy is supplied and used is evolving and this is something that drax can support with the growing retail side of our business were a company with a wealth of expertise in renewable power and we can use this to help deliver electricity to business customers in a way that caters for todays market were already doing this with haven power  but now were extending this with the acquisition of opus energy  with this new company as part of drax group we will be able to grow our existing retail offering providing more of the uks growing businesses and established industrial and corporates not only with electricity but also with gas our retail offering will provide businesses with a route to sell the power they generate but do not need  plus expertise in how they can use energy more efficiently rd these are the first steps in a new chapter for drax there will be more research and development to come in the future well be looking at how we can extend our american compressed wood pellet supply business drax biomass  and at the potential for power storage systems if we want to continue to be a truly modern energy company that delivers on our aim of changing the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future we need to be able to adapt its always been a part of draxs history and it will be a part of our
