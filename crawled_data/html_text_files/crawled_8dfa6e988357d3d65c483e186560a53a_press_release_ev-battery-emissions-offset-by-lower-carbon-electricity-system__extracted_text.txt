power station ev battery emissions offset by lower carbon electricity system the rapidly decarbonising electricity system in the uk is helping electric vehicles evs to become greener  offsetting the carbon emitted in the production of their batteries more quickly according to a new study 29 august 2019 research by imperial college london for drax electric insights shows that on average britains evs emit just one quarter of the co 2 of conventional petrol and diesel cars  and if the carbon emitted in making their battery is included the co 2 emissions are half those of a conventional vehicle after just two to three years the carbon emitted in producing the batteries for the most efficient ev models would have been saved smaller evs with modest battery sizes are better for the environment whereas the largest luxury ev models could need three times longer to pay back their carbon cost as manufacturing their large batteries emits as much carbon as three round the world flights more co 2 is emitted in building the battery for premium ev model than from recharging it over a 15year lifetime 1 minimum daily carbon intensity each month 2 britains generation mix during june 30th that delivered electricity for less than 100g of carbon per kwh the research found that the increasing decarbonisation of our electricity supply linked to the 2050 netzero carbon target is enabling evs to become even more environmentally friendly britains evs bought today could be emitting just a tenth of the co 2 from a petrol car in five years time electricity generation is decarbonising faster in britain than anywhere else in the world wind solar biomass and hydro supplied 55 of electricity demand on june 30 breaking last years record of 48 according to the report dr iain staffell of imperial college london said evs have real potential to reduce our carbon footprint and help meet our netzero carbon ambitions  despite some speculation about how clean they really are an electric vehicle in the uk simply cannot be more polluting than its petrol or diesel equivalent  even when taking into account the upfront carbon cost of manufacturing their batteries the carbon content of britains electricity has halved in recent years and keeps on falling whereas conventional engine vehicles have very limited scope to reduce emissions over their lifetime any ev bought today could be emitting just a tenth of what a petrol car would in as little as five years time as the electricity it uses to charge comes from an increasingly lowcarbon mix carbon emissions from driving hatchback electric vehicles in britain this new analysis coincides with a longerterm consumer shift in how many electric vehicles there are on our roads as they fast become more mainstream there are now well over 200000 on britains roads and this number is growing by 30 per year 1 in 40 cars sold in britain is now electric around a third of which are pure battery models and two thirds are plugin hybrid britains electric vehicle fleet is expected to expand tenfold over the next five to ten years according to national grids latest future energy scenarios report paul sheffield managing director of draxs customer supply businesses haven power and opus energy said the electrification of transport is going to be vital if we are to address the climate crisis weve seen firsthand how complex it can be for businesses to switch their fleet vehicles to evs and have developed a new service to help make the switch easier for them supplying renewable electricity to businesses is one step towards helping them to be more sustainable  enabling them to decarbonise other aspects of their operations like transportation will mean they can play a fuller role in the transition to a zero carbon future ends media

service for business customers earlier in the year with ses water its first customer the research by imperial college london for drax electric insights shows electric vans are quickly taking off with over 8000 sold in britain to date their performance is comparable to small hatchbacks and they also currently emit around a quarter of the co 2 of the most popular conventional van with around 40 gkm with their 3040 kwh battery pack included this rises to just below half the co 2 of a small ford transit small hatchbacks are the cleanest variety of ev to drive as they are small and lightelectric models currently emit around 33 grams of co 2 per km driven which is one quarter that of the most popular conventional vehicle a 2019 ford fiesta these electric models typically come with a 3045 kwh battery which pushes their lifetime emissions up around 60 gkm this is still less than half the emissions of a petrol or diesel car with the projected changes to the grid mix this will fall to less than one third of a standard car in just five years time luxury saloons and suv models are much larger and need more energy to move meaning they have higher emissions than hatchbacks at 4454 gkm this is still just a quarter of the emissions from a comparable conventional car a top of the range mercedes sclass the lifetime emissions of these luxury evs are notably higher though pushed up by the enormous 90100 kwh batteries they use to provide a driving range of over 250 miles these batteries are responsible for more co 2 emissions than driving the car over its entire lifetime about electric insights electric insights is commissioned by drax and is delivered independently by a team of academics from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the quarterly reports analyse raw data made publicly available by national grid and elexon which run the electricity and balancing market respectively and sheffield solar electric insights quarterly focuses on supply and demand prices emissions the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that connects them along with dr iain staffell the team from imperial includes professors richard green and tim green experts in energy economics and electrical engineering and dr rob gross who contributes expertise in energy policy uniquely electric insights provides real time data about the uks transmission grid as well as embedded wind and solar generation which is not available from other sources the quarterly reports are backed by an interactive website

principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it
