team attended the meeting including andy koss  the ceo of its generation business drax power the meeting was an opportunity for drax to explain its business operations in the uk and talk through its reasons for acquiring the progress scheme this includes the strategic need for rapid response gas power generation developments within britains power system the potential timeframe for the construction and operation of the power station were also discussed if drax secures a capacity market contract in the early part of next year 2018 construction of the progress scheme the power generation plant the underground gas pipeline the underground electrical connection and the substation would start later in the year and expect to be completed by 202021 councillors from suffolk county council and mid suffolk district council attended the meeting along with councillors representing eye town council and parish councils in the vicinity of the site they along with local landowners who were also present raised a number of questions about the status and future of the project which are summarised in a meeting note on this website along with the presentation given at the event itself some additional preworks photos were shared following the meeting drax employees highlighted that the power station would have a single turbine with a single 35mhigh stack the substation building associated with the project is likely to be 3040 smaller than was originally envisaged based on ongoing discussions with national grid in addition there was a discussion about draxs proposals to establish a community benefit fund for the area surrounding the project attendees were keen to see the fund supporting local community initiatives it was agreed that another local liaison meeting would be arranged once national grid had prepared its proposed design and layout of the substation the meeting is likely to take place later this year the following day july 4th drax met with officials from suffolk county council to discuss the project and provide feedback from the community event the night before officials from the authority agreed to provide an update to councillors on the points discussed during that meeting and the process for discharging all planning obligations related to the project going forward parkinson lane primary are 2017 drax cup champions 7 july 2017 uncategorized pupils from parkinson lane primary school in halifax have been crowned the 2017 drax cup champions the team lifted the trophy in the finals of the biggest under 9s cricket competition in the country after beating driffield junior school 150141 at headingley they were among four regional winners competing for the drax cup at the world famous ground in leeds watched by their families

playing at headingley for the third year in succession by four runs 149145 driffield overcame acklam whin primary from middlesbrough 187165 losing in the final meant continued heartbreak for driffield who have now finished runnersup three times having appeared at headingley five times since 2012 the drax cup and medals were presented on the pitch by yorkshire allrounder will rhodes an ambassador for the competition the teams and supporters then settled down to watch their cricketing heroes play in the yorkshire vikings v nottinghamshire outlaws natwest t20 blast andy koss drax power ceo said this was the eleventh year of the drax cup and we are delighted that once again thousands of children across the region have been able to enjoy the thrill of competitive cricket with yorkshires joe root leading england to victory in his first test as captain and katherine brunt bowling brilliantly in the womens cricket world cup perhaps some of the players this year will follow in their footsteps the drax cup is sponsored by drax and organised by the yorkshire county cricket club in conjunction with the yorkshire cricket board the yorkshire cricket foundation and the yorkshire schools cricket association it is open to primary schools throughout yorkshire and teesside the competition began after the easter holidays and ran throughout the summer term with a series of festival and school partnership events and area finals established in 2007 participation has increased year on year with 650 schools taking part in 2017 editors notes the drax cup is open to schools from across yorkshire and teesside and is played by years 34 ages 79 the competition aims to introduce children to cricket in a fun way and each team must contain a minimum of two girls 2017 finalists

press releases public exhibitions held 9 th to 13 th june statutory public consultation runs until 2 nd july people took the opportunity to learn more and offer comment about the project as well as meet members of the millbrook power team and representatives of drax group  the owners of the millbrook power project among those who visited the exhibitions were councillors from central bedfordshire council and local parish councils at the four exhibitions millbrook power displayed images of the project from different viewpoints in the area and highlighted the main findings of its preliminary environmental information report  once the period of statutory consultation ends on 2 nd july millbrook power will consider the feedback that it has received at the exhibitions and received via emailpost and phone will finalise its environmental and technical studies and will continue to work closely with central bedfordshire and bedford borough councils millbrook will also keep local parish councils and other relevant parties in the near vicinity of the project site fully informed details of the project the exhibitions and the period of consultation were published in a leaflet mailed to 13500 homes and businesses in the area and were featured in the local press and on radio and tv in addition posters about the exhibitions were displayed in the area in local parish newsletters and on social media millbrook power is aiming to submit its application for a development consent order to the planning inspectorate before the end of this year subject to the outcome of the consenting and financing processes the project could enter commercial operation in 2022 carlton pupils attend popup drax virtual tour 13 june 2017 uncategorized schoolchildren at a north yorkshire primary school today tuesday 13 june experienced a unique new pop up planetarium developed by drax to support stem learning  science technology engineering and maths  in the curriculum the mobile cinema is housed inside an inflatable replica of the giant biomass storage domes at drax power station near selby a stateoftheart internal projection displays a speciallyproduced 360degree film onto the dome walls and ceiling to give the audience a planetariumstyle virtual tour of the entire site and its operations with an accompanying informative voiceover the video shows how drax has upgraded half the power station to run on sustainable biomass in place of coal to become the uks biggest single site renewable energy generator drax now produces 16 of the uks renewable electricity  enough to power four million uk households drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping children in their science and engineering studies with many schools taking part in tours of the power station to help inspire the next generation of engineers the company recently launched project reinvent  a secondary schools challenge using stem learning to develop an idea to improve their local community drax power chief executive andy koss said at drax we are helping to find and inspire the engineers of the future by encouraging greater interest in stem subjects as well as inviting schools to the power station to show pupils how energy is generated here we are now bringing the power station to schools this new innovative dome means we can reach and inspire more children giving them a unique interactive insight into how we generate renewable electricity a team from the visitor centre at drax transported the dome to the primary school where it was inflated and set up within the school grounds the idea for the project came from drax visitor centre manager rachael baldwin who wanted an innovative new way to take the drax experience further afield and reach even more school children she explained drax welcomes thousands of pupils from across our region to discover the sights and sounds of the power station for themselves we believe this latest innovation in our visitor experience will become an equally engaging and exciting way to share what we do with those schools unable to come to us weve gone to great lengths to create real wow factor for the children she added we hope to reach 25000 school pupils with the dome this year carltoninsnaith primary school headteacher jon watson said the children were really looking forward to the visit by drax and are excited to be the first school pupils to try out the new dome cinema our year 5 and 6 pupils are currently learning about electricity generation and the environment and the experience was invaluable in terms of bringing the subject to life the 15ft high and 23ft wide 45m x 7m dome can accommodate around 30 pupils at a time the immersive 360degree video experience was designed and created by peel interactive based in skipton it uses a combination of animation highly detailed and interactive 3d models and dramatic aerial footage to show how electricity is made using sustainable compressed wood pellets which have now completely replaced coal in half of draxs generating units to achieve carbon savings of over 80 percent the film shows how the pellets are formed from lowvalue material including thinnings  small trees that have been removed from working forests to maximise the growth of the remaining trees  tree tops sawmill residues and other leftovers from the commercial management of timber supplies produced for other industries the drax guides who will present the video to the schools also use fun props to encourage discussion around sustainable energy generation and use the tour is free to all primary and secondary schools and content from the video can be adapted to fit the curriculum and assist teachers in delivering an engaging learning experience were sure pupils will love the whole cinema experience of learning said rachael baldwin our guides really bring to life what happens at drax and for the children its just as if they too were here at the power station we are looking forward to taking our virtual tour to schools across the north and even further afield any schools interested in booking a dome visit should contact email protected  ends media contact

undergone such radical changes that carbon emissions from the sector are now so low the dirtiest hour of generation is cleaner than the average hour from just a few years ago the latest electric insights report  produced by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax analysed data from january to march 2017 it reveals the dirtiest hour for generation during this winter period was at 830pm on the 16 th january on that cold and calm winter evening 424 grams of co 2 were released per kwh gkwh compare this to the average hour from 2009  2013 when 471 per kwh gkwh was being produced in fact during the first quarter of 2017 emissions dropped by 10 per cent compared to the same period in 2016 and a massive 33 per cent from q1 in 2015 while this years mild winter played an important role in reducing emissions the reduction in the use of coal should not be underestimated policy levers like the carbon tax continued to push coal off the system and the dramatic growth in renewables also reduced its role in january to march 2017 output from coal generation fell by 30 compared to the same quarter in 2016 renewables hit new energy production records wind  113 twh biomass  44 twh hydro  16 twh solar hit a new record peak output 767 gw dr iain staffell of imperial college london said the dirtiest hour in the first quarter of 2017 in terms of carbon intensity from electricity saw 424g of co 2 produced per kwh  that would have seemed clean just a few years ago the average from 2009 to 2013 was 471gkwh however coal output  largely driven by the carbon tax  has fallen 82 in the last four years and has been replaced by midcarbon gas low carbon biomass and imports as well as zero carbon wind and solar together these have driven decarbonisation in line with or even slightly ahead of the countrys targets  which are the most ambitious in the world the rise of intermittent renewables like wind and solar mean that gas coal and biomass fired power stations are often not required throughout the day they are instead being used to power up and down according to the weather and peaks in demand making flexibility more important than ever before while in the winter months we are witnessing record breaking changes in the generation mix the new data from the first quarter of 2017 suggests that this summer is likely to witness an even more dramatic shift in the last weekend of march  for the first time ever  we saw lower daytime than night time demand on the grid this phenomenon was largely driven by the dramatic rise in solar both solar panels and small scale onshore wind are invisible from the grid this means that effectively what they produce reduces what the grid is required to deliver during march demand on the transmission system was 23gw higher at 9am than at 1pm when solar panels achieve maximum output dr staffell predicts that based on previous data this gap is set to double this summer june dr staffell explained that whilst this quarter was a recordbreaker for all renewables including solar the sun often isnt shining at the very times when the country needs the most power  when factories and offices are starting up in the morning  and when people settle down at home for the evening dr staffell said how we manage this changing pattern in demand requires a major change in how power stations operate solar output is still relatively hard to forecast in advance technologies that are flexible and can be turned on and off quickly such as gas or battery storage will help accommodate these changes andy koss drax power ceo said we continue to see dramatic changes in both the generation mix and new demands on the system making reliable flexible power increasingly important seasonal changes are highlighting the changing role that power stations are now playing this new role is set to increase and we will need more nimble technologies which can be up and running at the flick of a switch  like the rapid response gas power stations we are developing this kind of flexible and responsive power generation is vital during times of system stress such as when the sun isnt shining or the wind doesnt blow  it will also enable more intermittent renewables to come onto the grid replacing coal and making the whole system cleaner electric insights will be published once a quarter and is supported by an interactive website  electricinsightscouk  which provides live data from 2009 until the present the data sources and methodology used in electric insights are listed in full on the website commissioned by drax group owner and operator of the uks largest power station and europes biggest biomassfuelled power plant the report will be delivered independently by dr iain staffell from imperial college london facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants the full report can be read here httpselectricinsightscoukdrax_electric_insights_report_2017_q1pdf ends notes to editors electric insights reports that the carbon intensity of electricity averaged 284gkwh during the first quarter of 2017 it ranged from just 102gkwh on a windy sunday night in march to 424gkwh on a cold and calm january evening when coal output was high the lowest carbon intensity hour was 430am on march 19 when there was 078gw of coal generation 44gw gas 7gw nuclear and 120gw renewables previously minimum demand was always during the night and daytime demand never came within 5gw of the night time minimum however this gap narrowed to 24gw in 2015 and on march 25 th 2017 it disappeared completely this meant demand on the national grid was lower during the daytime than it was over night for the first time ever all forms of renewables had a record breaking first quarter of 2017 wind farms recorded

racing gaspropelled cars are just some of the fun activities children can enjoy during a brand new family event organised by drax to celebrate british science week the free outdoor event  a bit of science for a change explores the theme of changing states of matter and will take place within the woods at the skylark centre and nature reserve between 11am and 3pm on sunday 19 march children use a map to locate a series of science stations hidden around the nature reserve and then answer questions to earn the equipment and materials needed to complete fun sciencebased challenges investigating the changing states of liquids gases and solids drax visitor centre coordinator jane breach said this is the first event drax has hosted as part of british science week and weve come up with a number of handson challenges designed to appeal to children of all ages and abilities we hope this will be a great opportunity for families to come together enjoy our beautiful nature reserve and learn something along the way she added discovering how to make a cd hover above the ground and create magnetic slime are just some of the exciting activities planned for our more competitive participants weve even created a top gearstyle leader board to record the furthest distance achieved by gaspropelled cars drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping children in their stem studies science technology engineering and maths and recently launched project reinvent  a secondary schools challenge to develop an idea using stem learning to improve their local community entry to

emissions from britains power sector fell to their lowest level for 60 years as more coal came off the system making way for renewables the new figures were revealed in the latest electric insights quarterly report produced by researchers at imperial college london in collaboration with drax 2016 saw the most dramatic shift in the makeup of electricity generation since the 1984 miners strike coal generation fell 61 from the previous year as a mixture of low gas prices and the carbon price floor continued to force it off the system gas generation was up by more than 50 the septemberdecember period saw low carbon sources provide an average of 40 of britains electricity needs over the quarter peaking at a record 81 high over the christmas period wind output was low  over the quarter it was 7 down on the same period in 2015 this winter has seen fewer large storms resulting in lower average wind speeds compared to previous years wind speeds in q4 2016 were down 15 on 2015 the lowest since 2012 despite this when storm barbara passed through just before christmas it enabled wind power to pass the 10gw barrier for the first time in britain beating the previous record of 94gw set in 2014 however wind farms also spent a whole day producing on average less than 07gw  an output of just 5 of their installed capacity andy koss drax power ceo said these figures highlight a truly seismic shift in the balance of power coal continues to disappear at a dramatic rate and we can see the impact of intermittent renewables which have been affected by dramatic weather events low gas prices and the carbon price floor are forcing coal off the system and helping to ensure the uk is on track to meet its carbon targets for the power generation industry its essential the uks energy system is supported by the right mix of power generation coaltobiomass conversions and gas peaking plants are the best way to get coal off the system quickly and cost effectively whilst ensuring security of supply dr iain staffell of imperial college london said these figures clearly show that the carbon price floor cpf has played an important part in relegating coal to a more climatefriendly role providing infrequent peaking power at times of greatest need allowing lower carbon gas to take over as the baseload generator over the last two years the cpf has added 05pkwh to the cost of generation or about 3 of a household electricity bill in return it has played a major part in reducing carbon emissions by a third making it excellent value for money the report also found that britain became a net exporter to france for the first time in six years due to a crisis with french nuclear stations but exports were limited due to the interconnector being damaged the loss of imports from france left the power market tight with national grid issuing notices of thin margins power price volatility grew with peak prices over 1500mwh electric insights will be published once a
