you need to know about britains electricity last quarter more records fell in springsummer as britains energy system accelerates toward decarbonisation 17 august 2017 power generation for an hour over lunch on wednesday 7 th june more than 50 of britains electricity came from renewables it was only the second time this had ever happened  the first had come just two months earlier in april the second quarter q2 of 2017 was a period largely made up of firsts for britains electricity system while there were only two instances of renewable power tipping the 50 mark between april and june overall wind solar biomass and hydro energy made up more than a quarter of all britains electricity for the first time ever these findings come from electric insights  research on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by top university academics over the past year the quarterly report has shown breaking renewable records is becoming the new normal for britains electricity last quarter was no different here we look at the key findings from q2 2017 and what they mean for the changing nature of the energy sector more than half great britains electricity came from renewables twice wind solar biomass and hydro accounted for 515 of the uks electricity for an hour on 7 th june  generating 191 gigawatts gw combined with nuclear power and imports from france lowcarbon output was a record 286 gw  a massive 89 of total demand this followed 30 th april when britains electricity edged over the 50 renewable mark for a shorter but no less significant period the percentage of renewables making up our power supply is set to grow as additional renewable capacity comes onto the grid there is currently 6 gw of additional wind capacity being constructed in britain solar capacity has already hit 124 gw  more solar panels than analysts thought would be installed by 2050 plans to convert more of britains coal units to biomass will increase the availability of renewable power further still electricity was cleaner than ever there was a key date in the history of coal during q2 on 21 st april britain recorded the first full day it had gone without burning any coal since 1882  the year holborn viaduct power station became the worlds first coalfired public electricity station while that date is symbolic of the uks shift away from coal in practice it means carbon emissions are also dropping to historically low levels carbon intensity reached a new low in q2 averaging 199 gkwh over the quarter  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year for context carbon intensity averaged 740 gkwh in the 1980s and 500 gkwh in the 2000s an important indicator of this falling carbon intensity is that britains electricity now regularly drops below 100 gkwh and reached an alltime low of 71 gkwh on the sunny and windy sunday of 11 th june electric cars are cleaner than before one of the greatest decarbonisation challenges moving forward is how we transform transport electrification is the primary driver of change in this sector and q2 saw britain hit a significant milestone as the total number of electric vehicles evs in the country surpassed 100000 the potential of evs in cleaning up transport is significant but there are also concerns they could in some cases increase co 2 levels due to pollution from power stations however as the last quarters data shows evs are in fact twice as carbon efficient as conventional cars thanks to the amount of renewable and low carbon electricity on the system according to our analysis looking at a few of the most popular models evs werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell from imperial college london but now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk they are delivering much better results the most solar power a quarter has ever seen the longer days in q2 enabled solar power to become a key source of electricity  and for eight hours over the quarter it generated more than all fossil fuels combined it also set output records by supplying 25 of total demand on 8 th april and producing 891 gw on 26 th may while wind remains the largest source of renewable energy generation in the uk solars influence is growing  especially as decentralisation of the power system continues to proliferate  of britains 124 gw solar capacity 57 is concentrated in 1400 solar farms of around 5 mw each while the rest is distributed across almost one million rooftop arrays in homes businesses and other institutions in fact during june 10 of all britains electricity came from these sorts of decentralised sources  sources of power not on the national grid this is unlikely to spell a fundamental shift to an entirely decentralised power grid in the short term but it does hint at the changes the sector is seeing from its carbon profile to its variety to its flexibility britains power system is changing  and thats a good thing explore the
