Supporting the deployment of Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the UK: business model options
8 April 2021
Carbon capture

the report PDF.
Drax Power Station is currently exploring the option of adding carbon capture and storage equipment to its biomass-fired generating units. The resulting plant could produce at least 8 million tonnes (Mt) of negative CO
2
emissions each year, as well as generating renewable electricity. Drax is planning to make a final investment decision (FID) on its bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (‘BECCS in power’
1
) investment in Q1 2024, with the first BECCS unit to be operating by 2027.
The potential of BECCS as part of the path to Net Zero has been widely recognised.
BECCS in power is an important part of all of the Climate Change Committee (CCC)’s Net Zero scenarios, contributing to negative emissions of between 16- 39Mt CO
2
e per year by 2050
2
. Investment needs to occur early: by 2035, the CCC sees a role for 3-4GW of BECCS, as part of a mix of low carbon generation
3
.
The Government’s Energy White Paper commits, by 2022, to establishing the role which BECCS can play in reducing carbon emissions across the economy and setting out how the technology could be deployed. The Government has also committed to invest up to £1 billion to support the establishment of carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) in four industrial clusters
4
.
National Grid’s 2020 Future Energy Scenarios (FES) indicate that it is not possible to achieve Net Zero without BECCS
5
.
However, at present, a business model
6
which could enable this investment is not in place. A business model is required because a number of barriers and market failures otherwise make economic investment impossible.
There is no market for negative emissions.
There is currently no source of remuneration for the value delivered by negative emissions, and therefore no return for the investment needed to achieve them.
Positive spillovers are not remunerated
. Positive spillovers that would be delivered by a first-of-a-kind BECCS power plant, but which are not remunerated include:
providing an anchor load for carbon dioxide (CO
2
) transport and storage (T&S) infrastructure that can be used by subsequent CCS projects;
delivering learning that will help lower the costs of subsequent BECCS power plants; and
delivering learning and shared skills that can be used across a range of CCS projects, including hydrogen production with CCS.
BECCS relies on the presence of CO
2
transport and storage infrastructure
. Where this infrastructure doesn’t already exist, or where the availability or costs are highly uncertain, this presents a significant risk to investors in BECCS in power.

Frontier Economics has been commissioned by Drax to develop and evaluate business model options for BECCS in power that could overcome these barriers, and help deliver timely investment in BECCS.
Business model options
We started with a long list of business model options. After eliminating options that are unsuitable for BECCS in power, we considered the following three options in detail.
Power Contract for Difference (CfD):
the strike price of the CfD would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions, low carbon power and for learnings and spillover benefits.
Carbon payment:
a contractual carbon payment would provide a fixed payment per tonne of negative emissions. The payment level would be set to include remuneration for negative emissions, low carbon power and for learnings and spillovers.
Carbon payment + power CfD:
this option combines the two options above. The carbon payment would provide remuneration for negative emissions and learnings and spillovers while the power CfD would support power market revenues for the plant’s renewable power output.
We first considered if committing to any of these business model options for BECCS in power now might restrict future policy options for a broader GGR support scheme. We assessed whether these options could, over time, be transitioned into a broader GGR support scheme (i.e. one not just focused on BECCS in power), and concluded that this would be possible for all of them.
We then considered how these business model options could be funded, and whether the choice of a business model option is linked to a particular source of funds (for example, power CfDs are currently funded by a levy paid by electricity suppliers to the Low Carbon Contracts Company [LCCC]). We concluded that business models do not need to be attached to specific funding sources; all of the options can be designed to fit with numerous different funding options, so the two decisions can be made independently. This means that the business model options can be considered on their own terms, with thinking about funding sources being progressed in parallel.
We then evaluated the three business model options against a set of criteria developed from principles set out in the BEIS consultation on business models for CCS, summarised in the figure below.
Figure 1: Principles for design of business models
Instil investor confidence
▪ Attract innovation
▪ Attract new entrants
▪ Instil supply chain confidence
Cost efficiency
▪ Drive efficient management of investment costs
▪ Drive efficient quantity of investment
▪ Drive efficient dispatch and operation
▪ Risks allocated in an efficient way, taking into account the impact on the cost of capital
Feasibility
▪ Limit administrative burden
▪ Practicality for investors
▪ Requirement for complementary policy
▪ Wider policy and state aid compatibility
▪ Timely implementation
Fair cost sharing
▪ Allows fair and practical cost distribution
Ease of policy transition
▪ Ease of transition to subsidy free system
▪ Ease of transition to technology neutral solution

graphic.
All three business model options performed well across most criteria. However, our evaluation highlighted some key trade-offs to consider when choosing a business model:
investor confidence:
the power CfD and the two-part model with a CfD performed better than the carbon payment on this measure, as they shield investors from wholesale power market fluctuations;
feasibility:
the power CfD performed best on this measure. Because it is already established in existing legislation and is well understood, it will be quick to implement. Introducing a mechanism to provide carbon payments may require new legislation. However, this will be needed in any case to support other CCUS technologies
7
, and could be introduced in time before projects come online; and
potential to become technology neutral and subsidy free:
all three options could transition to a mid-term regime which could be technology neutral. However, the stand-alone power CfD performed least well as it does not deliver any learnings around remunerating negative emissions.
Overall, the two-part model performed well across the criteria and would offer a clear path to a technology neutral and subsidy free world, delivering learnings that will be relevant for other GGRs as well.
Conclusions
The UK’s Net Zero target will be challenging to achieve, and will require investment in negative emissions technologies to offset residual emissions from hard-to-abate sectors, as highlighted by the CCC
8
. BECCS in power is a particularly important part of this picture, and represents a cost-effective means of delivering the scale of negative emissions needed. Early investment in BECCS is also important in insuring against the risk and cost of ”back ending” significant abatement effort.
However, market failures, most notably the lack of a market for negative emissions, lack of remuneration for positive spillovers and learnings, and reliance on availability of T&S infrastructure, mean that without policy intervention, the required level of BECCS in power is unlikely to be delivered in time to contribute to Net Zero.
There are a number of business options available in the near term to overcome these barriers. In our view, a two-part model combining a power CfD and a carbon payment is preferable.
This measure:
addresses identified market failures;
can be implemented relatively easily and in time to capture benefits of early BECCS in power investment; and
can be structured to ensure an efficient outcome for customers (including with reference to investors’ likely cost of capital) and in a way that allocates risks appropriately.

1: Biomass can be combusted to generate energy (typically in the form of power, but this could also be in the form of heat or liquid fuel), or gasified to produce hydrogen. The resulting emissions can then be captured and stored using CCS technology. The focus of this report is on biomass combustion to generate power, with CCS, which we refer to as ‘BECCS in power’. We refer to biomass gasification with CCS as ‘BECCS for hydrogen’.

The jobs and careers supporting the UK’s net zero future
5 March 2021
Sustainable business

In October last year several of our employees, from policy managers to apprentices, took over the Energy UK
Young Energy Professional (YEP) Forum’s
Twitter account to share their experiences so far working in the energy industry and their roles at Drax. The YEP forum consists of a network of energy industry professionals with less than 10 years’ experience, and aims to provide them with opportunities to collaborate, develop and recognise successes. The following insights from employees at Drax show the importance of our workforce in
achieving our ambition
and what they have learnt so far about starting a career in the energy industry.
Engineer working in the turbine hall at Drax Power Station, North Yorkshire
Meet Samuel, the apprentice
One of our technical apprentices, Samuel Plumb, explains why he decided to kick-start his career with a Drax
apprenticeship
plus what the
selection process
involves: “I applied for this role because it’s a mix of practical skills and problem-solving. Drax has a large site with a huge range of equipment and processes so no two days are the same. Working here appealed to me because I’m really interested in the power industry and Drax plays a key role in generation. I found out about this apprenticeship through online research, submitted an application, completed aptitude tests online, sat another aptitude test on-site and then eventually attended an interview.”
Meet Richard, the policy manager
Richard Gow explains that with the right policies in place, Drax could become a carbon negative power station, enabling a
zero carbon industrial cluster
in the Humber region. The Drax Group Policy and Government Relations Manager outlines how his role helps to develop the necessary frameworks: “I engage with policymakers, advisors and experts across the UK to understand the policy and political landscape and how this could impact Drax’s commercial objectives. The energy sector is at the forefront of decarbonisation and it’s exciting to be involved in developing policies and market frameworks to support this transition to net zero.”
By investing in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), hydrogen and other green technologies in the Humber, industry can regain a competitive edge.
New jobs can help to rejuvenate communities
and the wider region, as evidenced by a
recent report
from Vivid Economics on the socio-economic benefits of BECCS. This investment at Drax supports the UK’s levelling up agenda and to
Build Back Better
, emphasising the need for the UK to have a skilled workforce to achieve net zero. Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, has explained how our own ambitions will also boost our communities and local economies by “helping to create a cleaner environment for future generations whilst creating new jobs and export opportunities for British businesses.”
Noting that
BECCS at Drax
is not just limited to new engineering or technician roles, as a UK-US company, with sites from Selby to the Scottish Highlands to Louisiana and Mississippi in the US South, we continue to attain young professionals and apprentices across a wide-range of departments, including sustainable business and smart energy services.

Meet Emma, the renewables engagement officer
And at Drax we emphasise that now is the time for action to
tackle climate change
. Emma Persson, Renewables Engagement Officer, describes her motivations for joining the clean energy transition and how her role is helping to ensure the UK reaches its
net zero
target: “As a recent graduate with a Masters in energy and society, I wanted to work in the energy sector and be part of its real and current transition to mitigating climate change instead of contributing to it. This is an exciting time, and my part in this transformation involves stakeholder engagement and contributing to Drax’s climate policy to ensure we reach our carbon negative ambition.”
By developing talent within schools from a young age and inspiring students to study Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects, Drax also encourages future career opportunities. We are proud to be working with a number of local schools and colleges, such as Selby College, with whom we recently signed a new
five-year partnership
. This shows our continued commitment to ensuring students of all ages are equipped with the skills needed to progress the UK’s cleaner energy future, while having a
positive social impact
on our local communities.
Mobilising a Million
Students from Selby College collect their laptops donated by Drax (April 2020)
We recently became the UK’s first energy company to
announce an initiative to improve employability for a million people by 2025
. Drax’s
Opportunity Action Plan
is in partnership with the
Social Mobility Pledge
, led by the former Education Secretary, the Rt Hon Justine Greening. Through our ‘Mobilising a Million’ initiative, we aim to connect with one million people by 2025, improving skills, education, employability and opportunity. This sets a new and higher standard for the levelling up agenda in Britain, with a wider focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues. Clare Harbord, Drax Group Director of Corporate Affairs, said of the initiative, “By boosting education, skills and employability opportunities for a million people, we can start to level the playing field and build a more diverse workforce. This will make the energy sector stronger and able to make a more significant contribution to the UK’s green recovery.”
During the COVID-19 pandemic we have also been using
virtual resources
to provide new ways of learning from home, delivering
laptops for learners
, and a new series of webinars titled
‘Drax in the Classroom’
as well as
virtual work experience
and tours of
Drax Power Station, North Yorkshire
and
Cruachan in Scotland
. Before the pandemic, we also hosted a number of inspiring careers events at Drax, including the
‘Women of the Future’
. The event showcased the various opportunities available for young women, part of our continued efforts to increase diversity in our workforce and develop the future generation of energy professionals.

BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage)


Standing together
against climate
change
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
27 January 2021
Opinion

Tackling climate change requires global collaboration. As a UK-US sustainable energy company, with communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we at Drax are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends countries and borders.
Joe Biden has become the 46
th
President of my native country at a crucial time to ensure there is global leadership and collaboration on climate change. Starting with re-joining the Paris Agreement, I am confident that the new administration can make a significant difference to this once-in-a-lifetime challenge.
This is why Drax and our partners are mobilising a transatlantic
coalition
of negative emissions producers. This can foster collaboration and shared learning between the
different technologies and techniques
for carbon removal that are essential to decarbonise the global economy.

Whilst political and technical challenges lie ahead, clear long-term policies that spur collaboration, drive innovation and enable technologies at scale are essential in achieving the UK and US’ aligned targets of reaching
net zero
carbon emissions by 2050.
Collaboration between countries and industries
What makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a scale like few other projects. This is why the Paris Agreement and this year’s COP26 conference in Glasgow are so vital.

Our effort towards
delivering negative emissions
using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (
BECCS
) is another example of ambitious decarbonisation that is most impactful as part of an integrated, collaborative energy system. The technology depends upon sustainable forest management in regions, such as the US South where our American communities operate. Carbon capture using sustainable bioenergy will help Drax to be carbon negative by 2030 – an
ambition I announced at COP25
, just over a year ago in Madrid.
Will Gardiner announcing Drax’s carbon negative ambition at COP25 in Madrid (December 2019).
Our cutting-edge carbon removal technologies will help the UK, and the world, hit net zero.
Experts on both sides of the Atlantic consider BECCS essential for net zero. The UK’s Climate Change Committee says it will play a major role in
tackling carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions that will remain in the UK economy after 2050
, from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise. Meanwhile, a report published last year by New York’s Columbia University revealed that
rapid development of BECCS is needed within the next 10 years
in order to curb climate change.
A variety of negative emissions technologies are required to capture between
10% and 20% of the 35 billion metric tonnes of carbon
produced annually that the International Energy Agency says is needed to prevent the worst effects of climate change.
We believe that sharing our experience and expertise in areas such as forestry, bioenergy, and carbon capture will be crucial in helping more countries, industries and businesses deploy a range of technologies.
A formal coalition of negative emissions producers that brings together approaches including land management,
afforestation and reforestation
, as well as technical solutions like direct air capture (DAC), as well as BECCS, would offer an avenue to ensure knowledge is shared globally.
Direct air capture (DAC) facility
It would also offer flexibility in countries’ paths to net zero emissions. If one approach under-delivers, other technologies can work together to compensate and meet CO
2
removal targets.
As with renewable energy,
working in partnership with governments
is essential to develop these innovations into the cost-effective, large scale solutions needed to meet climate targets in the mid-century.
A shared economic opportunity
I agree whole heartedly that a nation’s economy and environment are intrinsically linked – something many leaders are now saying, including President Biden. The recently approved US economic stimulus bill, supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and which allocates $35 billion for new clean energy initiatives, is a positive step for climate technology and job creation.
Globally as many as
65 million well-paid jobs
could be created through investment in clean energy systems. In the UK, BECCS and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change, but are also a
vital economic force
as the world begins to recover from the effects of COVID-19.

We all want the UK’s recovery to be a green recovery – one which benefits the North, along with the whole of the country
Government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of well-paid jobs, new careers, education opportunities and upskill workforces.
Developing BECCS at Drax Power Station
, for example, would support around 17,000 jobs during the peak of construction in 2028, including roles in construction, local supply chains and the wider economy.
Additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain. This includes the rail, shipping and forestry industries
that are integral to rural communities in the US South
.
We are also partnered with 11 other
organisations in the UK’s Humber region
to develop a carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen industrial cluster with the potential to spearhead creating and supporting more than 200,000 jobs around the UK in 2039.
The expertise and equipment needed for such a project can be shared, traded and exported to other industrial clusters around the world, allowing us to help reach global climate goals and drive global standards for CCUS and
biomass sustainability
.
Clear, long-term policies are essential here, not just to help develop technology but to mitigate risk and encourage investment. These are the next crucial steps needed to deploy negative emissions at the scale required to impact CO
2
emissions and lives of people.
Engineer at BECCS pilot project within Drax Power Station
At Drax we directly employ almost 3,000 people in the US and UK, and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the Atlantic. Drax Power Station is the most advanced BECCS project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cutting-edge carbon capture and removal technology. We can then share our expertise with the United States and the rest of the world – a world where major economies are committing to a net zero future and benefiting from a green economic recovery.

Charge. Recharge. The evolution of batteries
23 December 2020
Electrification

From watches to toothbrushes, mobile phones to cars, batteries are a power source for many of our everyday belongings. And while their beginnings can be traced back to the 19
th
century, their innovation has transformed industries, technology use and society at large today.
Energy storage systems such as pumped-hydropower have long played an important role in balancing electricity systems, but as the UK and countries around the world seek to decarbonise industries and make greater use of intermittent, renewable sources, there is a
need for greater levels of storage
.
While pumped-hydro storage requires the
right kind of terrain
, batteries can theoretically be built wherever there is the space and investment. But what actually is a battery, and how does it work?
Turning chemicals to electrical flow
Batteries are comprised of one or more cells which store chemical energy, and are able to convert that energy into electricity. In most batteries, there are three main components: an anode, cathode and electrolyte.
The anode and cathode are terminals for the flow of energy and are typically made of metal. The electrolyte is a chemical medium that sits between the terminals allowing an electrical charge to pass through. This is often a liquid, but increasingly research points to the potential to use solids and create what are known as solid-state batteries.
How a lithium ion battery works
It’s only when a battery is connected to a device that it completes a circuit and chemical reactions take place that allow the flow of electrical energy from the battery to the device. But how much electrical energy a battery can dispense has always been a hurdle to using them as a power source, making rechargeable batteries an important breakthrough.
The same reaction backwards
A key element in battery development was the exploration of rechargeable cells. These have long provided mobility and reliability in small scale outputs, but are now being looked to as
a source of large-scale energy storage
.
Invented by physician Gaston Planté in 1859, rechargeable batteries are possible because the chemical reactions that take place are reversible. Once the initial stored charge has been depleted via chemical reaction, these reactions occur again, but this time backwards, to store a new charge.
Battery charger with AA rechargeable batteries
Using a lead-acid system, Planté’s composition was similar to that found in rechargeable batteries used in cars and motorbikes today, although the characteristics of these cells, such as their heavy weight, meant they were not convenient for many other uses.
As a result, a journey of continuous research and optimisation to decrease the size and weight of rechargeable batteries began. This includes investigation into the alternative chemical compositions found in batteries today – nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion to name two.
Recharging in a low-carbon energy system
Just as we have seen the size and capacity of batteries bettered throughout history, the application and optimisation of modern-day lithium-ion cells looks to continue too, powering the world’s move towards a low carbon, renewable energy future.
From electric vehicle batteries with a
million mile lifespan
to a
200 megawatt battery farm in South Africa
, lithium-ion allows reasonably large-scale energy storage. It can also play a key role in power grid stabilisation over short durations of time such as a few hours.
Tesla gigafactory
For the UK to run on 100% renewable electricity sources, batteries would be imperative in complimenting other flexible renewables, such as biomass and hydropower. As a support technology, batteries can help ensure a continuous supply of electricity to homes and cities, even when cloud cover and low wind prevents other sources generating.
Conversely, charging and recharging batteries can also be used to absorb and store electricity when there is more sun and wind generation than needed, avoiding surges in electric current or wasted generation.
Changing charging
Woman charging smartphone using wireless charging pad
Alongside the advancements of battery capacity and composition, the way we use them to charge is also changing. Just as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi avoid the tethering required of wired connections, wireless charging can increase mobility and remove physical limitations.
Small-scale wireless charging is in use today. Many mobile phones, toothbrushes, smartwatches and earbuds now have wireless charging pads. These use near-field charging, meaning the device must be in close proximity to the charger to receive power.
However, efficient far-field charging is in development, with companies like
Energous
and
Ossia
developing over-the-air charging solutions for wearable tech, medical products, smart homes, and industrial equipment. This would mean devices could be powered and charged from many metres away.
The implications of this are vast, for example your devices could be charged just by entering your home or office. There could be less need for invasive surgery to change the batteries for pacemakers, neurotransmitters and other implanted medical equipment.
This type of technology could also provide passive charging for electric vehicles. The UK Department for Transport has
announced a trial in Nottingham
, where charging plates will be placed on parts of the town’s roads allowing electric taxis to charge while waiting briefly to pick up passengers. As charging technology and speed continues to increase, this might mean vehicles could charge wirelessly not only while parked, but when stopped at traffic lights.

As the world shifts away from fossil fuels to renewable sources, batteries, with continued improvement in performance and capacity, will be crucial in supporting our connected lives, transport systems and electrical grids.

What is renewable energy?
17 December 2020
Sustainable bioenergy

These differ to non-renewable energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas, of which there is a finite amount available on Earth, meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out.
Renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications, including electricity generation, transportation and heating or cooling.
The difference between low-carbon, carbon neutral and renewable energy
Renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce
any

carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
when they generate power. Low-carbon sources might produce
some
CO
2
, but much less than fuels like coal.
Bioenergy that uses woody biomass
from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb CO
2
from the atmosphere as they grow, meaning the amount of CO
2
in the atmosphere remains level. Supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation. Therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel, when its
whole lifecycle
is considered.
Managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power.
Responsible biomass sourcing
also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuel-based energy generation.
Nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable. It does not produce CO
2,
but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium, of which there is a finite amount available.
Managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power.
How much renewable energy is used around the world?
Humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires, as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing. Water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources, but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels, coal in particular, have been the main source of power.
However, as the effects of air pollution and CO
2
produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent, renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change.
In the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18% of global electricity generation,
according to the IEA
. By 2019, renewable sources made up 27% of the world’s electrical power.
Why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change
The single biggest human contribution to
climate change
is greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO
2,
into the atmosphere. They create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on Earth to increase, making it less habitable.
Renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the world’s demand for power without contributing to global warming, unlike carbon-intensive fuels like coal, gas and oil.
Bioenergy can also be used to
remove CO
2
from the atmosphere
while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
Forests absorb CO
2
from the atmosphere, then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same CO
2
is captured and stored permanently underground – reducing the overall amount of CO
2
in the atmosphere.
Humans have used renewable energy for millions for years, from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs.

What’s holding renewables back?
The world’s energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind. This can make
converting national grids difficult
and installing new renewable energy sources expensive. However, as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture, build and operate renewable systems, the cost of deploying them at scale drops.
There are future changes needed. Renewables such as wind, solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they can’t generate electricity when there is no sun, wind or the tidal movement. For future energy systems to deliver enough power, large scale energy storage, as well as other flexible, reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and
keep systems stable
.
Renewable energy key facts:

Renewable power in the UK has
grown six-fold
in the last decade, helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the country’s electricity system by 58%, according to Electric Insights.
The
cost of electricity from solar panels
dropped by 82% between 2010 and 2019, while the cost of onshore wind fell 40% and offshore wind 29%.
The world’s
largest power station of any kind
, the Three Gorges Dam in China, runs on a renewable energy source, hydropower, and has a generation capacity of 22.5 gigawatts (GW).
The
total capacity of the world’s installed renewable electricity
generation is forecast to reach 3,978 GW in 2025, up from 849 GW in 2000.

FAQs (frequently asked questions)


The UK is the leader the world needs to tackle climate change
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
11 December 2020
Opinion

December 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement. It represented a landmark moment in the global effort to combat
climate change
and build a
better future
. However, global progress is not moving at the speed it needs to in order to meet the treaty’s target of keeping global warming below 1.5-2 degrees Celsius.

Carbon Capture by Drax
Countries have set their own
decarbonisation
targets and many companies have laid out plans to become carbon neutral or even carbon negative – as we at Drax
intend to achieve by 2030
. While these leading ambitions are important for the UK and the world to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, real action, polices and investment are needed at scale.
We have a clearer view of the path ahead than five years ago. We know from the recent 6
th
Carbon Budget that renewable energy, as well as
carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS)
are essential for the UK to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
In that detailed,
1,000-page report
, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) was clear that progress must be made immediately – the country as a whole must be 78% of the way there by 2035. By investing where it’s needed, the UK can lead the world in a whole new industry. One that may come to
define the next century
.
Leading the world in decarbonisation
It was a combination of resource and ingenuity that enabled the UK to launch the Industrial Revolution some 250 years ago. Today the country is in a similar position of being able to inspire and help transform the world.
As a country – one that I moved to over 20 years ago now – we have decarbonised
at a greater pace than any other
over the past decade. Investing in renewable generation such as wind, solar and biomass has allowed the UK to transform its energy systems and set ambitious targets for
net zero emissions
.
To remain resilient and meet the increased electricity demand of the future, power grids will require
vastly increased support from energy storage systems
such as pumped hydro – as well as flexible, reliable forms of low and zero carbon power generation.
However, the urgency of climate change means the UK must go beyond decarbonisation to implementing
negative emissions technologies
(which remove more carbon dioxide (CO
2
) from the atmosphere than they emit). The CCC, as well as National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios report have emphasised the
necessity of negative emissions for the UK to reach net zero
, by removing CO
2
not just from energy but other industries too.
The UK can build on its global leadership in decarbonisation to invest in the cutting-edge green technology that can take the country to net zero, establishing it as a world leader for others to follow.
Creating an industry, exporting it to the world
When the Paris agreement was signed, I was just joining Drax. I had been impressed by the power station’s
transformation from coal to biomass
– Europe’s largest decarbonisation project – supporting thousands of jobs in the process.
Five years on and I’m excited for the next stage: delivering negative emissions. By
deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
we can permanently remove CO
2
from the atmosphere while producing renewable electricity.
Drax has successfully piloted BECCS and is ready to deploy it at scale as part of our
Zero Carbon Humber
partnership.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and negative emissions
.
I’m confident the partnership with other leading energy, industrial and academic organisations can act as a
revitalising force in a region that has historically been under-invested in
, protect 55,000 jobs and create 50,000 new opportunities.
Developing the supply chain surrounding a world-leading zero-carbon cluster in the Humber could deliver a £3.2 billion economic boost to the wider economy as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.
I believe we can establish a new industry to export globally. The Humber’s ports have a long history of trade and we can build on this legacy. The machinery, equipment and services needed to develop BECCS and Zero Carbon Humber will be an essential export as the rest of the world races to decarbonise.

By providing training and partnering with educational institutions we can increase scientific and technical skills. Net zero industrial clusters can enable more in society the opportunity to have rewarding and fulfilling engineering, energy and environmental careers.
This model can reach around the world – positioning people and businesses to help countries to reach the collective goals of Paris Agreements.
The economic benefits for such achievements far outweigh the costs of failing to stem global warming and we are ready to invest in the technologies needed to do so. With robust government policies in place,
a net zero future could cost as little as 1% of GDP over the next 30 years
.
Countering climate change is a once-in-a-lifetime challenge for the world, but also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a sustainable future with sustainable jobs, improved standards of living, health and wellbeing. The UK has a responsibility to use its expertise and resources, setting in place the structures that can allow companies like mine – Drax – to lead the world to reaching the Paris Agreement’s targets and beyond.
