How is carbon stored?
13 January 2022
Carbon capture

Carbon storage is the process of capturing and trapping that CO
2
. This can occur naturally in the form of carbon sinks like forests, oceans, and soils that store carbon. However, it can also be manually carried out through technology.

One of the most well-established ways of storing carbon through the use of technology is by injecting CO
2
into naturally occurring geological formations that can lock in or sequester the molecule on a permanent basis. Carbon storage is the final phase of the carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) process.
Why do we need to store carbon?
Global bodies like the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as well as the UK’s own Climate Change Committee, emphasise carbon capture and storage as crucial to achieving net zero emissions and meeting the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting temperature rises to within 1.5
o
C.
This includes supporting forest growth through
afforestation and reforestation
, and other nature-based solutions to store carbon,
alongside CCUS technology
.
The
European Commission
also highlights CCUS’s role in balancing increased energy demand and continued fossil fuel use in the future, with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent them entering the atmosphere.
How is carbon captured and transported to storage?
In naturally occurring examples, forests and ocean fauna absorb carbon through photosynthesis. When the vegetation eventually decomposes the carbon is sequestered into soil and seabeds.
Carbon can also be captured from emissions sources such as factories or power plants. The carbon is captured either pre-combustion, where it is removed from the fuel source, or post-combustion, where it is removed from exhaust fumes in the form of CO
2
.
The CO
2
is then converted into a supercritical state where it has the viscosity of a gas but the density of a liquid, meaning it can travel more easily through pipelines. It can also be transported via trucks and ships, but pipelines are the most efficient.
Where can carbon be stored?
Natural carbon sinks differ all over the world, from peatlands in Scotland to Pacific coral reefs to the massive forests that cover countries like Russia, Canada, and Brazil. Wooden buildings also act as carbon storage as they maintain the carbon within the wood for long time periods.
The CO
2
captured by manmade technologies can also be stored in different types of geological formation: unused natural gas reserves, saline aquifers, and un-minable coal mines.
The North Sea, with its expansive layers of porous sandstone, also offers the UK alone an estimated
70 billion tonnes of potential CO
2
storage space
.
If negative emissions technologies (which actively remove emissions from the atmosphere) were to capture and store the equivalent amount of CO
2
as the 258 million tonnes expected to remain in the UK economy in 2050, it would take up just 0.36% of the available storage space.
Years of research by the oil and gas industries mean many such geological structures have been mapped and are well understood all around the world.
Carbon storage fast facts
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that an accumulative 100 billion tonnes (or 100 gigatonnes) of CO
2

must be stored by 2060 to limit global warming
to a 2
o
C increase
Globally, peatland soils contain more than
600 gigatonnes of carbon
, exceeding the carbon stored in all other vegetation types including the world’s forests
The United States Geological Survey estimates the country has a mean storage potential of
3,000 gigatonnes of CO
2
More than 98% of injected CO
2
will
remain stored for over 10,000 years
Over 25 million tonnes of captured carbon was
permanently stored in sites
across Brazil, Norway, and the United States in 2019
How is the carbon kept in place?
In nature-based carbon sinks the carbon does not always remain in one location. In a forest, for example, trees and plants will hold carbon until the end of their lifetime after which they decompose, releasing some CO
2
into the atmosphere while some is sequestered into soil.
When CO
2
captured through CCUS is stored
several things can happen
to it in a geological storage site. It can be caught in the minute intervening spaces within the rock through capillary action, or trapped by a layer of impermeable cap-rock, which prevents it from moving upwards.
CO
2
may also dissolve in the water and then sinks as it is heavier than normal water. The carbonated water
reacts with basaltic rocks
which cover most of the ocean floor. The reaction releases elements like calcium, magnesium, and iron into the water stream. Over time, these elements combine with the dissolved CO
2
to form stable carbonate minerals that permanently fill pores within the rock.
How does
CO
2
enter the storage sites?
The CO
2
is injected into the porous rocks of depleted or unused natural gas or oil reserves, as well as saline aquifers – geologic strata, filled with brine or saline water. Porous rock is filled with holes and gaps between the grains that make up the rock. When CO
2
is injected into these structures, the CO
2
floods the pores, displacing the brine or remnants of oil and gas. It then spreads out and is trapped in the dome-like structures of the rock strata called anticlines.
How long can
CO
2
be stored?
Appropriately selected and maintained geological reservoirs are “very likely” to retain 99% of sequestered carbon for more than 100 years and are “likely” to retain 99% of sequestered carbon for more than 1,000 years, according to the
2005 Special Report on CCS
by the IPCC. Another
study by Nature
found that more than 98% of injected CO
2
will remain stored for over 10,000 years.
In natural carbon sinks, the length of time that carbon is stored varies and depends on environments being preserved. Peatland, for example,
builds up over thousands of years
storing carbon. However, as peatlands degrade from attempts to drain them to create arable land, as well as peat extraction for fuel, they begin to emit CO
2
. The lifecycle of a tree by contrast is relatively short before it decomposes and releases some CO
2
back into the atmosphere.
The ability for geological storage to contain CO
2
for millennia means it can truly remove and permanently store emissions.

Forests, net zero and the science behind biomass
22 December 2021
Sustainable bioenergy

Tackling climate change and spurring a global transition to net zero emissions will require collaboration between science and industry. New technologies and decarbonisation methods must be rooted in scientific research and testing.
Drax has almost a decade of experience in using
biomass as a renewable source of power
. Over that time, our understanding around the effectiveness of bioenergy, its role in improving
forest health
and ability to deliver negative emissions, has accelerated.
Research from governments and global organisations, such as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
increasingly highlight sustainably sourced biomass and bioenergy’s role
in achieving net zero on a wide scale.
The European Commission
has also highlighted biomass’ potential to provide a solution that delivers both renewable energy and healthy, sustainably managed forests.  Frans Timmermans, the executive vice-president of the European Commission in charge of the European Green Deal has emphasised it’s importance in bringing economies to net zero, saying: “without biomass, we’re not going to make it. We need biomass in the mix, but the right biomass in the mix.”
The role of biomass in a sustainable future
Moving away from fossil fuels means building an electricity system that is primarily based on renewables. Supporting wind and solar, by providing electricity at times of low sunlight or wind levels, will require flexible sources of generation, such as biomass, as well as other technologies like
increased energy storage
.
In the UK, the Climate Change Committee’s (CCC)
Sixth Carbon Budget
report lays out its Balanced Net Zero Pathway. In this lead scenario, the CCC says that bioenergy can reduce fossil emissions across the whole economy by 2 million tonnes of CO
2
or equivalent emissions (MtCO
2
e) per year by 2035, increasing to 2.5 MtCO2e in 2045.
Foresters in working forest, Mississippi
Biomass is also expected to play a crucial role in supplying biofuels and hydrogen production for sectors of the global economy that will continue to use fuel rather than electricity, such as aviation, shipping and industrial processes. The CCC’s Balanced Net Zero Pathway suggest that enough low-carbon hydrogen and bioenergy will be needed to deliver 425 TWh of non-electric power in 2050 – compared to the 1,000 TWh of power fossil fuels currently provide to industries today.
However, bioenergy can only be considered to be good for the climate if the biomass used comes from sustainably managed sources. Good forest management practises ensure that forests remain sustainable sources of woody biomass and effective carbon sinks.
A report co-authored by IPCC experts
examines the scientific literature around the climate effects (principally CO
2
abatement) of sourcing biomass for bioenergy from forests managed according to sustainable forest management principles and practices.
The report highlights the dual impact managed forests contribute to climate change mitigation by providing material for forest products, including biomass that replace greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive fossil fuels, and by storing carbon in forests and in long-lived forest products.
The role of biomass and bioenergy in decarbonising economies goes beyond just replacing fossil fuels. The addition of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to bioenergy to create
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
enables renewable power generation while removing carbon from the atmosphere and carbon cycle permanently.
The
negative emissions made possible by BECCS
are now seen as a fundamental part of many scenarios to limit global warming to 1.5
o
C above pre-industrial levels.
BECCS and the path to net zero
The IPCC’s special report on limiting global warming to 1.5
o
C above pre-industrial levels, emphasises that even across a wide range of scenarios for energy systems, all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy – coupled with effective land-use that prevents it contributing to deforestation.
The
second chapter of the report
deals with pathways that can bring emissions down to zero by the mid-century. Bioenergy use is substantial in 1.5°C pathways with or without CCS due to its multiple roles in decarbonising both electricity generation and other industries that depend on fossil fuels.
However, it’s the negative emissions made possible by BECCS that make biomass  instrumental in multiple net zero scenarios. The IPCC report highlights
BECCS alongside the associated afforestation and reforestation
(AR), that comes with sustainable forest management, are key components in pathways that limit climate change to 1.5
o
C.

There are two key factors that make BECCS and other forms of emissions removals so essential: The first is their ability to neutralise residual emissions from sources that are not reducing their emissions fast enough and those that are difficult or even impossible to fully decarbonise. Aviation and agriculture are two sectors vital to the global economy with hard-to-abate emissions. Negative emissions technologies can remove an equivalent amount of CO
2
that these industries produce helping balance emissions and progressing economies towards net zero.
The second reason BECCS and other negative emissions technologies will be so important in the future is in the removal of historic CO
2
emissions. What makes CO
2
such an important GHG to reduce and remove is that it lasts much longer in the atmosphere than any other. To help reach the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting temperature rises to below 1.5
o
C removing historic emissions from the atmosphere will be essential.
In the UK, the  CCC’s 2018 report ‘
Biomass in a low-carbon economy
’ also points to BECCS as both a crucial source of energy and emissions abatement.
It suggests that power generation from BECCS will increase from 3 TWh per year in 2035 to 45 TWh per year in 2050. It marks a sharp increase from the 19.5 TWh that biomass (without CCS) accounted for across 2020, according to
Electric Insights
data. It also suggests that BECCS could sequester 1.1 tonnes of CO
2
for every tonne of biomass used, providing clear negative emissions.
However, the report makes clear that unlocking the potential of bioenergy and BECCS is only possible when biomass stocks are managed in a sustainable way that, as a minimum requirement, maintains the carbon stocks in plants and soils over time.
With increased attention paid to forest management and land use, there is a growing body of evidence that points to bioenergy as a win-win solution that can decarbonise power and economies, while supporting healthy forests that effectively sequester CO
2
.
How bioenergy ensures sustainable forests
Biomass used in electricity generation and other industries must come from sustainable sources to offer a renewable, climate beneficial [or low carbon] source of power.
UK legislation
on biomass sourcing states that operators must maintain an adequate inventory of the trees in the area (including data on the growth of the trees and on the extraction of wood) to ensure that wood is extracted from the area at a rate that does not exceed its long-term capacity to produce wood. This is designed to ensure that areas where biomass is sourced from retain their productivity and ability to continue sequestering carbon.
Ensuring that forestland remains productive and protected from land-use changes, such as urban creep, where vegetated land is converted into urban, concreted spaces, depends on a healthy market for wood products. Industries such as construction and furniture offer higher prices for higher-quality wood. While low-quality, waste wood, as well as residues from forests and wood-industry by-products, can be bought and used to produce
biomass pellets
.
A report by
Forest 2 Market
examined the relationship between demand for wood and forests’ productivity and ability to sequester carbon in the US South, where Drax sources about two-thirds of its biomass.
The report found that increased demand for wood did not displace forests in the US South. Instead, it encouraged landowners to invest in productivity improvements that increased the amount of wood fibre and therefore carbon contained in the region’s forests.
A
synthesis report
, which examines a broad range of research papers,  published in Forest Ecology and Management in March of 2021, concluded from existing studies that claims of large-scale damage to biodiversity from woody biofuel in the South East US are not supported. The use of these forest residues as an energy source was also found to lead to net GHG greenhouse emissions savings compared to fossil fuels,
according to Forest Research
.
Importantly the research shows that climate risks are not exacerbated because of biomass sourcing; in fact, the opposite is true with
annual wood growth in the US South increasing by 112% between 1953 and 2015
.
Delivering a “win-win solution”
The European Commission’s JRC Science for Policy literature review and knowledge synthesis report ‘
The use of woody biomass for energy production in the EU’
suggests  a win-win forest bioenergy pathway is possible, that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term, while at the same time not damaging, or even improving, the condition of forest ecosystems.
However, it also makes clear “lose-lose” situations is also a possible, in which forest ecosystems are damaged without providing carbon emission reductions in policy-relevant timeframes.
Win-win management practices must benefit climate change mitigation and have either a neutral or positive effect on biodiversity. A win-win future would see the afforestation of former arable land with diverse, naturally regenerated and dedicated industrial forests.
The report also warns of trade-offs between local biodiversity and mitigating carbon emissions, or vice versa. These must be carefully navigated to avoid creating a lose-lose scenario where biodiversity is damaged and natural forests are converted into plantations, while BECCS fails to deliver the necessary negative emissions.
In a future that will depend on science working in collaboration with industries to build a net zero future continued research is key to ensuring biomass can deliver the win-win solution of renewable electricity with negative emissions while supporting healthy forests.

The jobs needed to build a net zero energy future
11 November 2021
Sustainable business

Many components are needed to tackle climate change and reach environmental milestones such as meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. One of those components is the right workforce, large enough and with the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the green energy jobs of a low-carbon future. In 2020, the renewable energy sector employed
11.5 million people
around the world, but as the industry continues to expand that workforce will only grow.
Last year, a National Grid report found that in the UK alone,
120,000 jobs will need to be filled in the low-carbon energy sector by 2030
, to meet the country’s climate objectives. That figure is expected to rise to 400,000 by 2050.  The UK energy sector as a whole currently supports
738,000 jobs
and much of this workforce already has the skills needed for a low carbon society . Others can be reskilled and retrained, helping to bolster the future workforce by supporting employees through the green transition.
At a global level energy sector jobs are expected to increase from
18 million to 26 million by 2050
. Jobs that will span the full energy spectrum; from researching and advising on low-carbon solutions to installing and implementing them.
Here are some of the roles that will be key to the low-carbon energy transformation:
A wind farm under construction off the English coast
Wind turbine technicians
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), wind power is this year set for a
17% increase in global energy generation
compared to 2020, the biggest increase of any renewable power source. The IEA also forecasts that wind power will need to
grow tenfold by 2050
if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. It’s not surprising, therefore, that wind turbine technicians – the professionals who install, inspect, maintain, and repair wind turbines – are in high demand. In the US, wind turbine technician is the fastest-growing job in the country – with
68% growth projected over the 2020-2030 period
– to give just one example.
In the UK, many wind turbine technicians have a background in engineering or experience from the wider energy sector. Although there are wind turbine technician and maintenance courses available, they are not a prerequisite, and many employers offer apprenticeships and on-the-job training – smoothing the path for energy professionals to transition into the role.
Solar panel installers
Today, solar photovoltaic (solar PV) is the biggest global employer in renewable energy, accounting for
3.8 million jobs
. The IEA also reported a
23% uptick in solar PV installations
around the world in 2020. In the UK, there are currently
13.2 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar power capacity
. Trade association Solar Energy UK predicts this will need to rise to at least
40 GW by 2030
if the UK is to succeed in becoming a net zero economy by 2050. The trade association believes this could see the creation of 13,000 new solar energy jobs.
Solar panel installers – who carry out the important job of installing and maintaining solar PV – are essential to a low-carbon future. Many solar panel installers in the UK come from a background in electrical installation or have transitioned from engineering. While there are training courses specifically designed for solar panel installers, they are not a necessity, particularly if you already have on-the-job experience in a relevant sector. This makes a move to becoming a solar panel installer relatively easy for someone already working in energy or with a mind for engineering.
Energy consultants
Businesses of all kinds must play a role in the transition to net zero. Organisations must be able to manage their energy use and begin switching to renewable sources. As professionals who advise companies on this process, renewable energy consultants are a key part of the green energy workforce. Aspects of the job include identifying how organisations use their electric assets and helping businesses optimise those assets to build responsiveness and flexibility into energy-intensive operations. The core responsibilities of a renewable energy consultant are to reduce a company’s environmental impact while helping the business reduce energy costs and identifying opportunities.
Carbon accountants
A growing number of businesses are setting targets for reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. But that’s only possible if you can first determine what your GHG emissions are and where they come from, which is where the relatively young field of carbon accounting comes in. Through what is known as physical carbon accounting, companies can assess the emissions their activities generate, and where in the supply chain the emissions are occurring. This allows businesses to implement more accurate actions and be realistic in their timelines for reducing emissions.
On a wider scale, accurate carbon accounting will be crucial in certifying emissions reductions or abatement, as well as in the distribution of carbon credits or penalties as whole economies push towards net zero.
Battery technology researchers
Energy storage is essential to a low-carbon energy future
.  The ability to store and release energy from intermittent sources such as wind and solar will be crucial in meeting demand and balancing a renewables-driven grid.
While many forms of energy storage already exist
, developing electric batteries that can be deployed at scale is still a comparatively new and expanding area.
Global patenting activities in the field of batteries and other electricity storage
increased at an annual rate of 14%
–  four times faster than the average for technology – between 2005 and 2018. However, it’s estimated that to meet climate objectives, the world will need nearly 10,000 GW hours of battery and other electricity storage by 2040. This is 50 times the current level and research and innovation will be crucial to delivering bigger and more efficient batteries.
Farmers and foresters
How we use and manage land will be important in lowering carbon emissions and creating a sustainable future for people and the planet. Crops like corn, sugarcane, and soybean can serve as feedstock for biofuel and bioenergy, and farming by-products such as cow manure can be used in the development of biofuel.
Techniques adopted in the agricultural sector will also be important in optimising soil sequestration capabilities while ensuring it is nutrient-rich enough to grow food. These techniques include the
use of biochar
, a solid form of charcoal produced by heating biomass without oxygen. Research indicates that biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for centuries or longer. It also helps soil retain water and could contribute to reducing the use of fertilisers by making the soil more nutrient-dense.
Forests, meanwhile, provide material for industries like construction, the by-products from which can serve as feedstock for woody biomass, primarily in the shape of low-grade wood that would otherwise remain unused. Sustainably managed forests, such as those from which Drax sources its biomass, have two-fold importance. They both enable woody biomass for bioenergy and ensure CO
2
is removed from the atmosphere as part of the natural carbon cycle.
Biofuel engineers and scientists
Farmers and foresters provide feedstock for biofuels, but it’s biofuel scientists and engineers who research, develop, and enhance them, opening the door to alternative fuels for vehicles, heating, and even jet engines.
According to the IEA, production of biofuel that can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector grew 6% in 2019. However, the organisation forecasts that production will
need to increase 10% annually until 2030
to be in line with Paris Agreement climate targets.
Scientific innovations that can help boost the production of biofuel around the world, therefore, continues to be vital. As is the work of biofuel engineers who assess and improve existing biofuel systems and develop new ones that can replace fossil fuels like petrol and diesel.
The wealth of knowledge around fuels in the oil and gas industries means there is ample opportunity for scientists and engineers who work with fossil fuels to bring their skills to crucial low-carbon roles.
Geologists
The overriding goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to
“well below” 2
and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. This is an objective the IEA has said will be “
virtually impossible” to fulfil
without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. CCS entails capturing CO
2
and transporting it for safe and permanent underground storage in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas fields, coal seams, and saline aquifers.
According to the Global CCS Institute, the world will need a
100-fold increase on the 27 CCS project
currently in operation by 2050. Knowledge and research into rock types, formations, and reactivity will be important in helping identify sites deep underground that can be used for safe, permanent carbon storage, and sequestration. Skills and expertise gained in the oil and gas industries will allow professionals in these sectors to make the switch from careers in fossil fuel to roles that help power a net zero economy.

Chemists
The role of chemists is also vital to decarbonisation. Knowledge and research around CO
2
is a potent force in the effort to reduce and remove it from the atmosphere.
Technologies like CCS,
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECSS
) and
direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS
) are based around such research. Carbon capture processes are chemical reactions between emissions streams and solvents, often based on amines, and GHGs. Understanding and controlling these processes makes chemistry a key component of delivering carbon capture at the scale needed to help meet climate targets.
Chemists’ role in decarbonisation is far from limited to carbon capture methods. From battery technology to reforestation, chemists’ understanding of the elements can help drive action against climate change.
Bringing together disciplines
Tackling climate change on the scale needed to achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement depends on collaboration between industries, countries, and disciplines. Decarbonisation projects such as the UK’s East Coast Cluster, which encompasses both
Zero Carbon Humber
and Net Zero Teesside, fuse engineering and construction jobs with scientific and academic work.
Zero Carbon Humber, which brings together 12 organisations, including Drax, is expected to create as many as
47,800 jobs in the region by 2027
. Among these are construction sector jobs for welders, pipefitters, machine installers and technicians. In addition, indirect jobs are predicted to be created across supply chains, from material manufacturing to the logistics of supporting a workforce.
Meeting climate challenges and delivering projects on the scale of Zero Carbon Humber, depends on creating an energy workforce that combines the knowledge of the past with the green energy skills of the future.
Drax’s apprenticeships have readied workers for the energy sector for decades, and will continue to do so as we build a low-carbon future. Options include
four-year technical apprenticeships
in mechanical, electrical, and control and instrumentation engineering. Getting on-the-job training and practical experience, apprentices receive a nationally recognised qualification, such as a BTEC or an NVQ Level 3, at the end of the programme.
Apprentices at Drax Power Station [2021]
The workforce needed to make low carbon societies a reality will be a diverse one – stretching from apprentices to experienced professionals with a background in traditional or renewable energy. It will also span every aspect of the renewable energy field, from the chemists and biofuel scientists who develop key technologies to the solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians who fit and maintain the necessary equipment.
The skills needed to take on these roles are already plentiful in the UK and around the world. Overcoming challenges on the road to net zero requires refocussing these existing talents, skills, and careers towards a new goal.

Transporting carbon – How to safely move CO
2
from the atmosphere to permanent storage
15 October 2021
Carbon capture

Key points
Carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) offers a unique opportunity to capture and store the UK’s emissions and help the country reach its climate goals.
Carbon dioxide (CO
2
) can be stored in geological reservoirs under the North Sea, but getting it from source to storage will need a large and safe CO
2
transportation network.
The UK already has a long history and extensive infrastructure for transporting gas across the country for heating, cooking and power generation.
This provides a foundation of knowledge and experience on which to build a network to transport CO
2
.
Across the length of the UK is an underground network similar to the trainlines and roadways that crisscross the country above ground. These pipes aren’t carrying water or broadband, but gas. Natural gas is a cornerstone of the UK’s energy, powering our heating, cooking and electricity generation. But like the country’s energy network, the need to reduce emissions and meet the UK’s target of
net zero emissions by 2050
is set to change this.
Today, this network of pipes takes fossil fuels from underground formations deep beneath the North Sea bed and distributes it around the UK to be burned – producing emissions. A similar system of subterranean pipelines could soon be used to transport captured emissions, such as CO
2
, away from industrial clusters around factories and power stations,
locking them away underground, permanently and safely
.

The rise of
CCUS
technology is the driving force behind CO
2
transportation. The process captures CO
2
from emissions sources and transports it to sites such as deep natural storage enclaves far below the seabed.
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
takes this a step further. BECCS uses sustainable biomass to generate renewable electricity. This biomass comes from sources, such as forest residues or agricultural waste products, which remove CO
2
from the atmosphere as they grow. Atmospheric CO
2
released in the combustion of the biomass is then captured, transported and stored at sites such as deep geological formations.
Across the whole BECCS process, CO
2
has gone from the atmosphere to being permanently trapped away, reducing the overall amount of CO
2
in the atmosphere and delivering
what’s known as negative emissions
.
BECCS is a crucial technology
for reaching net zero emissions by 2050, but how can we ensure the CO
2
is safely transported from the emissions source to storage sites?
Moving gases around safely
Moving gases of any kind through pipelines is all about pressure. Gases always travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. By compressing gas to a high pressure, it allows it to flow to other locations. Compressor stations along a gas pipeline help to maintain right the pressure, while metering stations check pressure levels and look out for leaks.
The greater the pressure difference between two points, the faster gases will flow. In the case of CO
2
, high absolute pressures also cause it to become what’s known as a supercritical fluid. This means it has the density of a liquid but the viscosity of a gas, properties that make it easier to transport through long pipelines.
Since 1967 when North Sea natural gas first arrived in the UK, our natural gas transmission network has expanded considerably, and is today made up of almost
290,000 km of pipelines
that run the length of the country. Along with that physical footprint is an extensive knowledge pool and a set of well-enforced regulations monitoring their operation.
While moving gas through pipelines across the country is by no means new, the idea of CO
2
transportation through pipelines is. But it’s not unprecedented, as it has been carried out since the 1980s at scale across North America. In contrast to BECCS, which would transport CO
2
to remove and permanently store emissions, most of the CO
2
transport in action today is used in oil enhanced recovery – a means of ejecting more fossil fuels from depleted oil wells. However, the principle of moving CO
2
safely over long distances remains relevant – there are already 2,500 km of pipelines in the western USA, transporting as much as 50 million tonnes of CO
2
a year.
“People might worry when there is something new moving around in the country, but the science community doesn’t have sleepless nights about CO
2
pipelines,” says Dr Hannah Chalmers, from the University of Edinburgh. “It wouldn’t explode, like natural gas might, that’s just not how the molecule works. If it’s properly installed and regulated, there’s no reason to be concerned.”
CO
2
is not the same as the methane-based natural gas that people use every day. For one, it is a much more stable, inert molecule, meaning it does not react with other molecules, and it doesn’t fuel explosions in the same way natural gas would.
CO
2
has long been understood and there is a growing body of research around transporting and storing it in a safe efficient way that can make CCUS and BECCS a catalyst in reducing the UK’s emissions and future-proofing its economy.
Working with CO
2
across the UK
Working with CO
2
while it is in a supercritical state mean it’s not just easier to move around pipes. In this state CO
2
can also be loaded onto ships in very large quantities, as well as injected into rock formations that once trapped oil and gas, or salt-dense water reserves.
Decades of extracting fossil fuels from the North Sea means it is extensively mapped and the rock formations well understood. The expansive layers of porous sandstone that lie beneath offer the UK an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential CO
2
storage space – something a number of industrial clusters on the UK’s east coast are exploring as part of their plans to decarbonise.

Drax is already running a pilot BECCS project at its power station in North Yorkshire. As part of the Zero Carbon Humber partnership and wider East Coast Cluster, Drax is involved in the development of large scale carbon storage capabilities in the North Sea that can serve the Humber and Teesside industrial clusters. As Drax moves towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030, transporting CO
2
safely at scale is a key focus.
“Much of the research and engineering has already been done around the infrastructure side of the project,” explains Richard Gwilliam, Head of Cluster Development at Drax. “Transporting and storing CO2 captured by the BECCS projects is well understood thanks to extensive engineering investigations already completed both onshore and offshore in the Yorkshire region.”
This also includes research and development into pipes of different materials, carrying CO
2
at different pressures and temperatures, as well as fracture and safety testing.
The potential for the UK to build on this foundation and progress towards net zero is considerable. However, for it to fully manifest it will need
commitment at a national level
to building the additional infrastructure required. The results of such a commitment could be far reaching.
In the Humber alone, 20% of economic value comes from energy and emissions-intensive industries, and as many as 360,000 jobs are supported by industries like refining, petrochemicals, manufacturing and power generation. Putting in place the technology and infrastructure to
capture, transport and store emissions will protect those industries
while helping the UK reach its climate goals.
It’s just a matter of putting the pipes in place.

What is direct air carbon capture and storage (DACS)?
9 July 2021
Carbon capture

What is direct air carbon capture and storage (DACS)?
Direct air carbon capture and storage (DACS, sometimes referred to as DAC or DACCS) is one of the few technologies that can remove
carbon dioxide
(CO
2
) from the atmosphere. Unlike other carbon removal technologies that capture CO
2
emissions during the process of generating electricity or heat, DACS can be deployed anywhere in the world it can tap into a supply of electricity.
CO
2
removal is crucial to meeting the
international climate goals
set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. But it’s not enough just to cut CO
2
emissions, to achieve
net zero
, it will also be necessary to remove the CO
2
that two centuries of industrialisation have released into the environment. As a technology that removes more CO
2
from the atmosphere than it releases – assuming it is powered by green electricity – DACS has the potential to play a key role in this process.
How does DACS work?
DACS could be described as a form of industrial photosynthesis. Just as plants use photosynthesis to convert sunlight and CO
2
into sugar, DACS systems use electricity to remove CO
2
from the atmosphere using fans and filters.
Air is drawn into the DACS system using an industrial scale fan.
Liquid DACS systems
pass the air through a chemical solution which removes the CO
2
and returns the rest of the air back into the atmosphere.
Solid DACS systems
captures CO
2
on the surface of a filter covered in a chemical agent, where it then forms a compound. The new compound is heated, releasing the CO
2
to be captured and separating it from the chemical agent, which can then be recycled.
The captured CO
2
can then be compressed under very high pressure and pumped via pipelines into
deep geological formations
. This permanent storage process is known as ‘sequestration’.
Alternatively, the CO
2
can be pumped under low pressure for immediate use in commercial processes, such as carbonating drinks or cement manufacturing.
A
2021 study by the Coalition for Negative Emissions
shows that DACS could provide at least 1Gt of sustainable negative emissions by 2025
DACS fast facts
Human activities
have raised
atmospheric concentrations of CO
2
by 48% above pre-industrial levels found in 1850.
During prehistoric ice ages, CO
2
levels were around 200 parts per million (ppm).
The average level in 2020 was more than 417ppm.
101 out of 116 of the IPCC scenarios mitigating greenhouse gas emissions depend on
using negative emissions technology
, including DACS.
What role can DACS play in decarbonisation?
CO
2
is in the air at the same concentration everywhere in the world. This means that DACS plants can be located anywhere, unlike carbon capture systems that remove CO
2
from industrial processes at source.
There are 15 DACS plants currently in operation worldwide –
Climeworks
operates three in Switzerland, Iceland and Italy. Together, these small-scale plants capture approximately 9,000 tonnes of CO
2
per annum.
The first large-scale plant
, currently being developed in the Permian Basin, Texas, is expected to capture 1,000,000 tonnes (one megatonne) per annum when it becomes operational in 2025.
At just 0.04%, the concentration of CO
2
in the atmosphere is very dilute which makes removing and storing it a challenge. This means that DACS costs significantly more than some other CO
2
capture technologies – between $200 and $600 (£156-468) per metric tonne. The process also requires large amounts of energy, which adds to the demand for electricity.
However, DACS has the potential to become an important piece in the jigsaw of CO
2
removal technologies and techniques that includes nature-based solutions such as planting forests, along with
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
, soil sequestration and ‘blue carbon’ marine initiatives.

Landmark moments on the path to a net zero UK
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
10 June 2021
Opinion

In brief
£75m backing for Zero Carbon Humber to develop net zero technologies
Accenture and World Economic Forum report says Humber could decarbonise quicker than any other UK industrial region
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries partners with Drax, supplying its advanced carbon capture technology, making millions of tonnes of negative emissions possible at Drax Power Station this decade
Deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in the 2020s will have ‘positive spillover’ for a net zero economy, says Frontier Economics
Delaying BECCS until the 2030s, argues Baringa research, could increase energy system costs by £4.5bn
Planning consent process for BECCS at Drax from 2027 is underway, with public consulted
Drax and Bechtel studying global BECCS deployments
Around the world governments, industries and societies have begun to set themselves targets for reaching net zero but it is at home in the UK where real progress is starting to be made in answering some of the tougher challenges posed by the global environmental crisis.
Eyebrows were raised when the UK set itself one of the most stretching timeframes in which to decarbonise but like many business leaders, I am firmly of the belief that this ambitious target will be the catalyst to deliver the innovative thinking needed to get the planet to where it needs to be.
I was delighted to learn recently that Government has awarded the Zero Carbon Humber partnership
£75 million
in funding to develop world-leading net zero technologies.
MHI BECCS pilot plant within CCUS Incubation Area, Drax Power Station, North Yorkshire
Drax was one of the founder members of the Partnership and its goal is to build the world’s first net zero industrial cluster and decarbonise the North of England. Along with the other members, we worked hard to secure this Government support and it consists of money from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy’s Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge fund, with two thirds coming from private backing. This financing is a vote of confidence from investors and highlights the Government’s commitment to developing the world’s first zero-carbon industrial cluster in the region.
Projects of this scale, backed with meaningful funding, are key to accelerating a range of technologies that will be essential to advancing decarbonisation. These include hydrogen production, carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) and
negative emissions
through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). But more than just having a positive effect on reducing emissions, delivering this in the Humber will also support clean economic growth and future-proof vital industries.

I believe that in a similar way to how renewables have made huge strides in helping decarbonise power, a range of new technologies are now needed to decarbonise industry and industrial regions. Our work as a partnership in the Humber is establishing a landmark project for the UK and the world’s journey to
net zero
and clean growth.
Reaching net zero depends on a diverse range of technologies
There are many factors that will be essential for the
world to reach net zero
, but perhaps none more important than open collaboration and integration. Government, industry and individual businesses will need to work together and share learnings and infrastructure to be able to make true progress. This collaboration will of course take many forms, but one that is crucially important is industrial clusters, such as Zero Carbon Humber and neighbouring Net Zero Teesside.
A recent report by Accenture
highlighted how vital decarbonising industrial regions will be to reaching climate goals. Industrial carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions account for as much as 11 gigatonnes, or 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). However, the report also highlights the opportunities, both environmental and economic, in decarbonising clusters. The market for global industrial efficiency alone is expected to receive investments worth as much as $40bn, while the global hydrogen market was estimated at around $175bn in 2019.
The Humber is the UK’s largest cluster by industrial emissions, emitting 10 million tonnes of CO
2
per year – more than 2% of the UK’s total GHG emissions. Pioneering projects around hydrogen production, CCUS and
negative emissions through BECCS
are all ready to scale in the region, beginning the task of reducing and removing emissions. The potential benefit to the regional economy could also be significant – it’s estimated these technologies could create
48,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs
in the Humber region by 2027. This new £75 million in funding will allow work to gather pace on these transformational projects.
The funding will be used to obtain land rights and begin front-end engineering design (FEED) for the hydrogen facility at H2H Saltend, as well as onshore pipeline infrastructure for CO
2
and hydrogen. It marks the beginning of the vital work of putting transportation systems in place that will take captured CO
2
from Drax Power Station’s BECCS generating units and permanently store it under the southern North Sea’s bed.
Drax’s BECCS power generation is one of Zero Carbon Humber’s anchor projects. Our recently confirmed partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will see its Advanced KM CDR™️ carbon capture technology deployed at Drax Power Station. The negative emissions that this long-term agreement will make possible, will enable the region to reduce its emissions faster than any other UK cluster,
according to Accenture
. Developing negative emissions through BECCS will help us achieve our ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030. By that time, Drax Power Station could remove 8 million tonnes of CO
2
from the atmosphere each year, playing a major part in helping the UK meet its climate goals.
From BECCS to a net zero UK
In March 2021, Drax kickstarted the process to gain the necessary planning permissions called a
Development Consent Order (DCO) from the Government
. It’s a crucial administrative step towards delivering a BECCS unit as early as 2027, and a landmark moment in developing negative emissions in the UK.
A
report by Frontier Economics for Drax
highlights BECCS as a necessary step on the UK’s path to decarbonisation. Developing a first-of-a-kind BECCS power plant would also have ‘positive spillover’ effects that can contribute to wider decarbonisation and a net zero economy. These include learnings and efficiencies that come from developing and operating the country’s first BECCS power station, as well as transport and storage infrastructure, which will reduce the cost of subsequent BECCS, negative emissions and other CCS projects.
However, the benefits of acting quickly and pioneering BECCS deployment at scale can only be achieved if policy is put in place to enable the right business models for BECCS and negative emissions. According to the Frontier report, intervention is needed to
instil confidence in investors while also protecting consumer energy prices
from spikes.
Inside MHI pilot carbon capture plant, Drax Power Station
Failure to implement negative emissions through BECCS could also be costly. Time is of the essence for the UK to reach net zero by 2050 and
research by energy consultancy Baringa
, commissioned by Drax, highlights the economic cost of hesitation. Findings showed that delaying BECCS from 2027 to 2030 could increase energy system costs by more than £4.5bn over the coming decade and over £5bn by the time the UK has to reach net zero.
I believe what we are developing at Drax can become a world-leading and exportable solution for large-scale carbon negative power generation. The potential in negative emissions is economic as well as environmental, protecting thousands of jobs in the UK’s carbon-intensive industries, as well as overseas.
BECCS offers great potential for the UK to export skills, knowledge and equipment to an international market. To help establish this market we are
working with engineering and construction project management firm Bechtel
to explore locations globally where there is the opportunity to deploy BECCS, and identify how new-build BECCS plants can be optimised to deliver negative emissions for those regions.
Pictured L-R: Kentaro Hosomi, Chief Regional Officer EMEA, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI); Jenny Blyth, Project Analyst, Drax Group at Drax Power Station, North Yorkshire; Carl Clayton, Head of BECCS, Drax Group;
Multiple government and independent organisations have highlighted how essential negative emissions are to reaching net zero in the UK, as well as global climate goals. The recently formed
Coalition for Negative Emissions
aims to advance this vital industry at a global scale. By uniting a range of negative emissions providers and users from across industries, we can make it a more powerful force for decarbonisation and sustainable growth.
It will still be a long journey towards the UK’s goals, but the Government’s funding for Zero Carbon Humber, the beginning of our BECCS DCO and partnerships with MHI and Bechtel are key steps on the path to reaching net zero by 2050. I, for one, am excited to be on this journey.

How to build a business model for negative emissions
10 May 2021
Carbon capture

In brief
Policy intervention is needed to enable enough BECCS in power to make a net zero UK economy possible by 2050
Early investment in BECCS can insure against the risk and cost of delaying significant abatement efforts into the 2030s and 2040s
A two-part business model for BECCS of carbon payment and power CfD offers a clear path to technology neutral and subsidy free GGRs
The UK’s electricity system is based on a market of buying and
selling power and other services
. For this to work electricity must be affordable to consumers, but the parties providing power must be able to cover the costs of generating electricity,
emitting carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
and getting electricity to where it needs to be.
This process has thrived and proved adaptable enough to rapidly
decarbonise the electricity system
in the space of a decade.
With a
58% reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation
, the UK’s electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies. As the UK pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, new technologies are needed, and the market must extend to enable innovation.
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is one of the key technologies
needed at scale
for the UK to reach net zero. Yet there is no market for the negative emissions BECCS can deliver, in contrast to other
energy system services
.
BECCS has been repeatedly flagged as vital for the UK to reach its climate goals, owing to its ability to
deliver negative emissions
. The Climate Change Committee has demonstrated that negative emissions – also known as greenhouse gas removals (GGRs) or carbon removals – will be needed at scale to achieve net zero, to offset residual emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors such as aviation and agriculture. But there is no economic mechanism to reward negative emissions in the energy market.
For decarbonisation technologies like BECCS in power to develop to the scale and within the timeframe needed, the Government must
implement the necessary policies
to incentivise investment, and allow them to thrive as part of the energy and carbon markets.
BECCS is essential to bringing the whole economy to net zero
The primary benefit of BECCS in power is its ability to deliver negative emissions by removing CO
2
from the atmosphere through
responsibly managed forests
, energy crops or agricultural residues, then storing the same amount of CO
2
underground, while producing reliable, renewable electricity.
Looking down above units one through five within Drax Power Station
A
new report by Frontier Economics
for Drax highlights BECCS as a necessary cornerstone of UK decarbonisation and its wider impacts on a net zero economy. Developing a first-of-a-kind BECCS power plant would have ‘positive spillover’ effects that contribute to wider decarbonisation, green growth and the UK’s ability to meet its legally-binding climate commitments by 2050.
Drax has a unique opportunity to fit
carbon capture and storage (CCS)
equipment to its existing biomass generation units, to turn its North Yorkshire site into what could be the world’s first
carbon negative
power station.
Plans are underway to build a CO
2
pipeline in the Yorkshire and Humber region, which would move carbon captured from at Drax out to a
safe, long-term storage
site deep below the North Sea. This infrastructure would be shared with other CCS projects in the
Zero Carbon Humber partnership
, enabling the UK’s most carbon-intensive region to become the world’s first net zero industrial cluster.
Developing BECCS can also have spillover benefits for other emerging industries. Lessons that come from developing and operating the first BECCS power stations, as well as transport and storage infrastructure, will reduce the cost of subsequent BECCS, negative emissions and other CCS projects.
Hydrogen production, for example, is regarded as a key to providing
low, zero or carbon negative alternatives to natural gas
in power, industry, transport and heating. Learnings from increased bioenergy usage in BECCS can help develop biomass gasification as a means of hydrogen production, as well as applying CCS to other production methods.
The economic value of these positive spillovers from BECCS can be far reaching, but they will not be felt unless BECCS can achieve a robust business model in the immediate future.
With a 58% reduction in the carbon intensity of power generation, the UK’s electricity has decarbonised twice as fast as that of other major economies. As the UK pushes towards its goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, new technologies are needed, and the market must extend to enable innovation.
Designing a BECCS business model
The Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) outlined
several key factors to consider
in assessing how to make carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) economically viable. These are also valid for BECCS development.
Engineers working within the turbine hall, Drax Power Station
One of the primary needs for a BECCS business model is to instil confidence in investors – by creating a policy framework that encourages investors to back innovative new technologies, reduces risk and inspires new entrants into the space. The cost of developing a BECCS project should also be fairly distributed among contributing parties ensuring that costs to consumers/taxpayers are minimised.
Building from these principles there are three potential business models that can enable BECCS to be developed at the scale and in the timeframe needed to bring the UK to net zero emissions in 2050.
Power Contract for Difference (CfD):
By protecting consumers from price spikes, and BECCS generators and investors from market volatility or big drops in the wholesale price of power, this approach offers security to invest in new technology. The strike price could also be adjusted to take into account negative emissions delivered and spillover benefits, as well as the cost of power generation.
Carbon payment:
Another approach is contractual fixed carbon payments that would offer a BECCS power station a set payment per tonne of negative emissions which would cover the operational and capital costs of installing carbon capture technology on the power station. This would be a new form of support, and unfamiliar to investors who are already versed in CfDs. The advantage of introducing a policy such as fixed carbon payment is its flexibility, and it could be used to support other methods of GGR or CCS. The same scheme could be adjusted to reward, for example, CO
2
captured through CCS in industry or direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). It could even be used to remunerate measurable spillover benefits from front-running BECCS projects.
Carbon payment + power CfD:
This option combines the two above. The Frontier report says it would be the most effective business model for supporting a BECCS in power project. Carbon payments would act as an incentive for negative emissions and spillovers, while CfDs would then cover the costs of power generation.
Cost and revenue profiles of alternative support options based on assuming a constant level of output over time.

Way to go, hybrid!
Why does the hybrid business model of power CfD with carbon payment come out on top? Frontier considered how easy or difficult it would be to transition each of the options to a technology neutral business model for future projects, and then to a subsidy free business model.
By looking ahead to tech neutrality, the business model would not unduly favour negative emissions technologies – such as BECCS at Drax – that are available to deploy at scale in the 2020s, over those that might come online later.
Plus, the whole point of subsidies is to help to get essential, fledgling technologies and business models
off to a flying start
until the point they can stand on their own two feet.
The report concluded:
Ease of transition to technology neutrality
: all three options are unlikely to have any technology neutral elements in the short-term, although they could transition to a mid-term regime which could be technology neutral; and
Ease of transition to subsidy free
: while all of the options can transition to a subsidy free system, the power CfD does not create any policy learnings around treatment of negative emissions that contribute to this transition. The other two options do create learnings around a carbon payment for negative emissions that can eventually be broadened to other GGRs and then captured within an efficient CO
2
market.
‘Overall, we conclude that the two-part business model performs best on this criterion. The other two options perform less well, with the power CfD performing worst as it does not deliver learnings around remunerating negative emissions.’
Assessment of business model options. Green indicates that the criteria is largely met, yellow indicates that it is partially met, and red indicates that it is not met.
Transition to a net zero future
Engineer inspects carbon capture pilot plant at Drax Power Station
Crucial to the implementation of BECCS is the feasibility of these business models, in terms of their practicality in being understood by investors, how quickly they can be put into action and how they will evolve or be replaced in the long-term as technologies mature and costs go down. This can be improved by using models that are comparable with existing policies.
These business models can only deliver BECCS in power (as well as other negative emissions technologies) at scale and enable the UK to reach its 2050 net zero target, if they are implemented now.
Every year of stalling delays the impact positive spillovers and negative emissions can have on global CO
2
levels. The UK Government must provide the private sector with the confidence to deliver BECCS and other net zero technologies in the time frame needed.

Global collaboration
is key to tackling
the climate crisis
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
22 April 2021
Opinion

Leaders from 40 countries are meeting today, albeit virtually, as part of President Joe Biden’s
Leaders’ Summit on Climate
. The event provides an opportunity for world leaders to reaffirm global efforts in the fight against climate change, set a clear pathway to net zero emissions, while creating jobs and ensuring a just transition.
Since taking office President Biden has made bold climate commitments and brought the United States back into the Paris Agreement. Ahead of the two-day summit, he
announced an ambitious 2030 emissions target
and new Nationally Determined Contributions. The US joins other countries that have announced significant reduction goals. For example, the EU committed to reduce its emissions by at least 55%, also South Korea, Japan and China have all set net-zero targets by mid-century.
Here in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week
outlined new climate commitments
that will be enshrined in law. The ambitious new targets will see carbon emissions cut by 78% by 2035, almost 15 years earlier than previously planned. If delivered, this commitment which is in-line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee’s
sixth carbon budget
will put the UK at the forefront of climate action, and for the first time the targets include international aviation and shipping.
What makes
climate change
so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a global scale never seen before. As a UK-North American sustainable energy company, with communities on both sides of the Atlantic, at Drax we are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends borders, creating a global opportunity for businesses and governments to work together towards a shared climate goal. That’s why we joined other businesses and investors in an
open letter
supporting the US government’s ambitious climate actions.
Collaboration between countries and industries
It’s widely recognised that negative emissions technologies will be key to global efforts to combat climate change.
At Drax we’re pioneering the negative emissions technology
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)
at our power station in North Yorkshire, which when up and running in 2027 will capture millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) per year, sending it for secure storage, permanently locking it away deep under the North Sea.
Experts on both sides of the Atlantic consider
BECCS essential for reaching net zero
. The UK’s Climate Change Committee says it will play a major role in removing CO
2
emissions that will remain in the UK economy after 2050 from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise. Meanwhile, a report published last year by New York’s Columbia University revealed that rapid development of BECCS is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change and a recent report from Baringa, commissioned by Drax, showed it will be a lot more expensive for the UK to reach its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2031 without BECCS.
A shared economic opportunity
Globally as many as 65 million well-paid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems. In the UK, BECCS and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but will also be a key component of a post-Covid economy.
Government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of well-paid jobs, new careers, education opportunities and upskill workforces. Developing BECCS at Drax Power Station, for example, would
support around 17,000 jobs
during the peak of construction in 2028, including roles in construction, local supply chains and the wider economy. It would also act as an anchor project for the
Zero Carbon Humber
initiative, which aims to create the world’s first net zero industrial cluster. Developing a carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen industrial cluster could spearhead the creation and support of tens of thousands of jobs across the Humber region and more than 200,000 around the UK in 2039.
Additional jobs would be supported and created throughout our international supply chain. This includes the rail, shipping and forestry industries that are integral to rural communities in the US South and Western Canada.
A global company
As a British-North American company, Drax embodies the positive impact that clean energy investments have. We directly employ 3,400 people in the US, Canada, and the UK, and indirectly support thousands of families through our supply chains on both sides of the Atlantic. Drax is strongly committed to supporting the communities where we operate by investing in local initiatives to support the environment, jobs, education, and skills.
From the
working forests of the US South and Western Canada
to the Yorkshire and Humber region, and Scotland, we have a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030. At Drax, we believe the challenge of climate change is an opportunity to improve the environment we live in. We have
reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80%
and transformed into Europe’s largest decarbonisation project. Drax Power Station is the most advanced BECCS project in the world and we stand ready to invest in this cutting-edge carbon capture and removal technology. We can then share our expertise with the rest of the world – a world where major economies are committing to a
net zero
future and benefiting from a green economic recovery.
If we are to reach the targets set in Paris, global leaders must lock in this opportunity and make this the decade of delivery.

The world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business
Will Gardiner, Chief Executive Officer, Drax Group
13 April 2021
Opinion

Today we
completed a transformational deal
– our acquisition of Canadian biomass pellet producer Pinnacle Renewable Energy.
I’m very excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the Drax family – together we will build on what we have already achieved, having become the biggest decarbonisation project in Europe and the UK’s largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal.
The deal positions Drax as the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business – making us a truly international business, trading biomass from North America to Europe and Asia. It also advances our strategy to increase our self supply, reduces our biomass production costs and creates a long-term future for sustainable biomass – a renewable energy source that the UN’s IPCC says will be needed to achieve global climate targets.
It’s also an important milestone in Drax’s ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our
pioneering negative emissions technology BECCS
.
That’s because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) at Drax.
Negative emissions from BECCS are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy, supporting jobs and clean growth in a post-Covid recovery.
Inside a Pinnacle pellet mill
We already know Pinnacle well – it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with Drax.
Our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so I’m looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together.
We will benefit from Pinnacle’s scale, operational efficiency and low-cost fibre sourcing, that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues. In 2019, Pinnacle’s production cost was 20% lower than Drax’s.
Completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 4.9 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets
at 17 plants in locations across Western Canada and the US South
– up from 1.6Mt now.
It also expands our access to three major North American fibre baskets and four export facilities, giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base, which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply.
This positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass. The market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in Europe and Asia is expected to grow in the current decade, principally driven by demand in Asia.

We believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets, the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play, will result in continued robust demand.
Pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with C$6.7 billion of long-term contracts with high quality Asian and European customers, including Drax, and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027.
Drax aims to leverage Pinnacle’s trading capability across its expanded portfolio. We believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and third-party suppliers.
The transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics, helping to reduce distance, time, carbon footprint and cost.

Importantly – there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group.
We recognise that the forest landscape in British Columbia and Alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern US where we currently operate.
In line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy, Drax will work closely with environmental groups, Indigenous First Nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental, social and climate outcomes in Pinnacle’s sourcing areas.
We are determined to create a long-term future for sustainable biomass and deliver BECCS –  the negative emissions technology that will be needed around the world to meet global climate targets. The acquisition of Pinnacle takes us a big step forward in achieving our goals.
