sustainability plant more forests and better manage them 22 june 2020 sustainable bioenergy there is an ongoing debate about forests contribution to fighting the climate crisis forests can act as substantial and effective tools for carbon sequestration during a high growth phase they can also function as significant and extensive carbon storage areas during maturity and throughout multiple stages of the age class cycle if managed effectively at a landscape level or they can be emitters of carbon if overharvested subject to fire storm pest or disease damage different age class forest stands in louisiana in a natural state forests will go through each of these life phases rapid early growth maturity and senescence damage decay and destruction through natural causes then they begin the cycle again absorbing and then emitting carbon dioxide co 2  in a continual succession recently loud voices have argued against forest management per se  against harvesting for wood products in particular suggesting that this reduces both forest carbon stocks and sequestration capacity pine cut in into wood for different wood products markets in louisiana big thick straight higher value sections go to sawmills and smaller and misshapen lowgrade wood not suitable for timber production is sold to pulp paper or wood pellet mills many foresters consider that this is just not correct in fact the opposite is true research and evidence clearly support the foresters view active forest management when carried out appropriately actually increases the amount of carbon sequestered  ensures that carbon is stored in solid wood products and provides substantial savings of fossil fuels by displacing other high carbon materials eg concrete steel brick plastic and coal oliver et al2014 1 compared the impact of forest harvesting and the use of wood products to substitute other highcarbon materials concluding that  more co 2 can be sequestered synergistically in the products or wood energy and landscape together than in the unharvested landscape harvesting sustainably at an optimum stand age will sequester more carbon in the combined products wood energy and forest than harvesting sustainably at other ages this research demonstrated that an increase in the use of structural timber to displace concrete and steel could lead to substantial emissions savings compared to unharvested forest the use of wood for energy is an essential component of this displacement process although it is important to use appropriate feedstocks  burning wood that could be used for structural timber will not lead to a positive climate impact the message here is to manage working forests for optimum sawlog production for longlife solid wood products and utilise the byproducts for energy where this is the most viable market this provides the best allround climate benefit what happens when you close the gate closing the forest gate and stopping all harvesting and management is one option being championed by some climate change campaigners there is certainly a vital role for the preservation and protection of forests globally primary and virgin forests intact landscapes high biodiversity and high conservation value areas all need to be protected that doesnt necessarily mean that there is no forest management it should mean careful and appropriate management to maintain and ensure the future of the resource in these cases management is with an objective to reduce the risk of fire pests and disease rather than for timber production globally we need better governance understanding and implementation of best practice to achieve this forest certification and timber tracing systems are a good start this can equally apply to the many hundreds of millions of hectares of working forest that do not fall into the protection categories forests that have been managed for many hundreds of years for timber production and other purposes harvesting in these forests can be more active but governance controls and the development of best practice are required better management not less management during the 1970s there was a significant change of policy in the us aimed at removing massive areas of publicly owned forest from active management  effectively closing the gate the drivers behind this policy were well meaning it was intended to protect and preserve the habitat of endangered species but the unintended consequences have also had a substantial impact in the 1970s little thought was given to the carbon sequestration and storage potential of forests and climate change was not at the top of the agenda the west coast of the us was most substantially affected by these changes more than in the us south  but the data below looks at the example of mississippi which is primarily  working forest  and 88 in private ownership pine trees in mississippi working forest this is the location of draxs amite pellet mill  the charts below show an interesting comparison of forest ownership in mississippi where limited or no harvesting takes place and where active management for timber production occurs in the short term the total volume of timber stored per hectare is higher where no harvesting occurs this makes sense since the forest will keep growing until it reaches its climax point and succumbs to fire pest or disease average standing volume per unit area in the private sector where active management occurs is the lowest as timber is periodically removed for use in solid wood products remember that the oliver et al analysis which does not include regrowth showed that despite a shortterm reduction in forest carbon the total displacement of highcarbon materials with wood for structural timber and energy leads to a far higher emissions saving it is better to have a lower stock of carbon in a working forest and to be continually sequestering new carbon for storage in solid wood products average standing volume per acre by ownership class mississippi 2 comparing the average annual growth rates across all forest types in mississippi annual growth in the private sector is almost double that in the unharvested public forest this differential is increased even further if only commercial species like pine are considered and a comparison is made between planted well managed forests and those that are left to naturally regenerate average growth rates per acre by ownership class mississippi 3 the managed forest area is continually growing and storing more carbon at a materially higher rate than less actively managed forest as harvesting removes some forest carbon these products displace high carbon materials in construction and energy and new young forests are replacing the old ones we know that forests are not being lost and that the overall storage of carbon is increasing for example the drax catchment area analysis for the amite biomass wood pellet plant showed an increase in forest area of 5200 ha and an increase in volume of 11 million m 3  just in the area around the pellet mill but what happens to protected forest area the forest reserve with limited or no harvesting over the last 20 years the average annual loss of forest to wildfire in the us has been 278 million ha per year the same as the uks total area of productive forest according to the usfs fia database the average standing volume of forests in the us is 145 m 3 per ha although in the national park land this is 365 m 3 per ha therefore wildfires are responsible for the average annual combustion of 403 million m 3 of wood pa equal to the total annual wood harvest of the us or 25 billion m 3 if entirely in national parks one cubic metre equates to a similar quantity of co 2 released into the atmosphere each year therefore wildfires are responsible for between 407 million and 25 billion tonnes of co 2 emissions in the us each year 4  wildfires in the us starrs et al 2018 5 demonstrated that the risk of wildfire was significantly higher in federally owned reserved forest where harvesting and management were restricted compared to privately owned forests with active management in california the risk of wildfire in federal forest 200015 was almost double the risk in private forests where both had state firefighting resources the risk of fires in federal lands had increased by 93 since 195066 compared to only 33 in nonfederal forests due to the change in forest management practice in the 1970s forest fire in california closing the gate means that the carbon stock is maintained and grows in the short term but there is no opportunity for carbon to be stored in solid wood products no highcarbon materials are displaced concrete steel and fossil fuels and the rate of sequestration declines as the forest ages eventually the forest will reach its natural climax and die releasing all of that carbon back into the atmosphere the managed forest by contrast will have a lower standing volume at a certain point in time but will be in a continual cycle of sequestration storage and regrowth  with a much lower risk of fire and disease if managed correctly the rate of growth and standing volume will also increase over time how should we manage the forest forests are extremely variable there are a vast variety of tree species soil  geological features water regimes temperature climate and many other factors that combine to make unique ecosystems and forest landscapes some of these are rare and valuable for the exceptional assemblages they contain some are commonplace and widespread some are natural some manmade or influenced by human activity forests have many important roles to play and careful management is required in some cases that management may be protection preservation and monitoring in other cases it may be active harvesting and planting to optimise growth and carbon storage  cypress forests in the atchafalaya basin in louisiana are an example of a forest landscape where the suitable management practice is protection preservation and monitoring for each forest type and area we need to recognise the highest or best purposes for that land in the objectives set and carefully plan the management to optimise and sustain that value the primary value could be in species and habitat diversity or rarity provision of recreation and aesthetic value production of timber forest products and revenue generation carbon sequestration and storage water management and other ecosystem benefits most likely it will be a combination of several of these benefits therefore best management practice usually involves optimising each piece of forest land to provide the most effective combination of values forests can deliver many benefits if we are sensible about how we manage them in a recent study favero et al 2020 6 concluded that increased bioenergy demand increases forest carbon stocks thanks to afforestation activities and more intensive management relative to a nobioenergy case some natural forests however are converted to more intensive management with potential biodiversity lossesthe expanded use of wood for bioenergy will result in net carbon benefits but an efficient policy also needs to regulate forest carbon sequestration 1 chadwick dearing oliver nedal t nassar bruce r lippke and james b mccarter 2014 carbon fossil fuel and biodiversity mitigation

innovations that you should know about in 2020 5 june 2020 power generation as we head into the 2020s  its an exciting time for energy a deeper level of climate consciousness has led to crucial changes in populations attitudes and thinking around how we power our lives  adapting to a new set of energy standards has become essential its also driving innovation in energy technology leading to the rise of a number of emerging technologies designed to support the global energy transition in new ways from domestic solar and wind generation to leaps forward in recycling and aeroplane fuel here are five new energy ideas in the 2020s pipeline miniature turbines for your garden think of a wind farm and you might think of giant structures located in remote windswept areas but thats quickly changing icewind is developing residential wind turbines that use the same generatorprincipal as largescale wind farms just on a much smaller scale a set of three outer and three inner vertical blades rotate when the wind passes through them providing spinning mechanical energy that passes through the generator and is converted to electricity constructed from durable stainless steel carbon fibre and aluminium the cw1000 model can handle wind speeds of up to 134 miles per hour to ensure theyre fit for domestic use the units are adapted to have a maximum height of just over 3 metres and make less than 40 decibels of noise  roughly equivalent to quiet conversation the icelandic company says it aims to decentralise and democratise energy generation by making wind power accessible to people anywhere in the world expanding solar to cover more surfaces as solar technology becomes more widespread and easier to implement more communities are turning to a prosumer approach and generating their own power roof panels to date have been the most common way to domestically capture and convert rays but solecco is taking it a step further offering solar roof tiles these work in the same way as roof panels using photovoltaic cells made of silicon to convert sunlight into electricity but by covering more surface area entire roofs can be used to generate solar energy rather than single panels environmental street furniture takes it a step further by bringing small scale solar generation into many aspects of the urban environment such as smart benches rubbish bins and solar lighting in green spaces this opens up opportunities for powering cities including incorporating charging stations and network connectivity which in turn enables social power sharing repurposing plastic global recycling rates currently sit at approximately 18 indicating there are still further steps to take in ensuring singleuse products are eliminated plastic is a major target in the war on disposal and for good reason by 2015 the world had produced over seven billion tonnes of plastic  greenology is tackling this by harnessing a process called pyrolysis to turn plastic into power by heating waste at a very high temperature without oxygen the plastic is breaks down without combusting this process produces biooils which can be used to create biofuels the benefits of this innovative approach to waste are twofold not only can plastic be repurposed which minimises the lasting impact singleuse plastic has on the planet but the creation of biofuel offers a power source for everything from transport to generating electricity storing heat for the home decarbonising heating is one of the global challenges yet to have a clear answer pumped heat ltd phl is developing a potential solution with its heat battery technology the company has found a solution that enables its devices to charge up and store electricity during offpeak hours when electricity is at its cheapest and then use this energy to generate heating and hot water for homes as it is required as the grid continues to decarbonise and as renewable power becomes cheaper and more accessible the electricity used to charge these units will approach zero carbon content the heat battery technology utilises vacuum insulation losing 10 times less heat than a conventional night storage heater in contrast air sourced heat pumps a more commonly used type of heat pump operate in real time when a home needs heating they take water at its delivery temperature which can be very cold during the winter months and heat it using electricity available at that time pumped heats storage system instead ensures there is always heat available maintaining a consistent temperature for hot water or central heating rather than just when there is an excess of electricity the company claims the benefit of using a heat battery system is that it is cheaper than an oil or lpg boiler in a world where renewable electricity production both domestic and on a national level is only set to increase wastepowered planes as some of the most fossil fuelreliant industries in the world travel and transport are actively seeking alternative and more sustainable ways to keep them powered in long run velocys aims to do this using waste the company is developing sustainable fuels for aviation and heavy goods transport using the fischertropsch method of gasifying waste  this involves turning waste materials  such as domestic refuse and woody waste  into clean jet fuel using a catalytic chemical reaction where synthesis gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen are converted into liquid hydrocarbons that can then be used for fuel not only does this make use of waste products that could have ended up in landfill but it produces much cleaner fuels that emit less particle matter and harmful pollutants into the atmosphere as we enter a new decade of invention the world is focusing on more sustainable alternatives to power our lives and these innovative solutions to current environmental issues will continue to inspire creativity tags technology  sustainability  wind power  transport  decarbonisation  renewable energy changing forest structure in virginia and north carolina 21 may 2020 sustainable bioenergy forest owners have responded to the recovery in pine sawtimber markets since the global financial crisis of 2008 by planting more forest and investing more in the management of their land the same period has witnessed increased demand from the biomass sector which has replaced declining need for wood from pulp and paper markets the area of timberland  actively managed productive forest  has increase by around 89000 hectares ha since 2010 this change is due to three important factors new planting on agricultural land the planting of lowgrade selfseeded areas with more productive improved pine and the reclassification by the us forest service usfs of some areas of naturally regenerated pine from woodland to timberland the 2018 data shows that pine forest makes up 46 of the timberland area of which 61 is planted and the remainder naturally regenerated hardwoods cover 43 of the timberland area with 93 of this naturally regenerated the remaining area is mixed stands composition of timberland area since 2000 there have been some significant changes in the composition of the timberland area with a transition from hardwood to softwood pine has increased from 39 of the total area in 2000 to 46 in 2018 and hardwood has decreased from 50 to 43 over the same period all pine areas have increased since 2000 with naturally regenerated pine increasing by 13000 ha and planted pine by 340000 ha since 2000 mixed stands have declined by 6500 ha as some of these sites have been replanted with improved pine to increase growth and sawtimber production the biggest change has been in the hardwood areas where there has been a decline of around 314000 ha despite the total area of timberland increasing by 31000 ha change in forest type this change has been driven by private forest owners representing 91 of the total timberland area seeking to gain a better return on investment from their forest land hardwood markets have declined since the 2008 recession and demand for hardwood sawtimber has not recovered demand for pine sawtimber has rebounded and is now as strong as precrisis pine also offers much faster growth rates and higher total volumes in a much shorter time frame typically 2535 years compared to 7580 years for hardwoods the decision to change species is similar to a farmer changing their agricultural crops based on market demand and prices for each product where forests are managed for revenue generation then it is reasonable to optimise the land and crop for this objective this can be a significant positive from a carbon perspective more carbon is sequestered in a shorter time frame and more carbon is stored in long term wood products if the quantity if sawtimber is increased increased revenue generation also helps to maintain the forest area rather than conversion to urban development agriculture or other uses a potential negative is the change in habitat from a pure hardwood stand to a pure pine stand each providing a different ecosystem and supporting a different range of flora and fauna there is no conclusive evidence that one forest type is better or worse than the other there is a great deal of variety of each type some hardwood forests are rich in species and biodiversity others can be unremarkable the key is not to endanger or risk losing any species or sensitive habitat and to ensure that any conversion only occurs where there is no loss of biodiversity and no negative impact to the ecosystem it is not clear whether all of the lost hardwood stands have been directly converted to pine forests some hardwood stands may have been lost to other land uses urban and other land has increased by 400000 ha some may have been directly converted to pine by forest owners encouraged by the increase in pine sawtimber demand and prices whatever the primary driver of this change it is clearly not being driven by the biomass sector change in forest type  timing the chart above demonstrates that the biggest change loss of hardwood and increase in planted pine occurred between 2000 and 2012 prior to the operation of the pellet mills since 2012 there has been no significant loss of natural hardwood and only a small decline in planted hardwood read the full report catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends

southampton enviva catchment area in virginia and north carolina forests and woodlands represent 68 of the total area at just over 54 million hectares ha with 87 of this area classified as timberland the area of timberland actively managed productive forest has increased by around 89000 ha since 2010 and there have been some significant changes in forest type  the overall area of forest has increased and there is no evidence of deforestation occurring land use by area since 2000 the total volume of standing timber in the catchment area has increased by 170 million cubic metres m 3  sixty five percent of this increase has occurred since 2012 indicating a growingmaturing forest resource and an expanding forest area most of the increase in volume has been in the sawtimber categories for both pine and hardwood although the hardwood pulpwood size class has also increased by nearly 10 million m 3 since 2012 following a small decline between 2000 and 2012 timber inventory by product category the increased demand from the three enviva pellet mills beginning operation in 2012 in the chesapeake region appears to have had no negative impact of the accumulation of forest carbon in the growing stock of the region since this time all categories of timber product have increased timber inventory by product category  pre and postenviva this increase in inventory is also reflected in the comparison of average annual growth to removals the surplus of uncut growth has increased substantially since 2010 from 47 million m 3 per year to 159 million m 3 pa over this period annual growth has increased by 355 whereas removals have decreased by 86 annual growth vs removals and surplus volume demand for timber products has fluctuated since 2000 the global financial crisis in 200809 impacted all product categories but particularly pine and hardwood sawtimber where there was a combined drop of over five million tonnes in 2010 compared to 2000 this was a loss of over 20 of total annual demand in the catchment area pine sawtimber has now recovered to precrisis levels but hardwood demand has remained low hardwood pulpwood demand also declined around this time with the closure and decline of existing pulp mills in the catchment area demand had fallen by one million tonnes pa by 2011 prior to the enviva pellet mills opening from 2012 the new biomass demand enabled the hardwood pulpwood market to recover to precrisis levels with demand in 2018 at almost exactly the same level as in 2000 annual demand by product category this fluctuation in demand is reflected in the average annual stumpage price data shown on the chart below this is the value that the forest owner gets for each product the trends are generally as expected with the exception of the hardwood sawtimber price which has increased substantially despite a decrease in demand this is due to supply chain issues reduced capacity of loggers and access to land average annual stumpage prices detailed below is an edited version of the consultants review and analysis of key issues in the catchment area the full version can be found in the main report is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows the opposite the total area of timberland in the enviva chesapeake catchment area has increased an estimated 82818 hectares 18 since enviva pellets ahoskie commenced full production in 2012 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no  inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area since 2012 but there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand has caused these changes conversion of hardwood and mixed pinehardwood timberland to planted pine timberland has occurred in the catchment area diversion from other markets no  inconclusive since 2012 pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has decreased 19 however this decrease is largely attributed to decreased demand from the pulppaper sector also demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs have increased an estimated 14 and 7 respectively since 2012 an unexpected increase in wood prices no  inconclusive the increase in hardwood biomass demand coincided with price increases of 1024 for delivered hardwood pulpwood these price increases were likely linked to a combination of both supply chain issues shortage of local loggers following pulppaper mill closures in the region and elevated prices offered by enviva to ensure guaranteed wood supply for the first several years of operation as prices for delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chips proceeded to decline 16 and 9 respectively from 2014 to2017 once the market stabilised since 2014 prices for pine products have held flat even though softwood raw material purchases demand by enviva have more than doubled in this catchment area changes in pine pulpwood and pine chip prices are largely driven by demand attributed to the pulppaper sector a reduction in growing stock timber no total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 19 from 2012 through 2018 over this period inventories increased as follows for each of the five major timber products 33 for pine sawtimber 23 for pine chipnsaw 14 for pine pulpwood 12 for hardwood sawtimber and 14 for hardwood pulpwood the increase in timber inventory can be linked to a combination of increased forest area additional hectares  additional inventory and annual harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment area forest ie annual growth has continued to exceed annual removals resulting in increased inventory levels a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock timber has increased slightly since 2012 increased timber growth ratescarbon sequestration rates can be linked to a combination of changes in species composition and silvicultural practices softwood pine grows at a much quicker rate compared to hardwood species and in the enviva chesapeake catchment area pine timberland area increased from 436 of total timberland area in 2011 to 460 in 2018 also improvements in silviculture have continued to enhance growth and overall productivity together these factors help explain how average per hectare volume growth increased from 59 m3 in 2011 to 77 m3 in 2018 an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no in 2018 the latest available growthtoremovals ratio for pine and hardwood pulpwood the timber products utilised by bioenergy equalled 249 and 276 respectively a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area what has been the impact of bioenergy demand on timber growing stock inventory neutral total wood demand increased an estimated 14 from 20122018 and much of that increase can be attributed to increased demand from bioenergy in this catchment area inventories are so substantial that increases in demand from bioenergy as well as from other sources have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth total growing stock inventory has continued to increase  an average of 29 per year since enviva first entered this market in 2012 timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have increased for pine sawtimber pine chipnsaw pine pulpwood and hardwood pulpwood since 2012 hardwood sawtimber growth rates have declined slightly evidence suggests these overall increases in growth rates are linked to changes in age class distribution ie a younger forest not due to changes in bioenergy demand forest area positive  neutral total forest timberland area in the catchment area increased nearly 83000 hectares 18 from 2012 through 2018 the latest available our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found a strong positive correlation between these two variables but also a moderately strong correlation between softwood sawlog demand and forest area wood prices neutral  negative the additional wood demand placed on this market by enviva from 20122014 coincided with a 19 increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 24 increase in delivered hardwood pulpwood price pine and hardwood chip prices also increased 1011 over this period analysis found evidence that increases in hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices can be linked to increases in total hardwood pulpwood demand however given that hardwood bioenergy demand has accounted for over 75 of total hardwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2014 it is reasonable to conclude that hardwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy has had some level of impact on delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices markets for solid wood products positive in the enviva chesapeake catchment area demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased 15 and 9 respectively from 20122018 a byproduct of the sawmilling process are sawmill residuals  a material utilied by envivas three mills to produce wood pellets with the increased production of both softwood and hardwood lumber so too has come an increase in sawmill residuals some of which has been purchasedconsumed by enviva not only has enviva benefited from the greater availability of this byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as envivas

executive officer drax group 14 may 2020 opinion this crisis will be remembered for many things many are not positive but some are inspiring around the world weve seen tremendous acts of kindness and witnessed remarkable resilience from people continuing to live work and to support one another the actions we are all taking as individuals businesses and communities will not only help us get through this crisis they will shape how we emerge from it at drax we are proud of the ongoing role were playing in supporting the uk and its essential services continuing to generate and supply the electricity needed to keep people healthy and the economy running it is what we have always done and it is what we will continue to do this is possible because our people have continued to carry out their important work in these uncertain times safely and responsibly my leadership team in the uk and us must continue to support them and we must also support the communities they are a part of employees drax power station show their support and appreciation for the heroic efforts of those within the nhs by turning one of its cooling towers blue at 8pm each thursday our communities are at the core of what we do and who we are they support our business globally and enable us to supply energy to the country we have a responsibility to do what we can to help them through this crisis to do this we have put together a covid19 support package totalling more than three quarters of a million pounds that goes beyond just financing to make a positive impact id like to highlight a few of these supporting communities in great britain and the us the robinson family collect their laptop at selby community primary school the closures of schools and the need to turn homes into classrooms has been one of the biggest changes for many families with children now depending on technology and the internet for schooling theres a very real chance those without access may fall behind with a long term negative impact on their education we want to ensure no child is left out so we have donated 250000 to buy 853 new laptops each with three months of prepaid internet access and delivered them to schools and colleges local to our sites across the uk  this has been implemented by drax working closely with headteachers as one of our local heads ian clennan told us schools dont just provide education  theyre a whole support system having computers and internet access means pupils can keep in touch with their teachers and classmates more easily too  which is also incredibly important at the moment in the us were donating 30000 to support hardship funds for the communities where we operate  our colleagues in louisiana are playing an active role in the community and in amite county mississippi they have helped provide ppe to first responders as well as supporting charities for the families worse affected helping businesses starting with the most vulnerable as an energy supplier to small and medium sized businesses smes we must act with compassion and be ready to help those who are most economically exposed to the crisis to do this we are launching a number of initiatives to support businesses starting with some of the most vulnerable its clear that care homes require extra support at this time we are offering energy bill relief for more than 170 small care homes situated near our uk operations for the next two months allowing them to divert funds to their other priorities such as ppe food or carer accommodation but it is also important we understand how difficult a period this is for small businesses of all kinds many of our customers are facing financial pressure that was impossible to forecast to help relieve this we have agreed deferred payment plans with some of our customers who are unable to pay in full we have also extended current energy prices for three months for 4000 customers of opus energy who have not been able to secure a new contract during this period the impact of this crisis will be long term so we made a significant twoyear charitable donation to business debtline  a dedicated phoneline and webpage will be provided to our

with a mature forest resource that has been neglected over many years due to political and ownership changes management of state and corporate owned forests is now good but some small privatelyowned areas of forest are still poorly managed despite this both the forest area and the growing stock have been increasing largely due to new planting and the maturing age class of existing forest forest area has increased from 49 to 52 of the total land increasing by more than 118 thousand hectares since 2010 land use in estonia click to viewdownload over the same period the growing stock increased by 52 million m 3  with 60 of this growth in softwood and 40 in hardwood species the data shows a slight decline in 2018 but this is due to a sampling error and the growing stock is thought to have been maintained at 2017 levels this should be rectified in the 2019 data when available change in forest growing stock  estonia click to viewdownload the forests of estonia have been going through a period of restitution since the 1990s land that had been taken into state ownership during soviet rule has been given back to private owners this process was complex and lengthy and limited active management in the forest during this time since 2008 harvesting and management has increased private and corporate forest owners have been harvesting forest that had been mature and ready for clear felling the longerterm harvesting trend has been considerably lower than annual growth increment and the maximum sustainable harvesting level as shown on the chart below annual increment and harvesting levels click to viewdownload in 2018 harvesting reached an all time high at just over 14 million m 3 and just under the maximum threshold it is expected to remain at this level as more forest matures and enters the cycle of harvest and regeneration harvesting type by volume click to viewdownload harvesting type by area click to viewdownload clear cutting regeneration felling is the largest operation by volume but thinning maintenance felling is the largest by area this indicates a forest landscape in balance with widespread thinning to produce more sawlog trees and a large volume of clear cuts in the mature stands to make way for the next generation of forests reforestation in estonia  note since 2014 it has not been compulsory for private and other forest owners to submit reforestation data click to viewdownload planting of seedlings is the most common form of regeneration however some native hardwood species are strong pioneers and naturally regenerate among the spruce and pine stands this has led to a change in the species composition of some forests with an increase in hardwoods although this is relatively small scale and only prevalent among some small private owners that do not invest in clearing unwanted regeneration species mix in estonian forests click to viewdownload markets and prices for forest products sunrise and fog over forest landscape in estonia pulpwood markets are limited in estonia and this material has been historically exported to neighbouring finland and sweden export demand has had a significant impact on prices as can be seen in a spike in 2018 when demand was at its strongest the forest industry has been dominated by sawmills and panel board mills demand and production in this sector has been increasing and this has kept prices high there is a substantial differential between sawlog and pulpwood pricing comparison of sawlog and pulpwood prices click to viewdownload the pellet industry developed due to the abundance of lowgrade fibre available domestically  this included sawmill and forest residues as well as low grade roundwood from thinnings and clear cuts draxs suppliers use a combination of these

bioenergy demand to forest resources forest area  forest cover no negative impact regardless of increasing domestic biomass utilisation for energy and exports forest area has increased due to afforestation programmes forest cover is not as high as forest area due to temporarily unstocked area after clearcut despite this forest cover has continuously increased from 20102018 growing stock no negative impact the total forest growing stock has been increasing for the last two decades in 2018 the growth slowed or halted official statistics show a decrease but this is due to sampling error in 2018 there was recordhigh wood demand from finland which was driven by high global pulp prices motivating maximal pulp production this increased harvests to a previously unseen level harvesting levels slight increasing impact during 20042011 harvesting levels in estonia were less than half of the estimated maximum sustainable level this resulted in an increase in the maximum sustainable harvesting level for the 20112020 period in 2018 the harvesting volumes were at the maximum sustainable level the main drivers increasing the harvesting volumes have been increased sawmill capacity and production high demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden and improved demand for energy wood this was a temporary peak and demand has already slowed softwood lumber prices have decreased significantly in europe due to an abundance of wood supply from central europe which has been created by widespread bark beetle and other forest damages global pulp prices have also decreased to below 2017 prices forest growth  carbon sequestration potential ambivalent impact the annual increment has grown throughout the 20002018 period increased fuelwood price has enabled forest management in some of the alder forests that were completely unutilised in the past thinnings both commercial and precommercial accelerate longterm volume growth in forests leading to increased carbon sequestration removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels utilisation of sawmill byproducts does not directly impact forests carbon sequestration potential but it can increase harvesting through improved sawmill overall profitability impacts of woodbased bioenergy demand to forest management practices rotation lengths neutral forest law regulates minimum forest age for clearcuts according to interviews riigimetsa majandamise keskus rmk  the estonian state forest company often conducts the final felling at the minimum age due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations at least in statemanaged forests in forests that are older than the minimum final felling age sawlog price is a more important driver for finalfelling decisions than woodbased bioenergy demand thinning increasing impact the increase of bioenergy demand has increased the demand for smalldiameter hardwood which in turn has increased thinnings in previously unmanaged forest stands this will increase the availability of good quality sawlogs and will also accelerate the carbon sequestration tonneshayear of the forests however the total forest carbon stock tonnesha will be reduced in unmanaged eg no thinnings mature stands the carbon stock is larger than in managed stands of similar age the carbon stock of a thinned stand will remain below that of an unthinned stand regardless of postthinning accelerated growth conversion from hardwood to

carbon 11 march 2020 carbon capture carbon capture use and storage ccus is a vital technology in the energy industry with facilities already in place all over the world aiming to eliminate carbon dioxide co 2  emissions however for decarbonisation to go far enough to keep global warming below 2 o c  as per the paris climate agreement  emission reductions are needed throughout the global economy from cement factories to farmland ccus technology is beginning to be deployed in a wide variety of sectors around the world construction the global population is increasingly urban and by 2050 its estimated 68 of all people will live in cities  for cities to grow sustainably its crucial the environmental impact of the construction industry is reduced construction currently accounts for 11 of all global carbon emissions  this includes emissions from the actual construction work such as from vehicle exhaust pipes but a more difficult challenge is reducing embedded emissions from the production of construction materials steel and concrete are emissionsheavy to make they require intense heat and use processes that produce further emissions deploying widespread ccus in the production of these two materials holds the key to drastically reducing carbon emissions from the built environment steel manufacturing alone regardless of the electricity used to power production is responsible for about 7 of global emissions  projects aimed at reducing the levels of carbon released in production are planned in europe and are already in motion in the united arab emirates abu dhabi national oil company and masdar a renewable energy and sustainability company formed a joint venture in 2013 with the aim of developing commercialscale ccus projects in its project with emirates steel which began in 2016 about 800000 tonnes of co 2 is captured a year from the steel manufacturing plant this is sequestered and used in enhanced oil recovery eor the commercially selfsustaining nature of this project has led to investigation into multiple future industrialscale projects in the region cement manufacturing a process that produces as much as 8 of global greenhouse gases  is also experiencing the growth of innovative ccus projects norcem cement plant in brevik norway has already begun experimenting with ccus calculating that it could capture 400000 tonnes of co 2 per year and store it under the north sea if the project wins government approval norcem could commence operations as soon as 2023 however as well as reducing emissions from traditional cement manufacturing and the electricity sources that power it a team at massachusetts institute of technology is exploring a new method of cement production that is more ccus friendly  by pretreating the limestone used in cement creation with an electrochemical process the co 2 produced is released in a pure concentrated stream that can be more easily captured and sequestered underground or harnessed for products such as fizzy drinks agriculture its hard to overstate the importance of the agriculture industry as well as feeding the world it employs a third of it  within this sector fertiliser plays an essential role in maintaining the global food supply however the fertiliser production industry represents approximately 2 of global co 2 emissions ccus technology can reduce the co 2 contributions made by the manufacturing of fertiliser while maintaining crop reliability in 2019 oil and gas climate initiatives ogci climate investments announced funding for what is expected to be the biggest ccus project in the us based at the wabash valley resources fertiliser plant in indiana  the project will capture between 13 and 16 million tonnes of co 2 from the ammonia producer per year the captured carbon will then be stored 2000 metres below ground in a saline aquifer similarly since the turn of the millennium mitsubishi heavy industries engineering has deployed ccus technology at fertiliser plants around asia  co 2 is captured from natural gas precombustion and used to create the urea fertiliser however the agriculture industry can also capture carbon in more naturebased and cheaper ways soil acts as a carbon sink capturing and locking in the carbon from plants and grasses that die and decay into it however intensive ploughing can damage the soils ability to retain co 2  it only takes slight adjustments in farming techniques like minimising soil disturbance or crop and grazing rotations to enable soil and grasslands to sequester greater levels of co 2 and even make farms carbon negative  transport the transport sector is the fastest growing contributor to climate emissions according to the world health organisation electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are expected to serve as the driving force for much of the sectors decarbonisation however at present these technologies are only really making an impact on roads there are other essential modes of transport where ccus has a role to play climeworks a swiss company developing units that capture co 2 directly from the air has begun working with rotterdam the hague airport to develop a direct air capture dac unit on the airports grounds climeworks plant technology source climeworks photo by julia dunlop hydrogen filling station in hamburg germany however beyond just capturing co 2 from planes taking off climeworks aims to use the co 2 to produce a synthetic jet fuel  creating a cycle of carbon reusage that ensures none is emitted into the atmosphere a pilot project aims to create 1000 litres of the fuel per day in 2021 another approach to zerocarbon transport fuel is the utilisation of hydrogen which is already powering cars trains buses and even spacecraft  hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways but its predominantly created from natural gas through a process in which co 2 is a byproduct ccus can play an important role here in capturing the co 2 and storing it  preventing it entering the atmosphere the hydrogenpowered vehicles then only emit water vapour and heat from every industry to every business to everyone as ccus technology continues to be deployed at scale and made increasingly affordable it has the potential to go beyond just large industrial sites to entire economic regions global thermostat is developing dac technology which can be fitted to any factory or plant that produces heat in its processes the system uses the waste heat to power a dac unit either from a particular source or from the surrounding atmosphere such technologies along with those already in action like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  can quickly make negative emissions a reality at scale  however to capture transport and permanently store co 2 at the scale needed to reach net zero collaboration partnerships and shared infrastructure between businesses in industrial regions is essential the uks humber region is an example of an industrial cluster where a large number of highcarbon industrial sites sit in close proximity to one another by installing beccs and ccus infrastructure that can be utilised by multiple industries the uk can have a far greater impact on emissions levels than through individual smallscale ccus projects decarbonising the uk and the world will not be achieved by individual sites and industries but by collective action that transcends sectors regions and supply chains implementing ccus at as large a scale as possible takes a greater stride towards bringing the wider economy and society to net zero learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere from capture methods to storage and use across three continents these companies are showing promising results for ccus why experts think bioenergy with carbon capture and storage will be an essential part of the energy system the science of safely and

landowners grow healthy forests 29 january 2020 sustainable bioenergy international papers pulp and paper mill located in the morehouse parish of louisiana had been in operation since 1927 and was once the largest employer in the area however as a result of the global recession of 2008 the company was forced to lay off over 550 employees and shut the facility other mills in the area have also reduced production including georgia pacific which let go around 530 people at its crossett arkansas plant 18 miles to the north of morehouse in 2019 for an area dominated by forests such as northern louisiana and southern arkansas this decline in traditional markets came as a serious blow its a region where a healthy market for wood products is vital for the local economy and in turn the health of the regions forests luckily other wood product manufacturers and industries have since began to fill the gap engineers in front of wood pellet storage silos at draxs morehouse bioenergy biomass manufacturing facility in northern louisiana drax biomass has opened a mill in morehouse parish that uses some of the the lowgrade wood previously used to supply the paper industry to produce compressed wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity in the uk commissioned in 2015 the plant employs 74 people and can produce as much as 525000 metric tonnes of biomass pellets a year this makes it an important facility for local employment and the wood market in the region however to ensure it is positively contributing to the area and its environment the demand for wood must be sustainably managed morehouse bioenergy sources lowgrade wood from a catchment area that covers a 60mile radius and includes 18 counties in arkansas and four in louisiana as drax biomass doesnt own any of the forests it sources wood products from it regularly examines the environmental impact of its pellet mills on the forests and markets in which it operates the aim is to ensure the biomass used by drax to generate 12 of great britains renewable electricity is sustainably sourced and does not contribute to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts a new report by forestry research and consulting firm forisk evaluates the impact of biomass pellet demand from morehouse bioenergy on the forests and wood markets within the mills catchment area map of pulpwoodusing mills near morehouse timber market it found that biomass demand in the region does not contribute to deforestation  nor increase forest harvesting above a sustainable level overall growth of the regions pine timberland which supplies morehouse bioenergy continues to exceed removals pointing to expanding forest carbon and wood inventory annual growth compared to harvesting removals growing forests and increasing timber stocks the study focuses on timberland  working forests  in the plants sourcing area which the us forestry service categorises as productive land capable of providing timber on an industrial scale the timberland here is made up of 63 softwood trees which includes pines and 37 hardwoods such as oak pellet manufacturing as a whole including other pellet producers in the area accounts for only 6 of the demand for wood products in the region of that morehouse bioenergy contributes to 4 of total pellet demand total area of timberland lumber  such as sawtimber  makes up the bulk of demand for wood products accounting for 46 of total demand largely as a result of its high market value and landowners aims to extract maximum revenue from their pine stands however the less valuable wood  parts of trees that are misshapen too short or thin to be used for lumber  can be sold at a lower price to biomass pellet mills this wood might previously have been sold to paper and pulp mills exclusively but with international papers departure morehouse bioenergy now fills a part of that role total volume of growing stock on timberland maintaining healthy markets for both high and lowvalue wood is key to enabling landowners to reforest areas once they have been harvested in the knowledge it will provide a valuable return in the future ultimately however the way forests are maintained depends on the individual landowners and how they want to use their land the advantages of corporate ownership morehouse bioenergys catchment area covers 28000 square kilometres of timberland within which 96 of the timber is privately owned while some of that is owned by families with small patches of productive land 54 is held by corporate owners this includes businesses such as real estate investment trusts reits and timber investment management organisations timos which advise institutional investors on how to manage their forest assets this high percentage of corporate ownership influences forest management and replanting as owners look to maximise the value of forests and seek to continue to generate returns from their land in general corporate owners are spending more money on silviculture and actively managing their timber stands explains forisk consulting partner amanda lang they are investing more in fertiliser their seedlings and harvest control on pine stands because that leads to larger trees of a higher quality and more profit in the long run this is reflected in the higher growth rates found in the private sector leading to faster rates of carbon sequestration annual growth per hectare by owner type smaller private landowners meanwhile may have other objectives for their land like recreation and hunting in addition to timber income as a result some owners may be less inclined to intensively manage their timber stands forgoing fertilisation and competition control due to cost and might harvest on a less regular basis although these landowners may not be maximising the productivity of their timber resource to the same degree corporate owners do their unique management often contribute to greater diversity on the landscape demand and forest health in 2018 the annual average price for a metric tonne of pine sawtimber in morehouse bioenergys catchment area was 2571 down from a 10year high of 3160 in 2010 similarly pine pulpwood from which biomass pellets are made was valued at 775 per metric tonne in 2018 down from a 10year high of 13 in 2010 these low wood prices have caused many landowners to delay harvesting forests in hopes for a more lucrative wood price as a result pine timber inventories have grown across morehouse bioenergys catchment area in 2010 the us forest service counted more than 167 million metric tonnes of pine inventory by 2018 this had increased by more than 35 to reach 226 million morehouse bioenergy market historic stumpage prices metric tonne the report suggests this price slump is an ongoing result of the 2008 recession which greatly affected us house construction  one of the primary uses of sawtimber and many other types of wood products in the us some areas have already seen sawtimber prices increase as they recover from the recession  however the report suggests this is not spread evenly on a national level the inventory overhang in morehouse bioenergys catchment area is expected to begin reversing in 2024 or 2025 as lang explains we expect inventories to increase for a few more years and then start to decline that said inventories will remain higher than prerecession levels while high inventories suggest an abundant resource lower inventory volumes are not indicative of declining or unhealthy forests rather they can point to younger growing forests that have recently been replanted which will later grow to higher inventory volumes as they mature both suggest a healthy forestry industry in which landowners continue to reinvest in forests overall the analysis of the region points to healthy growing forests and importantly a sustainable industry from which drax can responsibly source biomass pellets ensuring the biomass used at drax power station
