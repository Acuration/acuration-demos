said national apprenticeship week is a great opportunity to demonstrate the value of apprenticeships and highlight them as a potential career pathway this years theme for national apprenticeship week of build the future is especially important to drax as we strive to equip our regions workforce with the education and skills needed to work on climatesaving technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture beccs sarah mulholland head of policy at the northern powerhouse partnership said net zero has the potential to unlock massive economic benefits across the north particularly in the humber  but we can only unlock that opportunity through investment in skills businesses like drax are leading the charge in this area and this initiative will help create a pipeline of workers for green jobs such as in beccs and other new technologies ultimately levelling up boils down to creating wellpaid jobs across all northern towns and cities while giving local people the education skills and transport they need to reach those jobs last year drax announced its mobilising a million initiative which aims to increase social mobility by creating opportunities to support education and improve employability ensuring the country has the skilled workforce needed to support a postcovid green economic recovery these workshops build on this campaign by encouraging young people to consider the career options available to them answer any questions they may have and give them the opportunity to hear firsthand from current apprentices the  apprenticeships at drax what you need to know sessions

bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at its power station in north yorkshire if successful drax could develop two beccs units by 2030 capturing and storing at least 8 million tonnes of co 2 a year beccs at drax would support over 10000 jobs at its peak which is why it is vital that the regions workforce has the skills needed to implement this green energy technology enabling the uk to meet its 2050 net zero target whilst generating the renewable electricity the country needs drax has partnered with selby college to develop the uks first educational programme in carbon capture to help ensure that the region has the skilled workforce needed to operate the vital climate saving technology beccs drax announced its mobilising a million initiative in january 2021 when it published its opportunity action plan in partnership with the social mobility pledge led by former education secretary the rt hon justine greening about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology its 3400 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4mt of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 13 operational pellet plants with nameplate capacity of c4mt plus a further two plants currently commissioning and other developmentsexpansions which will increase this to c5mt once complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet mills supply around 30 of the biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses
