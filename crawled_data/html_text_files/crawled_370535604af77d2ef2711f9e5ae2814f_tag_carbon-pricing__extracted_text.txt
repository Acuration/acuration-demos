group of energy companies investing tens of billions in the coming decade deploying the low carbon infrastructure the uk will need to get to net zero and drive a green recovery to the covid19 crisis we welcome the leadership shown on the ten point plan for a green industrial revolution and the detailed work going on across government to deliver a net zero economy by 2050 we are writing to you to call on the government to signal what this will mean for uk electricity decarbonisation by committing to a date for a net zero power system  head of beccs carl clayton inspects pipes at the ccus incubation area  drax power station the electricity sector will be the backbone of our net zero economy and there will be ever increasing periods where great britain is powered by only zero carbon generation to support this the electricity system operator is putting in place the systems products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025 achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing which has been central in delivering uk leadership in the move away from coal and has led to uk electricity emissions falling by over 63 between 2012 and 2019 alone it is thanks to successive governments commitment to robust carbon pricing that the uk is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago  before the birth of the steam locomotive a consistent robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment lowcarbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in british history in the first quarter of 2020 yet even with the demise of coal and the progress in offshore wind more needs to be done to drive the remaining emissions from electricity as its use is extended across the economy wwwdraxcomcaptureit in the nearterm in combination with other policies continued robust carbon pricing on electricity will incentivise the continued deployment of low carbon generation market dispatch of upcoming gasfired generation with carbon capture and storage ccs projects and the blending of low carbon hydrogen with gasfired generation further forward a robust carbon price can incentivise 100 hydrogen use in gasfired generation and importantly drive negative emissions to facilitate the delivery of a net zero economy next year the worlds attention will focus on glasgow and negotiations crucial to achieving our climate change targets with important commitments already made by china the eu japan and south korea amongst others an ambitious 2030 target from the uk will help kickstart the sprint to glasgow ahead of the ukun climate summit on 12 december electricity cables and pylon snaking around a mountain near cruachan power station  draxs flexible pumped storage facility in the highlands 2030 ambition is clearly needed but to deliver on net zero deep decarbonisation will be required previous commitments from the uk on its coal phase out and being the first major economy to adopt a net zero target continue to encourage similar international actions to build on these and continue uk leadership on electricity sector decarbonisation we call on the uk to commit to a date for a net zero power system ahead of cop26 to match the commitment of the us presidentelects clean energy plan  to ensure the maximum benefit at lowest cost the chosen date should be informed by analysis and consider broad stakeholder input alongside nearterm stability as the uks carbon pricing future is determined to meet this commitment government should launch a consultation on a date for a net zero power system by the budget next year with a target date to be confirmed in the uks upcoming net zero strategy this commitment would send a signal to the rest of the world that the uk intends to maintain its leadership position on climate and to build a greener more

clarity at the first net zero budget we are writing to you to urge you to maintain the uks robust approach on carbon pricing the prolonged uncertainty regarding the uks carbon pricing future as it exits the eu reiterates the need for the upcoming budget  at whatever final date is chosen  to provide some muchneeded certainty in a potentially turbulent period for businesses across the uk with its approach to carbon pricing the powering past coal alliance and its net zero commitment the uk has been a leader in global efforts to meet the ambition of the paris agreement by phasing out coal as well as incentivising low carbon energy development and helping drive cost reductions this leadership should continue at the first net zero budget as outlined by the committee on climate change in its recent advice to the uk government on its carbon pricing future 1  reaching net zero will require a strong and rising carbon price in order to induce changes to both shortterm behaviour and longerterm investment decisions importantly in the run up to cop26 in glasgow in november 2020 it is important that the uk continues its global leadership and is not perceived to waver on its commitment to tackling climate change given the uncertainty over the uks exit from the eu there is little clarity on what the carbon pricing mechanism will be in the near term and this is already impacting on the forward pricing of carbon in electricity markets therefore providing certainty and stability is crucial when the government sets the carbon price support cps rate for april 2021 and beyond any reduction in cps rates made in isolation of wider clarity on the uks carbon pricing arrangements post eu exit risks sending a negative signal to low carbon investors and undermining the continuing need for a strong and rising carbon price in addition to the considerations on the cps the carbon emissions tax cet  that will replace the eu ets in the event that the uk leaves the eu without a deal  will need to be set out for 2020 as soon as possible to minimise the potential divergence between the cet and the eu ets over 2020 it is vital that the cet is set a level for 2020 that is comparable with recent eu ets pricing we look forward to measures to help the uk meet its leading ambitions at the first net zero budget including certainty and stability on the cps further clarity on the uks

system changes constantly demand is always changing in winter it may peak at 50 gigawatts gw but overnight in summer it will be less than 20 gw some days wind is the biggest source of the countrys electricity generation other days its gas then there are days when for a few hours solar takes the top spot in the middle of the day and nuclear during the night in the past great britains electricity came almost entirely from big coal and nuclear power stations but as the need for decarbonisation has grown so has the number of sources feeding electricity to the grid creating an ever more complex and varied system made up of technologies that behave in very different ways for example some sources are weather dependent and cant generate all day every day others stop and start flexibly to smooth out changes in demand or intermittent generation but in the event all sources are available what dictates which sources actually generate and when the overriding influence is economics  the costs of starting up and running a turbine the price of fuel or taxes on carbon emissions in great britain electricitys wholesale price is not set in stone by an entity such as a regulator instead its negotiated via trading over the course of a day between generators power stations storage and wind turbines and suppliers who transmit that electricity to consumers as a result the price of electricity fluctuates every half hour responding to factors such as demand cost of fuels availability of resources such as sun and wind and carbon taxes for an example of the scale at which it fluctuates we can look at the period 14 june this year when the index price of electricity ranged from over 55mwh down to around 5mwh see chart above but while these figures speak to the overall price of a megawatt on the system they dont reflect all the individual sources nor their individual costs each of the multiple sources on the grid have their own operating costs fluctuating on a similar basis these changing prices give rise to what is known as the merit order a fluid theoretical ranking of generation sources this is not set by any regulator economist or even by traders rather it is a naturally occurring financial occurrence that explains what sources of electricity generation are feeding power onto the grid daytoday what is the merit order the merit order dictates which sources of generation will deliver power to the grid by ranking them in ascending order of price together with the amount of electricity generated this then determines the order in which power sources are brought onto the system ultimately suppliers want the right amount of electricity for the best possible price so in a system made up of many sources it is the lowest cost highest yield option that is brought online first which in theory helps keep overall electricity prices down north sea wind farm redcar this means it is often sources such as wind and solar which have no fuel costs that sit at the top of the merit order nuclear may come next as it continually generates a large amount of power for a low cost while taking a long time to turn down or off at the opposite end of the merit order are sources like coal and oil which have high fuel and carbon dioxide co 2  emission costs such as carbon taxes and the european emission trading scheme however the merit order isnt a set of hard and fast rules its an assumption used by traders or market commentators to guide what is likely to run and thereby the likely market price says ian foy drax head of ancillary services there is no published merit order it is like santa claus  it doesnt exist but it makes explaining christmas easier the intricacies of being in and out of merit if a generating unit is required to meet demand then its described as in merit if it is not required at any particular point in time then its out of merit  theres no point in suppliers paying for another power station for example to start generating if demand is already being met if the market is efficient we generate from the lowest cost source at all times says foy costs are not simple for example you have to take into account the cost of starting or shutting down generating units however costs are not publicly shared so theres no single view of the merit order each party has its own perspective on it it means the merit order changes from seasontoseason daytoday and hourtohour as rates of supply and demand and the availability of resources change dungeness nuclear power station in kent an obvious example is gas tends to be cheaper in summer than winter when its not being used for heating coal and gas also switch as global prices change says foy availability also changes over the year theres more solar in summer but none in the morning and evening peaks of winter there are also practical issues such as repairs being made on wind and hydro turbines or planned maintenance outages on thermal and nuclear power stations putting those generators out of action and knocking them out of merit and because the merit order is not an implemented working scheme it can be deliberately manipulated by outside forces one of the ways this is most clearly seen is in carbon pricing merit in a changing system the carbon price support tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain alongside the european emissions trading system have increased the cost of fossil fuel generation gas oil and coal levied as tonne of co 2 emitted this has the effect of pushing fossil generation down the merit order with coal emitting double the co 2 per unit of electricity compared to gas we can see how the merit order can be influenced to achieve environmental outcomes this has helped steer great britain towards record breaking coalfree periods and stimulated the building of low carbon generation sources other sources such as interconnection with europe and power storage facilities also slot into the merit order their position often shifts due to highly variable prices dependent on power generation in neighbouring countries or the amount of electricity that can be stored at a low cost respectively the grid is everchanging over the last two decades weve seen huge shifts in how power is generated and delivered this is unlikely to slow down in the near future but the merit order will remain like the grid it is in a constant state of change adapting to the many moving parts of the electricity system as long as great britain maintains its open electricity trading market the merit order will continue to dictate where the countrys power comes from tags renewable energy  electricity generation  carbon pricing  decarbonisation a price worth paying why the treasury should maintain a higher carbon price 25 october 2018 power generation last week it was green gb week  a nationwide campaign supported by the uk government showcasing the countrys green credentials and progress in transitioning towards a low carbon world it is therefore timely that ahead of the autumn budget the energy industry should be speaking about measures such as the carbon price support mechanism which are within the power of government to help keep great britain on track in meeting its decarbonisation goals aurora energy research a leading energy research and analytics firm has produced fresh analysis that suggests that maintaining a higher carbon price is key to phasing out coal power generation and decarbonising the uk electricity sector in a timely costeffective manner  is the carbon price at risk in april 2013 hm treasury introduced the carbon price support  a tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain in part this was a response to low costs in the european emissions trading system which requires generators to buy certificates against their emissions at the time the uk government felt that these certificates were too cheap and wanted to impose a higher carbon price to drive a more modern lowcarbon energy mix this carbon price support has had a huge impact particularly on coal prior to its introduction coal represented 50 of power generation but since it has fallen to record lows 2017 saw the first day without any coal on the power system since the industrial revolution records continue to be broken throughout 2018 with coal generation falling to 1 during summer months  however 2018 has also seen prices within the emissions trading system surge prices started this year at 8tonne and now seem to be steadying at roughly 20tonne this has created uncertainty over the future of the uk carbon price support scheme many in energy from power generators to environmental campaign groups are worried that the treasury might respond to rising european prices by slashing the carbon price support in this years autumn budget which could threaten to undo the success the uk has had in decarbonising its energy mix the carbon price is needed to keep coal at bay aurora has tested the impacts of different trajectories for the carbon price going forward to 2040 and the implications are significant particularly for coal auroras analysis shows that if government maintains the current carbon price support rate of 18tonne then at current eu ets futures levels coal should come off the gb power system in 202122 by contrast the same analysis suggests that if chancellor philip hammond were to reduce the carbon price support to 7tonne then coal power stations would stay on the system until 2025 and increase generation during that time as illustrated below source aurora energy research this would make it difficult for the uk to meet its carbon targets  the uk government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with 5yearly carbon budgets cutting the carbon price support rate to 7tonne would result in 29 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide co 2  during the 4 th carbon budget period which runs from 202327 this is an increase of almost 20 on total power sector emissions  against a carbon budget that the uk is currently on track to miss  the cost of the carbon price a higher carbon price raises electricity prices slightly but the mechanics of this are complex and the rising price of electricity is somewhat offset by lower subsidy payments to low carbon generators comparing a status quo scenario to one where the carbon price support falls to 7tonne raises annual power system costs by 700 million average over 202140 which translates to roughly 9 a year on the average households electricity bill source aurora energy research decarbonisation affects not just the future of gbs power system but also its international reputation and progress in meeting climate change targets  the carbon price support has helped to make gbs power system a success story in reducing carbon emissions while keeping costs reasonable there are always tradeoffs to be made in policy but cutting the carbon price would threaten the progress great britain has made in

carbon emissions iain staffell imperial college london 17 september 2018 opinion 10year high gas prices 1 have prompted a resurgence in coalfired power across britain  and with it a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation if coalfired electricity remains cheaper than gasfired  as analysts predict  we could see the first yearonyear rise in carbon emissions from britains power sector in six years this highlights the importance of retaining a strong carbon price if we are to ensure the successful decarbonisation of the power system is not reversed after dropping to a historic low of just 02 gw during june and july britains coal power generation doubled in august and has shot up to 2 gw during the first week of september the last time coal output was this high was during the beast from the east  when temperatures plummeted in march with these coal power stations running instead of more efficient gas plants britain is producing an extra 1000 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  every hour 2 carbon emissions from electricity generation are up 15 as a result these coal plants are not running solely because they are needed to meet peak demand but because gas prices have risen sharply and carbon prices have not kept up making coal power stations more economic to run than gasfired ones it became cheaper to generate power from coal than from gas see thick lines chart below in late august even though carbon prices now double the cost of generating electricity from coal 3 coal plants are consistently in the money at the moment meaning they can generate power profitably all day and night estimated cost of generating electricity from coal and gas in quarter 3 thick lines and the output from coal power stations in britain thin line the cost of emitting co 2 has increased sharply up 45 so far this year due to the ongoing rally in european emissions trading scheme eu ets prices rising carbon prices should make gas more economical to burn as it emits less than half the co 2 of coal however wholesale gas prices have also risen 40 since the start of the year as supplies and storage are squeezed in the run up to winter  gas prices are at a tenyear high currently 14 above their previous quarterlyaverage peak back in 2013 see chart below  these rising costs are feeding through into wholesale power prices which have risen by a third over the past year to hit 60mwh the estimated cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels over the last 20 years along with the cost of emitting co 2  britains carbon price strengthened dramatically through 201415 due to the government implementing a carbon price support scheme this caused gas to become competitive against coal for power generation leading to carbon emissions from the power sector halving  unless britains carbon price can once again make up the gap between coal and gas prices we risk rolling back some of the worldleading gains made on cleaning up our electricity system  the committee on climate change has made it clear that power is the only sector that is pulling its weight when it comes to decarbonising the uk clean electricity could power lowcarbon vehicles and heating but this opportunity will be wasted if the electricity comes from highcarbon coal so what can be done the sharp rise in gas prices hints at a lack of flexibility in the energy system britain came uncomfortably close to gas shortages in march in part due to the closure of the countrys largest gas storage site with nearly half of the electricity generated in britain coming from gas plus fivesixths of household heat diversifying into other  cleaner  energy sources would help insulate consumers and businesses from price spikes no one country has the power to determine international fuel prices several factors have come together to push up gas prices  including a lack of transmission capacity depleted stores of gas after the long hot summer and a lack of wind power increased output from gasfired stations suppliers which dont wish to be caught short after the beast from the east are also stocking up on gas any kneejerk reaction to try and lower the cost of electricity for example slashing the cost of carbon emissions may only have a shortterm impact and could easily lead to longerterm damage such as the resurgence of coal which would require further interventions in the future britain does have control over its carbon price its power stations and industry currently pay the emissions trading system price determined on the europewide market which has fluctuated wildly over the past week between 25 22 and 19 17 per tonne plus 18 per tonne in carbon price support which goes to the treasury this needs to be maintained or strengthened further to save the power

november 2017 power generation great britains electricity is cleaner than ever as wind solar biomass and hydro continue to make up more and more of our energy mix the power system edges ever closer to being entirely decarbonised the gb power system has leapt up the big economies low carbon league table from 20th in 2012 to seventh in 2016 but this shift to lowercarbon power isnt owed only to growing renewable electricity capacity a fall in gas prices has helped and importantly government policy has ensured coal power generation has become increasingly uneconomical vs electricity produced with gas gas and coal compete for contracts to supply power to the national grid introduced in 2013 great britains carbon price floor sets the minimum price on carbon emissions  a stricter policy than the eus volatile eu emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on carbon dioxide co 2  emissions the carbon price support as the british policy is also known tops up the eu ets together they have had a significant impact according to aurora energy research the carbon price floor is a major factor in coal generation emissions falling in great britain the carbon price floor cpf is currently capped at 18 per tonne of co 2 and the eu ets sits at around 5 tco 2  meaning power generators and heavy industry pay around 23 tco 2 altogether when initially formulated by the coalition government in 2010 it was intended the cpf would reach 30 per tonne by 2020 and 70 per tonne by 2030 however the eu ets has since fallen therefore the uk government chose to cap the carbon price support at 18 per tonne until 2020 now as we reach the end of the decade questions remain as to what will happen to this crucial mechanism post2020 will the government price coal off the system once and for all or will the fossil fuel make an unlikely comeback  four visions of carbon pricings future in its research aurora has identified four potential future scenarios for the uks carbon pricing strategy status quo if the uk chooses to continue supporting the phaseout of coal and promotes lowcarbon investment the carbon price floor will steadily increase post2020 reaching an estimated 52 per tonne by 2040 in this scenario the uks carbon pricing structure remains about 18 per tonne higher than the eu ets which is currently around 5 per tonne catchup in the postbrexit landscape whatever it may look like the uk may choose to seek parity with the eu over decarbonisation in this scenario the total uk carbon price remains flat with eu ets which rises until convergence in this scenario the uk and eus price per tonne of carbon reaches 35 by 2040 low priced carbon in the event that the uk government removes the carbon price from 2021 and the eu ets never recovers beyond its 2017 level the shortterm effects could be a drop in the price of coal power and cheaper energy bills co 2 emissions increase in the uk as demand for power rises in the late 2020s and beyond as recently witnessed in the netherlands where coal generation has increased  in part due to a low eu ets the expected price per tonne of carbon could be as low as 6 by 2040 and investment in lower carbon and renewable forms of power generation stalls high priced carbon in order to meet the uks fourth and fifth carbon budgets set by the committee on climate change this scenario sees the electricity system decarbonise more quickly with coal removed as an energy source the carbon price rises dramatically over the next two decades to hit 153 per tonne by 2040 stopping the coal comeback of these four scenarios the steadily increasing prices of the status quo scenario could see the uk meet its power sector target within the fourth carbon budget of 100 g co 2 eqkwh  achieving a 51 reduction from 1990 emission levels by 2030  but aurora found that keeping things as they are could see a radical swing the other way some years earlier in its scenario coal could make a comeback in the early 2020s in july this year coal accounted for just 2 of electricity generation in great britain and in 2016 as a whole it accounted for 9  producing the lowest amount of electricity since the start of world war ii without solid growth of the carbon price floor it could become a much more competitive fuel this potential is further increased by a predicted rise in natural gas prices post2020 when the current surplus of liquefied natural gas lng is set to end if the government chooses not to set tough prices on carbon emissions aurora predicts that on average coal will account for 9 of electricity generation between 2021 and 2025  a change in the declining coal power trend seen in recent years a low carbon price future would see coal grow to almost 12 of the total electricity generation mix during the same period by contrast in the high carbon price scenario coal is almost completely driven out of the energy system accounting for an estimated 2 of electricity generation between 2021 and 2025 signalling to the future what is crucial for british power generators at this stage is clarity beyond 2020 when the 18 per tonne cap ends this can allow the industry to react to future carbon pricing and prepare for whatever future scenario the government is most likely to adopt if the government chooses to continue decarbonising the energy system in a significant way  as it should do  coal facilities can be converted to renewable or lowercarbon units such as biomass or gas  new interconnectors renewable sources storage facilities and demandside response will also need to be installed at a greater capacity to meet the energy systems demands as the amount of low carbon generation continues to grow it will increasingly be the marginal generator this means that power stations such as draxs biomass units which run with an 87 lower carbon footprint compared to coal across their entire supply chain  could be used to meet the last megawatt hour mwh of demand  and this would see the carbon price having a diminishing impact on the wholesale price of power as has already been shown the carbon price floor is one of the most effective ways to reduce great britains electricity emissions  but to continue this impressive progress the government needs to use it appropriately to set a path towards a decarbonised future in october drax joined british energy company

what would have happened during 2016 with no carbon tax and also with an increased carbon tax they have compared both with what actually happened their conclusion no carbon tax would mean more coal less gas higher emissions a higher carbon tax would mean less coal more gas lower emissions since it was announced in 2011 the carbon price support cps has encouraged generators and industry to invest in lower carbon and renewable technologies it has also forced coal generators to fire their boilers only when they are really needed to meet demand such as during the winter months or at times of peak demand and still or overcast weather conditions during the summer months the introduction of the carbon price has meant that gas power stations which are less carbon intensive than coal have jumped ahead of coal in the economic merit order of energy generation technologies and produced a greater share of the uks power the same is the case for former coal generation units that have since upgraded to sustainable biomass  three such units at drax power station result in savings in greenhouse gas ghg emissions of at least 80 a coal cliff edge the carbon price support has resulted in significant savings in the countrys greenhouse gas emissions helping the uk meet its international climate change commitments removing or reducing the cps too soon and britains power mix risks going back in time it would improve the economics of coal and encourage britains remaining coal power stations to stay open for longer creating a risk to security of supply through a cliff edge of coal closures in the mid2020s changing the economics to favour coal also makes it harder to reach the uk governments goal of bringing a new fleet of gas power stations online what if  dr iain staffell from the centre for environmental policy at imperial college london has modelled a scenario in which the carbon price support did not exist in 2016 if the government had abolished all carbon pricing we would probably have seen a 20 increase in the power sectors carbon emissions said staffell removing the carbon price support would have the equivalent environmental impact of every single person in the uk deciding to drive a car once a year from lands end to john ogroats without the carbon price support emissions from electricity consumption would be 20 higher meaning an extra 250 kg per person equivalent to driving a car 800 miles running the numbers the carbon price support is capped at 18tco 2 until 2021 in his budget on 8 th march 2017 chancellor philip hammond  rightly in the view of drax  confirmed the governments commitment to carbon pricing using data from national grid and elexon and analysis from dr iain staffell electric insights shows how coal power generation was only needed last winter when electricity demand was greater than could be produced by other technologies alone coal was only used at times of peak demand because it was among the most expensive energy technologies in part due to the cps what if that wasnt the case and the government had decided to scrap the cps before that point in time more coal is burnt particularly during the daytimes  on average coal produces 2500 mw more over this week equivalent to four of drax power stations six generation units and what does dr iain staffells model suggest would have happened if the cap was doubled to 36tco 2  the change is stark even for a week in the winter with an average temperature across the country of 86 o c to see coal generation reduced so much compared to the actual cps of 18tco 2 or the 0tco 2 scenario model illustrates the impact of the carbon price support could bill payers save one argument for reducing the carbon price support  or scrapping it altogether  is the possibility that consumers and nondomestic electricity bill payers would save money its worth noting that apparent savings for electricity bill payers are lowered when the whole way that power is priced is accounted for by the time it reaches homes and businesses carbon price support does increase the cost of wholesale power says staffell but if you add the extra taxes other renewable and low carbon support measures transmission and balancing charges and fees imposed by electricity suppliers the overall impact on consumer bills is modest so if the government abolished all carbon pricing we could expect a 1 pkwh reduction in our tariffs but a 21 increase in our carbon emissions as a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers from imperial college london has already shown there are other ways to save bill payers money while encouraging a low carbon future their analysis published in early 2016 found that households and businesses could save 2bn if the government considered the whole system cost of electricity generation and supply when designing its competitions for support under its contracts for difference cfd scheme 2016 redux without the carbon price support the uk wouldnt have managed to send carbon emissions back to 19 th century levels  so if 2016 was played out one more time but with no carbon price support coal generation would have increased by 102 28 terawatthours to 56 twh gas generation would have decreased by 21 27 twh to 101 twh carbon emissions would have risen by 21 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to 92mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have increased by 20 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 349 gco 2 kwh and if 2016 had seen a doubling of the cps to 36tco 2  coal generation would have decreased by 47 129 twh to 147 twh gas generation would have increased by 9 118 twh to 1395 twh carbon emissions would have decreased by 10 73 mt co 2  to 686 mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have decreased by 9 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 263 gco 2 kwh the two scenarios presented above only modelled the impact of no or a higher carbon price support on nuclear coal and gas power supply in the realworld changes to the carbon price support would also impact on energy technologies that operate under the renewables obligation ro such as two of draxs three biomass units and much of the countrys other renewable capacity cps changes would also likely impact imports and storage while no analysis is perfect this clearly illustrates the significantly negative impact that scrapping or reducing the carbon price support would have on the uks decarbonisation agenda it also highlights the benefits that the governments decision to remain committed to carbon pricing will deliver what if  britain had no carbon price support httpstcongz1jzmhtx pictwittercommiusyf73gq  drax
