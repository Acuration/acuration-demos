power stations visit cruachan power station visit drax power station securing reliable and flexible energy this winter power demand is at its highest during dark cold days will we be able to meet it this winter 20 october 2017 power generation preparing for winter is one of the uk power systems biggest challenges shorter days and falling temperatures ramp up demand for electricity and gas to power lights and heating across the country this can put strain on the grid even leading to blackouts if not carefully managed in anticipation of potentially difficult times national grid assesses britains winter energy system to determine how much power were going to need and more importantly to ensure generators can produce enough to meet demand in its most recent report looking at winter 201718  national grids take is a positive one there will be enough power to meet demand more than that it has the potential to be cleaner than ever before  what to expect from electricity this winter in the report national grid forecasts a surplus power margin how much generation capacity will exceed estimated demand of 103  a significant increase from last years 57 margin what does this mean in real terms the report predicts a peak electricity demand of nearly 51 gw during the darkest coldest days of middecember by contrast the total possible capacity of the uks energy system during winter is 1012 gw not including interconnectors importing power from abroad it is important to note however that 1012 gw is more a theoretical number than an expected one considering normal occurrences such as planned outages breakdowns or other operational issues that prevent power stations generating their usual output a more accurate estimate is 661 gw but electricity isnt the only resource put under strain in the winter months  gas is also in high demand for heating and for electricity generation in the report national grid predicts this winter to have a lower gas demand than last year owing largely to a decrease in gasfuelled electricity generation however where gasfired electricity is likely to remain integral is in plugging the gaps in electricity supply left by intermittent renewables the system under stress weather plays a huge part in both the consumption and generation of power  during the winter when days are shorter and darker and the wind calmer solar and wind cannot generate and feed into the power grid as they normally would this means when there are sudden spikes in demand such as in a cold snap national grid must secure other sources to avoid disruption which can sometimes include carbonintensive coal diesel generators or importing power from europe this growing pressure on the system requires flexible and reliable sources of energy that can quickly react to these sudden surges biomass is a reliable flexible renewable and available at scale its able to provide the full range of support services the grid needs to retain stable supplies  whatever the weather says drax power ceo andy koss drax power stations south cooling towers recycle water and feed it back into the boilers where 17 of the uks renewable electricity is generated lowcarbon winter energy the ability to secure sufficient reliable and lowercarbon power over the winter months is key to the ongoing decarbonisation of the uk biomass and gas will play an important role in allowing the country to operate with less dependence on fossil fuels weve already made significant headway in this field last year christmas day was powered by more renewable electricity than ever before while each quarter of 2017 has seen new clean energy records broken  as we move into another winter its imperative generators and operators focus on the security of supply that the stability of our power system will be secured by lower carbon sources is an added  and much needed  bonus share related stories electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero press
