Our communities
Our communities
We are a core part of the communities in which we are located and we aim to make a real, positive difference to the people that live around us. We regularly talk to our local authorities – for example, the parish, district and county councils serving the communities around our power stations. This maintains our connection to local civic groups and organisations, and supports them in improving the local area.
As a major employer and supplier, we support local and national businesses by providing jobs and encouraging local companies to bid for contracts to supply the many goods and services we need.
When it comes to supporting the communities around us, we know we can do so much more than provide employment or financial support. We can tap into the same spirit that looked ahead to a zero-carbon future to bring new dynamism to the people and organisations that can change our local areas for good.
That’s why across Drax Group, we focus on improving social mobility and opportunity through Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) and education outreach, skills and employability. We are developing talent and helping equip the next generation with the skills they’ll need to succeed. We are supporting communities by helping organisations shape a brighter future through fundraising and investment. And we’re celebrating the local heroes who are already making things happen.
Supporting our local communities
Drax has long history of supporting our local communities and we are playing our part and responding to government aims to make sure that education provides the skilled workforce employers need. Through our educational outreach programme, we focus on improving social mobility and opportunity through STEM and education outreach, skills and employability, creating a positive impact in the communities where we operate.
Drax will consider requests to support charitable causes or registered charities that support the aims of Drax and improving our local community.
Charitable and non-charitable donations
All requests for funding will be considered by the Charity Committee
Funds will only be allocated to organisations based within a specified radius of each Drax site
The organisation must support one of the following objectives:
STEM & education outreach
Skills & employability
Improving our local community
Eligibility
If your charity or organisation supports STEM & education outreach, skills & employability, or improving our local community please apply in writing via our
enquiry form
. Your request will be considered by our Charity Committee.
Visit the websites of
our businesses
to find out about sponsorship initiatives in our other locations.
Drax Power Station Consultative Committee
Being open and transparent is an important part of what we do. That’s where the Drax Power Station Consultative Committee (DPSCC) comes in. Meeting once a year, the committee brings together local stakeholders to help advise and consult on the way we work. Committee members include North Yorkshire County Council, Selby District Council, the Environment Agency, local parish councillors, hauliers, Selby Area Internal Drainage Board and the Forestry Commission.
By giving its members regular updates on business issues and providing the opportunity to ask questions about how we’re run, the committee ensures a positive and open dialogue between the Drax team and the local communities that support and sustain us.
Drax Power Station Parish and Town Council Liaison meeting
Local councillors are joined by Drax representatives once every three months at the Parish and Town Council Liaison meeting. It provides an additional opportunity for us to discuss issues important to the local community.
