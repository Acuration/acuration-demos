power station you wont recognise this powder but you will know what its used for welcome to the world of gypsum  power station byproduct naturally occurring mineral and an ingredient in almost all parts of modern life 3 march 2017 power generation chances are wherever youve been today youve never been further than a few feet away from gypsum its equally likely however you dont know what gypsum is you might not recognise it in its raw form  a soft chalky white mineral made up of calcium and sulphur but you will recognise the things its used in buildings food fertilisers  the list goes on its a hugely versatile mineral and while its naturallyoccurring its also a byproduct of electricity generation where does gypsum come from gypsum is formed naturally when lakes or lagoons with a high amount of calcium and sulphates evaporate this evaporation leaves behind layers of sediments which eventually harden into a mineral gypsum which can then be mined its also sometimes found on the earths surface where it can give rise to spectacular natural environments like the white sands desert in new mexico or slowly crystallise underground into formations like the cave of the crystals in chihuahua mexico but gypsum can also be formed as a byproduct of industrial processes  electricity generation being one when coal is used to generate electricity it releases sulphur at drax power station flue gas desulphurisation fgd technology removes up to 90 of that sulphur dioxide  which takes the form of gypsum  a lot of it in 2016 80000 tonnes of gypsum was produced and sold by drax today that gypsum is sold to just one supplier who uses it to make plasterboard but there are a number of varied uses for this versatile mineral construction one of gypsums most abiding uses in human society has been in construction in ancient times it was used widely for making cement or as a construction material in its own right  the interior of the great pyramids of giza are lined with gypsum today its still a prominent feature of the building industry gypsum is the key component in plasterboard which is produced by passing a gypsum paste between two sheets of paper when the paper sets the resulting gypsum sandwich forms the tough and ubiquitous plasterboard today all gypsum created at drax power station is used to create plasterboard its also a core ingredient in several forms of cement making and can  in its paste form  be applied as a plaster covering for existing walls and surfaces agriculture after its use in construction gypsums most important historical use is as a fertiliser gypsum is rich in sulphur which plants  in particular oil and legume crops  need for healthy growth its the same reason why volcanic soils are particularly fertile gypsums high calcium content also helps strengthen plant cell walls and aids in the absorption of nutrients more than just helping the plants gypsum fertiliser can also help reduce soil toxicity and improve its structure by allowing water to be absorbed and to drain more efficiently arts beyond its many practical uses gypsum also has a long history in the fine arts gypsum in its plaster form often called plaster of paris after the montmartre hill where it was originally quarried can be used for sculpting and decorative ornamentation when left in its solid form gypsum is known as alabaster and has been used for millennia in monumental sculpting often as a softer alternative to marble alabaster sculptures and statues have been produced by ancient societies in egypt syria and byzantium gypsum powder has also been used as an ingredient in colours in delicate inks used in medieval illuminations as well as common blackboard chalk cooking and brewing the presence of nutrients like calcium in gypsum makes it an important ingredient in several recipes including in making certain kinds of tofu but it has a more interesting role in brewing the taste of beer is determined in part by the hardness of the water used in the process the higher the mineral content in water the harder the water soft water can be used to make sweet beers like pilsners but if you want to make a bitter beer gypsum can be added to harden the water with its high sulphur and calcium content which in turn strengthens the flavour its worth mentioning however that only naturallyoccurring gypsum is used in cooking and brewing gypsum acquired through desulphurisation processes is only used in industrial contexts like building medicine as it is malleable and sets quickly sometimes within just a few minutes gypsum has proven an ideal material for sculpting casts and splints and anyone who has braces fitted knows only too well the unpleasant feeling of a plaster mould settling over the inside of their mouths thats gypsum too with an end date fixed for coal  its already a diminishing form of electricity generation  this in turn means less gypsum will created as a byproduct and sold to industry and while this means therell be less of a connection between what your home is built with and what powers it it wont mean that youre any less connected to gypsum every day gypsum has been a part of life for a long time unlike coal its one that will stick around share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero sustainable bioenergy forests net zero and the science behind
