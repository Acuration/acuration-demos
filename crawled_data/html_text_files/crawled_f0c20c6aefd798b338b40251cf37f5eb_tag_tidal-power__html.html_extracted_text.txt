The 8 biggest things in renewable energy
18 July 2018
Power generation

Powering a whole country is a big task. The equipment that make up power stations and electricity systems are measured in tonnes and miles, and pump gigawatts (GW) of electricity around the country. With the world’s electricity increasingly coming from renewables, this big thinking is key to powering long-term change.
From taller wind turbines to bigger batteries, these are the massive structures breaking energy records.
Germany’s giant wind turbine and the plan to beat it
As wind power becomes ever more prevalent, one of the key questions that needs answering is how to get more out of it. One way is to build
taller turbines and longer blades
. Putting turbines higher into the air sets them into stronger wind flows, while longer blades increase their generating capacity.
The world’s tallest wind turbines are currently in Gaildorf, Germany and stand at
178 metres with the blades tips reaching 246.5 metres
. Built by Max Bögl Wind AG, the onshore turbines house a 3.4 megawatt (MW) generator that can produce around 10.5 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year.
However, turbines continue to grow and
GE has announced plans for the Haliade-X turbine
, which will ship in 2021. At 259 metres in total the offshore turbine is almost double the height of the London Eye and will spin 106 metre blades, generating 67 GWh per year.
China’s ‘Great Wall of Solar’
China has pumped substantial investment into solar power, including the world’s biggest solar plant in electricity generation and sheer size. Dubbed the ‘Great Wall of Solar’, the Tengger Desert Solar Park has a capacity of more than 1.5 GW and covers 43 km
2
of desert.
The next largest, by comparison, is India’s Kurnool Ultra Mega Solar Park, which covers just 24 km
2
and generates 1 GW. However,
rampant investment by the country
means there are several projects in the pipeline that will break the 2 GW mark and will set new records for solar power plants.
Morocco takes solar to new heights
Concentrated solar power (CSP) takes the technology skywards by using thousands of mirrors, known as heliostats, and focusing the sun’s rays towards a central tower. This heats up molten salt within the tower, which is then combined with water to create steam and power a turbine – like in a thermal power plant.
Morocco’s
Noor Ouarzazate
facility (pictured in the main photo of this article) is home to the world’s tallest CSP towers. At 250 metres tall, 7,400 heliostats beam the sunlight at each tower, which have a capacity of 150 MW and can store molten salt for 7.5 hours. Its record will soon be matched by Israel’s
121 MW Ashalim Solar Thermal Power Station
when it begins operating this year.
However, never one to be outdone when it comes to tall structures,
Dubai plans to build a 260 metre CSP tower
in 2020 as part of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which at 700 MW will be the world’s largest single-site CSP facility.
Three Gorges Dam
China’s monster mountain dam
The Three Gorges Dam on China’s Yangtza river might be the world’s most powerful hydropower dam with its massive 22.5 GW capacity, but a different Chinese dam holds the title of the world’s tallest.
Jinping-I Hydropower Station is a 305-metre-tall arch dam on the Yalong River. It sits on the Jinping Bend where the river wraps around the entire Jinping mountain range. The project began in 2005 and was completed with the commissioning of a sixth and final generator in 2014, which brought its total capacity to 3.6 GW.
Itaipu Dam and hydropower station
Brazil and Paraguay’s river arrangement
While it may be tall, at 568 metres-long, Jinping-I is far from the longest. That mantle belongs to the 7,919 metre-long Itaipu Dam and hydropower station that straddles Brazil and Paraguay and has an installed capacity of 14 GW.
The power station is home to 20, 700 MW generators, however, as Brazil’s electricity system
runs at 60Hz and Paraguay’s at 50Hz
, 10 of the generators run at each
frequency
.
Biomass domes that could hide the Albert Hall
Using a relatively new material, such as compressed wood pellets as a renewable alternative to coal in large thermal power stations
creates new challenges
. Biomass ‘ecostore’ domes help tackle storage problems by keeping the materials dry and maintaining the right temperatures and conditions.
Unlike cylindrical, concrete silos, domes also offer greater resistance to hurricanes and extreme weather. This is important in areas such as Louisiana where this low carbon fuel  is stored at the Drax Biomass port facility in
35.7 metre high, 61.6 metre diameter domes
before it is shipped to Drax Power Station.
The power station itself is home to four of the world’s largest biomass domes. Each is 50.3 metres high and 63 metres in diameter – enough to hold the Albert Hall, or in Drax’s case
71,000 tonnes of biomass
.
South Korean coastline takes the most from the tides
Beginning operation 1966, the
Rance Tidal Power Station
, in France was the first and largest facility of its kind for 45 years. The power station made use of the 750 metre-long Rance Barrage on France’s northern coast with a 330-metre-long section of it generating electricity through 24, 10 MW turbines.
It was overtaken, however, in 2011 with the opening of the
Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station
in South Korea. The facility generates power along a 400-metre section of the 12.7 km Sihwa Lake tidal barrage and generates a maximum of 254 MW through ten 25.4 MW submerged turbines.
The battle to beat Tesla’s giant battery
South Australia has become a battlefield in the race to build the world’s biggest grid scale storage solution. Tesla constructed a 10,000 m
2
, football pitch-sized
100 MW lithium-ion battery
outside of Adelaide at the end of 2017 which is connected to a wind power plant and can independently supply electricity to 30,000 homes for an hour.
However, rival billionaire to Tesla’s Elon Musk, Sanjeev Gupta plans to take on the storage facility with a 140 MW battery to support a new solar-powered steelworks, also in South Australia.
The excitement around battery technology’s potential means the title of world’s biggest will likely swap hands plenty more times over the next decade. This contest won’t just be confined to batteries. As countries increasingly move away from fossil fuels, bigger, wider and taller renewable structures will be needed to power the world. These are the world’s largest renewable structures today, but they probably won’t stay in those positions for long.

4 of the most exciting emerging technologies in electricity generation
6 July 2017
Power generation

Since the dawn of the industrial age, the world has been powered by a relatively small set of technologies. The 20
th
century was the age of coal, but this side of 2000, that’s changed.
The need to curb emissions and the rise of renewables, from wind to solar to biomass, has significantly changed how we fuel our power generation.
Today, some of the world’s most interesting and exciting emerging technologies are those designed to generate electricity.
Microbial fuel cells – harnessing the power of bacteria
Bacteria are all around us. Some are harmful, some are beneficial, but all of them ‘breathe’. When they breathe oxidation occurs, which is when something combines with oxygen at a chemical level, and when bacteria do this, electrons are released.
By connecting breathing microbes to a cathode and an anode (the positive and negative rods of a battery), the flow of these released electrons can be harnessed to generate power. This is what’s known as a
microbial fuel cell
(MFC). MFCs are used largely to generate electricity from waste water, but are expanding into more exotic uses, like powering
miniature aquatic robots
.
New developments are constantly expanding the power and applications of MFCs. Researchers at Binghamton University, New York found that combining phototropic (light-consuming) and heterotrophic (matter-consuming) bacteria in microbial fuel reactions generates currents
70 times more powerful
than in conventional setups.
Solar – a new dawn
Solar power may not be a new technology, but where it’s going is.
One of the most promising developments in the space is solar voltaic glass, which has the properties of a sheet of window glass but can also generate solar power.
Rather than collecting photons like normal solar does (and which transparent materials by definition can’t do)
photovoltaic glass
uses salts to absorb energy from non-visible wavelengths and deflects these to conventional solar cells embedded at the edge of each panel.
Or there’s solar PV paint, which contains tiny light sensitive particles coated with conductive materials. When layered over electrodes you’ve got a spray-on power generator.
Betavoltaics – nothing wasted from nuclear waste
Nuclear material is constantly decaying and in the process emits radioactive particles. This is why extremely radioactive material is so dangerous and why properly storing nuclear waste is so important and so expensive. But this waste can actually be put to good use.
Betavoltaic devices
use the waste particles produced by low-level radioactive materials to capture electrons and generate electricity.
The output from these devices can be fairly low and decreases over long periods of time, but because of the consistent output of nuclear decay they can be extremely long-lasting. For example, one betavoltaic battery could provide one watt of power continuously
for 30 years
.
And while they aren’t currently fit to work on a large scale, their longevity (and very compact size) make them ideal power sources for devices such as sensors installed on equipment that needs to be operational for long periods.
Tidal power – changing tides
A more predictable power source than intermittent renewables like wind and solar, tidal power isn’t new, however its growth and development has typically been restrained by high costs and limited availability. That’s changing. Last year saw the launch of the first of 269 1.5 MW (megawatt) underwater turbines, part of
world’s first large scale tidal energy farm in Scotland
.
Around the world there are existing tidal power stations – such as the
Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station in South Korea
, which has a capacity of 254MW – but the
MeyGen array in Scotland
will be able to take the potential of the technology further. It’s hoped that when fully operational it will generate 398MW, or enough to power 175,000 homes.
We might not know exactly how the electricity of tomorrow will be generated, but it’s likely some or all of these technologies will play a part. What is clear is that our energy is changing.
