march highlighted in blue were the coldest britain has been since christmas 2010 this pushed electricity demand up 10 as people used more electric heating to keep warm the evening peak demand on 1 march was the highest in three years and so was not stretching the system to its limits electricity prices rose to five times the average for the quarter they peaked at 990 per megawatt hour mwh for half an hour and also fell to 150 per mwh as the market became volatile coal generation surged for the weeks surrounding the cold spell not because more output from conventional plants was needed but rising gas prices made it more economical to burn than gas total generation from fossil fuels remained around 2025 gw biomass and hydro ran solidly throughout the cold spell wind output was particularly high when it was most needed ranging from 118 to 138 gw during 1 march whilst wind certainly helped the lights would not have gone off without it as up to 19 gw of spare gas capacity was available if needed britains links to other countries were not so helpful we exported to france through much of the cold spell french electricity demand is more impacted by temperature than british as more french homes use electric heating looking in more detail at the uks links to other countries britain had been largely importing from france all year but then exported solidly through 2728 february when power prices were higher in france prices remained lower in the netherlands so britain continued importing from them britain and ireland traded power back and forth to help balance their

uk government response to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme which will enable drax to convert a fourth unit to biomass the response proposes that rather than imposing a cap on roc 1 support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all roc 1 units this would protect existing converted units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum the response would enable drax to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax will now continue its work to deliver the low cost conversion of a fourth biomass unit accelerating the removal of coalfired generation from the uk electricity system whilst supporting security of supply drax plans to complete the work on this unit as part of a major planned outage in the second half of 2018 before returning to service in late 2018 the capital cost is significantly below the level of previous conversions repurposing the existing cofiring facility on site to deliver biomass to the unit the unit will likely operate with lower availability than the three existing converted units but the intention is for it to run at periods of higher demand which are often those of higher carbon intensity allowing optimisation of roc 1 generation across three roc 1 accredited units the cfd 2 unit remains unaffected will gardiner chief executive of drax group commented we welcome the governments support for further sustainable biomass generation at drax which will allow us to accelerate the removal of coal from the electricity

their new spaceaged neighbour in this silicon valley city a sleek doughnutshaped flying saucer sits on a hillside overlooking the population but this is no extraterrestrial this is the new home of cupertinos mostfamous inhabitant apple the socalled apple campus 2 spaceship has caused a stir since it opened this year with its abundance of trees 100000 squarefoot wellness centre revolutionary chairs and specially designed pizza boxes  it aims to be as the late steve jobs declared it the best office building in the world but theres also something interesting going on outside the building where women and men think up the next iphone around the 175acre campus sits 805000 squarefeet of solar arrays the 17 megawatts mw of solar panels on the spaceships roof and 4 mw of fuel cell storage will provide 75 of the buildings daytime electricity with the rest coming from a nearby 130 mw solar farm the aim is to not only power operations with renewable energy but to do so with selfgenerated renewable energy  and apple arent alone in this endeavour driven by a need to operate more cleanly and enabled by increasingly accessible renewable energy technologies many companies are now pursuing their own energy independence could we soon see the first entirely offgrid multinational going off grid think of ikea and you might think of long afternoons wrestling woodwork and allen keys  what you dont think of is wind turbines however the swedish retailer which boasts 355 locations across 29 countries recently saw the number of wind turbines it owns exceed the number of stores  by 2020 it aims to generate more renewable energy than it uses worldwide  something its already achieved in the nordics and canada  ikea isnt the only retailer exploring innovative energy models us shopping and leisure mall giants target and walmart which count almost 7000 locations between them are also looking to selfgenerate renewable energy at mass scale making use of the space available at their massive stores the retailers are looking to rooftop solar systems to power their efforts to reach 100 renewable energy at the end of last year target was the us leading corporate solar installer with 1475 mw of capacity  followed by walmart with 145 mw unsurprisingly the tech industry is making a big push towards selfsupply or sourcing power from 100 renewable generators this is largely down to just how much electricity they use particularly when it comes to things like data centres estimated by some to become the largest users of electrical power on the planet by the 2020s datacentres house hundreds of rows of servers that remotely store and process internet and mobile data from around the world they are the physical footprint of our digital cloud computing age and already theyre estimated to use roughly 3 of the global electricity supply  one big user of datacentres  crypto currency blockchain  is projected by 2020 to use about the same amount of power each year as denmark  microsoft has tackled its datacentre demand by both developing inhouse generation capabilities and by partnering with local utilities suppliers to source renewable energy for their centres not only does this make operations cleaner but the independence can also increase the reliability of their power supplies which are often backed up by batteries  there are other obvious benefits for companies going energyindependent  one being the pr boost but there is also a significant bottom line benefit even for partly selfgenerating organisations in the first half of 2017 thames water cut 12 million from its annual energy bills by producing 23 of its own electricity while solar and wind made up part of this the water management company generated much of the 146 gwh it produced through biogas made from its own sewage management facilities the power it didnt generate itself was sourced from haven power in the form of renewable biomass electricity what it means for the grid the cynical view may be one that says energy independence is a further step towards entirely independent and unregulated multinationals but there are signs it can benefit the wider population too some selfgeneration operations can feed electricity back into the grid serving as a backup resource at times of high demand this idea of prosuming both producing and consuming electricity is growing outside of big businesses in the residential space  with the rise of electric vehicles and their potential to store and feed power back to the grid it is one likely to grow even further and big companies are taking note microsoft points to its cheyenne wyomingbased data centre as an example of this local utility black hills energy which it has partnered with to source renewable power has the ability to draw from the datacentres normally dormant backup generators in times of need in the uk this is happening on a smaller scale hamerton zoo park in cambridgeshire generates its own onsite wind solar and biomass power making it the most environmentally friendly zoo in europe  excess power not used on site is then sold back to the grid through opus energy  generating extra revenue for the zoo and contributing to overall grid supply even with growing numbers of prosuming and energyindependent companies however there will still be a need for gridstabilising services provided by large scale generators companies perform well when they focus on their core business partnering with energy suppliers to help them manage their electricity  including their selfgenerated power  can make sense but what increasing levels of distributed renewable energy generation offers is the potential to reduce usage of fossil fuels at a countrywide level coordinating the give and take of this energy across the entire system will take significant effort but smart technologies and improving storage will help grids and energyindependent companies work together to make the whole system cleaner tags renewable energy  energy policy  national grid how did we use electricity in the 70s 8 december 2017 electrification great britains energy mix is arguably in the best place its been in modern times during the second quarter of 2017 56 of our power came from lowercarbon energy sources  this includes renewable nuclear and much of the power imported from france by 2035 its projected that the amount of electricity generated by major power producers from renewable sources like wind solar and biomass could more than double from just over 80 terawatt hours twh in 2016 to almost 180 twh there is still a way to go but the progress weve made is remarkable great britain is now ranked seventh among large economies for electricity decarbonisation its even more impressive when you consider where weve come from just five years ago 38 of the uks electricity was generated from coal between april and august 2017 that share slipped to just 19  and in april 2017 britain went a full 24 hours without using any coal to generate its electricity  the first time this has happened since the industrial revolution if you look even further back however the difference is even more impressive electricity in the 70s welcome to 1970s britain striking workers in the power industry have prompted edward heaths conservative government to put in place the threeday week limiting commercial use of electricity and putting curfews on television broadcasting  since then a lot has changed and this has had a marked effect on how we use electricity for one the uks population has grown by nearly 10 million  more than that the average number of electronic appliances per household has risen from 21 to 50  in 1970 the average household had 16 lighting appliances one cold eg fridges and freezers one wet eg washing machines and dishwashers one cooking appliance and two consumer electronic devices eg a tv and a power supply unit in comparison the average today is 27 lighting two cold two wet 13 consumer electronics three cooking devices and an additional three home computing devices the uk household today is far more reliant on electricity and electrical devices  unsurprisingly this means how much electricity we use has changed total household electricity consumption in 1970 was 2995 ktoe thousand tonnes of oil equivalent in 2015 britain used nearly double  6869 ktoe and while this is a steep rise our electricity use is currently on a downward trajectory since peaking in 2007 at more than 8000 ktoe domestic electricity use has shrunk thanks to more efficient appliances for example an led light bulb can use as much as 80 less electricity than a traditional incandescent one  and can last 25 times longer our overall energy use ie the sources beyond electricity that we use to fuel things like heating and transport has also decreased since 1970 households are using 12 less while the relative decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in the uk means industry now uses 60 less energy than it did in 1970 these gains are slightly offset by our growing love of mobility in 1970 there were around 10 million cars on uk roads now there are around 26 million and we also take a lot more flights which means the transport sector today uses roughly 50 more energy than in 1970 cleaning things up electricity consumption has changed since the 1970s thats no surprise but whats more important is the electricity we use is cleaner than its ever been in 1970 we used 57 million tonnes of coal in power generation every year by 2012 we were using just three million tonnes and during the last four years coal output has fallen 82 instead our electricity is increasingly coming from natural gas plus renewable and low carbon sources a trend set to continue with the maturation of renewables the increasing prevalence of smarter technologies and smarter more efficient electricity grids our energy system is set to remain in a state of positive change a lot of progress has been made over the last 40 years  and its likely to continue over the next 40 this is the first in a series on electricity demand through the ages the second story of which looks at 2018  tags electricity  energy policy what will happen to the carbon price after 2020 21 november 2017 power generation great britains electricity is cleaner than ever as wind solar biomass and hydro continue to make up more and more of our energy mix the power system edges ever closer to being entirely decarbonised the gb power system has leapt up the big economies low carbon league table from 20th in 2012 to seventh in 2016 but this shift to lowercarbon power isnt owed only to growing renewable electricity capacity a fall in gas prices has helped and importantly government policy has ensured coal power generation has become increasingly uneconomical vs electricity produced with gas gas and coal compete for contracts to supply power to the national grid introduced in 2013 great britains carbon price floor sets the minimum price on carbon emissions  a stricter policy than the eus volatile eu emissions trading system eu ets which puts a much lower price on carbon dioxide co 2  emissions the carbon price support as the british policy is also known tops up the eu ets together they have had a significant impact according to aurora energy research the carbon price floor is a major factor in coal generation emissions falling in great britain the carbon price floor cpf is currently capped at 18 per tonne of co 2 and the eu ets sits at around 5 tco 2  meaning power generators and heavy industry pay around 23 tco 2 altogether when initially formulated by the coalition government in 2010 it was intended the cpf would reach 30 per tonne by 2020 and 70 per tonne by 2030 however the eu ets has since fallen therefore the uk government chose to cap the carbon price support at 18 per tonne until 2020 now as we reach the end of the decade questions remain as to what will happen to this crucial mechanism post2020 will the government price coal off the system once and for all or will the fossil fuel make an unlikely comeback  four visions of carbon pricings future in its research aurora has identified four potential future scenarios for the uks carbon pricing strategy status quo if the uk chooses to continue supporting the phaseout of coal and promotes lowcarbon investment the carbon price floor will steadily increase post2020 reaching an estimated 52 per tonne by 2040 in this scenario the uks carbon pricing structure remains about 18 per tonne higher than the eu ets which is currently around 5 per tonne catchup in the postbrexit landscape whatever it may look like the uk may choose to seek parity with the eu over decarbonisation in this scenario the total uk carbon price remains flat with eu ets which rises until convergence in this scenario the uk and eus price per tonne of carbon reaches 35 by 2040 low priced carbon in the event that the uk government removes the carbon price from 2021 and the eu ets never recovers beyond its 2017 level the shortterm effects could be a drop in the price of coal power and cheaper energy bills co 2 emissions increase in the uk as demand for power rises in the late 2020s and beyond as recently witnessed in the netherlands where coal generation has increased  in part due to a low eu ets the expected price per tonne of carbon could be as low as 6 by 2040 and investment in lower carbon and renewable forms of power generation stalls high priced carbon in order to meet the uks fourth and fifth carbon budgets set by the committee on climate change this scenario sees the electricity system decarbonise more quickly with coal removed as an energy source the carbon price rises dramatically over the next two decades to hit 153 per tonne by 2040 stopping the coal comeback of these four scenarios the steadily increasing prices of the status quo scenario could see the uk meet its power sector target within the fourth carbon budget of 100 g co 2 eqkwh  achieving a 51 reduction from 1990 emission levels by 2030  but aurora found that keeping things as they are could see a radical swing the other way some years earlier in its scenario coal could make a comeback in the early 2020s in july this year coal accounted for just 2 of electricity generation in great britain and in 2016 as a whole it accounted for 9  producing the lowest amount of electricity since the start of world war ii without solid growth of the carbon price floor it could become a much more competitive fuel this potential is further increased by a predicted rise in natural gas prices post2020 when the current surplus of liquefied natural gas lng is set to end if the government chooses not to set tough prices on carbon emissions aurora predicts that on average coal will account for 9 of electricity generation between 2021 and 2025  a change in the declining coal power trend seen in recent years a low carbon price future would see coal grow to almost 12 of the total electricity generation mix during the same period by contrast in the high carbon price scenario coal is almost completely driven out of the energy system accounting for an estimated 2 of electricity generation between 2021 and 2025 signalling to the future what is crucial for british power generators at this stage is clarity beyond 2020 when the 18 per tonne cap ends this can allow the industry to react to future carbon pricing and prepare for whatever future scenario the government is most likely to adopt if the government chooses to continue decarbonising the energy system in a significant way  as it should do  coal facilities can be converted to renewable or lowercarbon units such as biomass or gas  new interconnectors renewable sources storage facilities and demandside response will also need to be installed at a greater capacity to meet the energy systems demands as the amount of low carbon generation continues to grow it will increasingly be the marginal generator this means that power stations such as draxs biomass units which run with an 87 lower carbon footprint compared to coal across their entire supply chain  could be used to meet the last megawatt hour mwh of demand  and this would see the carbon price having a diminishing impact on the wholesale price of power as has already been shown the carbon price floor is one of the most effective ways to reduce great britains electricity emissions  but to continue this impressive progress the government needs to use it appropriately to set a path towards a decarbonised future in october drax joined british energy company sse climate ngo sandbag and others to write to chancellor philip hammond calling on him to back the carbon price floor beyond 2020 and in doing so provide certainty for businesses investing in lower carbon and renewable capacity read the letter here  tags carbon pricing  investors  coal  energy policy what is an advantaged fuel and why use them 10 november 2017 power generation drax power station produces 17 of the uks renewable electricity but it has a long history as a coalfired generator  and while today around 70 of draxs output is from renewable biomass  there are still instances when coal is used  for example at times of high demand such as in the winter months  beyond just meeting demand for power maintaining some operational coal capacity until it can be replaced with more biomass or gas  also allows drax to offer flexibility and grid stability through ancillary services such as inertia  reactive power and frequency management  ensuring these remaining coal units run as efficiently as possible is key to drax being able to economically provide support services to the grid and for this alongside more conventional coals it uses something termed as advantaged fuels what are advantaged fuels advantaged fuels are coals outside of draxs conventional specification that are slightly more affordable than standard coals blending advantaged fuels with standard coal before burning allows generators to remain economical while meeting demand at drax these include offspecification coal and mine remnants such as pond fines which are produced from former deep mine sites  these are offered at lower prices than standard fuels because they often have a lower calorific value meaning they produce less energy when burned or are difficult to work with and transport the benefit however is that power stations are able to ramp up generation as well as provide essential system services while remaining economical getting the balance right each time an advantaged fuel is used the right blend must be found depending on how much and what type is being utilised to ensure maximum efficiency and reliability this requires coordination across drax between the fuel procurement team aiming to source these lowerpriced fuels the materials handling and power generation teams who must quickly understand and resolve any issues surrounding fuel blends and the trading team responsible for selling into the power market the cost savings achieved from using advantaged fuels combined with the highly efficient units drax group operates helps keep costs down and that means lower electricity costs for everyone but this doesnt mean these fuels will be used for the long term drax is continuing to decarbonise its power generation business at drax power station where three of its six power units have been upgraded to low carbon biomass trials were underway in the spring and summer of 2017 to test a lower cost way of converting one of the three remaining coal units to run on compressed wood pellets  the selby north yorkshire site is currently consulting with its local community on plans to repower one or two coal units to run on another flexible fuel  natural gas if constructed the gas power plant could be joined by a large battery storage facility  one which could provide immediate power and system services to the countrys electricity system while the gas turbines power up in the minutes that follow coals days in the uk are numbered  and this is certainly a good thing  but while it remains a necessary part of meeting winter demand and balancing the system advantaged fuels will be key to keeping it an affordable one too tags investors  energy policy  coal securing reliable and flexible energy this winter 20 october 2017 power generation preparing for winter is one of the uk power systems biggest challenges shorter days and falling temperatures ramp up demand for electricity and gas to power lights and heating across the country this can put strain on the grid even leading to blackouts if not carefully managed in anticipation of potentially difficult times national grid assesses britains winter energy system to determine how much power were going to need and more importantly to ensure generators can produce enough to meet demand in its most recent report looking at winter 201718  national grids take is a positive one there will be enough power to meet demand more than that it has the potential to be cleaner than ever before  what to expect from electricity this winter in the report national grid forecasts a surplus power margin how much generation capacity will exceed estimated demand of 103  a significant increase from last years 57 margin what does this mean in real terms the report predicts a peak electricity demand of nearly 51 gw during the darkest coldest days of middecember by contrast the total possible capacity of the uks energy system during winter is 1012 gw not including interconnectors importing power from abroad it is important to note however that 1012 gw is more a theoretical number than an expected one considering normal occurrences such as planned outages breakdowns or other operational issues that prevent power stations generating their usual output a more accurate estimate is 661 gw but electricity isnt the only resource put under strain in the winter months  gas is also in high demand for heating and for electricity generation in the report national grid predicts this winter to have a lower gas demand than last year owing largely to a decrease in gasfuelled electricity generation however where gasfired electricity is likely to remain integral is in plugging the gaps in electricity supply left by intermittent renewables the system under stress weather plays a huge part in both the consumption and generation of power  during the winter when days are shorter and darker and the wind calmer solar and wind cannot generate and feed into the power grid as they normally would this means when there are sudden spikes in demand such as in a cold snap national grid must secure other sources to avoid disruption which can sometimes include carbonintensive coal diesel generators or importing power from europe this growing pressure on the system requires flexible and reliable sources of energy that can quickly react to these sudden surges biomass is a reliable flexible renewable and available at scale its able to provide the full range of support services the grid needs to retain stable supplies  whatever the weather says drax power ceo andy koss drax power stations south cooling towers recycle water and feed it back into the boilers where 17 of the uks renewable electricity is generated lowcarbon winter energy the ability to secure sufficient reliable and lowercarbon power over the winter months is key to the ongoing decarbonisation of the uk biomass and gas will play an important role in allowing the country to operate with less dependence on fossil fuels weve already made significant headway in this field last year christmas day was powered by more renewable electricity than ever before while each quarter of 2017 has seen new clean energy records broken  as we move into another winter its imperative generators and operators focus on the security of supply that the stability of our power system will be secured by lower carbon sources is an added  and much needed  bonus tags national grid  energy policy  flexibility and stability and power system security whats next for bioenergy 11 july 2017 sustainable bioenergy discussions about our future are closely entwined with those of our power today when we talk about electricity we talk about climate change about new fuels and about the sustainability of new technologies theyre all inexplicably linked and all hold uncertainties for the future but in preparing for whats to come it helps to have an idea of what may be waiting for us researchers at universities across the uk including the university of manchester and imperial college london have put their heads together to think about this question and together with the supergen bioenergy programme theyve created a unique graphic novel on bioenergy that outlines three potential future scenarios based on their imagined views of the future theres plenty to be optimistic about but it could just as easily go south future one failure to act on climate change in the first scenario our energy use and reliance on nonrenewable fuels like oil coal and gas continues to grow until we miss our window of opportunity to invest in renewable technology and infrastructure while its affordable neither the beginning nor the end of the supply chain divert from their current trends  energy providers produce electricity and end users consume it as they always have governments continue to pursue growth at all costs and industrial users make no efforts to reverse their own rates of power consumption in response electricity generation with fossil fuels ramps up which leads to several problems attempts to secure a dwindling stock of nonrenewable fuels lead to clashes over remaining sources as nations vie for energy security as resources run out attempts to put in place renewable alternatives are hampered by a lack of development and investment in the intervening years the damages caused by climate change accelerate and at the same time mobility for most people drops as fuel becomes more expensive future two growing a stable centralised bioenergy a future of dwindling resources and increasing tension isnt the only way forward bioenergy is likely to play a prominent role in the energy mix of the future in fact nearly all scenarios where global temperature rise remains within the two degrees celsius margin recommended by the paris agreement rely on widespread bioenergy use with carbon capture and storage beccs but how far could the implementation of bioenergy go a second scenario sees governments around the world invest significantly in biomass energy systems which then become major centralised features in global energy networks this limits the effects of a warming climate particularly as ccs technology matures and more carbon can be sequestered safely underground this has knockon effects for the rest of the world large tracts of land are turned over to forestry to support the need for biomass creating new jobs for those involved in managing the working forests in industry largescale ccs systems are installed at sizeable factories and manufacturing plants to limit emissions even further future 3 the right mix bioenergy a third scenario takes a combined approach  one in which technology jumps ahead and consumption is controlled instead of relying on a few concentrated hubs of beccs energy renewables and bioenergy are woven more intimately around our everyday lives this relies on the advance of a few key technologies widespread adoption of advanced battery technology sees wind and solar implemented at scale  providing the main source of electricity for cities and other large communities these communities are also responsible for generating biomass fuel from domestic waste products which includes wood offcuts from timber that makes up a larger proportion of building materials as wooden buildings grow more common whether future three  or any of the above scenarios  will unfold like this is uncertain these are just three possible futures from an infinite range of scenarios but they demonstrate just how wide the range of futures is its up to us all  not just governments but businesses individuals and academics such as those behind this research project too  to to make the best choices to ensure the future we want tags energy policy  technology  investors  climate change how quickly will these countries reach their climate targets 28 june 2017 power generation it was no surprise when president donald trump echoed his election campaign stance and announced his intention to renegotiate  or failing that withdraw the us  from the paris agreement on climate change it raised the question would other countries back away from their own climate change targets in fact many reaffirmed their commitment to the pact and continue their progress towards becoming low carbon economies for those in the european union this means meeting the 2030 climate and energy framework  which sets three key targets for member states cut greenhouse gas ghg emissions by at least 40 from 1990 levels produce at least 27 of their energy through renewable sources and improve energy efficiency by at least 27 many countries across europe however have set climate objectives that go beyond these whether they can meet those goals is another matter portugal what are its climate targets the portuguese government has pressed the eu to go further than its 2030 targets and is aiming for 40 of total energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030  this target is part of its green growth commitment 2030 which also sets out to create more green  or low carbon economy  jobs and improve overall energy efficiency across the country how is it achieving this portugal has rapidly increased its renewable energy production by investing in wind mainly onshore and hydro power although it is rapidly developing its solar capabilities it is also looking at small scale renewable energy generation through wave thermal and biomass power portugal has two operational coal plants that together are responsible for 16 of the countrys carbon emissions however the government is seeking to phase these out prior to 2025 how is it doing so far the growth in renewable energy within the power industry specifically has been a big success story for portugal in 2005 renewables accounted for only 16 of total electricity production  by 2015 they produced an average of 52 the country made headlines in may 2016 for running on 100 renewable electricity for four days in a row unsurprisingly this means the government is confident of achieving a target of 31 renewables in gross final energy consumption by 2020 which would mean 574 renewable electricity generation germany what are its climate targets germany set its current climate targets as far back as 2007 it subsequently agreed to the paris agreement and the eus 2014 climate and energy framework added to this the country has its own ambitious aims for 2050  cut ghg emissions by up to 95 compared to 1990 levels with an interim target of 40 by 2020 increase the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption to 60 and increase all electricity generated from renewables to 80 how does it plan to achieve this germanys climate action programme 2020 and climate action plan 2050  set out its plans for reducing ghg emissions much of this is based around the energiewende energy transition a strategy that will see the country phaseout nuclear power and decarbonise the economy through renewable energy initiatives according to these plans germanys energy supply must be almost completely decarbonised by 2050 with coal power slowly phased out and replaced with renewables especially wind power the utilisation of biomass will be limited and sourced mostly from waste it also stresses the role of the european union emission trading system to meet targets how is it doing so far between 1990 and 2015 emissions reduced by 27 in 2015 the share of renewable sources in german domestic power consumption amounted to 316 however german energyrelated co₂ emissions rose almost 1 in 2016  despite a fall in coal use and the ongoing expansion of renewable energy sources this rise is due in part to an overall increase in energy consumption and an increase in natural gas use and diesel for electricity heat and transport projections from the environment ministry in september 2016 indicated that germany will likely miss its 2020 climate target  uk httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201706adobestock_90651791mp4 what are its climate targets alongside its eu and paris commitments the uk houses of parliament approved the climate change act in 2008 which commits to reducing ghg emissions by at least 80 of 1990 levels by 2050 the act requires the government to set legallybinding carbon budgets  a cap on the amount of ghg emitted in the uk over a fiveyear period the first five carbon budgets have been put into legislation and will run up to 2032 these include reducing emissions 37 below 1990 levels by 2020 and 57 by 2030 a key milestone in the uks decarbonisation is to entirely phase out coal by 2025 which will mean either closing or converting as in the case of drax power station  existing coal power stations how does it plan to achieve this under its legally binding carbon budget system  every tonne of ghg emitted between now and 2050 will count where emissions rise in one sector of the economy be it agriculture heavy industry power transport etc the uk must achieve corresponding falls in another the uks initial focus has been to transition to renewable electricity production wind biomass and solar power have all grown significantly aided by government support and by initiatives like the carbon price floor how is it doing so far the uks progress towards its targets is positive but leaves room for improvement renewables generated 149 of the uks electricity in 2013 in 2015 they accounted for nearly a quarter of electricity generation and by 2016 low carbon power sources contributed an average of 40 of the uks power  with wind generating more power than coal for the first time ever the department for business energy and industrial strategy estimates that as of 2016 ghg emissions fell 42 since 1990  despite this the committee on climate change ccc has said that the government is not on track to meet its pledge of cutting emissions 80 by 2050  however it points out the uk is likely to meet the target of making electricity almost entirely lowcarbon by early 2030s but only if further steps are taken such as including increasing investment in more lowcarbon generation such as biomass and developing carbon capture and storage ccs technologies the uk government is due to publish an emissions reduction plan in the autumn of 2017 norway what are its climate targets norways climate policy is based on agreements reached in the storting the norwegian parliament in 2008 and 2012 they stipulate a commitment to reduce global ghg emissions by at least 30 by 2020 from 1990 levels the government also approved the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 as well as signing the paris agreement norway has aligned itself with the european unions climate target and intends to fulfil its commitment collectively with the eu of which it is not a member state this means using the eu emissions trading market international cooperation on emissions reductions and projectbased cooperation how does it plan to achieve this around 98 of norways electricity production already comes from renewable energy sources mostly through its more than 900 hydropower plants the remainder is through wind and thermal power norway exports hydropower to the netherlands and exchanges renewable energy with denmark sweden and finland there are plans for similar green exchanges with germany and the united kingdom via interconnectors within the next five years norway is also aided by a substantial carbon sink in its forests which cover 30 of its land surface they sequester absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere to such an extent that it equals approximately half of the scandinavian countrys annual emissions how is it doing so far while norway already has one of the worlds most carbon neutral electricity sectors its significant domestic oil and gas sector means it still struggles to reduce its overall emissions as such the government is expected to rely on carbon trading with the eu or international offsets to meet its ambitious goals nonetheless earlier this year the government said that ghg emissions will fall to around 1990 levels by 2020 although it did not stipulate whether this included buying carbon credits from abroad or not tags energy policy  decarbonisation  climate change  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up
