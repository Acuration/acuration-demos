<p>From Princeton, for Princeton: our commitment to local wood pellet supply</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/ca/sustainable-bioenergy/from-princeton-for-princeton-our-commitment-to-local-wood-pellet-supply/">From Princeton, for Princeton: our commitment to local wood pellet supply</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/ca">Drax Canada</a>.</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to support local communities, Drax has organized three community pellet sales days at our Princeton plant. These days are an effort to ensure our neighbours in Princeton can enjoy a safe and warm heating season.</p>
<p>At Drax, safety is our top priority. With our bagging line closing, we want to ensure that community members can access pellets to heat their homes in a safe manner.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Drax is committed to producing local pellets for our local community,” said Liezl van Wyk, VP of Northern Operations for Drax. “We’re committed to producing for Princeton and working with the community to find a distributor to sell our pellets locally.”</p></blockquote>

At our September 15 sales day our plant team sold over 60 units.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The day was a complete success – the customers were great and our Drax team’s presence was a big part of why the day went so well!” said Princeton Plant Manager Richard White.</p></blockquote>
<p>The interest was so high that many community members showed up before we officially opened and sold us out of the 24 totes the plant team had pre-filled the day before.</p>
<p>Our remaining community pellet sales days are scheduled for October 13 and November 17. Community members can purchase half tonne totes for $125 or one tonne totes for $250. Our plant team will assist our community members in loading the totes onto their trailers or pickup trucks.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">A number of colleagues have been evacuated from the area and production at the Entwistle plant has been temporarily suspended. The site is currently unaffected by the fires and is being continually monitored to ensure it remains safe. Entwistle produces 1,200 tonnes of pellets per day. We are in constant contact with the emergency services and Drax is supporting relief efforts in the community.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Background</h3>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><strong>Drax is reaching out to colleagues impacted by this event to assess what further support they require, and we can confirm there will be no pay interruptions for affected staff.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Drax’s North America operations are strategically located in the U.S. and Canada, providing ready access to large tracts of responsibly managed working forests, modern infrastructure and an available workforce of trained loggers, wood haulers, plant operators and other critical specialties.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Entwistle plant can produce 400 Kt of sustainable biomass pellets each year, enabling its customers to generate renewable power and decarbonise their energy grids.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>***UPDATE***</h3>
<p><b>The mandatory evacuation order for Entwistle and all residents in Parkland County was lifted on 8th May at 5:00 pm.</b></p>
<p><b>The county says it is now safe for residents to return home, but that the situation could change quickly. Crews are still actively fighting the wildfire in the area and residents could be asked to evacuate again. </b></p>
<p><strong>The plant remains offline. Fire crews continue to fight fires in the surrounding areas and our team will continue to monitor the plant around the clock. As always, the safety of our team is our top priority.</strong></p>

Part of this process requires the development &amp; consultation of the SBP REDII Supply Base Evaluation &amp; associated mitigation measures that are required on top of SBP Certification to allow for the sale of REDII SBP Compliant wood pellets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here, you will find a copy of the risk assessment &amp; detailed summary of how Drax intend on carrying out mitigation measures for specified risk identified that relates to it’s British Columbia operations and we want your input. As an active member of the forestry community in BC, your input is valuable to us when designing mitigation measures and we want to ensure we capture as many perspectives as possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For context, Drax are not forest managers. We source wood fibre waste like sawdust, shavings, chips, and bark from sawmills and other wood processing facilities. We also source wood fibre waste direct from the forest from sources like slash or roadside debris piles, wildfire damaged or insect damaged stands, wildfire proofing or habitat enhancement projects and occasionally receive pulp quality roundwood where pulp markets do not exist. Our ability to influence “on the ground” forest activities is limited due to our dissociation from forest management activities. Our mitigation measures are focused on information gathering and sharing in the form of detailed supplier mapping packages, in addition to monitoring, policies, participation in conservation efforts, and advocating for forest certification.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We want to hear your thoughts and comments as to the Supply Base Evaluation &amp; the effectiveness of mitigation measures and if there are any other factors we should consider. The comment period will be open until <strong>May 30</strong><strong><sup>th</sup></strong><strong>, 2023</strong>, however, if you have comments after that date feel free to pass them along anyway. They may not make it into the final draft for this year, but we will certainly consider your comment for next years review, encouraging the system to mature and refine over time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks in advance for your time and consideration in reviewing our REDII Supply Base Evaluation of British Columbia. We hope you will find the document informative, and we look forward to hearing some thought-provoking feedback.</p>

<p>How proactive forest management protects forests, communities, and wildlife from wildfire in a changing climate </p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/ca/sustainable-bioenergy/building-fire-resilience-with-forest-management-in-british-columbia/">Building fire resilience with forest management in British Columbia</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/ca">Drax Canada</a>.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Across the globe, wildfires are increasing in size and frequency, driven by the effects of climate change.</li>
<li>In places like British Columbia, surging wildfires have meant that in recent years, some forests have been emitting more carbon than they have been able to absorb.</li>
<li>British Columbia can serve as an example for where wildfire mitigation occurs, to reduce the risk of threats to communities and forest ecosystems.</li>
<li>An essential step is reducing potential fuel for fires by removing flammable material on the forest floor and dead standing trees. The market for biomass encourages the removal of excess fibre which could become fuel for dangerous wildfires.</li>
<li>Collaboration between government, industry and First Nations in British Columbia ensures that forests are managed and protected to remain useful resources for all.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Forest fires are nothing new. Temperate forests throughout the world have evolved with fire over millions of years, and a certain amount of fire is inevitable and necessary to maintain the overall <a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainable-bioenergy/longleaf-pine-wood-product-markets-help-conserve-protected-species/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health of many types of forests</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But as global temperatures have increased in recent decades, so have the size and recurrence of wildfires. After Australia saw record heat in the summer of 2020, a series of fires across the continent burned an unprecedented 58,000 square kilometres (km<sup>2</sup>), an area larger than Costa Rica. While in 2022, Europe saw 7,850 km<sup>2</sup> of forest destroyed in a single scorching summer, more than double the amount burned in an average fire season.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the effects of climate change, catastrophic wildfires have also prevailed in response to widespread fire suppression, when methods were sought to increase the resiliency of landscapes to fire and change forest stand characteristics. This has in turn led to thicker and denser forests, and increased fuel loading.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to fire suppression, wildfires would have burned vast areas. In some cases, lower-intensity, stand-maintaining wildfires would naturally keep the forest understory clear of fuel loads. Fire suppression has instead led to increasing density in the forest understory, and when fire inevitably returns to those forest stands it creates conditions for high-intensity, stand-replacing fire events.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In Canada, British Columbia has not escaped these trends of larger fires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">About 64% of the province, more than 60,000 km2, is forested. This makes it particularly vulnerable to wildfire. In 2021 more than 1,600 separate fires burned nearly 8,700 km2 of land in the province, displacing thousands of people from their homes and wildlife from their habitats. Wildfires in the region also now average around 59 MtCO2 of emissions per year, <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/07/05/analysis/under-siege-bcs-forests-have-started-emitting-co2-lots-it">10x times the 1990s average</a>, meaning that in recent years, British Columbia’s forests have been emitting more carbon than they have been able to absorb, becoming a source of CO2 rather than a sink.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a region where forests are an important part of life, as well as an essential economic resource for rural communities, protecting forests from intense wildfires, and mitigating the effects, is crucial.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Delivering proactive management against wildfire</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Managing forests to make them more resilient to wildfires requires careful management and collaboration between government, industry, communities, and First Nations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The British Columbian government’s 2022 budget included CA$359 million in new funding to <a href="https://firesmartbc.ca/how-british-columbia-is-preparing-for-potential-wildfire-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect British Columbia from wildfires</a>, including CA$145 million over three years to help move the BC Wildfire Service from a reactive to a proactive model. This means year-round work on four pillars of emergency management: prevention and mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The biomass industry has an important role to play in this work, incentivising fire mitigation and forest management which help protect forests for local communities to use and enjoy, as well as harvesting and regenerating fire-damaged land.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How forest management can protect forests against wildfires </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For thousands of years, First Nations used small fires to clear forests, improving habitat for hunting and reducing the chance of large, uncontrollable fires.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While fire may be a natural part of the province’s landscape, active human management can help reduce the damage fires cause One key step is to <a href="https://blog.gov.bc.ca/bcwildfire/understanding-forest-fuels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remove the fuels</a> that cause fires to burn and spread.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Fuels that feed wildfires consist of any burnable materials found on forest floors, ranging from grasses, dead leaves, and small trees to logs, stumps, and branches. Another fuel source are juvenile seedlings, sometimes called “ladder fuels” which move the forest fire from the ground into the forest canopy which often leads to fires that are much more severe and harder to suppress. Outbreaks of pests, like mountain pine beetle, also contribute to fuel loads, leaving large areas of dead wood.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Material accumulated on the forest floor over time can eventually become a source of what’s called ladder fuel that enables a relatively small fire to reach the forest canopy, burning higher, faster, and farther. These fuel loads, coupled with hotter temperatures and more frequent drought, make today’s fires more likely to burn larger and more intensely than their historic counterparts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Removing sources of fuel and thinning the density of forest stands are sustainable management practices that can help mitigate the risk of the most damaging types of fires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“When there’s less fuel to consume, future fire events will be lower in intensity,” says Mike Thomas, Regional Biomass Purchaser for Drax Canada. “And because they’re at low levels of intensity, the existing trees will live through the fire.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, removing fuel sources from forests can be expensive and historically has not been a priority for forestry operations focused on producing lumber and solid wood products. This makes biomass an important market, serving as a fibre purchaser for the low-grade wood removed in fire mitigation operations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Forest mitigation projects are very labour intensive and can be very expensive,” says Thomas. “The smaller material that we purchase from operators for pellet plants also helps to complete the projects. Without the biomass market, there would be less incentive to carry out these fire mitigation operations.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Collaboration is key to lowering the amount of fuel in a forest</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The type of sustainable forest management practices that reduce fuel loads require effort, know-how, and even the right market conditions. The key to implementing these practices is collaboration, between industry, government, and First Nations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One example is the joint venture between the Tŝideldel First Nation (TFN) and the Tl’etinqox First Nation. The resulting company, called Central Chilcotin Rehabilitation (CCR), is involved in forestry projects, including fire rehabilitation, in the two groups’ traditional territories.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional land of Tŝideldel First Nation is largely lodgepole pine forest, which has been hard hit by mountain pine beetles and subject to frequent burning. In response, the Tŝdeldel have spearheaded several projects to remove dead standing trees and low-grade wood to reduce overall fuel load. Such projects aim to make the damaged landscapes productive, valuable resources once again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax’s partnership with the Tŝideldel provides a crucial market for dead and low-grade wood removed from damaged forests, making it possible to finance forest management operations and reduce the chances of devastating wildfires.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A proactive example for the future </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">British Columbia offers an example of how smart, proactive forest management can play an important role in reducing the risk of catastrophic fires and making them more resilient to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, by working with the wider forestry sector, the biomass industry can help to facilitate important wildfire mitigation projects, ensuring forests and communities are protected, and all those who use them can continue to depend on them as a vital resource.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a business operating in the Canadian forest industry, we have a responsibility to work collaboratively with local and national governments, communities, and First Nations to ensure British Columbia’s forests are sustainably managed, protected from disease and fire, and preserved for future generations. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">British Columbia is a vast and diverse landscape. The second largest of Canada’s provinces, it contains </span><a href="https://selkirk.ca/discover/bec/zones/whatis.html"><span data-contrast="none">14 different bio geoclimatic zones</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> ranging from coastal forest in the west, to alpine meadows on the eastern Rocky Mountains, with bogs, wetlands, and even arid land in between. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The landscape of British Colombia is home to a wide range of flora and fauna. With roughly 55-60 million hectares (550,000-600,000 km</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-contrast="auto">) of land covered in forest, it is a vital resource. More than </span><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/competitive-forest-industry/modernizing_forestry_in_bc_report.pdf"><span data-contrast="none">50,000 British Columbians</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> work directly in the forest industry and even as cities like Vancouver and Victoria grow, it remains a central source of social value to rural economies. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sharing forests between government and First Nations</strong></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">British Columbia has a long history of stewardship and sustainable forest management practices. Forestry began in the region in the 1800s with Sitka spruce, harvested predominantly to support ship building. Since then, forestry has become a major part of the province’s economy and the province is a world leader in sustainable forest management and environmental practises.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As </span><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-resource-use"><span data-contrast="none">94% of British Columbia is provincial Crown Land</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, the government sets the rules and regulations about what forestry practices, or any other natural resource extractions, can take place. Under legislation, any land where forest harvesting occurs </span><a href="https://www.drax.com/sustainable-bioenergy/what-is-reforestation-and-afforestation/"><span data-contrast="none">must be reforested</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and it is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> illegal for a company to deforest British Columbia or Canada.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For many years, an increasingly important component of the Canadian forestry industry has been the contribution that First Nations are making. There are </span><a href="https://www.indigenousbc.com/"><span data-contrast="none">204 First Nations across British Columbia</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> each with traditional territories used for cultural and spiritual purposes, as well as day-to-day needs like hunting, fishing, trapping, and housing. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many First Nations have their own land use plans that are utilised in forest management planning in the province. First Nations are also consulted and collaborated with by the province on forest management decisions. This creates partnerships between First Nations, industries working in the province’s forests, and governments at the provincial and federal levels.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Protecting forests from pests and fire </strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_16046" style="width: 654px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16046" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-16046" src="https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/AdobeStock_413123379-683x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="644" height="964" srcset="https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/AdobeStock_413123379-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/AdobeStock_413123379-320x480.jpeg 320w, https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/AdobeStock_413123379-100x150.jpeg 100w, https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/AdobeStock_413123379-480x720.jpeg 480w, https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/AdobeStock_413123379-400x600.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><p id="caption-attachment-16046" class="wp-caption-text">Forest infected with mountain pine beetle in British Columbia</p></div>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Managing forests is crucial to their longevity and ensuring they remain healthy and useable for future generations. This includes forestry practices to protect them from pests and the growing threat of forest fires. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2017 and 2019 we saw the largest catastrophic fires we&#8217;ve ever had in British Columbia. At times it felt like the whole province was on fire. More recently, 2020 was another terrible year. Factors like climate change and storms are increasing the number of fires we see, but the intensity of fires is also exacerbated by debris left on forest floors from relatively recent mountain pine beetle infestations and other insects or diseases affecting forest health. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">In the 1990’s several relatively warm winters led to the mountain pine beetle becoming endemic, and over the next 15 years millions of hectares of pine forest were lost to the bug. The government increased the allowable annual cut (harvesting levels) to remove the debris of such infestations which become dangerous fire hazards if not removed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To protect from fires, pests, and diseases, it’s important to open up forests through managed removals. This process creates more space and less dense stands of trees. It’s also crucial to reduce what’s left lying on the forest floor after forestry operations, while ensuring that the right wood is left to encourage biodiversity, soil health and habitat needs. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-contrast="auto">These sustainable management practises are important to help the resilience of the forest and biomass offers a use for much of the wood removed through these practices that is not able to be manufactured into lumber. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Biomass and the wood industry </strong></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Compared to lumber manufacturing, pellet production is relatively new to British Columbia’s forest industry, but it offers a practical use for materials that are unmerchantable or unsuitable for sawlogs. This includes, but is not limited to, forms of forest residues such as low-grade wood, treetops, and branches that are left behind from harvesting activities. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Removing forest residues can provide more growing sites for new seedlings and helps to prevent intense forest fires. Slash and other low-grade wood are often simply burned along roadsides, but pellets offer a way to turn this fibre into a source of renewable energy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Forest residues from harvests, like slash and low-grade roundwood, accounted for approximately 8% and 10% of the fibre used in our Canadian pellet plants in the first half of 2022. The rest of the fibre we use comes from sawmill residues, such as wood chips, shavings, and sawdust. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Drax operates eight pellet mills across British Columbia and two in neighbouring Alberta, but doesn’t own forests or carry out harvesting or wood sorting. Instead, we partner with forest companies that operate sawmills. These companies are awarded forest tenures, which allow them to harvest certain forest areas (which are identified by the provincial government) to produce solid wood products, which lock in carbon for years. In return, we obtain their sawmill residues. The economics of the wood pellet industry means the main driver of harvesting is still demand for high-grade timber.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>British Columbia’s working forests are owned by the province and managed  to preserve the environment while supporting forestry industries and local communities.</strong></li>
<li><strong>When forests are harvested, professional, licensed scalers who are independent of logging companies or sawmills, evaluate the size and quality of wood.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The processes and assessments made by scalers are extensive and designed to ensure high quality lumber makes its way to commercial markets.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The careful process of grading wood ensures that only low-quality wood, unusable by lumber sectors is used to produce sustainable biomass pellets.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy working forests are full of different species of trees that serve as essential commercial resource to rural communities. Within these forests are different qualities of wood and trees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The lumber industry, which drives the commercial forestry in British Columbia, only uses high-quality sawlogs that can be processed into lumber and other valuable solid wood products. When forest companies and the provincial government identify areas of forest suitable for management, the materials are professionally, independently sorted, and selected by the logging operator according to specifications set by the sawmill and by merchantability specifications set by government.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This leaves a range of rejected roundwood trees and other materials that are unsuitable for lumber. Characteristics of rejected material can include undersized logs, rotting in parts, excessive twisting, cracks, large knots, or exposure to damage like fires. But that’s not to say the wood isn’t valuable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The biomass industry emerged as a way to utilise wood and residues from forestry and sawmill processes. To sort through wood harvests and identify what wood is suitable for lumber, forest companies in British Columbia use a grading system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The province’s Forest Act outlines that timber harvested from publicly owned Crown must be scaled (measured) and graded. This standardised system means all types of wood are utilised, and the full value of a harvest maximised for lumber and other wood products – ensuring forests remain valuable resources that are replanted and managed for future generations.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Making the grade</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The policy of scaling and grading timber has been in action along British Columbia’s coastal forests since as long ago as 1902.  And while log grades have evolved and expanded with changes in wood utilisation and forest practices, today’s grading rules and conventions are very similar to those used more than a century ago.<em> </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Timber scaling and grading can only be carried out by trained, licenced professionals, known as scalers. The processes and assessments they are required to carry out are <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/timber-pricing/harvest-billing/timber-scaling/scaling_2011_amend_5_master_nov_21.pdf">rigorous and extensive</a>, as outlined in a regularly updated Scaling Manual.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Scalers apply grading rules to determine: the log&#8217;s gross dimensions, estimate what portion of the log is available to produce a given product, and consider the quality of the product that could be produced from the log.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the scaler’s job to assess the visible characteristics of each log and determine what can be recovered from the log given its size and quality characteristics. Results in British Columbia are reported in cubic metres, with one cubic metre of timber viewed as a cubic metre of solid wood (known as firmwood), free of any rot, hole, char, or missing wood. It’s then up to the manufacturer to get the best and most valuable product out of the available volume.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Grade rules typically include three components: minimum or maximum dimensions, a requirement that a percentage of the log&#8217;s volume must be available to manufacture a given product, a requirement that a percentage of the product manufactured from the log must meet or exceed a given quality.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By developing methods of taking measurements in British Columbia’s coastal and interior regions, meaningful data is generated to understand the health and quality of the province’s diverse forests.</p>

<h3>Grade code 1 &#8211; Premium sawlogs</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The highest-quality and most valuable grade, a grade code 1 log must be 2.5 m or more in length and 10 cm or more in radius. It can also be a slab of wood 2.5 m long and 20 cm wide and 20 cm or more in thickness measured at a right angle to the growth rings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For species like hemlock, cedar or balsam log or slab, at least 90% of the overall log can be manufactured into lumber, meaning it’s free of rot, chars, or holes, without too many knots or twists.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For other species, at least 75% can be manufactured into lumber. For all species, at least 75% of the lumber will be suitable for sale.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Grade code 2 – Sawlog</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Smaller than premium sawlogs, grade code 2 logs are also 2.5 m or longer but can be only 5 cm wide. Grade code 2 sawlogs can also be made from slabs of wood 2.5 m or more in length and 15 cm wide, with a 15 cm or more thickness measured at a right angle to the growth rings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In species like hemlock or cedar at least 75% of the wood can be manufactured into lumber, while for a balsam logs, it’s at least 67%. For all other species, at least 50% of overall wood can be manufactured into lumber.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Grade code 4 &#8211; Lumber reject</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lumber reject is the grade given to a log or slab that’s higher in grade than firmwood reject, but not high-grade enough to meet the requirements for a sawlog, due to factors like rot, chars, and holes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The reason there is no grade code 3 or 5 is because they were merged into the lumber reject category as the needs of forestry industries changed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16039" src="https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-44.png" alt="" width="960" height="463" srcset="https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-44.png 960w, https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-44-300x145.png 300w, https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-44-768x370.png 768w, https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-44-480x232.png 480w, https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-44-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Grade code 6 &#8211; Undersized log<br />
</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">An undersized log is the higher in grade than firmwood reject but cut from a tree which was below the minimum diameter to be processed into high-quality, useable lumber.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Grade code Z &#8211; Firmwood reject </strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The lowest grade of wood, a Grade code Z log is not of a high enough quality to be made into lumber.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A log falls into the firmwood reject category if there is heart rot or a hole that runs the entire length of the log, and any firmwood around the defect makes up less than 50% of the overall log.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A scaler may also grade a log as Z if rot is in the log and they estimate the net length of the log to be less than 1.2 m. Sap rot or charred wood within a log where the residual firmwood is less than 10 cm in diameter at the butt end of the log also makes it Grade code Z.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Portions of healthier logs that are less than 10 cm in diameter or portion of a slab that is less than 10 cm in thickness, are also in this category.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Supporting healthy, resilient forests </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Wood that is unsuitable for valuable sawlogs was once seen as a residual of forestry harvest and burned as a means of disposal, emitting CO<sub>2,</sub> and polluting local air. The biomass market, however, processes low-grade wood into a feedstock for renewable electricity, unlocking the full value of forest resources, as well as enhancing ecosystems.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Newly developed forest management practises aimed at mitigating against wildfires, enhancing areas of habitats for wildlife, or restoring fire or diseased-damaged ecosystems, typically generate high volumes of low-grade wood. Without a local biomass market that can purchase and make use of that wood there’s less incentive to carry out these kinds of activities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As wildfires and pests, like the mountain pine beetle, become increasing threats for Canadian forests and the rural communities who depend on them for work and leisure, the biomass sector’s participation is key to supporting forest management that ensures healthy, resilient forests.</p>

<p>How different management strategies are expanding the world’s working forests</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/ca/sustainable-bioenergy/the-key-to-sustainable-forests-thinking-globally-and-managing-locally/">The key to sustainable forests? Thinking globally and managing locally</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.drax.com/ca">Drax Canada</a>.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working forests, where wood products are harvested, are explicitly managed to balance environmental and economic benefits, </strong><strong>while encouraging healthy, growing forests that store carbon, provide habitats for wildlife, and space for recreation. </strong></li>
<li><strong>But there is no single </strong><strong>management technique. The most effective methods vary depending on local conditions. </strong></li>
<li><strong>By employing locally appropriate methods, working forests have grown while supporting essential forestry industries and local economies. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Forests in the U.S. South, British Columbia, and Estonia all demonstrate how local management can deliver both environmental and economic wins.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Forests are biological, environmental, and economic powerhouses. Collectively they are home to most of the planet’s terrestrial biodiversity. They are responsible for absorbing <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/3-reasons-companies-are-investing-in-forest-conservation-and-restoration-and-how-they-do-it#:~:text=environmental%20degradation%20worldwide.-,The%20sustainable%20management%20of%20forests%20could%20create%20%24230%20billion%20in,%2C%20and%20values%2Dbased%20leadership." target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.6 billion tonnes</a> of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) equivalent per year, or roughly 1.5 times the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by the United States on an annual basis. And working forests, which are actively managed to generate revenue from wood products industries, are important drivers for the global economy, employing over <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/forests/brief/forests-generate-jobs-and-incomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 million people</a> worldwide and generating <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/forests/brief/forests-generate-jobs-and-incomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600 billion annually</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But as important as forests are globally, the key to maximizing working forests’ potential lies in smart, active forest management. While 420 million hectares of forest have been <a href="https://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/">lost since 1990</a> through conversion to other land uses such as for agriculture, many working forests are actually growing both larger and healthier due to science-based management practices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The best practices in working forests balance economic, social, and environmental benefits. But just as importantly, they are tailored to local conditions and framed by appropriate regional regulations, guidance, and best-practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The following describes how three different regions, from which Drax sources its biomass, manage their forests for a sustainable future.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>British Columbia: Managing locally for global climate change</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">British Columbia is blanketed by almost 60 million hectares of forest – an area larger than France and Germany combined. Over 90% of the forest land is owned by Canada’s government, meaning the province’s forests are managed for the benefit of the Canadian people and in collaboration with First Nations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">From the province’s expanse of forested land, less than half a percent (0.36%) is harvested each year, <a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/state-canadas-forests-report/timber-being-harvested-sustainably/16494">according to government figures</a>. This ensures stable, sustainable forests. However, there’s a need to manage against natural factors.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, 2018, and 2020 catastrophic fires ripped through some of British Columbia’s most iconic forest areas, underscoring the threat climate change poses to the area’s natural resources. One response was to increase the removal of stands of trees in the forest, harvesting the large number of dead or dying trees created by pests that have grown more common in a warming climate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By removing dead trees, diseased trees, and even some healthy trees, forest managers can reduce the amount of potential fuel in the forest, making devastating wildfires less likely. There are also commercial advantages to this strategy. Most of the trees removed are low quality and not suitable for processing into lumber. These trees can, however, still be used commercially to produce biomass wood pellets that offer a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. This means local communities don’t just get safer forests, they get safer forests that support the local economy.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The United States</strong><strong>: Thinning for healthier forests </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. South’s forests have expanded rapidly in recent decades, largely due to growth in working forests on private land. Annual forest growth in the region more than doubled from <a href="https://forestscope.info/">193 million cubic metres of wood in 1953 to 408 million cubic meters by 2015</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This expansion has occurred thanks to active forest product markets which incentivise forest management investment. In the southern U.S. thinning is critical to managing healthy and productive pine forests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thinning is an intermediate harvest aimed at reducing tree density to allocate more resources, like nutrients, sunlight, and water, to trees which will eventually become valuable sawtimber. Thinning not only increases future sawtimber yields, but also improves the forest’s resilience to pest, disease, and wildfire, as well as enhancing understory diversity and wildlife habitat.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">While trees removed during thinning are generally undersized or unsuitable for lumber, they’re ideal for producing biomass wood pellets. In this way, the biomass market creates an incentive for managers to engage in practices that increase the health and vigour of forests on their land.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The results speak for themselves: across U.S. forestland the volume of annual <a href="https://www.forestlandowners.com/forest-facts/">net timber growth 36% higher</a> than the volume of annual timber removals.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Estonia: Seeding the future</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Though Estonia is not a large country, approximately half of it is covered in trees, meaning forestry is integral to the country’s way of life. Historically, harvesting trees has been an important part of the national economy, and the government has established strict laws to ensure sustainable management practices.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These regulations have helped Estonia increase its overall forest cover from about 34% 80 years ago to <a href="https://envir.ee/en/water-forest-resources/forestry">over 50% today</a>. And, as in the U.S. South, the volume of wood harvested from Estonia’s forests each year is less than the volume added by tree growth.</p>
<div id="attachment_10529" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 2570px;">

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Estonia has managed to increase its growing forest stock by letting the average age of its forests increase. This is partially due to Estonia having young, fast-growing forests in areas where tree growth is relatively new. But it is also due to regulations that require harvesters to leave seed trees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Seed trees are healthy, mature trees, the seeds from which become the forest’s next generation. By enforcing laws that ensure seed trees are not harvested, Estonia is encouraging natural regeneration of forests. As in the U.S. South protecting these seed trees from competition for water and nutrients means removing smaller trees in the area. While these smaller trees may not all be suitable for lumber, they are a suitable feedstock for biomass. It means managing for natural regeneration can still have economic, as well as environmental, advantages.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Different methods, similar results</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Laws, landownership, and forestry practices differ greatly between the U.S. South, British Columbia, and Estonia, but all three are excellent examples of how local forest management contributes to healthy rural economies and sustained forest coverage.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many different strategies for creating a balance between economic and environmental interests, all successful strategies have something in common: They encourage healthy, growing forests.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drax has recently purchased the Princeton pellet facility from the Princeton Standard Pellet Corporation &amp; intends to add this site to Drax’s certification management program. Part of this process requires the development of mitigation measures for any specified risk ratings identified in the Sustainable Biomass Program endorsed Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) of British Columbia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.drax.com/ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/10/Supply-Base-Report-Pinnacle-Renewable-Energy-Inc-Princeton-Division.pdf">Here</a> you will find a detailed summary of how Drax intend on carrying out mitigation measures for risk identified in the SBP RRA relating to the Princeton site and we want your input. As an active member of the forestry community in BC, your input is valuable to us when designing mitigation measures and we want to ensure we capture as many perspectives as possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For context, Drax are not forest managers. We source wood fibre waste like sawdust, shavings, chips, and bark from sawmills and other wood processing facilities. We also source wood fibre waste direct from the forest from sources like slash or roadside debris piles, wildfire damaged or insect damaged stands, wildfire proofing or habitat enhancement projects and occasionally receive pulp quality roundwood where pulp markets do not exist. Our ability to influence “on the ground” forest activities is limited due to our dissociation from forest management activities. Our mitigation measures are focused on information gathering and sharing in the form of detailed supplier mapping packages, in addition to monitoring, policies, participation in conservation efforts, and advocating for forest certification.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We want to hear your thoughts and comments as to managing Princeton’s certification &amp; the effectiveness of those mitigation measures and if there are any other factors we should consider. The comment period will be open until <strong>November 26<sup>th</sup>, 2022</strong>, however, if you have comments after that date feel free to pass them along anyway. They may not make it into the final draft for this year, but we will certainly consider your comment for next years review, encouraging the system to mature and refine over time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks in advance for your time and consideration in reviewing our Princeton supply base report. We hope you will find the document informative, and we look forward to hearing some thought-provoking feedback.</p>
