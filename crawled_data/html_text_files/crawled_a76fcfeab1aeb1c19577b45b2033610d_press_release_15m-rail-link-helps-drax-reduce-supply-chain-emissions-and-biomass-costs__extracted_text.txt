climate policy forests and biomass transport contact us 15m rail link helps drax reduce supply chain emissions and biomass costs the new rail link allows drax to deliver around 7000 tonnes of sustainable biomass to the port of greater baton rouge in each train compared to just 27 tonnes that could be transported by each truck previously 26 may 2020 the rail link has increased capacity to deliver more sustainable biomass from draxs lasalle bioenergy pellet plant in louisiana usa to its uk power station taking thousands of trucks off local roads the 15 million rail link and other initiatives have already contributed to a 5tonne reduction in draxs biomass production costs in 2019 in its first year of operation a new 15m rail link has increased the flow of sustainable biomass from one of drax groups us pellet plants to its uk power station reducing emissions and costs whilst increasing the resilience of the energy companys supply chain the first train arrives at the lasalle plant in may 2019 by rafael moreno the five miles of rail track connects draxs lasalle pellet plant in northern louisiana to the regional rail network enabling freight trains to deliver the pellets to the companys dedicated export facility at the port of greater baton rouge from there the pellets are shipped to drax power station in north yorkshire which supplies around 12 of the uks renewable electricity the new rail link allows drax to deliver around 7000 tonnes of sustainable biomass to the port of greater baton rouge in each train compared to just 27 tonnes that could be transported by each truck previously drax biomass senior vice president matt white said the new rail spur has been a great success since it was commissioned last may it has significantly increased the amount of sustainable biomass we can deliver its also taken thousands of trucks off local roads unlocking carbon savings and costs in our supply chain as we build a longterm future for the sustainable biomass that provides millions of uk homes and businesses with renewable power biomassgenerated electricity will be an important part of the global climate change solution it supports healthy forest growth and biodiversity while providing reliable flexible renewable power and could enable bioenergy with carbon capture and storage known as beccs  a vital negative emissions technology that will be crucial to meeting net zero targets a team of up to 40 contractors worked through two of the wettest louisiana winters in decades to clear the site excavating around 180000 cubic yards of dirt to level off the ground and stabilise it before three sets of rail tracks could be laid the work also included installing conveyors to get the pellets to the new rail loading point rafael moreno drax biomass associate director of engineering said it was a huge amount of work and the wet winters certainly created some challenges its hard to excavate when everything turns into mud but the team pulled together and worked through the night to get the track laid and completed so the spur could be commissioned in may last year the rail spur at lasalle is part of draxs wider efforts to cut the costs of its biomass by around a third by 2027 the rail link and other initiatives including the colocation of a sawmill at the lasalle site last year has already contributed to a 3 reduction in biomass production costs to 161tonne in 2019 compared with 166tonne in 2018 drax acquired the lasalle bioenergy plant in urania in northern louisiana in 2017 lasalle bioenergy is one of three us pellet plants owned by drax the three plants produce a total of 15 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets a year ends picture captions installing the scales in january 2019 to weigh the pellets

us operations include colocation of a sawmill constructed by hunt forest products in 2019 next to the lasalle pellet plant the sawmill which began production in february last year supplies sawmill residues such as sawdust to drax this helps lower processing costs to produce pellets and delivers the greatest carbon savings it also reduces transportation costs further operational efficiencies to come this year include the full commissioning of a rail logistics facility known as a rail chambering yard at the port of greater baton rouge this allows multiple trains to arrive at the port at the same time reducing congestion at the pellet plants by 2022 these and other initiatives are expected to reduce the cost of draxs selfsupplied biomass by 35tonne compared to 2018 costs sustainable biomass is an important part of the uks longterm energy mix using sustainable biomass at drax power station has already delivered carbon savings of more than 80 and made drax europes largest decarbonisation project about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 its 2900strong employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of flexible low carbon and renewable electricity generation assets across britain the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted two thirds of drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan it also owns and operates four gas power stations in england customers through its two b2b energy supply brands haven power and opus energy drax supplies energy to 250000 businesses across england scotland and wales pellet production drax owns and operates three pellet mills in the us south which manufacture compressed wood pellets biomass produced from sustainably managed working forests these pellet mills supply around 20 of the biomass used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more
