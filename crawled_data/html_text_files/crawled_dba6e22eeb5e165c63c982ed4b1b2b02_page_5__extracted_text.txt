electricity generation understanding the pounds behind the power will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 26 july 2017 opinion editors note on 21 st september 2017 the board announced that will gardiner would replace dorothy thompson as chief executive drax group as of 1 st january 2018 read the announcement to the london stock exchange  this story was written by will two months prior to that announcement and remains unedited below the uk electricity market used to be simpler coal gas and nuclear plants generated energy and fed power into the national grid  retail companies then delivered that power to homes and businesses across the country thanks to regional distribution network operators  today its not as simple the energy system of great britain has grown more complex  it needed to the push to lower carbon emissions led to the introduction of an array of different power generation technologies and fuels to the energy mix these all generate power in different ways at different times and in different conditions added to this are government schemes that have changed how this is all funded in short our electricity market is now more complex drax group has transformed itself to align with this new system it is now an energy company with complementary operations across its supply chain  sourcing fuel  generating 17 of great britains renewable power and then selling much of that electricity directly to business customers in the retail market  this has fundamentally changed both how we do business and the financial mechanisms behind the business where are we now draxs financial and operating strategies are very much interlinked shifting how we generate energy changes how we generate revenue the company is structured according to a set of distinct business segments each of which is treated in a slightly different way the generation business drax has adapted its business model to the uk governments regulatory framework which through successive administrations has broadly promoted investment in renewable and low carbon power generation three of our six electricity generation units  accounting for 68 of our output in the first half of 2017  have been upgraded from coal to produce renewable electricity from sustainable compressed wood pellets  these units are a core part of britains renewable energy mix guaranteed income from the third unit conversion has given us a significantly higher degree of earnings visibility and reduced our exposure to commodity prices h1 2017 107 twh total generation 73 twh biomass generation our coal generation units no longer provide 247 baseload electricity this means we primarily use our coal generation as a support system when the grid needs it we can ramp up and down coal generation responding to demand and ancillary service needs  our renewable generation units do this too ultimately however our longterm goal is to convert the remaining coal units  either to renewables or to gas our research and innovation team is currently looking into how we might be able to do this but early indications show that coaltogas conversion could be an attractive option for delivering flexible and reliable generation capacity for the uk drax power is doing well and generated 137m of ebitda in the first half of this year a 51m increase compared to the first half of 2016 we are confident about the projected growth of our power generation business to 300 million ebitda by 2025 that plan is aided by our move into rapid response gas  a technology that can meet urgent needs of a power system that includes an increasing amount of weatherdependent renewables two of the four rapid response gas projects were developing are ready to bid for 15year capacity market contracts this coming february they are designed to start up from cold faster than coal and combined cycle gas turbine ccgt units these smallyetpowerful plants will respond to shortterm power market price signals and be capable of providing other ancillary services to further enhance security of supply these projects should add an attractive additional source of earnings to our generation business they also will have attractive characteristics as a significant element of their earnings will come from the capacity market  guaranteed government income for 15 years the retail business we directly serve the retail market through haven power  which supplies renewable electricity primarily to industrial and commercial customers last week we announced that haven power was able to breakeven six months ahead of schedule retail is an area were growing and in february 2017 we acquired opus energy  the largest nondomestic uk energy company by meters installed outside the big six this has had a marked effect  today were the largest challenger b2b energy retailer in the uk there is a healthy and regular annuity coming in through the existing retail business and we believe this can generate 80 million of ebitda by 2025 which together with our growing biomass supply business will make up a third of our earnings we demonstrated good progress in the first half of the year earning 11m of ebitda the biomass business our two operational wood pellet manufacturing plants in louisiana and mississippi are progressing well they are both still ramping up to full production and have seen marked improvements in pellet quality and production we are looking to grow our us business and as part of this well need to build on the recent addition of lasalle bioenergy with further acquisitions expansion will grow our capacity for the selfsupply of pellets from 15 to 30 of drax power stations requirements adding an additional one million tonnes of production in the second half of 2017 we expect the profitability of drax biomass to increase lasalle will be commissioned in the first half of 2018 and reach capacity in 2019 whats next the energy landscape continues to change and well need to change with it phasing out coal entirely is priority number one for this well continue to look at options how and when we can convert more units to sustainable biomass depends on trials that we are conducting at drax power station during 201718 the right government support would also make further conversions cost effective we also recognise that its important to look at alternative possibilities for our remaining coal units this is why we are seeking planning permission to convert one or more of our 645 mw megawatt coal units to 1300 mw of gas such an upgrade would be at a discount to a newbuild combined cycle gas turbine ccgt power station of equivalent capacity and thats simply because we would use much of the existing infrastructure and equipment another major prospect is in the technology space and so were continuing to invest in research and innovation batteries and storage are a huge opportunity for us  both in how they could benefit our retail customers and how they could provide solutions for largescale centralised energy systems in short its an area with huge potential we welcome the governments recent initiatives designed to stimulate the development of battery technology  as well as encourage the use of electric vehicles drax has gone through a period of considerable change and that will continue as we meet the uks lowcarbon energy demands we are improving the quality of our earnings reducing our exposure to commodities and positioning to take advantage of future opportunities as we told investors in june if we deliver on these plans we can expect 425 million of ebitda in 2025  tags will gardiner  electricity generation  investors  gas  supply chain  financial reports 4 of the most exciting emerging technologies in electricity generation 6 july 2017 power generation since the dawn of the industrial age the world has been powered by a relatively small set of technologies the 20 th century was the age of coal but this side of 2000 thats changed the need to curb emissions and the rise of renewables from wind to solar to biomass has significantly changed how we fuel our power generation today some of the worlds most interesting and exciting emerging technologies are those designed to generate electricity microbial fuel cells  harnessing the power of bacteria bacteria are all around us some are harmful some are beneficial but all of them breathe when they breathe oxidation occurs which is when something combines with oxygen at a chemical level and when bacteria do this electrons are released by connecting breathing microbes to a cathode and an anode the positive and negative rods of a battery the flow of these released electrons can be harnessed to generate power this is whats known as a microbial fuel cell mfc mfcs are used largely to generate electricity from waste water but are expanding into more exotic uses like powering miniature aquatic robots  new developments are constantly expanding the power and applications of mfcs researchers at binghamton university new york found that combining phototropic lightconsuming and heterotrophic matterconsuming bacteria in microbial fuel reactions generates currents 70 times more powerful than in conventional setups solar  a new dawn solar power may not be a new technology but where its going is one of the most promising developments in the space is solar voltaic glass which has the properties of a sheet of window glass but can also generate solar power rather than collecting photons like normal solar does and which transparent materials by definition cant do photovoltaic glass uses salts to absorb energy from nonvisible wavelengths and deflects these to conventional solar cells embedded at the edge of each panel or theres solar pv paint which contains tiny light sensitive particles coated with conductive materials when layered over electrodes youve got a sprayon power generator betavoltaics  nothing wasted from nuclear waste nuclear material is constantly decaying and in the process emits radioactive particles this is why extremely radioactive material is so dangerous and why properly storing nuclear waste is so important and so expensive but this waste can actually be put to good use betavoltaic devices use the waste particles produced by lowlevel radioactive materials to capture electrons and generate electricity the output from these devices can be fairly low and decreases over long periods of time but because of the consistent output of nuclear decay they can be extremely longlasting for example one betavoltaic battery could provide one watt of power continuously for 30 years  and while they arent currently fit to work on a large scale their longevity and very compact size make them ideal power sources for devices such as sensors installed on equipment that needs to be operational for long periods tidal power  changing tides a more predictable power source than intermittent renewables like wind and solar tidal power isnt new however its growth and development has typically been restrained by high costs and limited availability thats changing last year saw the launch of the first of 269 15 mw megawatt underwater turbines part of worlds first large scale tidal energy farm in scotland  around the world there are existing tidal power stations  such as the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea  which has a capacity of 254mw  but the meygen array in scotland will be able to take the potential of the technology further its hoped that when fully operational it will generate 398mw or enough to power 175000 homes we might not know exactly how the electricity of tomorrow will be generated but its likely some or all of these technologies will play a part what is clear is that our energy is

the whole country on the same frequency 23 june 2017 power generation the modern world sits on a volatile fizzing web of electricity in 2015 the uk consumed roughly 303 terawatt hours twh of electricity according to government statistics  thats an awful lot of power humming around and in this country we take it for granted that electricity is controlled this means the power supply coming into your home or place of work is reliable and wont trip your fuse box in short it means your mobile phone will keep on charging and your washing machine will keep on spinning but generating and circulating electricity at safe usable levels is not an easy task one of the most overlooked aspects of doing this is electrical frequency  and how its regulated what is electrical frequency to understand the importance of frequency we need to understand a couple of important things about power generation generators work by converting the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine into electrical energy in a steamdriven generator like those at drax power station  high pressure steam turns a turbine which turns a rotor mounted inside a stator copper wire is wound around the rotor energised with electricity this turns it into an electromagnet with a north and south pole the stator is made up of large heavy duty copper bars which enclose the rotor as the rotor turns its magnetic field passes through the copper bars and induces an electric current which is sent out onto the transmission system as the magnetic field has a north and south pole the copper bars experience a change in direction of the magnetic field each time the rotor turns this makes the electric current change direction twice per revolution and is called an alternating current ac there are in fact three sets of copper bars in the stator producing three electrical outputs or phases termed red yellow and blue electrical frequency is the measure of the rate of that oscillation and is measured in the number of changes per second  also called hertz hz a generator running at 3000 rpm  with two magnetic poles produces electricity at a frequency of 50hz why is this important maintaining a consistent electrical frequency is important because multiple frequencies cannot operate alongside each other without damaging equipment this has serious implications when providing electricity at a national scale the exact figure is less important than the need to keep frequency stable across all connected systems in great britain the grid frequency is 50hz in the us its 60hz in japan the western half of the country runs at 60hz and the eastern half of the country runs at 50hz  a string of power stations across the middle of the country steps up and down the frequency of the electricity as it flows between the two grids sticking to one national frequency is a team effort every generator in england scotland and wales connected to the high voltage transmission system is synchronised to every other generator when the output of any of the three phases  the red yellow or blue  is at a peak the output from all other phases of the same colour on every other generating unit in great britain is also at a peak they are all locked together  synchronised  to form a single homogenous supply which provides stability and guaranteed quality how is frequency managed the problem is frequency can be difficult to control  if the exact amount of electricity being used is not matched by generation it can affect the frequency of the electricity on the grid for example if theres more demand for electricity than there is supply frequency will fall if there is too much supply frequency will rise to make matters more delicate theres a very slim margin of error in great britain anything just 1 above or below the standard 50hz risks damaging equipment and infrastructure  see how far the countrys frequency is currently deviating from 50 hz  managing electrical frequency falls to a countrys high voltage transmission system operator the national grid in the uk the grid can instruct power generators like drax to make their generating units automatically respond to changes in frequency if the frequency rises the turbine reduces its steam flow if it falls it will increase changing the electrical output  a change that needs to happen in seconds in the case of generating units at drax power station the response starts less than a second from the initial frequency deviation the inertial forces in a spinning generator help slow the rate of frequency change acting like dampers on car suspension which minimises large frequency swings frequency on a fastchanging system not all power generation technologies are suited for providing high quality frequency response roles and as the uk transitions to a lowercarbon economy ancillary services such as stabilisation of frequency are becoming more important neither solar nor wind can be as easily controlled its possible to regulate wind output down or hold back wind turbines to enable upward frequency response when there is sufficient wind similarly solar panels can be switched on and off to simulate frequency response as solar farms are so widely dispersed and tend to be embedded  meaning they operate outside of the national system it is not as easy for national grid to instruct and monitor them both wind and solar have no inertia so the allimportant damping effect is missing too using these intermittent or weatherdependent power generation technologies to help manage frequency can be expensive compared to thermal power stations nor are the current fleet of nuclear reactors flexible  nuclear reactors in great britain were designed to run continuously at high loads known as a baseload power although they cannot deliver frequency response services the countrys nuclear power stations do provide inertia twenty times faster thermal power generation technologies such as renewable biomass or fossil fuels such as coal and gas are ideal for frequency response services at scale because they can be easily dialled up or down as both the fuel supply to their boilers and steam within their turbines can be regulated the 645 mw thermal power units at drax have the capability to respond to the grids needs in as little as half a second or less complete their change in output in under one second and maintain their response for many minutes or even hours before the introduction of high volumes of wind and solar generation almost all generators excluding nuclear running on the system could provide frequency response as these generators are increasingly replaced by intermittent technologies the system operator must look for new services to maintain system stability an example is national grids recent enhanced frequency response tender which asked for a solution that can deliver frequency stabilisation in under a second  20 times faster than the primary response provided by existing thermal power stations drax was the only participating thermal power station however all contracts were all won by battery storage projects frequency future given the decline in fossil fuel generation and uncertainty around our power makeup in future decades national grid is consulting on how best to source services such as frequency response the ideal scenario for national grid is one where services can be increasingly sourced from reliable flexible and affordable forms of low carbon generation or demand response the next generation of nuclear power stations as with some already operating in france can provide frequency response services however the first of the new crop hinkley c is around a decade away from being operational  likewise solar or wind coupled with battery molten salt or flywheel storage will provide an increasing level of flexibility in the decades ahead as storage costs come down thanks to power generation at drax with compressed wood pellets  a form of sustainable biomass britain has already begun moving into an era where lower carbon frequency response can begin to form the foundation of a more reliable and cleaner system this story is part of a series on the

during rapid decarbonisation  tags national grid  energy policy  investors  electricity  electricity generation why you shouldnt be surprised by another recordbreaking quarter for renewable energy 11 may 2017 power generation its been another recordbreaking quarter for britains power system during the first three months of 2017 biomass wind and hydro all registered their highest energy production ever while solar recorded its highest ever peak output and while this is all worth celebrating it shouldnt come as a surprise  the last few years have seen britains power system take several significant steps toward decarbonisation and this year is no different electric insights the quarterly report on britains power system by dr iain staffell from imperial college london commissioned by drax via imperial consultants documents the new gains and confirms the trend renewables are fast becoming the new norm and in 2017 they continued their growth the renewable record breakers over this quarter biomass electricity generation hit a record production figure of 44 twh which means that biomass generators ran at 95 of full capacity  higher than any other technology has achieved over the last decade hydro went 4 better than its previous energy production best by generating 16 twh while britains wind farms produced 113 twh 10 higher than the previous record set in 2015 this was helped in part by several new farms being built which increased installed capacity by 5 over last year but it was also indebted to the mild windy weather wind farms produced more electricity than coal 57 days out of 90 during the first three months of 2017 solar hit a new record peak output at the end of march when it generated 767 gw  enough to power a fifth of the country in fact during the last weekend of march for the first time ever the countrys demand for electricity from the national grid was lower during an afternoon than during the night this was because solar panels which only generate power when the sun is up tend to sit outside of the national high voltage transmission grid understanding how this happened is to understand how solar energy is changing our national power system a reverse of the trend electricity demand on the national grid  think of it as the power systems motorways  is typically higher during the day and early evening when people are most active using lights and gadgets than overnight however on the last weekend in march 2017 the opposite was true because of how much solar energy was generated solar panels and some smaller onshore windfarms are invisible  they dont feed into the national grid instead these sources either feed into the regional electricity distribution networks  the power systems a and b roads  or as many of them are on peoples roofs and used in their own homes or business premises it never gets down their driveway this can mean when solar panels are generating a lot of electricity there is a lower demand for power from the grid making it appear that less of the country is using electricity than it actually is this was the case during the last weekend of march when solar generated enough power to satisfy a large part of britains demand and while this is another positive step towards a lower carbon energy mix it is about to change the way our power system works particularly when it comes to the remaining coal power stations what the power system needs to provide today and in the future is flexibility  to ramp up and down to accommodate for the shifting demand based on supply of intermittent  weather dependent  renewables thermal power stations such as gas coal and biomass can meet much of this demand but even more rapid response from technologies such as the open cycle gas turbines that drax is developing and batteries could fulfil these needs quicker todays dirty is yesterdays clean the record breaking and increased renewable generation of the period from january to march 2017 would mean nothing if it wasnt matched by a decrease in emissions during the first three months of 2017 emissions dropped 10 lower than the same period in 2016 and a massive 33 lower than 2015 coal output alone fell 30 this quarter compared to q1 2016 to put the scale of this progress into context we need only look at the quarters dirtiest hour  the hour in which carbon intensity from electricity generation is at its highest between january and march it peaked on a calm and cold january evening with 424 grams of co 2 released per kwh gkwh the average for generation between 2009 and 2013 was 471 gkwh in short this quarters dirtiest hour was cleaner than the average figure just four years ago  yesterdays average is todays extremity if we want to continue to break records and further progress towards a

slowly across the inside of a cavernous warehouse below a team of engineers stand around a turbine spindle the size of a double decker bus but weighing four times as much at 65 tonnes waiting for the cranes descent around them other engineers work on similarsized equipment one uses a wrench the size of an arm another programs a computerised lever to carefully strip millimetres from a piece of steel its just a normal day inside drax power station s machine workshop for the last 15 years this workshop has been refurbishing repairing and manufacturing tools and equipment for use at the power station  a fact that sets drax apart from other stations like it were envied by a few stations because we do most things inhouse says turbine engineer and head of the workshop andrew storr were leagues in front of everyone else in the uk because weve got our own manufacturing and machining facility we can do all this work on site were not relying on other people storr set up the workshop in 2001 after being asked to reverse engineer a replacement set of governor relays components that help regulate the flow of steam going into the turbines for one of draxs steam turbines today its a thriving centre of activity filled with heavyduty machinery and ingenious engineers a look inside the workshop when youre manufacturing spares its not a matter of going down to our machine shop and just saying make one of those youve got to have the correct grade of material the correct size the correct certification for the material  you cant just have a scrappy piece of steel that you find its got to have paperwork with it to say its certified up to whatever its supposed to be says storr turbine bearings need to be bored to size using a horizontal borer that very accurately shaves out the lining of the inner bearing getting it right is incredibly important explains storr if its made too large it causes the turbine shaft to vibrate if its made too small the bearing becomes too hot and the white metal will melt and pour out the bearing we need to avoid both of these issues at all cost the inside of the turbine blading needs to have seal strips administered by hand as theyre delicately made to limit any damage to the spinning shaft should they touch each other despite the wealth of equipment at the disposal of the team in the shop success depends on the skill of the engineers using it there are three 160tonne cranes in the turbine hall each installed before the turbines were built this meant the construction companies who erected the turbines could lift all heavy components into place with ease due to their size they move slowly it takes approximately 20 minutes for the largest hook to travel from the ground all the way to the top says storr in mechanical engineering its sometimes necessary to fit one part inside another and once these parts are assembled they must stay locked together and not come apart storr says one way the team does this is by shrinking some components and for this they use liquid nitrogen the team places the component that needs to fit inside another into a bath of liquid nitrogen and shrink it at 190 degrees celsius once shrunk the team assembles the two placing the now smaller component into the larger one eventually the inner part warms up to ambient temperature and grows in size making the fit very tight and preventing them from coming apart explains storr in the past drax would send the work they now do in the machine shop to companies off site and because all other power stations in the area would do the same thing wait times would often be long and the quality of the output could vary when we do it inhouse i can keep my eye on it says storr i can reprioritise things depending on what is going to be needed back on the turbine first  weve got 100 control over it we can make sure everythings hunkydory tags technology  drax power station  electricity  electricity generation north yorkshire tops chart for renewable energy andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 8 april 2016 opinion a new survey from the green alliance and regen sw shows that selby in north yorkshire produces the most renewable energy of any area in england and wales as you can see drax s home tops the chart by a large margin thats because between three and four per cent of the uks electricity is generated from sustainable biomass here at drax power station weve already converted half the station to use compressed wood pellets that half of drax has reduced its carbon emissions by more than 80 per cent as a result but theres so much more drax could do to help the uk get more coal off the grid and if the green alliances next data visualization pitted renewables against fossil fuels a renewableonly drax as our countrys biggest power station would give low carbon technologies an even bigger share than would be the case today drax can not only generate more renewable power ourselves but also help solar and wind power to cope with demand as some of the older coal gas and nuclear plant retire over the coming years moving towards a balanced mix of renewables including further biomass upgrades at drax
