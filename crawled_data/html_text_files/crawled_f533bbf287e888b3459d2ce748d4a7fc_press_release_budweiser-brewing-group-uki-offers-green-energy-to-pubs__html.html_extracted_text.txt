Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I offers green energy to pubs
Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I, part of AB InBev, has today announced a partnership with leading renewable energy supplier, Opus Energy, to launch an exclusive green energy tariff for pubs and bars. The deal follows the announcement that the company will brew Budweiser with 100% renewable electricity for its UK operations by the end of 2020.
20 December 2019
The programme supports the brewer’s ambitious Sustainability Goals while helping customers save on their monthly energy bills
The programme, in partnership with Opus Energy, is currently in a pilot phase and will roll out nationwide in Spring 2020
The launch follows customer research which revealed that energy bills score high on the list of priorities for pubs and bars looking to reduce costs.

As such, Budweiser Brewing Group is evolving its offering — directly addressing the needs and demands of pub and bar operators up and down the country, while helping to reduce their environmental impact.
The exclusive renewable electricity tariff is offered by
Opus Energy
, part of Drax Group, and is guaranteed to be cheaper than any other deal found through price comparison or third-party alternatives, with a saving of up to 30% from existing standard renewal prices from other suppliers.
Pubs and bars which take advantage of the exclusive deal will join over 355,000 business premises in the UK currently powered by renewable electricity from Opus Energy. The programme is currently in pilot phase with 100 pubs and will roll out in Spring 2020, helping more businesses to reduce their carbon emissions and contribute to tackling the climate crisis.
Paula Lindenberg, President at Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I says,
“For us, sustainability isn’t just about looking at our own operations — it’s also about looking outward and supporting our customers. We know that our customers are eager to save on energy costs, and that consumers are more environmentally conscious than ever, so this really is a sweet spot where we can make a difference.”
Marc Montgomery, Director of SME Direct, Opus Energy says,
“We’re thrilled to team up with Budweiser Brewing Group to supply renewable electricity to more pubs and bars across the UK. Enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future for businesses is our purpose, and this partnership will help more pubs to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute towards the UK’s net zero carbon targets.”
This deal is the latest in a series of sustainability initiatives by Budweiser Brewing Group. Last year, it signed the UK’s biggest unsubsidised solar power deal with Lightsource BP to brew Budweiser with 100% renewable electricity for its UK operations by the end of 2020.
With completion of the new UK solar farm expected by mid-2020, all UK-brewed Budweiser will begin to feature a new symbol to encourage consumers to choose a beer brewed with 100% renewable electricity. Similarly, Budweiser Brewing Group will offer window decals for pubs that sign up to the Opus Energy deal.
The investment in UK solar reinforces the brewer’s commitment to its 2025 Sustainability Goals, which includes the target of a 25% reduction to carbon emissions across its value chain against a 2017 baseline – the equivalent of taking more than 1.5 million cars off the road each year.
Drax Group is the first business in the world to
announce an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030
– making a major contribution towards global efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), Drax will remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces, creating a negative carbon footprint for the company.
