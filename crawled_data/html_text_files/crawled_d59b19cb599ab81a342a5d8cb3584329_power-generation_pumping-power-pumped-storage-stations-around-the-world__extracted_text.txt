pumping power pumped storage stations around the world from humble to humongous the hydro stations balancing grids and stabilising our energy supply 30 december 2020 power generation changing the worlds energy systems is a more complex task than just replacing coal power stations with wind farms moving to an energy system with more intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar will require greater levels of storage that can deliver electricity when its needed one of the longestablished means of storing energy and using it to generate electricity when needed is through pumped hydropower storage with upper and lower reservoirs of water and turbines in between these facilities act a bit like rechargeable batteries when there is excess electricity on the grid the turbines are switched on to pump water from the lower to the higher reservoir for example up a mountain or hill where its stored when electricity is needed the water is released to flow from the higher reservoir toward the lower reservoir passing through the turbines which generate electricity to send back to the grid greater levels of intermittent renewables on energy systems around the world will make pumped storage all the more vital in helping to balance grids their mountainous locations also make pumped storage stations some of the most dramatic and interesting monuments in energy here are some of the most interesting pumped hydro stations generating power and pumping water up mountains in the world 1 the largest in the world currently bath county in virginia usa is dense with forests and mountain retreats but below the scenery of the allegheny mountains lies the worlds biggest pumped hydro power station view of appalachian mountains along highway 220 in warm springs bath county virginia the bath county pumped storage station has a maximum generation capacity of more than 3 gigawatts gw and total storage capacity of 24 gigawatthours gwh the equivalent to the total yearly electricity use of about 6000 homes  construction began in march 1977 and upon completion in december 1985 the power station had a generating capacity of 21 gw however its six turbines were upgraded between 2004 and 2009 to over 500 mw per turbine the power stations upper reservoir can hold 14000000 cubic metres m 3  of water and its water level can drop by as much as 32 metres during operations while the amount of earth and rock moved during the construction of the dam and facilities would make a mountain more than 300 metres tall the actual station occupies a relatively small amount of land to minimise its impact on the environment the water from the upper reservoir has a use beyond power too  at times of drought its used to supplement river flow in the recreational area that surrounds the site 2 the future largest in the world bath county will not be the worlds largest pumped hydro station for much longer while china is already home to more of the top 10 largest pumped storage power stations than any other country the fengning pumped storage power plant in chinas hebei province will take the top position when completed in 2023 thanks to its 36 gw capacity landscape of the bashang grassland in hebei china construction first began on the monster project in june 2013 and is being developed in two 18 gw stages the first stage is scheduled for completion in 2021 when six of the 12 planned 300 mw reversable pump turbine units roar into life the plant will serve beijingtianjinnorth hebei electrical grid and highlights the rapid growth of renewables in the region fengning will act as a peaking plant to balance the expansive wind and solar parks in chinas northern hebei and inner mongolia regions china has more installed pumped hydro storage capacity than any other country thanks in large part to its extensive mountainous terrain which can accommodate such facilities as well as an increasing need to support growing intermittent renewable installations the construction of fengning part of a pipeline of projects will further the countrys capabilities helping china reach as much as 40 gw of installed capacity in the coming years 3 most reversable turbines fengning will also take the record for the most individual turbine units in a pumped storage facility when its finished in 2023 a title that is currently jointly held by huizhou pumped storage power station and guangdong pumped storage power station  these two plants are the respective second and third largest pumped storage plants in the world today each with eight reversable turbines guangzhou city guangdong province china while guangdong pumped storage power station has a capacity of 24 gw huizhou has a slightly larger capacity of 2448 gw the increased number of turbines might mean more machinery to maintain and operate but also offers the plants greater flexibility in how much electricity they absorb and generate 4 multiple dams and reservoirs the drakensberg pumped storage scheme  located in the drakensberg mountains in the province of kwazulunatal south africa is a unique hydro facility thanks to its use of four dams the driekloof dam sterkfontein dam kilburn dam and woodstock dam give the facility a generation capacity of 1 gw and a total storage capacity of over 27 gwh however drakensberg is not the largest facility in south africa drakensberg mountains in south africa south africa holds a total installed pumped storage capacity of nearly 3 gw from its four large facilities the newest and largest is the ingula pumped storage scheme  which has a generation capacity of over 13 gw its name ingula was inspired by the foamy river waters surrounding the facility and comes from the zulu word for the creamy foam on the top of a milk vessel 5 the oldest working pumped storage plant another country with the ideal terrain for pumped storage is switzerland the alpine countrys landscape feeds water into europes rivers such as the rhine making water a plentiful supply for the countrys energy hydropower as a whole accounts for around 57 of the countrys energy production and the country was one of the first to begin deploying pumped storage systems in the 1890s although these were initially used for water management rather than supporting electricity generation water dam and reservoir lake in swiss alps to produce hydropower switzerland is also home to the worlds oldest working pumped storage plant the engeweiher pumped storage facility was built in 1907 before reversable turbines were introduced in the 1930s it was renewed in the early 1990s and is scheduled to continue operating until at least 2052 6 the biggest in europe the alps are also home to europes biggest hydroelectric facility in france the grand maison hydroelectric power station operates in the isère area of the auvergnerhônealpes region and has a capacity of 18 gw during peak demand it takes only three minutes for the station to supply its full 18 gw of power to the national electricity grid of france grand maison hydroelectric power station sitting at an altitude of 1698 metres the majority of the water that fills the upper reservoir created by the grand maison dam comes from melted snow this reservoir has a storage capacity of 140000000 m 3 of water 7 the biggest in the uk across the channel the uk also boasts impressive hydropower and pumped storage credentials having used water for electricity generation since 1879 the uk has a total hydropower capacity of over 47 gw including 28 gw of pumped storage  with the wet mountainous landscapes of scottish highlands and welsh countryside particularly well suited to hydropower facilities dinorwig hydroelectric power station the largest of these is the dinorwig hydro power station which sits at the edge of snowdonia national park in north west wales although its hard to spot as most of the machinery is found underground with a total capacity of over 17 gw this pumped storage plant can power 25 million homes and is known by locals as electric mountain 8 the station lying between the lochs surrounded by loch etive and loch nant and perched on the north side of loch awe draxs cruachan power station was built between 1959 and 1965 1 km inside of a hollowedout mountain in argyll and bute scotland upon completion the power station also known as the hollow mountain was opened by queen elizabeth ii and can currently generate 440 mw of hydroelectric power in 30 seconds helping to maintain stability on the electricity grid cruachan dam in argyll and bute a proposed sister station cruachan 2  which would stand adjacent to the existing facility could enable cruachan to produce up to twice as much power increasing its support of renewables coming onto the grid 9 the worlds smallest the goudemand apartment building in the city of arras france is home to an extremely small pumped storage hydroelectricity system with no mountain in sight the residential building was transformed in 2012 to become gridindependent through the installation of solar panels wind turbines batteries and a 200 square metre m 2  open air water tank sitting on its roof this tank 30 metres above the ground acts as an upper reservoir and is connected to five 10 m 2 plastic water tanks in the basement the lower reservoir arras france while the 35 kwh kilowatthours capacity of the buildings micro facility is small it provides useful knowledge to researchers opening up the possibility of small modular pumped storage systems to be developed and deployed at scale in the future
