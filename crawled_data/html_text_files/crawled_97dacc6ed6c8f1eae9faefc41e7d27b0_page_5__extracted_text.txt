international papers pulp and paper mill located in the morehouse parish of louisiana had been in operation since 1927 and was once the largest employer in the area however as a result of the global recession of 2008 the company was forced to lay off over 550 employees and shut the facility other mills in the area have also reduced production including georgia pacific which let go around 530 people at its crossett arkansas plant 18 miles to the north of morehouse in 2019 for an area dominated by forests such as northern louisiana and southern arkansas this decline in traditional markets came as a serious blow its a region where a healthy market for wood products is vital for the local economy and in turn the health of the regions forests luckily other wood product manufacturers and industries have since began to fill the gap engineers in front of wood pellet storage silos at draxs morehouse bioenergy biomass manufacturing facility in northern louisiana drax biomass has opened a mill in morehouse parish that uses some of the the lowgrade wood previously used to supply the paper industry to produce compressed wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity in the uk commissioned in 2015 the plant employs 74 people and can produce as much as 525000 metric tonnes of biomass pellets a year this makes it an important facility for local employment and the wood market in the region however to ensure it is positively contributing to the area and its environment the demand for wood must be sustainably managed morehouse bioenergy sources lowgrade wood from a catchment area that covers a 60mile radius and includes 18 counties in arkansas and four in louisiana as drax biomass doesnt own any of the forests it sources wood products from it regularly examines the environmental impact of its pellet mills on the forests and markets in which it operates the aim is to ensure the biomass used by drax to generate 12 of great britains renewable electricity is sustainably sourced and does not contribute to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts a new report by forestry research and consulting firm forisk evaluates the impact of biomass pellet demand from morehouse bioenergy on the forests and wood markets within the mills catchment area map of pulpwoodusing mills near morehouse timber market it found that biomass demand in the region does not contribute to deforestation  nor increase forest harvesting above a sustainable level overall growth of the regions pine timberland which supplies morehouse bioenergy continues to exceed removals pointing to expanding forest carbon and wood inventory annual growth compared to harvesting removals growing forests and increasing timber stocks the study focuses on timberland  working forests  in the plants sourcing area which the us forestry service categorises as productive land capable of providing timber on an industrial scale the timberland here is made up of 63 softwood trees which includes pines and 37 hardwoods such as oak pellet manufacturing as a whole including other pellet producers in the area accounts for only 6 of the demand for wood products in the region of that morehouse bioenergy contributes to 4 of total pellet demand total area of timberland lumber  such as sawtimber  makes up the bulk of demand for wood products accounting for 46 of total demand largely as a result of its high market value and landowners aims to extract maximum revenue from their pine stands however the less valuable wood  parts of trees that are misshapen too short or thin to be used for lumber  can be sold at a lower price to biomass pellet mills this wood might previously have been sold to paper and pulp mills exclusively but with international papers departure morehouse bioenergy now fills a part of that role total volume of growing stock on timberland maintaining healthy markets for both high and lowvalue wood is key to enabling landowners to reforest areas once they have been harvested in the knowledge it will provide a valuable return in the future ultimately however the way forests are maintained depends on the individual landowners and how they want to use their land the advantages of corporate ownership morehouse bioenergys catchment area covers 28000 square kilometres of timberland within which 96 of the timber is privately owned while some of that is owned by families with small patches of productive land 54 is held by corporate owners this includes businesses such as real estate investment trusts reits and timber investment management organisations timos which advise institutional investors on how to manage their forest assets this high percentage of corporate ownership influences forest management and replanting as owners look to maximise the value of forests and seek to continue to generate returns from their land in general corporate owners are spending more money on silviculture and actively managing their timber stands explains forisk consulting partner amanda lang they are investing more in fertiliser their seedlings and harvest control on pine stands because that leads to larger trees of a higher quality and more profit in the long run this is reflected in the higher growth rates found in the private sector leading to faster rates of carbon sequestration annual growth per hectare by owner type smaller private landowners meanwhile may have other objectives for their land like recreation and hunting in addition to timber income as a result some owners may be less inclined to intensively manage their timber stands forgoing fertilisation and competition control due to cost and might harvest on a less regular basis although these landowners may not be maximising the productivity of their timber resource to the same degree corporate owners do their unique management often contribute to greater diversity on the landscape demand and forest health in 2018 the annual average price for a metric tonne of pine sawtimber in morehouse bioenergys catchment area was 2571 down from a 10year high of 3160 in 2010 similarly pine pulpwood from which biomass pellets are made was valued at 775 per metric tonne in 2018 down from a 10year high of 13 in 2010 these low wood prices have caused many landowners to delay harvesting forests in hopes for a more lucrative wood price as a result pine timber inventories have grown across morehouse bioenergys catchment area in 2010 the us forest service counted more than 167 million metric tonnes of pine inventory by 2018 this had increased by more than 35 to reach 226 million morehouse bioenergy market historic stumpage prices metric tonne the report suggests this price slump is an ongoing result of the 2008 recession which greatly affected us house construction  one of the primary uses of sawtimber and many other types of wood products in the us some areas have already seen sawtimber prices increase as they recover from the recession  however the report suggests this is not spread evenly on a national level the inventory overhang in morehouse bioenergys catchment area is expected to begin reversing in 2024 or 2025 as lang explains we expect inventories to increase for a few more years and then start to decline that said inventories will remain higher than prerecession levels while high inventories suggest an abundant resource lower inventory volumes are not indicative of declining or unhealthy forests rather they can point to younger growing forests that have recently been replanted which will later grow to higher inventory volumes as they mature both suggest a healthy forestry industry in which landowners continue to reinvest in forests overall the analysis of the region points to healthy growing forests and importantly a sustainable industry from which drax can responsibly source biomass pellets ensuring the biomass used at drax power station is sustainably sourced is crucial to its generation of renewable carbonneutral electricity and in turn laying the path to negative emissions  read the full report morehouse louisiana catchment area analysis  a short summary of its analysis

around the drax morehouse bioenergy plant has a long history of active management for timber production 96 of the forest owners are private and around half of these are corporate investors seeking a financial return from forest management  the pulp and paper pp sector dominates the market for low grade roundwood with over 75 of the total demand the wood pellet markets use only 6 of the roundwood of which 4 is used by morehouse given the small scale of demand in the pellet sector the extent of influence is limited however the new pellet markets have had a positive impact replacing some of the declining demand in the pp sector and providing a market for thinnings for some forest owners and a new offtake for sawmill residues pine forest is dominant in this area with an increasing inventory

the hardwood inventory remained static historic inventory and timberland area in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload us forest service fia data shows that the pine resource in this catchment area has been maturing the volume of timber has been increasing in each size class year on year this means that the volume available for harvesting is increasing and that more markets will be required to utilise this surplus volume and ensure that the longterm future of the forest area can be maintained historic pine inventory by dbh class in morehouse catchment click to viewdownload this is reflected in the growth drain ratio  the comparison of annual growth versus harvesting a ratio of one shows a forest area in balance less than one shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing phase but it can also occur when insufficient market demand exists and owners are forced to retain stands for longer in the absence of a viable market draxs morehouse bioenergy compressed wood pellet plant in northern louisiana this can have a negative impact on the future growth of the forest limiting the financial return to forest owners and reducing the cumulative sequestration of carbon by enforcing suboptimal rotation lengths the current growth drain ratio of pine around morehouse is 167 with an average annual surplus of around 7 million metric tonnes this surplus of growth is partly due to a decline in sawtimber demand due to the global financial crisis but also due to the maturing age class

john thank you for your letter of the 9 january detailing the findings and recommendations from the first meeting of the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass i want to begin by reiterating how important the work of the iab is to draxs purpose and ambition as you know we recently announced our intention to become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030 by scaling up our pioneering biomass with ccs beccs pilot project this ambition will only be realised if the biomass we use makes a positive contribution to our climate the environment and the communities in which we operate to that end both you and the iab will play a vital role by guiding us on our sourcing choices and challenging us to be as sustainable and transparent as we can be i enjoyed meeting with the iab and hearing your conclusions from the first meeting i am also pleased to hear from my team that the longer discussions were useful and constructive please pass on my thanks to all the members of the iab for their time and consideration in particular i am grateful for their consideration of our new sustainable biomass sourcing policy and the insight and recommendations that were given i am pleased to hear that you agree our policy is an accurate representation of the criteria laid down in the forest research report i agree that a key topic for us to explore is how science can be further developed with regards the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood i also agree that understanding the counter factuals in the usage of wood that has come to us is important this is an area we have and continue to explore and i would refer the iab to a report we have published subsequent to the meeting catchment area analysis of forest management and market trends 2019  which contains an independent analysis of the impact of our sourcing at our amite pellet mill in mississippi the team look forward to discussing this with you at a future meeting and receiving your input to shape the next phases of this work i also agree the need to continuously improve our sustainability policy and seek to update it as new findings come to light as well as ensure that the current policy is embedded into our operations for that reason our policy will be kept under regular review to accommodate changes in science and new evidence as it emerges we have also committed to advancing scientific research in the areas applicable to our operations through partnerships with academic institutions and direct support for academic research with regards your suggestion of a restatement of the academic evidence on biomass sustainability we shall give this interesting approach due consideration i do believe that better alignment through a shared understanding of the evidence among the academic community environmental groups policy makers and industry would be a welcome development and would be grateful to the iab for its further consideration of how this might be achieved i will also raise your considerations regarding the sustainable biomass program spb in my position a member of the spb board you are correct that our new policy goes beyond sbp and so an important work programme for us is how we demonstrate we are meeting the new policy lastly i welcome the addition of two interim telephone calls which will help to keep momentum between the half yearly meetings and will support us as we develop our policy research and implementation projects further thank you for this commitment as the work of the iab progresses i look forward to hearing how you believe drax can best build the evidence required to demonstrate that we are sourcing according to the best available science as the worlds largest biomass consumer it is important that we lead by example this means not only having a world leading biomass sustainability policy in place but also the data and evidence available to give all our stakeholders the confidence that we are fulfilling our purpose of

the past decade the united kingdom has decarbonised significantly as coal power has been replaced by sources like biomass wind and solar every year power generation emits fewer and fewer tonnes of carbon thanks to renewables and with the ban on the sale of new diesel and petrol cars coming in no later than 2040 roads and urban areas are about to get cleaner too however there are still tough challenges ahead if the uk is to meet its target of carbon neutrality by 2050 aviation heavy industry agriculture shipping power generation  some of the key activities of daily economic life  all remain reliant on fuels that emit carbon this is where greenhouse gas removal ggr technologies have a big role to play these can capture carbon dioxide co 2  and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and either store them or use them helping the drive towards carbon neutrality while the idea of being able to capture carbon has been around for some time the technology is fast catching up with the ambition there now exist a number of credible solutions that allow for capturing emissions the challenge however is putting in place the framework and policies needed to enable technologies to be implemented at scale time is short a recent report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis emphasised the need for government action now if we are to achieve the volume of carbon removal needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 the tech to take emissions out of the atmosphere the planet naturally absorbs co 2  forests absorb it as they grow mangroves trap it in flooded soils and oceans absorb it from the air so harnessing this power through planting growing and actively managing forests is one natural method of ggr that can be easily implemented by policy aerial view of mangrove forest and river on the siargao island philippines the idea of using technology to capture co 2 and prevent its release into the atmosphere has been around since the 1970s it was first deployed successfully in enhanced oil recovery  when captured emissions are injected into underground oil reserves to help remove the oil from the ground over time its been developed and is now in place in a number of fossil fuel power stations around the world allowing them to cut emissions  however by combining the same technology with renewable fuels like compressed biomass wood pellets we can generate electricity that is carbon negative  each of these solutions operate in different ways but all are important vivid economics report emphasises that a range of different solutions will be required to reach a point where 130 million tonnes of co 2 mtco 2  are being removed from the atmosphere in the uk annually by 2050 however investment and clear government planning and guidance will be crucial in enabling the growth of grr the report estimates largescale ggr could cost around 13 billion per year by 2050 in the uk alone a figure similar in size to current government support for renewables if you went back 20odd years people were sceptical of the role of wind solar and biomass and whether the technologies would ever get to a cost point where they could be viably deployed at scale explains drax policy analyst richard gow in the last few years weve seen enormous cost reductions in renewables and people are far more confident in investing in them  that has been driven by very good government policy ggr needs the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  but what shape should those policies take for them to be effective options for policies perhaps the most straightforward route to enabling ggr is to build on existing policies for example there are existing tree planting schemes such as the woodland carbon fund woodland carbon code and the country stewardship scheme all of which could receive greater regulatory support or additional rules obliging emitters to invest in actively managed forests  more technically complex solutions like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage daccs could be incentivised by alternative mechanisms in order to provide clarity on and to stabilise revenue streams these are already used to support companies building lowcarbon power generation such as through the contracts for difference scheme and have been effective in encouraging investment in projects with high upfront costs and longpayback periods alternative options to support the rollout of negative emissions technologies should also be considered for example the government could make it obligatory for companies that contribute to emissions to pay for ggr to avoid increased burden on electricity consumers in such a scenario fossil fuel suppliers would be required to offset the emissions of their products by buying negative emissions certificates from ggr providers as a result the price of fossil fuels for users would likely rise to cover this expense and the costs would then be shared across the supply chain rather than just a single party another approach that passes the costs of ggr deployment on to emitters is using emissions taxes to fund tax credits for ggr providers making these tax credits tradable would also mean any large taxpaying company such as a supermarket or bank could buy tax credits from ggr providers this approach would come at no cost to government as sales of the tax credits would be funded by an emissions tax and would offer revenue to ggr providers the challenge with tax credits however is they are vulnerable to changes in government an alternative is to offer direct grants and longterm contracts with ggr providers which would ensure funding for projects that transcends changes in parliament they could however prove costly for government whatever policy pathway the government may choose to follow there are underlying foundations needed to support effective ggr deployment making policies work there are still many unknown factors in ggr deployment such as the precise volume that will be needed to counter hardtoabate emissions this means all policy must be flexible to allow for future changes and the individual requirements of different regions forestbased solutions might suit some regions daccs might be better in others underlying the strength of any of these policies is the need for accurate carbon accounting understanding how much emissions are removed from the atmosphere by each technology will be key to reaching a true net zero status and giving credibility to certificates and tax credits pearl river nursery mississippi proper accounting of different technologies impact will also be crucial in delivering innovation grants these can come through the uks existing innovation structure and will be fundamental to jumpstarting the pilot programmes needed to test the viability of ggr approaches before commercialisation different approaches to ggr have different levels of effectiveness as well as different costs beccs for example serves two purposes in both generating lowcarbon power and capturing emissions  resulting in overall negative emissions across the supply chain its important to account for the full value chain of beccs explains gow therefore it should be rewarded through two mechanisms a cfd for the clean electricity produced and an incentive for the negative emissions a double policy here is important because you are providing two products which benefit different sectors of the economy one benefits power consumers and the other provides a service to society and the environment as a whole and cost should be apportioned as such beccs and daccs also have to consider wider supply chains such as carbon transport and storage infrastructure  although this requires a high initial investment by connecting to industrial emitters it can enable providers to recover the costs through charges to multiple network users ultimately the key to making any ggr policies work effectively and efficiently is speed in order to put in place accounting principles test different methods and begin courting investors government needs to act now the vivid economics report is further confirmation of the vital role that beccs will play in reaching a net zerocarbon economy and the need to deploy the uks

the phrase flygskam before but you might have felt it the recently coined swedish term refers to the a shame or embarrassment caused by flying and its effect of the environment its not an uncommon feeling either with 23 of people in the country now claiming to have abstained from air travel in the past year to lessen their climate impact from electric cars to cleaner shipping  transport is undergoing dramatic change however aviation is proving more difficult to decarbonise than most forms of transportation as airports cargo and the number of passengers flying every day continues to expand the need to decarbonise air travel is more pressing than ever if aviation is to avoid becoming a barrier to climate action for other transport sectors facing a similar dilemma electrification has proved a key route forward could the electrification of aeroplanes be next the problem with planes aeroplanes still rely on fossil fuels to provide the huge amount of power needed for takeoff globally flights produced 859 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  in 2017  the aviation industry as a whole accounts for 2 of all emissions derived from human activity and 12 of all transport emissions despite growing awareness of the contribution co 2 emissions make to causing the climate change emergency estimates show global air traffic could quadruple by 2050  electrification of air travel presents the potential to drastically cut plane emissions while also offering other benefits electric planes could be 50 quieter with reduced aircraft noise pollution potentially enabling airports to operate around the clock and closer to cities electric planes could also be as much as 10 cheaper for airlines to operate by eliminating the massive expense of jet fuel and fewer moving parts making electric motors easier to maintain compared to traditional jets these cost savings for airlines could be passed on to passengers and businesses needing to move goods in the form of cheaper flights but while the benefits are obvious the pressing question is how feasible is it the race to electric planes start ups are now racing to develop electric planes that will reduce emissions  such ampaire and wright electric the latter has even partnered with easyjet to develop electric planes for shorthaul routes of around 335mile distances which make up a fifth of the budget carriers routes easyjet going electric source easyjetcom  easyjet has highlighted london to amsterdam as a key route they hope wright electrics planes will operate with potential for other zeroemission flights between london and belfast dublin paris and brussels the partners aim to have an electric passenger jets on the tarmac by 2027  ahead on the runway however is israeli firm eviation which recently debuted a prototype for the worlds first commercial allelectric passenger aircraft  named alice the craft is expected to carry nine passengers for 650 miles and could be up and running as early as 2022 the challenge these companies face however is developing the batteries needed to power electric motors capable of delivering the propulsion needed for a plane full of passengers and luggage to take off currently batteries dont have anywhere near the energy density of traditional kerosene jet fuel  60 less  alices battery is colossal weighing 38 metric tons and accounting for 60 of the planes overall weight by contrast traditional planes allocate around 30 of total weight to fuel as conventional jets burn fuel they get lighter whereas electric planes would have to carry the same battery weight for the full duration of a flight closer to home on scotlands orkney islands electric planes could be perfectly suited to replace expensive jet fuel on the regions supershort island hopping service  theres little need for rangeanxiety with the longest flight from kirkwall to north ronaldsay lasting just 20 minutes and the shortest taking less than two minutes between the tiny islands of papa westray and neighbouring westray orkney is already known for its renewable credentials exporting more windgenerated power to the grid than it is able to consume the local council plans to investigate retrofitting its eightseater aircraft which carried more than 21000 passengers last year with electric motors as early as 2022 taking electric long haul the planes currently under development by ampaire wright electric and eviation are small aircraft only capable of short distance flights this is a long way behind the lengths capable of traditional fossil fuelpowered jets built by airline industry stalwarts airbus and boeing which are making their own move into electrification ampaire electric but only for short distances source ampairecom  even with drastic developments in battery technology however airbus estimates its longhaul a320 airliner which seats between 100 and 240 passengers would only be able to fly for a fifth of its range as an electric plane and only manage to carry half its regular cargo load elsewhere french jet enginemaker safran predicts that fullsize batterypowered commercial aircraft wont become a reality until 2050 at the earliest however if going fully electric may not yet be possible for large longhaul planes hybrid aircraft which use both conventional and electric power offer a potential middle ground a team comprising rollsroyce airbus and siemens are working on a project set to launch in 2021 called efan x which would combine an electric motor with a bae 146 aircrafts jet engine airbus say they may have to reduce their cargo to go electric source wwwairbuscom  hybrid models aim to use electric engines as the power source for the energyintensive takeoff and landing processes saving jet fuel and reducing noise around airports then while the plane is in the air it would switch to conventional kerosene engines which are most efficient when the plane reaches cruising altitude airbus aims to introduce a hybrid version of their bestselling singleaisle a320 passenger jet by 2035 while start ups and established jet makers jostle to get electric and hybrid planes off the ground there are other ideas around reducing aviation emissions technology of the future for decarbonising planes the university of illinois is working with nasa to develop hydrogen fuel cells capable of powering allelectric air travel hydrogen fuel cells work by combining hydrogen and oxygen to cause a chemical reaction that generates an electric current while the ingredients are very light the problem is they are bulky to store and on planes making effective use of space is key researchers are combatting this by experimenting with cryogenically freezing the gases into liquids which makes them more spaceefficient to store but makes refuelling trickier as airports would need the infrastructure to work with the freezing liquids there have also been experiments into solarpowered planes in 2016 a team of swiss adventurers succeeded in flying around the world in an aircraft that uses solar panels on its wings to power its propellers with a wingspan wider than a boeing 747 but weighing just a fraction of a traditional jet the solar impulse 2 is capable of staying airborne for as long as six days though only able to carry a lone pilot solar impulse 2 has great staying power while the feat is impressive the solar impulse team says the aim was to showcase the advancement of solar technology rather than develop solar planes for mainstream usage elsewhere mit engineers have been working on the first ever plane with no moving parts in its propulsion system instead the model uses ionic wind  a silent but hugely powerful flow of ions produced aboard the plane ionic wind is created when a current is passed between a thick and thin electrode with enough voltage applied the air between the electrodes produces thrust capable of propelling a small aircraft steadily during flight mit hope that ionic wind systems could be paired with conventional jets to make hybrid planes for a range of uses a general blueprint for an mit plane propelled by ionic wind source mit electric aircraft initiative newsmitedu  like any emerging technology it will take time to develop these alternative power sources to reach the point where they can safely and securely serve the global aviation industry however its clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is underway flying as we know it has been slow to adapt but with a growing awareness and levels of flygskam among consumers there is greater pressure on the industry to decarbonise and lay out positive solutions to cleaner air travel tags decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs  fossil fuels  sustainability  transport climate change is the biggest challenge of our time will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 28 july 2019 opinion climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and drax has a crucial role in tackling it all countries around the world need to reduce carbon emissions while at the same time growing their economies creating enough clean secure energy for industry transport and peoples daily lives has never been more important drax is at the heart of the uk energy system recently the uk government committed to delivering a netzero carbon emissions by 2050 and drax is equally committed to helping make that possible weve recently had some questions about what were doing and id like to set the record straight how is drax helping the uk reach its climate goals at drax were committed to a zerocarbon lowercost energy future and weve accelerated our efforts to help the uk get off coal by converting our power station to using sustainable biomass  and now were the largest decarbonisation project in europe were exploring how drax power station can become the anchor to enable revolutionary technologies to capture carbon in the north of england and were creating more energy stability  so that more wind and solar power can come onto the grid and finally were helping our customers take control of their energy  so they can use it more efficiently and spend less is drax the largest carbon polluter in the uk no since 2012 weve reduced our co2 emissions by 84 in that time we moved from being western europes largest polluter to being the home of the largest decarbonisation project in europe and we want to do more weve expanded our operations to include hydro power storage and natural gas and weve continued to bring coal off the system by the mid 2020s our ambition is to create a power station that both generates electricity and removes carbon from the atmosphere at the same time  does building gas power stations mean the uk will be tied into fossil fuels for decades to come our energy system is changing rapidly as we move to use more wind and solar power  at the same time we need new technologies that can operate when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining a new more efficient gas plant can fill that gap and help make it possible for the uk to come off coal before the governments deadline of 2025 importantly if we put new gas in place we need to make sure that theres a route through for making that zerocarbon over time by being able to capture the co 2 or by converting those power plants into hydrogen are forests destroyed when drax uses biomass and is biomass power a major source of carbon emissions no sustainable biomass from healthy managed forests is helping decarbonise the uks energy system as well as helping to promote healthy forest growth biomass has been a critical element in the uks decarbonisation journey helping us get off coal much faster than anyone thought possible the biomass that we use comes from sustainably managed forests that supply industries like construction we use residues like sawdust and waste wood that other parts of industry dont use we support healthy forests and biodiversity the biomass that we use is renewable because the forests are growing and continue to capture more carbon than we emit from the power station whats exciting is that this technology enables us to do more we are piloting carbon capture with bioenergy at the power station which could enable us to become the first carbonnegative power station in the world and also the anchor for new zerocarbon cluster across the humber and the north how do you justify working at drax i took this job because drax has already done a tremendous amount to help fight climate change in the uk but i also believe passionately that there is more that we can do i want to use all of our capabilities to continue fighting climate change i also want to make sure that we listen to what everyone else has to say to ensure that we continue to do the
