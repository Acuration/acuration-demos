decarbonisation under lockdown every day is a sunday iain staffell imperial college london 21 may 2020 opinion on march 23rd the uk took an unprecedented move to tackle the coronavirus most business that had not already closed moved online with millions of people now working from home this had a huge impact on electricity demand consumption on weekdays fell by 13 to its lowest levels since 1982  a time when there were 10 million fewer people in the country and gdp was a third lower than today other regions have seen a similar collapse in electricity demand spain italy and france have all seen electricity demand fall by 1015 according to analysis by ember  across the atlantic new york city has seen similar reductions demand has fallen for a simple reason with schools and workplaces now closed or running with a greatly reduced staff  machinery computers lights and heaters are not drawing power electric rail tram and tube systems are also running a reduced service on the contrary with more people at home household electricity consumption has increased octopus energy estimate that during social distancing before the stricter lockdown came into effect homes were consuming up to a third more electricity adding 20 per month to the typical bill the impact of lockdown on britains electricity demand is much like living through a month of sundays  the average profile for a march weekend day in previous years looks very similar to the daily profile for weekdays since lockdown begun  both in the amount of electricity consumed and the structure postlockdown weekends have even lower demand tracking 11 below weekday demand people no longer have to get up at the crack of dawn for work on a typical weekday morning demand would rise by 10 gw over two hours from 530 to 730 am now it takes more than twice as long  until midday  for this rise to occur at the other end of the day there would normally be a small peak in demand around 8 pm from people gathering in pubs and restaurants up and down the country both on weekdays and weekends demand begins falling earlier in the evening as the sofa has become the only available social venue with lower demand comes lower power prices wholesale electricity prices are typically 7 lower on sundays than on weekdays for this reason march saw the lowest monthlyaverage power price in 12 years down onethird on this month last year prices were already heading downwards because of the falling price of gas but the lockdown has amplified this and negative prices have become commonplace during the middle of the day there was not a visible impact on carbon emissions during the first quarter of the year as only the last week of march was affected however as lockdown continued into april and may emissions from power production in britain have fallen by 35 on the same period last year the effect is slightly stronger across europe with carbon emissions falling almost 40 as dirtier coal and lignite power stations are being turned down will some of these effects persist after lockdown restrictions are eased it is too early to tell as it depends on what longlasting economic and behavioural changes occur electricity demand is linked with the countrys gdp which is set to face the largest downturn in three centuries  whether the economy bounces back or is afflicted with a lasting depression will be key to future electricity demand it will also depend on behavioural shifts people are of course craving their lost freedoms many may appreciate not going back to a lengthy daily commute  and the rise of video conferencing and collaboration apps has shown that remote working may finally have come of age with even a small share of the population continuing to work from home on some days there could be a lasting impact on electricity demand for years to come read full report pdf  read full report  read press release tags covid19  electricity system balancing and ancillary services  decarbonisation  electric insights how do you store co 2 and what happens to it when you do 22 april 2020 carbon capture the north sea has long shaped british trade its also been instrumental in how the country is powered historically providing an abundant source of oil and natural gas however this cold fringe off the north atlantic could also play a vital role in decarbonising the uks economy  not because of its full oil and gas reservoirs but thanks to its empty ones in an effort to limit or reduce the amount of carbon dioxide co 2  in the atmosphere countries around the world are rushing towards large scale carbon capture usage and storage projects ccus in this process co 2 is captured from sources such as energy production and manufacturing or directly removed from the air and reused or stored permanently  for example underground in disused oil and gas reservoirs or other suitable geological formations source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload the international energy agency estimates that 100 billion tonnes of co 2 must be stored by 2060 to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius yet the global ccs institute reports that as of 2019 the projects currently in operation or under construction had the capacity to capture and store only 40 million tonnes of co 2 per year its clear the global capacity for ccus must accelerate rapidly in the coming decade but it raises the questions where can these millions of tonnes of co 2 be stored and what happens to it once it is where can you store co 2  the most welldeveloped approach to storing co 2 is injecting it underground into naturally occurring porous rock formations such as former natural gas or oil reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers these are deep geological formations with deposits of very salty water present in the rocks pores and most commonly found under the ocean the north sea and the area off the us gulf coast contain several saline aquifers once co 2 has been captured using ccus technology  its pressurised and turned into a liquidlike form known as supercritical co 2  from there its transported via pipeline and injected into the rocks found in the formations deep below the earths surface this is a process called geological sequestration source ccs image library  global ccs institute click to viewdownload but while pumping co 2 into the ground is one thing ensuring it stays there and isnt released into the atmosphere is another fortunately there are several ways to ensure co 2 is stored safely and securely keeping the lid on co 2 stored underground put simply the most straightforward way underground reservoirs store co 2 is through the solid impermeable rock that typically surrounds them once co 2 is injected into a reservoir it slowly moves upwards through the reservoir until it meets this layer of impermeable rock which acts like a lid the co 2 cannot pass through this is whats referred to as structural storage and is the same mechanism that has kept oil and gas locked underground for millions of years white chalk stone over time the co 2 trapped in reservoirs will often begin to chemically react with the minerals of the surrounding rock the elements bind to create solid chalky minerals essentially locking the co 2 into the rock in a process called mineral storage in the case of saline aquifers as well as structural and mineral storage the co 2 can dissolve into the salty water in a process called dissolution storage here the dissolved co 2 slowly descends to the bottom of the aquifer in any given reservoir each or all of these processes work to store co 2 indefinitely and while there remains some possibility of co 2 leakage from a site research suggests it will be minimal one study published in the journal nature suggests more than 98 of injected co 2 will remain stored for over 10000 years storage for the net zero future in the united states industrial scale storage is in action in texas wyoming oklahoma and illinois and there are projects in progress across the united arab emirates australia algeria and canada however there is still a long way to go for ccus to reach the scale it needed to limit the effects of climate change research has shown that globally there is an abundance of co 2 storage sites which could support widespread ccus adoption a report compiled by researchers at imperial college london and e4tech and published by drax details an estimated 70 billion tonnes of storage capacity in the uk alone the us on the other hand has an estimated storage capacity of 10 trillion tonnes its clear the capacity for storage is present it now remains the task of governments and companies to ramp up ccus projects to begin to reach the scale necessary in the uk drax power station is piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage projects beccs which could see it becoming the worlds first negative emissions power station as part of the zero carbon humber partnership it could also form a part of the worlds first zero carbon industrial hub in the north of the uk such projects are indicative of the big ambitions ccus technology could realise  not just decarbonising single sites but capturing and storing co 2 from entire industries and regions there is still a way to go to meet that ambition but it is clear the resources and knowledge necessary to get there are ready to be utilised source zero carbon humber click to viewdownload learn more about carbon capture usage and storage in our series planting sinking extracting  some of the ways to absorb carbon from

decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  negative emissions the uk needs negative emissions from beccs to reach net zero  heres why 7 april 2020 carbon capture reaching the uks target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 means every aspect of the economy from shops to super computers must reduce its carbon footprint  all the way down their supply chains  as close to zero as possible but as the country transforms one thing is certain demand for electricity will remain in fact with increased electrification of heating and transport there will be a greater demand for power from renewable carbon dioxide co 2 free sources bioenergy is one way of providing this power without reliance on the weather and can offer essential gridstability services as provided by drax power station in north yorkshire close up of electricity pylon tower beyond just power generation more and more reports highlight the important role the next evolution of bioenergy has to play in a net zero uk and that is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or beccs a carbon negative source of power abating emissions from other industries the committee on climate change ccc says negative emissions are essential for the uk to offset difficulttodecarbonise sectors of the economy and meet its net zero target this may include direct air capture dac and other negative emissions technologies  as well as beccs beccs power generation uses biomass grown in sustainably managed forests as fuel to generate electricity as these forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere while growing they offset the amount of co 2 released by the fuel when used making the whole power production process carbon neutral adding carbon capture and storage to this process results in removing more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted making it carbon negative  pine trees grown for planting in the forests of the us south where more carbon is stored and more wood inventory is grown each year than fibre is extracted for wood products such as biomass pellets this means beccs can be used to abate or offset emissions from other parts of the economy that might remain even as it decarbonises a report by the energy systems catapult modelling different approaches for the uk to reach net zero by or before 2050  suggests carbonintensive industries such as aviation and agriculture will always produce residual emissions the need to counteract the remaining emissions of industries such as these make negative emissions an essential part of reaching net zero while the report suggests that direct air carbon capture and storage daccs will also play an important role in bringing co 2 levels down it will take time for the technology to be developed and deployed at the scale needed meanwhile carbon capture use and storage ccus technology is already deployed at scale in norway the us australia and canada these processes for capturing and storing carbon are applicable to biomass power generation such as at drax power station which means beccs is ready to deploy at scale from a technology perspective today as well as counteracting remaining emissions however beccs can also help to decarbonise other industries by enabling the growth of a different low carbon fuel hydrogen enabling a hydrogen economy the cccs  hydrogen in a lowcarbon economy report  highlights the needs for carbon zero alternatives to fossil fuels  in particular hydrogen or h 2  hydrogen produced in a test tube when combusted hydrogen only produces heat and water vapour while the ability to store it for long periods makes it a cleaner replacement to the natural gas used in heating today hydrogen can also be stored as a liquid which coupled with its high energy density makes it a carbon zero alternative to petrol and diesel in heavy transport there are various ways beccs can assist the creation of a hydrogen economy most promising is the use of biomass to produce hydrogen through a method known as gasification in this process solid organic material is heated to more than 700c but prevented from combusting this causes the material to break down into gases hydrogen and carbon monoxide co the co then reacts with water to form co 2 and more h 2  while co 2 is also produced as part of the process biomass material absorbs co 2 while it grows making the overall process carbon neutral however by deploying carbon capture here the hydrogen production can also be made carbon negative beccs can more indirectly become an enabler of hydrogen production the zero carbon humber partnership envisages drax power station as the anchor project for ccus infrastructure in the region allowing for the production of blue hydrogen blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas a fossil fuel however the resulting carbon emissions could be captured the co2 would then be transported and stored using the same system of pipelines and a natural aquifer under the north sea as used by beccs facilities at drax this way of clustering beccs power and hydrogen production would also allow other industries such as manufactures steel mills and refineries to decarbonise lowering the cost of flexible electricity one of the challenges in transforming the energy system and wider economy to net zero is accounting for the cost of the transition the energy systems catapults analysis found that it could be kept as low as 12 of gdp while a report by the national infrastructure commission nic projects that deploying beccs would have little impact on the total cost of the power system if deployed for its negative emissions potential the nics modelling found when taking into consideration the costs and generation capacity of different sources beccs would likely be run as a baseload source of power in a net zero future this would maximise its negative emissions potential this means beccs units would run frequently and for long periods uninterrupted by changes in the weather rather than jumping into action to account for peaks in demand this coupled with its ability to abate emissions means beccs  alongside intermittent renewables such as wind and solar  could provide the uk with zero carbon electricity at a significantly lower cost than that of constructing a new fleet of nuclear power stations the report also goes on to say that a fleet of hydrogenfuelled power stations could also be used to generate flexible backup electricity which therefore could be substantially cheaper than relying on a fleet of new baseload nuclear plants however for this to work effectively decisions need to be made sooner rather than later as to what approach the uk takes to shape the energy system before 2050 the time to act is now what is consistent across many different reports is that beccs will be essential for any version of the future where the uk reaches net zero by 2050 but it will not happen organically sunset and evening clouds over the river humber near sunk island east riding of yorkshire a joint royal society and royal academy of engineering greenhouse gas removal report  includes research into beccs daccs and other forms of negative emissions in its list of key actions for the uk to reach net zero it also calls for the uk to capitalise on its access to natural aquifers and former oil and gas wells for co 2 storage in locations such as the north sea as well as its engineering expertise to establish the infrastructure needed for co 2 transport and storage however this will require policies and funding structures that make it economical a report by vivid economics for the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis highlights that  just as incentives have made wind and solar viable and integral parts of the uks energy mix  beccs and other technologies need the same clear longterm strategy to enable companies to make secure investments and innovate  however for policies to make the impact needed to ramp beccs up to the levels necessary to bring the uk to net zero action is needed now  the report outlines policies that could be implemented immediately such as contracts for difference or negative emissions obligations for residual emitters for beccs deployment to expand significantly in the 2030s a suitable policy framework will need to be put in place in the 2020s beyond just decarbonising the uk a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlights that beccs could be of even more importance globally differing scales of beccs deployment are illustrated in its scenarios where global warming is kept to within 15 o c levels of preindustrial levels as per the paris climate agreement beccs has the potential to play a vital role in power generation creating a hydrogen economy and

negative emissions from steel to soil  how industries are capturing carbon 11 march 2020 carbon capture carbon capture use and storage ccus is a vital technology in the energy industry with facilities already in place all over the world aiming to eliminate carbon dioxide co 2  emissions however for decarbonisation to go far enough to keep global warming below 2 o c  as per the paris climate agreement  emission reductions are needed throughout the global economy from cement factories to farmland ccus technology is beginning to be deployed in a wide variety of sectors around the world construction the global population is increasingly urban and by 2050 its estimated 68 of all people will live in cities  for cities to grow sustainably its crucial the environmental impact of the construction industry is reduced construction currently accounts for 11 of all global carbon emissions  this includes emissions from the actual construction work such as from vehicle exhaust pipes but a more difficult challenge is reducing embedded emissions from the production of construction materials steel and concrete are emissionsheavy to make they require intense heat and use processes that produce further emissions deploying widespread ccus in the production of these two materials holds the key to drastically reducing carbon emissions from the built environment steel manufacturing alone regardless of the electricity used to power production is responsible for about 7 of global emissions  projects aimed at reducing the levels of carbon released in production are planned in europe and are already in motion in the united arab emirates abu dhabi national oil company and masdar a renewable energy and sustainability company formed a joint venture in 2013 with the aim of developing commercialscale ccus projects in its project with emirates steel which began in 2016 about 800000 tonnes of co 2 is captured a year from the steel manufacturing plant this is sequestered and used in enhanced oil recovery eor the commercially selfsustaining nature of this project has led to investigation into multiple future industrialscale projects in the region cement manufacturing a process that produces as much as 8 of global greenhouse gases  is also experiencing the growth of innovative ccus projects norcem cement plant in brevik norway has already begun experimenting with ccus calculating that it could capture 400000 tonnes of co 2 per year and store it under the north sea if the project wins government approval norcem could commence operations as soon as 2023 however as well as reducing emissions from traditional cement manufacturing and the electricity sources that power it a team at massachusetts institute of technology is exploring a new method of cement production that is more ccus friendly  by pretreating the limestone used in cement creation with an electrochemical process the co 2 produced is released in a pure concentrated stream that can be more easily captured and sequestered underground or harnessed for products such as fizzy drinks agriculture its hard to overstate the importance of the agriculture industry as well as feeding the world it employs a third of it  within this sector fertiliser plays an essential role in maintaining the global food supply however the fertiliser production industry represents approximately 2 of global co 2 emissions ccus technology can reduce the co 2 contributions made by the manufacturing of fertiliser while maintaining crop reliability in 2019 oil and gas climate initiatives ogci climate investments announced funding for what is expected to be the biggest ccus project in the us based at the wabash valley resources fertiliser plant in indiana  the project will capture between 13 and 16 million tonnes of co 2 from the ammonia producer per year the captured carbon will then be stored 2000 metres below ground in a saline aquifer similarly since the turn of the millennium mitsubishi heavy industries engineering has deployed ccus technology at fertiliser plants around asia  co 2 is captured from natural gas precombustion and used to create the urea fertiliser however the agriculture industry can also capture carbon in more naturebased and cheaper ways soil acts as a carbon sink capturing and locking in the carbon from plants and grasses that die and decay into it however intensive ploughing can damage the soils ability to retain co 2  it only takes slight adjustments in farming techniques like minimising soil disturbance or crop and grazing rotations to enable soil and grasslands to sequester greater levels of co 2 and even make farms carbon negative  transport the transport sector is the fastest growing contributor to climate emissions according to the world health organisation electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are expected to serve as the driving force for much of the sectors decarbonisation however at present these technologies are only really making an impact on roads there are other essential modes of transport where ccus has a role to play climeworks a swiss company developing units that capture co 2 directly from the air has begun working with rotterdam the hague airport to develop a direct air capture dac unit on the airports grounds climeworks plant technology source climeworks photo by julia dunlop hydrogen filling station in hamburg germany however beyond just capturing co 2 from planes taking off climeworks aims to use the co 2 to produce a synthetic jet fuel  creating a cycle of carbon reusage that ensures none is emitted into the atmosphere a pilot project aims to create 1000 litres of the fuel per day in 2021 another approach to zerocarbon transport fuel is the utilisation of hydrogen which is already powering cars trains buses and even spacecraft  hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways but its predominantly created from natural gas through a process in which co 2 is a byproduct ccus can play an important role here in capturing the co 2 and storing it  preventing it entering the atmosphere the hydrogenpowered vehicles then only emit water vapour and heat from every industry to every business to everyone as ccus technology continues to be deployed at scale and made increasingly affordable it has the potential to go beyond just large industrial sites to entire economic regions global thermostat is developing dac technology which can be fitted to any factory or plant that produces heat in its processes the system uses the waste heat to power a dac unit either from a particular source or from the surrounding atmosphere such technologies along with those already in action like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  can quickly make negative emissions a reality at scale  however to capture transport and permanently store co 2 at the scale needed to reach net zero collaboration partnerships and shared infrastructure between businesses in industrial regions is essential the uks humber region is an example of an industrial cluster where a large number of highcarbon industrial sites sit in close proximity to one another by installing beccs and ccus infrastructure that can be utilised by multiple industries the uk can have a far greater impact on emissions levels than through individual smallscale ccus projects decarbonising the uk and the world will not be achieved by individual sites and industries but by collective action that transcends sectors regions and supply chains implementing ccus at as large a scale as possible takes a greater stride towards bringing the

as crucial in mitigating the climate crisis and getting the uk and the rest of the world to net zero  after a number of false starts and policy hurdles the technology is now growing with more momentum than ever carbon capture use and storage ccus is finally coming of age increasing innovation and investment in the space is enabling the development of ccus schemes at scale today there are over 19 largescale ccus facilities in operation worldwide while a further 32 in development as confidence in government policies and investment frameworks improves once co 2 is captured it can be stored underground in empty oil and gas reservoirs and naturally occurring saline aquifers in a process known as sequestration it has also long been used in enhanced oil recovery eor a process where captured co 2 is injected into oil reservoirs to increase oil production  drax power station is already trialling europes first bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs project this combination of sustainable biomass with carbon capture technology could remove and capture more than 16 million tonnes of co 2 a year and put drax power station at the centre of wider decarbonisation efforts across

ever offshore carbon capture and storage ccs plant and has been active since 1996 the facility separates co 2 from natural gas extracted from the sleipner field as well as from at the utgard field about 20km away this method of carbon capture means co 2 is removed before the natural gas is combusted allowing it to be used as an energy source with lower carbon emissions snøhvit  located offshore in norways northern barents sea operates similarly but here natural gas is pumped to an onshore facility for carbon removal the separated and compressed co 2 from both facilities is then stored or sequestered in empty reservoirs under the sea the two projects demonstrate the safety and reality of longterm co 2 sequestration  as of 2019 sleipner has captured and stored over 23 million tonnes of

a sharp turn downwards instead theyre in a race to the bottom to earn the title of the first net zero carbon city in the uk while they might be battling to be the first in the uk to reach net zero they are far from the only cities with net zero in their sights in the wake of the growing climate emergency cities companies and countries around the world have all announced their own ambitions for hitting net zero it has become a global focus based on necessity  for the world to hit the paris agreement targets and limit global temperature rise to under two degrees celsius its predicted the world must become net zero by 2070  yet despite its ubiquity net zero is a term thats not always fully understood so what does net zero actually mean glasgow scotland host of cop26 what does net zero mean going net zero most often refers specifically to reaching net zero carbon emissions but this doesnt just mean cutting all emissions down to zero instead net zero describes a state where the greenhouse gas ghg emitted    and removed by a company geographic area or facility is in balance in practice this means that as well as making efforts to reduce its emissions an entity must capture absorb or offset an equal amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the amount it releases the result is that the carbon it emits is the same as the amount it removes so it does not increase carbon levels in the atmosphere its carbon contributions are effectively zero  or more specifically net zero the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment likens the net zero target to running a bath  an ideal level of water can be achieved by either turning down the taps the mechanism adding emissions or draining some of the water from the bathtub the thing removing of emissions from the atmosphere if these two things are equally matched the water level in the bath doesnt change to reach net zero and drive a sustained effort to combat climate change a similar overall balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere must be achieved but while the analogy of a bath might make it sound simple actually reaching net zero at the scale necessary will take significant work across industries countries and governments how to achieve net zero the uks committee on climate change ccc recommends that to reach net zero all industries must be widely decarbonised heavy good vehicles must switch to lowcarbon fuel sources and a fifth of agricultural land must change to alternative uses that bolster emission reductions such as biomass production however given the nature of many of these industries and others considered hardtotreat such as aviation and manufacturing completely eliminating emissions is often difficult or even impossible instead residual emissions must be counterbalanced by natural or engineered solutions  natural solutions can include afforestation planting new forests and reforestation replanting trees in areas that were previous forestland which use trees natural ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere to offset emissions on the other hand engineering solutions such as carbon capture usage and storage ccus can capture and permanently store carbon from industry before its released into the atmosphere it is estimated this technology can capture in excess of 90 of the carbon released by fossil fuels during power generation or industrial processes such as cement production click to viewdownload graphic source zero carbon humber  bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs could actually take this a step further and lead to a net removal of carbon emissions from the atmosphere often referred to as negative emissions beccs combines the use of biomass as a fuel source with ccus when that biomass comes from trees grown in responsibly managed working forests that absorb carbon it becomes a low carbon fuel when this process is combined with ccus and the carbon emissions are captured at point of the biomass use the overall process removes more carbon than is released creating negative emissions according to the global ccs institute  beccs is quickly emerging as the best solution to decarbonise emissionheavy industries a joint report by the royal academy of engineering and royal society estimates that beccs could help the uk to capture 50 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2050  eliminating almost half of the emissions projected to remain in the economy the uks move to net zero in june 2019 the uk became the first major global economy to pass a law to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 it is one of a small group of countries including france and sweden that have enacted this ambition into law forcing the government to take action towards meeting net zero electrical radiator although this is an ambitious target the uk is making steady progress towards it in 2018 the uks emissions were 44 below 1990 levels while some of the most intensive industries are fast decarbonising  june 2019 saw the carbon content of electricity hit an alltime low falling below 100 gkwh for the first time  this is especially important as the shift to net zero will create a much greater demand for electricity as fossil fuel use in transport and home heating must be switched with power from the grid hitting net zero will take more than just this consistent reduction in emissions however an increase in capture and removal technologies will also be required on the whole the ccc predict an estimated 75 to 175 million tonnes of carbon and equivalent emissions will need to be removed by ccus solutions annually in 2050 to fully meet the uks net zero target this will need substantial financial backing the ccc forecasts that at present a net zero target can be reached at an annual resource cost of up to 12 of gdp between now and 2050 however there is still much debate about the role the global carbon markets need to play to facilitate a more costeffective and efficient way for countries to work together through market mechanisms industries across the uk are starting to take affirmative action to work towards the net zero target in the energy sector projects such as drax power stations carbon capture pilots are turning beccs increasingly into a reality ready to be deployed at scale along with these individual projects reaching net zero also requires greater cooperation across the industrial sectors the zero carbon humber partnership between energy companies industrial emitters and local organisations for example aims to deliver the uks first zero carbon industrial cluster in the humber region by the mid2020s nonetheless efforts from all sectors must be made to ensure that the uk stays on course to meet all its immediate and longterm emissions targets and regardless of whether or not edinburgh or glasgow realise their net zero goals first the competition demonstrates how important the idea of net zero has become and societys drive for real change across the uk drax has announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030  removing more carbon from the atmosphere than produced in our operations creating a negative carbon footprint track our progress at towards carbon negative   in this article weve simplified our explanation of net zero carbon dioxide co 2  is the most abundant greenhouse gas ghg it is

accessible and safe to use for just about everyone every day widescale blackouts are very rare but they do happen on 9 august 2019 a power cut saw more than 1 million people and services lose power for just under an hour it was the first largescale blackout since 2013 although this proves the network is not infallible the fact it was such an outlier in the normal performance of the grid highlights its otherwise exemplary stability and reliability but what is it exactly that makes an electricity system stable and reliable at its core system stability comes down to two key factors a country or regions ability to generate enough electricity and its ability to then transport it through a transmission system to where its needed when everything is running smoothly an electricity system is described as being balanced  in this state supply meets demand exactly and all necessary conditions  such as voltage and frequency  are right for the safe and efficient transport of electricity any slight deviation or mismatch across any of these factors can cause power stations or infrastructure to trip and cut off power a recent report by electric insights identified the countries around the world with most reliable power systems in which the uk was fourth it offers an insight into what factors contribute to building a stable system as well as those that hold some countries back generation and reliable infrastructure according to the report france has the most reliable electricity system of any country with a population of more than five million people having gone a decade without a power outage one reason for this is the countrys fleet of 58 statecontrolled nuclear power stations which generate huge amounts of consistent baseload power in 2017 nuclear power made up more than 70 of frances electricity generation while hydropower accounted for another 10 of the 475 terawatt hours twh consumed across the county that year penly nuclear power station near dieppe france now as its nuclear stations age france is increasing its renewable power generation as these sources are often weather dependent imports from and exports to its neighbours are expected to become a more important part of keeping the french network stable at times when there is little sunlight or wind  or too much importing and exporting electricity is also key to switzerlands power system third most reliable network on the list with 41 bordercrossing power lines allowing the country to serve as a crossroads for power flowing between italy and germany it means its total imports and exports can often exceed electricity production within the country electricity pylons in switzerland switzerlands mountainous landscape also means ensuring a reliable electricity system requires a carefully maintained transmissions system the swiss grid is 6700 kilometres long and uses 40000 hitech metering points along it to record and process around 10000 data points in seconds  the key to the stability of south korea  the second most stable network on the list  is also its imports but rather than actual megawatts it comes in the form of oil gas and coal the country is the worlds fourth biggest coal importer and its coal power stations account for 42 of its total generation seoul south korea however in the face of urban smog issues and global decarbonisation goals it is pursuing a switch to renewables this can come with repercussions to stability so south korea is also investing in transmission infrastructure including a new interconnector from the east of the country to seoul its main source of electricity consumption it highlights that if decarbonisation is going to accelerate at the pace needed to meet paris agreement targets then many of the worlds most stable and reliable electricity systems need to go through significant change balance will be needed between meeting decarbonisation targets with overall system stability however there are many countries around the world that focus less on ensuring consistent stability through decarbonisation and are instead more focused on how to achieve stability in the first place stalling generation the democratic republic of congo is the eleventhlargest country on earth it is rich with minerals and resources yet it is the least electrified nation just 9 of people have access to power in rural areas that number drops to just 1 and the country suffers blackouts more than once a month as a result of load shedding when there isnt enough power to meet demand so parts of the grid are deliberately shut down to prevent the entire system failing currently the country has just 27 gw of installed electricity capacity 25 gw of which comes from hydropower  the countrys inga dam facility on the congo river has the potential to generate more electricity than any other single source of power on the planet its thought the proposed grand inga site could produce as much as 40 gw  twice that of chinas three gorges dam and provide electricity to a massive part of southern africa a legacy of political instability in the country however has so far made securing financing difficult congo river democratic republic of congo nigeria is one of the worlds fastest growing economies and with that comes rapidly rising demand for electricity however just 45 of the country is currently electrified and of these areas many still suffer outages at least once a month the country has 125 gw of installed capacity most of which comes from thermal gas stations but technical problems in power stations and infrastructure mean it is often only capable of generating as much as 5 gw to transmit on to end consumers this limited production capability means it often fails to meet demand resulting in outages the problem has been prolonged by struggling utility companies that are unable to make the investments needed to stabilise electricity supply keen to resolve what it has referenced as an energy supply crisis the nigerian government recently secured a 1 billion credit line from the world bank to improve access to electricity across the country the investment will focus in part on securing the transmission system from theft thus allowing the private utility companies to generate the revenue needed to improve generation transmission holding back emerging systems balancing transmissions systems is a crucial part of stable electricity networks maintaining a steady frequency that delivers safe usable electricity into homes and businesses is at the crux of reliability even countries that can generate enough electricity are held back if they cant efficiently get the electricity to where it is needed brazil has an abundance of hydropower installed its 97 gw of hydro accounts for more than 70 of the countrys electricity mix  however the countrys dams are largely concentrated around the amazon basin in the north west whereas demand comes from cities in the south and eastern coastline transporting electricity across long distances between generator and consumer makes it difficult to maintain the correct voltage and frequency needed to keep a stable and reliable flow of electricity as a result brazil suffers a blackout every onetothree months hydropower plant henry borden in the serra do mar brazil the country is tackling its transmissions problems by diversifying its electricity mix to include greater levels of solar and wind off its east coast  closer to many of its major cities the country has also looked to new technology for solutions at the start of the decade as much as 8 of all electricity being generated in brazil was being stolen  reaching as high as 40 in some areas these illegal hookups both damage infrastructure making it less reliable as well as blur the true demand making grid management challenging brazil has since deployed smart meters to measure electricitys journey from power stations to end users more accurately allowing operators to spot anomalies sooner electricity theft is a major problem in many developing regions with as much as 10 billion worth of power lost each year in india which suffers blackouts as often as brazil it highlights that even when there is generation to meet demand maintaining stability at a large scale requires constant attention and innovation as new challenges arise this looks different around the world some countries might face challenges in shifting from stable thermalbased systems to renewables others are attempting to build stability into newly connected networks but no matter where in the world electricity is being used ensuring reliability is an everongoing task electric insights is commissioned by drax and delivered by a team of independent

to household recycling and access to green spaces cities and governments around the world are facing increasing pressure to find solutions to a growing number of urban problems one of these which doesnt come up often is sewage but every day 11 billion litres of wastewater from drains homes businesses and farms is collected across the uk and treated to be made safe to reenter the water system although for the most part sewage treatment occurs beyond the view of the general population it is something that needs constant work if not dealt with properly it can have a significant effect on the surrounding environment of the many ways that sewage is dealt with perhaps one of the most innovative is to use it for energy daldowie fuel plant near glasgow is one such place which processes sewage sludge taken from the surrounding area into a renewable low carbon form of biomass fuel the solution in the sludge in operation since 2002 daldowie was acquired by drax at the end of 2018 and today processes 35 of all of scotlands wastewater sludge into dry lowodour fuel pellets we receive as much as 25 million tonnes of sludge from scottish water a year says plant manager dylan hughes who leads a team of 71 employees and produce up to 50000 tonnes of pellets making it one of the largest plants of this kind in the world we have to provide a 247 365day service that is built into the infrastructure of glasgow he explains this sludge processed at daldowie is not raw wastewater which is treated in scottish waters sewage facilities instead the sludge is a semisolid byproduct of the treatment process made of the organic material and bacteria that ends up in wastewater from homes and industry from drains sinks and yes toilets until the late 1990s one of great britains main methods of disposing of sludge was by dumping it in the ocean  after this practice was banned cities where left to figure out ways of dealing with the sludge using sludge as a form of fertiliser or burying it in landfills was an already established practice however scottishpower instead decided to investigate the potential of turning sludge into a dry fuel pellet that could offer a renewable low carbon substitute to coal at its power plants cement manufacturing fuel kilns daldowie was originally designed to supply fuel to methil power station near fife which ran on coal slurry however it was decommissioned in 2000 before daldowie could begin delivering fuel to it this led the plant to instead provide fuel to longannet power station where it was used to reduce its dependency on coal before it too was decommissioned in 2016 today daldowies pellets are used in england and scotland to fuel kilns in cement manufacturing  an industry attempting to navigate the same decarbonisation challenges as power generation which daldowie was established to tackle though the end use of the fuel has changed the process through which the facility transforms the waste remains the same the process of turning waste to energy the process starts after wastewater from glasgow and the surrounding area is treated by scottish water daldowie receives 90 of the sludge it processes directly via a pressurised sludge pipeline the rest is delivered via sealed tanker lorries when it arrives at daldowie the sludge is 98 water and 2 solid organic waste it is first screened for debris before entering the plants 12 centrifuges which act as massive spinning driers these separate water from what is known as sludge cake the semisolid part of the sludge feedstock this separated water is then cleaned so it can either be used elsewhere in the process or released into the nearby river clyde membrane tank at daldowie fuel plant the remaining sludge cake is dried using air heated to 450 degrees celsius using natural gas this also reduces germs through pasteurisation while the rotating drums give the fuel granules their pellet shape once dried the pellets are cooled and inspected for quality any material not up to necessary standards is fed back into the system for reprocessing fuel that does meet the right standards is cooled further and then stored in silos where possible throughout the process hot air and water are reused helping keep costs down and ensuring the process is efficient nearly two decades into its life very little has had to change in the way the plant operates thanks to these efficiencies but while the process of turning the waste sludge into energy remains largely unchanged there is as always room for new innovation  improving for the future of the site daldowie is contracted to recycle wastewater for scottish water until 2026 to ensure the plant is still as efficient and effective as possible the daldowie team is undertaking a technical investigation of what if anything would be needed to extend the life of the plant for at least an additional five years the plant operates under the highest environmental and health and safety standards but further improvements are being planned in 2020 hughes explains we are upgrading the odour control equipment to ensure we have a best in class level of performance the control room and plant operators at daldowie draxs scotland office in glasgow is working with other industrial facilities in the area as well as the scottish environmental protection agency sepa to work with the local community we are putting in place a series of engagement events including plant tours from early 2020 offering local residents an opportunity to meet the local team and discuss the planned improvements there are also other potential uses for the fuel including use at drax power station as the pellets are categorised as waste and biomass it would require a new license for the power station however at a time when there is a greater need to reduce the impact of human waste and diversify the countrys energy it would add another source of renewable fuel to great britains electricity mix that could help to enable
