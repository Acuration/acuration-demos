abergelli power limited apl an energy development company established by watt power limited will be consulting on the 200m proposal between 13 october 2014 and 16 november 2014 the proposed project would produce up to 299 megawatts mw of electricity and represent a significant multi million pound investment into the local economy it could support up to 150 jobs during the 23 year construction and commissioning period and up to 15 fulltime jobs when operational the modern gasfired plant would have low emissions and would help strengthen and secure the uks energy supply by providing back up to intermittent energy that is generated from renewable sources  primarily wind and solar it would be designed to operate flexibly ie not always running and permitted to produce electricity for no more than 1500 hours per year as the plant will produce more than 50mw of electricity it is classified as a nationally significant infrastructure project this means that a development consent order is required to build operate and maintain it an application for a development consent order will be submitted to the planning inspectorate with a final decision taken by the secretary of state for energy and climate change the proposal was first presented to the local community during nonstatutory public exhibitions in june this year and statutory consultation will show how the project has developed since then apl has taken into account initial community feedback alongside ongoing engagement with city  county of swansea ccs and authorities such as natural resources wales and the companys own technical and environmental studies the consultation period will now give members of the local community the opportunity to learn more about comment on and potentially influence the proposals before an application for a development consent order is submitted apl has produced a statement of community consultation detailing the consultation programme it includes a number of exhibition events which will be an opportunity for local people and interested organisations to see the plans and give their views on the proposals ccs has been consulted on the consultation programme the exhibitions will be held on  wednesday 22nd october 2014 15002000  llangyfelach church hall swansea road llangyfelach swansea sa5 7ja  thursday 23rd october 2014 14001900  felindre welfare hall felindre swansea sa5 7na

apl project team will be on hand at these events to explain the proposed project how to get involved in the consultation process and to answer any questions the community may have preliminary assessments of the likely significant environmental effects of the project will also be available for viewing apls project director norman campbell said consultation with local communities and organisations is vitally important to us it provides us with an opportunity to explain our project in detail and get feedback to help with the development of our proposals our initial phase of consultation in june gave us the chance to communicate directly with local people gather their views and address their concerns we will now explain how the project has moved forward in recent months and provide more detailed information one of the key changes we have made is to reduce the height of the stacks of the plant following community feedback and our technical and environmental work we can confirm that they will be no taller than 40 metres this decision is just one of the steps we have taken to minimise the environmental and visual impact of the project we are also looking for peoples views on the environmental work we have carried out to date the proposed route options for accessing the project and our proposed layout of the plant within the project site we hope that as many people as possible will attend our public exhibition days or see the information we have made available on the project website and deposited at local libraries we will advertise the formal consultation in local media and are also distributing more than 13000 leaflets to homes and businesses in the area in the vicinity of the site at the end of the consultation period apl will finalise its proposals before submitting an application for a development consent order subject to the consultation and planning process and financing the power plant could enter commercial operation in

uncategorized drax welcomes the publication of the decc report life cycle impacts of biomass electricity in 2020 and the contribution it can make to the debate surrounding carbon savings through the use of sustainable biomass in the production of electricity the study considers a broad range of scenarios from the believable to the implausible as we would expect the scenarios that more closely reflect real world practices in sustainable forestry and responsible biomass sourcing confirm that using biomass in place of coal can deliver significant carbon savings in the short medium and long term the focus of the study north america was identified several years ago by drax as one of our source areas due to the abundance of biomass which met with our own robust sustainability criteria the biomass that drax sources from this geographic area includes woody residues and thinnings from sustainably managed forests where the carbon stock is either stable or increasing the study recognises both the low carbon impacts of biomass sourced in this way and the scale of the resource drax also sources biomass from europe as an academic study it does not purport to represent actual supply chains each of which has distinct attributes but it does confirm the need to ensure that all biomass used for electricity production is sourced sustainably to deliver low carbon electricity that is something drax has campaigned for in the uk and europe for many years and which the uk government has already anticipated by introducing sustainability criteria which will be mandatory from next april adding to the debate drax notes the recent publication of a report 1  prepared for the european commission by another arm of uk government the research agency of the forestry commission the report reviews scientific literature on the contributions of biogenic carbon to greenhouse gas emissions due to the production and use of bioenergy and how these contributions may be appropriately included in methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions this highlights the importance of working with colleagues across the eu to develop a common understanding and methodology in this important and complex area dorothy thompson chief executive of drax said sustainability has always been absolutely central to our biomass strategy the academic study by decc confirms what drax has always argued that there is a right way to source biomass and a wrong way we welcome that it confirms the fact that where biomass is sourced sustainably major carbon savings can be delivered this study adds to the growing breadth of analysis on sustainable sourcing of biomass as a fuel for low carbon electricity generation we look forward to working closely with uk government and other eu stakeholders to improve further the knowledge and analysis in this complex area when we complete our plans to convert three of our generating units to burn sustainable biomass in place of coal we will be able to deliver cost effective renewable electricity to the equivalent of over three million homes and reduce our carbon emissions by over ten million tonnes a year no other renewable can make such an impact

proposal is announced 11 june 2014 press releases abergelli power ltd a uk energy project developer today announces proposals to build a gasfired power station on land at abergelli farm south of felindre and to the north of the m4 motorway the proposed power station could produce up to 299 megawatts mw of electricity and inject tens of millions of pounds into the south west wales economy the company will consult with local people and organisations before applying for permission to build the power station the proposed project would support 150 jobs during the construction and commissioning period and up to 15 new full time skilled jobs when operational the proposed project would have low emissions and would help strengthen and secure the uks energy supply by providing back up to intermittent energy that is generated from renewable sources  primarily wind and solar the power station and its related energy infrastructure would be designed to operate flexibly ie not always running and would produce electricity for no more than 1500 hours per year consultation is a very important part of the planning process and abergelli power will engage with local communities before applying for development consent to build the power station an initial phase of public information events to introduce the project will be held at the following local venues thursday june 19 at forge

tircoed village hall y cyswllt tircoed sa4 9qz between 10am and 1pm members of the abergelli power project team will be on hand at these events to explain the how the proposals will be taken forward and how the consultation process is expected to evolve consultation with local communities and organisations including city  county of swansea council as well as the community councils in the vicinity of the site will be a part of the consenting process for the project alongside the detailed environmental impact assessments and technical studies that will be undertaken over the coming months people and local businesses in the area are being notified of the exhibitions by letter and via an advertisement in the local press information about the project and abergelli power can also be viewed online via httpswwwdraxcomukaboutusourprojectsabergellipower abergelli power proposes to take gas from the nearby national gas transmission system and use it to generate electricity this energy will feed into the national grid which also runs very close to the site the power station will produce up to 299mw of electricity enough to supply the equivalent of around 400000 homes at times when demand is highest norman campbell abergelli powers project director said this power station will be an ultra modern and clean facility and a very significant investment in the local economy we will do our utmost to ensure that the power plant will cause the minimum disturbance locally during construction and subsequent operation  its operation will be subject to stringent environmental and emission regulations we will seek to maximise local economic benefit where we can both during construction and operations he added before seeking permission to build the plant there will be an extensive consultation process with city  county of swansea council and with local people and interest groups this is extremely important to us as we want to explain our plans in detail and listen to what people have to say mr campbell said that swansea city council and the welsh government had been briefed on the proposal following consultation and feedback from communities and interest groups
