decarbonisation biomass and beccs are essential in the uks journey to net zero 10 august 2023 opinion the strategy provides an important steer on the short medium and longterm use of biomass in the uks 2050 net zero target with the governments strategy in hand i am more certain than ever on two things first that there remains a clear and powerful role for biomass and beccs in helping the uk balance harder to abate sectors like aviation and reach net zero and secondly that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs has a vital role to play in our global energy transition  and that drax is well placed to deliver why we should be confident in developing the strategy the government has considered several factors including availability of biomass and the priorities for end use impacts on air quality the sustainability of biomass use as well as the role of beccs in helping to reach our longterm climate goals the priority use framework evaluates where biomass would be most sustainably and efficiently used across sectors given supply constraints this framework is an important tool which has been developed with four key principles in mind sustainability air quality the circular economy and resource efficiency and ability to support us getting to net zero critically the priority use framework states that in the shortterm 2020s government will continue to facilitate sustainable biomass deployment through a range of incentives and requirements covering power heat and transport in the mediumterm to 2035 government intends to further develop biomass use for utilities such as heat and power with a view to where possible transition to beccs biomass for use in beccs should be prioritised in the long term to 2050 its very encouraging to see government recognise the important role that biomass plays in our energy transition in both the short and medium term as well as its prioritisation of beccs in the long term although there are various routes for deploying beccs across different industries the strategy further prioritises the deployment of beccs on existing biomass generation plants with established supply chains further supported by the development of the powerbeccs business model for the first beccs projects the strategy is also promising as it presents an evidencedriven basis for longterm policy stability and i believe if the government continues in this direction it will draw investment to the uks bioenergy industry why this is critical for the country biomass has already played an important role in supporting energy security while helping the uk decarbonise displacing fossil fuels with a source of renewable dispatchable power our work has also made a significant contribution to the uk economy adding an estimated 18 billion to the uk gdp and supporting 17800 jobs in 2021 alone and looking to the future beccs presents an enormous opportunity to the uk early investment in this critical technology has the potential to support energy security and climate targets whilst creating jobs and making the uk a leader in the potentially trilliondollar global cdr market this work needs to happen now  nearly all realistic pathways to limit warming to 15c require the carbon removal technology and renewable power beccs offers and expert voices at the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change the uks climate change committee and forum for the future have said that carbon removals will be needed to address the climate crisis todays strategy is a clear signal from government that they recognise the importance of beccs and the urgency with which we must employ it within the uk why this is encouraging for drax drax is an international growing sustainable business at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security and i believe the strategy we have seen from government today is a clear indication of their support for the work that we do with beccs drax has the ability to become a global leader in carbon removals technology we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in transforming drax power station into the worlds largest carbon removals project the prioritisation of beccs within the priority use framework shows the government is aligned to this vision as we look forward we welcome the governments biomass strategy and will continue to unpack what it means for our business over the coming days and weeks with a mind to our next steps government must now ensure that as it progresses its consultation on biomass sustainability that that process is equally evidencedriven and ensures that sciencebased methods drive the policy forward we hope to continue to work alongside government to support these efforts our formal discussions with the uk government on beccs and a bridging mechanism to support the transition to beccs have been productive but to realise the scale of the ambition included in the governments strategy we need commitment through the delivery of a clear business model that supports beccs todays support from government brings us a big step closer and we look forward to continuing the work will gardiner ceo drax read rns here  tags drax power station  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  biomass  beccs uk biomass strategy  highly supportive of biomass and a priority role for beccs investors the strategy outlines the potential extraordinary role which biomass can play across the economy in power heating and transport including a priority role for bioenergy carbon capture and storage beccs which is seen as critical for meeting net zero plans due to its ability to provide largescale carbon removals will gardiner drax ceo said will gardiner drax group ceo we welcome the uk governments clear support for sustainably sourced biomass and the critical role that beccs can play in achieving the countrys climate goals the inclusion of beccs at the top of a priority use framework is a clear signal that the uk wants to be a leader in carbon removals and drax is ready to deliver on this ambition we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in delivering beccs at drax power station in north yorkshire simultaneously providing reliable renewable power and carbon removals we look forward to working alongside the government to ensure biomass is best used to contribute to net zero across the economy through further progression of plans for beccs and ensuring an evidencedriven best practice approach to sustainability a priority role for beccs the strategy reiterates the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 with the potential for this to increase to 23mt by 2035 and up to 81mt by 2050 with beccs expected to provide the majority of the total in 2050 in the period to 2035 government intends to facilitate the use of biomass for power and heating whilst supporting projects transitioning to beccs beccs projects which includes drax power station are seen as a priority use of biomass given existing generation assets with established supply chains and carbon capture and storage ccs technology ready to be deployed beyond 2035 there will remain a role for biomass without beccs in harder to decarbonise sectors and in supporting energy security the strategy notes the active work in government to support beccs including the development of business models biomass availability and sustainability the strategy considers the global availability of sustainable biomass finding that by using domestic and imported biomass sources there is sufficient material to meet estimated future demand in the 6 th carbon budget alongside the increased use of sustainable biomass government will continue to develop sustainability criteria and drax supports the development of robust standards across sectors a link to the strategy can be found here  scientific assessment of carbon removals from beccs alongside publication of the strategy the government has published an evidencebased assessment of beccs as a route to negative emissions the report sets out how well regulated beccs can deliver negative emissions and ensure positive outcomes for people the environment and the climate beccs at drax power station in march 2023 the government confirmed its commitment to support the deployment of largescale powerbeccs projects by 2030 and that the drax power station beccs project had passed the deliverability assessment for the powerbeccs project submission process formal bilateral discussions with the government are ongoing to move the project forward and help realise the governments ambition to deliver 5mt pa of carbon removals by 2030 these discussions include a bridging mechanism between the end of the current renewable schemes in 2027 and the commissioning of beccs at drax power station drax believes that beccs at drax power station is the only project in the uk that can enable the government to achieve this ambition in addition to the largescale renewable power and system support services it provides to the uk power system in july 2023 the government designated the viking ccs cluster as a track 2 cluster progressing a co 2 transport and storage network in the humber represents a significant step toward helping the region meet its net zero ambitions and ensuring that it remains a source of highskilled jobs and energy security for decades to come along with the east coast cluster viking creates an additional potential pathway to support beccs at drax power station the government has also confirmed that during 2023

carbon capture and storage  will gardiner carbon markets will be essential in reaching net zero  we must ensure they support high standards 9 november 2022 carbon capture angela hepworth commercial director drax in brief the voluntary carbon market will be essential in deploying engineered carbon removals technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air carbon capture and storage dacs at scale the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is developing a set of core carbon principles ccps drax support proposed principles if theyre applied in ways appropriate for engineered carbon removals standards around additionality and the permanence of carbon removals may apply very differently to naturebased and engineered removals something that needs to be addressed explicitly theres growing recognition in governments and environmental organisations of the urgent need to develop highintegrity engineered carbon removals at scale if the world has any chance of meeting our collective parisaligned climate goals bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  beccs  and direct air carbon capture and storage  dacs  are two technologies on the cusp of deployment at scale that can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it permanently and safely the technology is proven developers are bringing forward projects and the most forwardthinking companies are actively seeking to buy removal credits from beccs and dacs developers yet theres a risk that the frameworks being developed in the voluntary carbon market could stifle rather than support the development of engineered carbon removals drax is a worldleader in the deployment of bioenergy solutions our goal is to produce 12 million tonnes of highintegrity permanent co 2 removals by 2030 from its beccs projects in the uk and the us we support the development of rigorous standards for co 2 removals that give purchasers confidence in the integrity of the co 2 removals theyre buying such standards are also important in providing a clear framework for project developers to work to however the market and its standards have largely developed around carbon reduction and avoidance credits rather than removals to create a market that can enable engineered carbon removals at scale rethinking is needed to create standards that are fit for purpose to tackle the climate emergency core carbon principles the integrity council for the voluntary carbon market is in the process of developing a set of core carbon principles ccps and assessment framework af intended to set new threshold standards for highquality carbon credits at drax we welcome and support the principles proposed by the integrity council however its crucial theyre applied in ways that are appropriate for engineered carbon removals and support rather than prevent their development many ccps are directly applicable to engineered carbon removals and can offer important standards for projects developing removals technologies among the most important principles include those stating removals must be robustly quantified with appropriate conservatism in any assumptions made key information must be provided in the public domain to enable appropriate scrutiny of the carbon removal activity while safeguarding commercially sensitive information removal credits should be subject to robust independent thirdparty validation and verification credits should be held in a registry which deals appropriately with removal credits registries must be subject to appropriate governance to ensure their integrity without becoming disproportionately bureaucratic or burdensome removals must adhere to high standards of sustainability taking account of impacts on nature the climate and society there should be no double counting of carbon removals between corporates or between countries bearing in mind that both corporates and countries may count the same removals in parallel and that the article 6 mechanism means countries can decide whether trades between corporates should or shouldnt trigger corresponding adjustments to countries carbon inventories however as pioneers in the field we believe that two of the core carbon principles need to be adapted to the specific characteristics of engineered carbon removals supporting additionality and development incentives the ccps state the greenhouse gas ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be additional ie they would not have occurred in the absence of the incentive created by carbon credit revenues engineered carbon removal credits such as beccs and dacs are by their nature additional they are developed for the specific purpose of removing co 2 from the atmosphere and putting it back in the geosphere they also rely on revenue from carbon markets  largely the voluntary market at present but potentially compliance markets such as the uk and eu ets in the future however most early projects are likely to have some form of government support eg 45q in the us or contracts for difference in the uk from outside carbon credit revenues but that support isnt intended to be sufficient on its own for their deployment  project developers will be expected to sell credits in compliance or voluntary markets engineered carbon removals have high upfront capital costs and its clear that revenue from voluntary or compliance markets will be essential to make them viable additionality assessments should be riskbased if its clear that a technologytype is additional a technologylevel assessment should be sufficient this should be supplemented with full transparency on any government support provided to projects compensating against nonpermanent storage on the topic of permanence that ccps state the ghg emission reductions or removals from the mitigation activity shall be permanent or if they have a risk of reversal any reversals shall be fully compensated a key benefit of engineered carbon removals with geological storage is that they effectively provide permanent carbon removal any risk of reversal over tens of thousands of years is extremely small  the risk of reversal for naturebased credits by contrast is much greater schemes for managing reversal risk in the voluntary carbon market that have been developed for naturebased credits are not necessarily appropriate for engineered removals requirements for project developers to set aside a significant proportion of credits generated in a buffer pool potentially as much as 10 are disproportionate to the real risk of reversal from a wellmanged geological store they also fail to take account of the stringent regulatory requirements for geological storage that already exist or are being put in place any ongoing requirements for monitoring should be consistent with existing regulatory requirements placed on storage owners and operators similarly where jurisdictions have robust regulatory arrangements for dealing with co 2 storage risk which place liabilities on storage owners operators or governments the arrangements in the voluntary carbon market should mirror these arrangements rather than cutting across them and no additional liabilities should be put on project developers at drax we believe the ccps provide a suitable framework to ensure the integrity of engineered carbon removals if applied pragmatically they can give purchasers of engineered carbon removal credits confidence in the integrity of the product theyre buying and provide a clear framework for project developers they can ensure that standards support rather than stifle the development of high integrity carbon removal projects such as beccs and dacs which are essential to achieving our global climate goals tags technology  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture carbon removals is a global need the us is making it possible will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 20 october 2022 carbon capture key takeaways removing carbon from the atmosphere is urgent if we are to meet global climate targets the uss commitment to supporting carbon removal technologies creates an opportunity for new bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs power stations the market for carbon credits is gaining increasing credibility and verification making it a source of financing for ambitious decarbonization projects carbon markets are needed now to make investment into vital removals projects possible in the us and globally after a summer of soaring temperatures across the northern hemisphere the global nature of climate change is more obvious than ever forest fires around the world in 2021 resulted in double the loss of tree cover than in 2001 while today more than 23 billion people face water stress from drought its clear that the action we take to help tackle the global climate emergency must be international too we believe that carbon dioxide co 2  removals will be crucial in addressing this global challenge experts and governments agree that in addition to economywide decarbonization removing carbon from the atmosphere is critical to meeting the goal of net zero co 2 emissions by midcentury the ipcc says 10 billion tons per year of removals will be needed in 2050 for the world to get to net zero thats a huge step up from the 40 million tons captured globally in 2021 but also a significant investment opportunity our ambition is to remove 4 million tons of co 2 through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs outside the uk per year while generating renewable baseload electricity and supporting healthy sustainable forests the likely contender for our first location the united states we already operate in communities across the us south employing more than 1200 people in our sustainable biomass pellet production  now we are preparing to build a new beccs power station in the region its clear to us that the us is an ideal market for beccs with its longrunning sustainable forest industry and range of suitable sites for permanent co 2 storage we see the countrys efforts to retire coal by 2030 and commitment to innovation as an opportunity to build one of the largest carbon removal projects in the us our first plant could be capable of permanently removing 2 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year while also generating 2terawatt hours of 247 renewable power the uss newly legislated commitment to tackling climate change through the inflation reduction act as well as the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent scenario planning for 100 clean electricity system are establishing it as the leading market to deploy new environmental technologies and a new frontier for permanent highquality emissions removals the need for high quality permanent emissions removals a net zero future is only possible through the widespread implementation of highintegrity carbon removals beccs offers this by combining low carbon renewable biomass power generation with carbon capture technology and secure permanent carbon sequestration beccs works by generating renewable electricity using biomass sourced from sustainably managed forests that absorb co 2 as they grow co 2 released in the generation process is captured and stored permanently and safely in geological rock formations the overall process removes more co 2 from the atmosphere than it emits resulting in negative emissions this allows us to offer decarbonizing industries highquality carbon removals credits given the scale of co 2 that must be removed from the atmosphere and the importance for countries and companies around the world to reach net zero i believe this market for verified co 2 removal credits is a trilliondollar opportunity voluntary carbon markets have historically suffered from a lack of sustained and reliable investment due to fluctuating market prices and varying quality of the carbon credits they contain however increased oversight from investors ngos and independent bodies is encouraging credibility and integrity prompting sustained adoption by businesses will gardiner drax group ceo weve demonstrated the growing appetite for carbon removals by signing the worlds largest carbon removals deal to date at new york climate week the agreement with respira an impactdriven carbon finance business  will allow it to purchase 400000 metric tons of co 2 removals cdrs a year from our north american operations this would enable other corporations and financial institutions to achieve their own co 2 emissions reduction targets by purchasing cdrs from respira deals like these make voluntary carbon markets a more effective means of reducing net co 2 emissions by securing commitments and driving investment in projects that deliver independently verified highquality emissions reductions as the global economy works towards its net zero targets co 2 removals will be crucial in reducing the still dangerously high levels of carbon in our atmosphere today beccs stands to be a powerful tool in a net zero future as the only technology capable of delivering both high quality permanent carbon removals while also delivering baseload renewable power the ability to generate power with negative emissions will be crucial for increasingly electrified economies as they move away from fossil fuels the potential for the us driven by a dynamic mix of markets investors and engaged consumers some of the most prominent us companies are pledging to reach net zero investing in 247 renewable power and other means to do so technology companies like alphabet apple and microsoft have laid out ambitious plans to decarbonize operations supply chains and even remove historic emissions other organizations like the first movers coalition include us companies from a range of sectors committing corporate purchasing power to solving difficult decarbonization challenges  this industry readiness is increasingly backed up by legislative policy action the recent inflation reduction act substantially increases the availability of the 45q tax credit for carbon capture and storage projects increasing their value from 50 a ton of carbon removals to 85 per ton helping to further support the business case needed to deploy technologies like beccs we believe the us is on the right track to create a market in which beccs can thrive the department of energys national renewable energy lab recent 100 clean electricity system report includes beccs in three of the four possible scenarios explored it forecasts the us will need between 714gw of installed beccs capacity by 2035 to achieve an electricity system with net zero co 2 emissions that equates to removals of approximately 55120 mt co 2 per year by 2035 the uss established forestry commercial industry with its credible commitment to sustainable management offers ample lowgrade wood and wood industry residues to power beccs the countrys longrunning exploration of co 2 capture and transport and history of industrial innovations means there are the skills supply chains and regulatory environment to undertake ambitious new infrastructure projects beccs is a proven technology and one that can scale up sooner than any other technology but action is needed now to make these markets that can deliver large scale carbon removals projects a reality action is needed now for responsible businesses with the desire to go further faster or for sectors still developing viable decarbonization routes carbon removals from beccs deliver real verifiable and permanent progress towards net zero and beyond to net negative its encouraging to see the us pass legislation that can facilitate investment into carbon removal technologies and develop the carbon credit market however carbon markets must have standards that are credible both in the business community and in the environmental and civil society collaboration between governments corporations and ngos will be critical to ensure we create systems that can tackle the climate emergency we cant afford to contemplate theoretical net zero futures buying and selling highquality permanent removals is the action we need today now is the time to capture the opportunity and be part of the solution together tags

carbon capture richard gwilliam head of cluster development at drax key takeaways the humber industrial cluster contributes 18 billion a year to the uk economy and supports 360000 jobs in heavy industry and manufacturing as demand for industrial products with green credentials rises and net zero targets demand decarbonisation businesses in the humber need to begin implementing carbon capture at scale the size of the humber and diversity of industries make it a significant challenge but if we get it right the humber will be a world leader in decarbonisation without investment in decarbonisation infrastructure the region risks losing its status as a world leading industrial cluster putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk when the iconic humber bridge opened in june 1981 it did more than just set records for its size it connected the region uniting both communities and industries and allowing the humber to become what it is today a thriving industrial hub that contributes more than 18 billion to the uk economy and supports some 360000 jobs as the uk works towards a lowcarbon future the shift to a green economy will require new regional infrastructure that once again unites the humbers people and businesses around a shared goal while the humber bridge connected the region across the estuary waters a new subterranean pipeline that can transport the carbon captured from industries will unify the regions decarbonisation efforts its infrastructure that will be crucial in helping the uk reach its net zero goals but also cement the humbers position as a global decarbonisation leader the humber bridge capturing carbon across the humber capturing carbon  preventing emissions from entering the atmosphere and storing them safely and permanently is a fundamental part of decarbonising the economy and tackling climate change aside from the chemical engineering required to extract carbon dioxide co 2  from industrial emissions one of the key challenges of carbon capture is how you transport it at scale to secure storage locations such as below the north sea bed where the carbon can be permanently trapped and sequestered  click to viewdownload engineers at drax power station at drax were pioneering bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology but carbon capture will play an important role in decarbonising a wide range of industries the humber region not only produces about 20 of the uks electricity its also a major hub for chemicals refining steel making and other carbonintensive industries the consequence of this industrial mix is that the humbers carbon footprint per head of population is bigger than anywhere else in the country at an international level its the second largest industrial cluster by co 2 emissions in the whole of western europe if the uk is to reach net zero the humber must decarbonise and carbon capture and storage will be instrumental in achieving that the scale of the challenge in the humber also makes it an opportunity to significantly reduce the countrys overall emissions and break new ground implementing carbon capture innovations across a wide range of industries these diverse businesses can be united in their collective efforts and connected through shared decarbonisation infrastructure  equipment to capture emissions pipelines to transport them and a shared site to store them safely and permanently economies of scale through shared infrastructure the idea of a co 2 transport pipeline traversing the humber might sound unusual but largescale natural gas pipelines have crisscrossed the region since the late 1960s when gas was dispatched from the easington terminal on the east yorkshire coast under the humber to killingholme in north lincolnshire further the uks existing legislation creates an environment to ensure they can be operated safely and effectively co 2 is a very stable molecule compared to natural gas and there are already thousands of miles of co 2 pipelines operating around the us where its historically been used in oil recovery a shared pipeline also offers economies of scale for companies to implement carbon capture allowing the humbers cluster of carbonintensive industries to invest in vital infrastructure in a costeffective way the diversity of different industries in the region from renewable baseload power generation at drax to cuttingedge hydrogen production  also offers a chance to experiment and showcase whats possible at scale the humbers position as an estuary onto the north sea is also advantageous its expansive layers of porous sandstone offer an estimated 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space the humber estuary but this isnt just an opportunity to decarbonise the uks most emissionsintensive region its a stage to present a new green industrial hub to the world a hub that could create as many as 47800 jobs including high quality technical and construction roles as well as other jobs throughout supply chains and the wider uk economy british innovation as a global export as industries of all kinds across the world race to decarbonise theres an increasing demand for products with green credentials if we can decarbonise products from the region such as steel  it will give uk businesses a global edge failure to follow through on environmental ambitions however will not just damage the clusters status it will put hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk breaking new ground is difficult but there are firstmover advantages the products and processes trialled and run at scale within the humber offer intellectual property that industrial hubs around the world are searching for creating a new export for the uk but this vision of a decarbonised humber that exports both its products and knowledge to the world is only possible if we take the right action now we have a genuine global leadership position if we dont act now that will be lost through projects like zero carbon humber and the east coast cluster  alongside net zero teesside the regions businesses have shown our collective commitment to implementing decarbonisation at scale through collaboration as a track 1 cluster  the humber presents one of the uks greatest opportunities to level up  attracting global businesses and investors as well as protecting and creating skilled jobs we need to seize

countries industries and companies towards net zero goals as a newly established discipline carbon accounting still lacks standardisation and frameworks in how emissions are tracked reduced and mitigated the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol which lays out three scopes businesses should report and act upon carbon accounting evolves from reporting in the use of goals and timeframes in which targets are met timeframes are crucial in the deployment of technologies like carbon capture removals and achieving net zero how can countries and companies find a route to net zero emissions many organisations countries and industries have pledged to balance their emissions before midcentury they intend to do this through a combination of cutting emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere tracking and quantifying emissions understanding output reducing them and setting tangible targets that can be worked towards are all central to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  especially when it comes to carbon dioxide co 2  emissions and energy consumption reporting is already common practice and compulsory for businesses over a certain size in the uk however carbon accounting takes this a step further carbon reporting is a statement of physical greenhouse gas emissions that occur over a given period explains michael goldsworthy head of climate change and carbon strategy at drax carbon accounting relates to how those emissions are then processed and counted towards specific targets the methodologies for calculating emissions and determining contributions against targets may then have differing rules depending on which framework or standard is being reported against carbon accounting tools can help companies and counties understand their carbon footprint  how much carbon is being emitted as part of their operations who is responsible for them and how they can be effectively mitigated like how financial accounting may seek to balance a companys books and calculate potential profit carbon accounting seeks to do the same with emissions tracking what an entity emits and what it reduces removes or mitigates carbon accounting is therefore crucial in understanding how countries and companies can contribute to reaching net zero a new space how different organisations countries and industries approach carbon accounting is still an evolving process its as complex as financial accounting but with financial accounting theres a long standing industry that relies on wellestablished practices and principles carbon accounting by contrast is such a new space explains goldsworthy regardless of its infancy businesses and countries are already implementing standardised approaches to carbon accounting regulations such as emissions trading schemes and reporting systems such as streamlined energy and carbon reporting secr and the taskforce on climate related financial disclosure tcfd are beginning to deliver some degree of consistency in businesses carbon reporting other standards such as the ghg protocol have sought to provide a standardised basis for corporate reporting and accounting elsewhere voluntary carbon markets eg carbon offsets have also evolved to allow transferral of carbon reductions or removals between businesses providing flexibility to companies in delivering their climate commitments the challenge is in aligning these frameworks so that they work together for example emissions within a corporate inventory or offset programme must be accounted for in a way that is consistent with a national inventory to date these accounting systems have evolved independently with different rules and methodologies beginning to implement detailed carbon accounting upon which emissions reductions and removals can be based requires standardised understanding of what they are and where they come from reporting and tackling scope one two and three emissions the main carbon accounting standard used by businesses is the greenhouse gas ghg protocol  this voluntary carbon reporting standard can be used by countries and cities as well as individual companies globally the ghg protocol categorises emissions in three different scopes called scope 1 scope 2 and scope 3 understanding measuring and reporting these is a key factor in carbon accounting and can drive meaningful emissions reduction and mitigation scope one  direct emissions scope one emissions are those that come as a direct result of a company or countrys activities these can include fuel combustion at a factorys facilities for example or emissions from a fleet of vehicles scope one emissions are the most straightforward for an organisation to measure and report and easier for organisations to directly act on scope two  indirect energy emissions scope two emissions are those which come from the generation of energy an organisation uses these can include emissions form electricity steam heating and cooling a business may buy electricity for example from an electricity supplier which acquires power from a generator if that generator is a fossilfuelled power station the energy consumers scope two emissions will be greater than if it buys power from a renewable electricity supplier or generates its own renewable power the ability to change energy suppliers makes scope two relatively straightforward for organisations to act on assuming renewable energy sources are available in the area scope three  all other indirect emissions scope three is much broader it covers upstream and downstream lifecycle emissions of products used or produced by a company as well as other indirect emissions such as employee commuting and business travel emissions identifying and reducing these emissions across supply and value chains can be difficult for businesses with complex supply lines and global distribution networks they are also hard for companies to directly influence add in factors like emissions mitigations or offsetting and the carbon accounting can quickly become much more complex than simply reporting and reducing emissions that occur directly from a companys activities nevertheless these fullsystem overviews and wholeproduct lifecycle accounting are crucial to understanding the true impact of operations and organisations and to reach climate goals working to timelines setting goals with defined timelines and the development of rules that ensure consistent accounting is also crucial to implementing effective climate change mitigation frameworks throughout the global economy consider the uks aim to be net zero by 2050 or draxs ambition to be net negative by 2030 as goals with set timelines for many technologies the time scales over which targets are set have added relevance there are often upfront emissions to account for and operational emissions that may change over time take for example an electric vehicle the climate benefit will be determined by emissions from construction and the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power it a timeline of beccs at drax click to viewdownload looking at a brief snapshot at the beginning of its life say the first couple of years might not show any climate benefit compared to a vehicle using an internal combustion engine over the lifetime of the vehicle however meaningful emissions savings may become clear  especially if the electricity powering the vehicle continues to decarbonise over time this provides a challenge when setting carbon emissions targets targets set too far in the future potentially risk inaction in the short term while targets set over short periods risk disincentivising technologies that have substantial longterm mitigation potential delivering net zero some greenhouse gas emissions will be impossible to fully abate such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture while other sectors like aviation will be incredibly difficult to fully decarbonise this makes carbon removal technologies all the more critical to ensuring net zero is achieved technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  which combines lowcarbon biomassfuelled renewable power generation with carbon capture and storage ccs to permanently remove emissions from the atmosphere  are already under development however it is imperative that such technologies are accounted for using robust approaches to carbon accounting ensuring all emission and removals flows across the value chain are accurately calculated in accordance with best scientific practice in the case of beccs its vital that not only are emissions from processing and transporting biomass considered but also its potential impact on the land sector forests from which biomass is sourced will be managed for a variety of reasons such as mitigating natural disturbance delivering commercial returns and preserving ecosystems accurate accounting of these impacts is therefore key to ensuring such technologies deliver meaningful reductions in atmospheric co 2 within timeframes guided by science accounting for net zero while carbon accounting is crucial to reaching a true level of net zero in the uk and globally where residual emissions are balanced against removals the practice should not be used exclusively to deliver numerical carbon goals to deliver net zero its vital we have robust carbon accounting systems and targets in place ensuring we reduce fossil emissions as far as possible while also incentivising carbon removal solutions says goldsworthy however many removal solutions rely on the natural world and so it is critical that ecosystems are not only valued on a carbon basis but consider other environmental factors such as biodiversity as well tags sustainability  decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  carbon capture why and how is carbon dioxide transported 11 april 2022 carbon capture what is carbon transportation carbon transportation is the movement of carbon from one place to another in nature carbon moves through the carbon cycle  in industries like energy however carbon transportation refers to the physical transfer of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from the point of capture to the point of usage or storage why does carbon need to be transported anthropogenic manmade co 2 released in processes like power generation leads to the direct increase of co 2 in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming  however these emissions can be captured as part of carbon capture and storage ccs  the co 2 is then transported for safe and permanent storage in geological formations deep underground capturing and storing co 2 prevents it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to global warming processes that can deliver negative emissions  such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs and direct air capture and storage dacs  aim to permanently remove co 2 from the atmosphere through ccs in ccs carbon must be transported from the site where its captured to a site where it can be permanently stored this means it needs to travel from a power station or factory to a geological formation like a saline aquifer or depleted oil and gas reservoirs as of september 2021 there were 27 operational ccs facilities around the world with the combined capacity to capture around 40 million tonnes per annum mtpa of co 2  its estimated that the uk alone has 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space in sandstone rock formations under the north sea how is carbon transported co 2 can be transported via trucks or ships but the most common and efficient method is by pipeline moving gases of any kind through pipelines is based on pressure gases travel from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure compressing gas to a high pressure allows it to flow to other locations gas pipelines are common all around the world including those transporting co 2  in the us there are for instance more than 50 co 2 pipelines  covering around 6500 km and transporting approximately 68 million tonnes of co 2 a year  gas takes up less volume when its compressed and even less when it is liquefied solidified or hydrated therefore before being transported captured co 2 is often compressed and liquefied until it becomes a supercritical fluid  in a supercritical state co 2 has the density of a liquid but the viscosity thickness of a gas and is therefore easier to transport through pipelines its also 5080 less dense than water with a viscosity that is 100 times lower than liquid this means it can be loaded onto ships in greater quantities and that there is less friction when its moving through pipes and subsequently into geological storage sites how safe is it to transport carbon its no riskier to transport co 2 via pipeline or ship than it is to transport oil and natural gas  and existing oil and natural gas pipelines can be repurposed to transport co 2  to enable the safe use of co 2 pipelines ccs projects must ensure captured co 2 complies with strict purity and temperature specifications as well as making sure co 2 is dry and free from impurities that could impact pipelines operations whilst there are a growing number of ccs transport systems around the world ccs is still is a relatively new field but research is underway to identify best practises materials and technologies to optimise the process this includes research around potential risks and techniques for leak mitigation and remediation in the uk the health and safety executive regulates health safety and integrity issues for all natural gas pipelines which are covered by legislation the legislation ensures the safety of pipelines pressure systems and offshore installations and can serve as a strong foundation for co 2 transport regulation fast facts globally ccs projects have been operational since the 1980s with more than 260 million tonnes of co 2 being captured and stored over 40 years the global capacity of ccs projects in development in september 2021 was 111 million tonnes per year  this was a 48 increase compared to the end of 2020 the uks existing gas transmission network is made up of some 7660 km of highpressure gas pipelines the price of reusing offshore oil and gas pipelines to transport co 2 could be just 1 to 10 of the cost of building a new pipeline go deeper catch up on how a range of carbon capture transport and storage projects around the world are progressing here are the details of five proposed carbon capture

decarbonisation  beccs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  negative emissions  carbon capture what is the carbon cycle 25 march 2022 carbon capture what is the carbon cycle all living things contain carbon and the carbon cycle is the process through which the element continuously moves from one place in nature to another most carbon is stored in rock and sediment but its also found in soil oceans and the atmosphere and is produced by all living organisms  including plants animals and humans carbon atoms move between the atmosphere and various storage locations also known as reservoirs on earth they do this through mechanisms such as photosynthesis the decomposition and respiration of living organisms and the eruption of volcanoes as our planet is a closed system the overall amount of carbon doesnt change however the level of carbon stored in a particular reservoir including the atmosphere can and does change as does the speed at which carbon moves from one reservoir to another what is the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle carbon exists in many different forms including the colourless and odourless gas that is carbon dioxide co 2   during photosynthesis plants absorb light energy from the sun water through their roots and co 2 from the air  converting them into oxygen and glucose the oxygen is then released back into the air while the carbon is stored in glucose  and used for energy by the plant to feed its stem branches leaves and roots plants also release co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration animals  including humans  who consume plants similarly digest the glucose for energy purposes the cells in the human body then break down the glucose with co 2 emitted as a waste product as we exhale co 2 is also produced when plants and animals die and are broken down by organisms such as fungi and bacteria during decomposition what is the fast carbon cycle the natural process of plants and animals releasing co 2 into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition and plants absorbing it via photosynthesis is known as the biogenic carbon cycle biogenic refers to something that is produced by or originates from a living organism this cycle also incorporates co 2 absorbed and released by the worlds oceans the biogenic carbon cycle is also called the fast carbon cycle as the carbon that circulates through it does so comparatively quickly there are nevertheless substantial variations within this faster cycle reservoir turnover times  a measure of how long the carbon remains in one location  range from years for the atmosphere to decades through to millennia for major carbon sinks on land and in the ocean what is the slow carbon cycle in some circumstances plant and animal remains can become fossilised this process which takes millions of years eventually leads to the formation of fossil fuels coal comes from the remains of plants that have been transformed into sedimentary rock and we get crude oil and natural gas from plankton that once fell to the ocean floor and was over time buried by sediment the rocks and sedimentary layers where coal crude oil and natural gas are found form part of what is known as the geological or slow carbon cycle from this cycle carbon is returned to the atmosphere through for example volcanic eruptions and the weathering of rocks in the slow carbon cycle reservoir turnover times exceed 10000 years and can stretch to millions of years how do humans impact the carbon cycle left to its own devices earth can keep co 2 levels balanced with similar amounts of co 2 released into and absorbed from the air carbon stored in rocks and sediment would slowly be emitted over a long period of time however human activity has upset this natural equilibrium burning fossil fuel releases carbon thats been sequestered in geological formations for millions of years transferring it from the slow to the fast biogenic carbon cycle this influx of fossil carbon leads to excessive levels of atmospheric co 2 that the biogenic carbon cycle cant cope with as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun between the earth and its atmosphere co 2 is essential to human existence without co 2 and other greenhouse gases the planet could become too cold to sustain life however the drastic increase in atmospheric co 2 due to human activity means that too much heat is now retained between earth and the atmosphere this has led to a continued rise in the average global temperature a development that is part of climate change  where does biomass fit into the carbon cycle one way to help reduce fossil carbon is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy including sustainably sourced biomass  feedstock for biomass energy includes plant material wood and forest residue  organic matter that absorbs co 2 as part of the biogenic carbon cycle when the biomass is combusted in energy or electricity generation the biogenic carbon stored in the organic matter is released back into the atmosphere as co 2  this is distinctly different from the fossil carbon released by oil gas and coal the addition of carbon capture and storage to bioenergy  creating beccs  means the biogenic carbon absorbed by the organic matter is captured and sequestered permanently removing it from the atmosphere by capturing co 2 and transporting it to geological formations  such as porous rocks  for permanent storage beccs moves co 2 from the fast to the slow carbon cycle this is the opposite of burning fossil fuels which takes carbon out of geological formations the slow carbon cycle and emits it into the atmosphere the fast carbon cycle because beccs removes more carbon than it emits it delivers negative emissions fast facts according to a 2019 study human activity including the burning of fossil fuels releases between 40 and 100 times more carbon every year than all volcanic eruptions around the world in march 2021 the mauna loa observatory in hawaii reported that average co 2 in the atmosphere for that month was 14 parts per million  this was 50 higher than at the time of the industrial revolution 17501800 there is an estimated 85 billion gigatonne gt of carbon stored below the surface of the earth in comparison just 43500 gt is stored on land in oceans and in the atmosphere forests around the world are vital carbon sinks absorbing around 76 million
