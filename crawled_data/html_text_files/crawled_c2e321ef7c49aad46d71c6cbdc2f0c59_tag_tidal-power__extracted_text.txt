power stations and electricity systems are measured in tonnes and miles and pump gigawatts gw of electricity around the country with the worlds electricity increasingly coming from renewables this big thinking is key to powering longterm change from taller wind turbines to bigger batteries these are the massive structures breaking energy records germanys giant wind turbine and the plan to beat it as wind power becomes ever more prevalent one of the key questions that needs answering is how to get more out of it one way is to build taller turbines and longer blades  putting turbines higher into the air sets them into stronger wind flows while longer blades increase their generating capacity the worlds tallest wind turbines are currently in gaildorf germany and stand at 178 metres with the blades tips reaching 2465 metres  built by max b√∂gl wind ag the onshore turbines house a 34 megawatt mw generator that can produce around 105 gigawatt hours gwh per year however turbines continue to grow and ge has announced plans for the haliadex turbine  which will ship in 2021 at 259 metres in total the offshore turbine is almost double the height of the london eye and will spin 106 metre blades generating 67 gwh per year chinas great wall of solar china has pumped substantial investment into solar power including the worlds biggest solar plant in electricity generation and sheer size dubbed the great wall of solar the tengger desert solar park has a capacity of more than 15 gw and covers 43 km 2 of desert the next largest by comparison is indias kurnool ultra mega solar park which covers just 24 km 2 and generates 1 gw however rampant investment by the country means there are several projects in the pipeline that will break the 2 gw mark and will set new records for solar power plants morocco takes solar to new heights concentrated solar power csp takes the technology skywards by using thousands of mirrors known as heliostats and focusing the suns rays towards a central tower this heats up molten salt within the tower which is then combined with water to create steam and power a turbine  like in a thermal power plant moroccos noor ouarzazate facility pictured in the main photo of this article is home to the worlds tallest csp towers at 250 metres tall 7400 heliostats beam the sunlight at each tower which have a capacity of 150 mw and can store molten salt for 75 hours its record will soon be matched by israels 121 mw ashalim solar thermal power station when it begins operating this year however never one to be outdone when it comes to tall structures dubai plans to build a 260 metre csp tower in 2020 as part of the mohammed bin rashid al maktoum solar park which at 700 mw will be the worlds largest singlesite csp facility three gorges dam chinas monster mountain dam the three gorges dam on chinas yangtza river might be the worlds most powerful hydropower dam with its massive 225 gw capacity but a different chinese dam holds the title of the worlds tallest jinpingi hydropower station is a 305metretall arch dam on the yalong river it sits on the jinping bend where the river wraps around the entire jinping mountain range the project began in 2005 and was completed with the commissioning of a sixth and final generator in 2014 which brought its total capacity to 36 gw itaipu dam and hydropower station brazil and paraguays river arrangement while it may be tall at 568 metreslong jinpingi is far from the longest that mantle belongs to the 7919 metrelong itaipu dam and hydropower station that straddles brazil and paraguay and has an installed capacity of 14 gw the power station is home to 20 700 mw generators however as brazils electricity system runs at 60hz and paraguays at 50hz  10 of the generators run at each frequency  biomass domes that could hide the albert hall using a relatively new material such as compressed wood pellets as a renewable alternative to coal in large thermal power stations creates new challenges  biomass ecostore domes help tackle storage problems by keeping the materials dry and maintaining the right temperatures and conditions unlike cylindrical concrete silos domes also offer greater resistance to hurricanes and extreme weather this is important in areas such as louisiana where this low carbon fuel is stored at the drax biomass port facility in 357 metre high 616 metre diameter domes before it is shipped to drax power station the power station itself is home to four of the worlds largest biomass domes each is 503 metres high and 63 metres in diameter  enough to hold the albert hall or in draxs case 71000 tonnes of biomass  south korean coastline takes the most from the tides beginning operation 1966 the rance tidal power station  in france was the first and largest facility of its kind for 45 years the power station made use of the 750 metrelong rance barrage on frances northern coast with a 330metrelong section of it generating electricity through 24 10 mw turbines it was overtaken however in 2011 with the opening of the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea the facility generates power along a 400metre section of the 127 km sihwa lake tidal barrage and generates a maximum of 254 mw through ten 254 mw submerged turbines the battle to beat teslas giant battery south australia has become a battlefield in the race to build the worlds biggest grid scale storage solution tesla constructed a 10000 m 2  football pitchsized 100 mw lithiumion battery outside of adelaide at the end of 2017 which is connected to a wind power plant and can independently supply electricity to 30000 homes for an hour however rival billionaire to teslas elon musk sanjeev gupta plans to take on the storage facility with a 140 mw battery to support a new solarpowered steelworks also in south australia the excitement around battery technologys potential means the title of worlds biggest will likely swap hands plenty more times over the next decade this contest wont just be confined to batteries as countries increasingly move away from fossil fuels bigger wider and taller renewable structures will be needed to power the world these are the worlds largest renewable structures today but they probably wont stay in those positions for long tags biomass energy  hydroelectric power  renewable energy  tidal power 4 of the most exciting emerging technologies in electricity generation 6 july 2017 power generation since the dawn of the industrial age the world has been powered by a relatively small set of technologies the 20 th century was the age of coal but this side of 2000 thats changed the need to curb emissions and the rise of renewables from wind to solar to biomass has significantly changed how we fuel our power generation today some of the worlds most interesting and exciting emerging technologies are those designed to generate electricity microbial fuel cells  harnessing the power of bacteria bacteria are all around us some are harmful some are beneficial but all of them breathe when they breathe oxidation occurs which is when something combines with oxygen at a chemical level and when bacteria do this electrons are released by connecting breathing microbes to a cathode and an anode the positive and negative rods of a battery the flow of these released electrons can be harnessed to generate power this is whats known as a microbial fuel cell mfc mfcs are used largely to generate electricity from waste water but are expanding into more exotic uses like powering miniature aquatic robots  new developments are constantly expanding the power and applications of mfcs researchers at binghamton university new york found that combining phototropic lightconsuming and heterotrophic matterconsuming bacteria in microbial fuel reactions generates currents 70 times more powerful than in conventional setups solar  a new dawn solar power may not be a new technology but where its going is one of the most promising developments in the space is solar voltaic glass which has the properties of a sheet of window glass but can also generate solar power rather than collecting photons like normal solar does and which transparent materials by definition cant do photovoltaic glass uses salts to absorb energy from nonvisible wavelengths and deflects these to conventional solar cells embedded at the edge of each panel or theres solar pv paint which contains tiny light sensitive particles coated with conductive materials when layered over electrodes youve got a sprayon power generator betavoltaics  nothing wasted from nuclear waste nuclear material is constantly decaying and in the process emits radioactive particles this is why extremely radioactive material is so dangerous and why properly storing nuclear waste is so important and so expensive but this waste can actually be put to good use betavoltaic devices use the waste particles produced by lowlevel radioactive materials to capture electrons and generate electricity the output from these devices can be fairly low and decreases over long periods of time but because of the consistent output of nuclear decay they can be extremely longlasting for example one betavoltaic battery could provide one watt of power continuously for 30 years  and while they arent currently fit to work on a large scale their longevity and very compact size make them ideal power sources for devices such as sensors installed on equipment that needs to be operational for long periods tidal power  changing tides a more predictable power source than intermittent renewables like wind and solar tidal power isnt new however its growth and development has typically been restrained by high costs and limited availability thats changing last year saw the launch of the first of 269 15 mw megawatt underwater turbines part of worlds first large scale tidal energy farm in scotland  around the world there are existing tidal power stations  such as the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea  which has a capacity of 254mw  but the meygen array in scotland will be able to take the potential of the technology further its hoped that when fully operational it will generate 398mw or enough to power 175000 homes we might not know exactly how the electricity of tomorrow will be generated but its likely some or all of these technologies will play a part what is clear is that our energy is changing tags electricity generation  investors  technology  tidal power name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive our email newsletter to receive
