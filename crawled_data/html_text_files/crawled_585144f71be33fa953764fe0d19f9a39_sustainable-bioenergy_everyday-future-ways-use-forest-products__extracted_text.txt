transport contact us the everyday and future ways you use forest products theres much more to trees than wood 24 august 2018 sustainable bioenergy think of the products that come from forests and you might think of the centuries of shipbuilding construction and cooking made possible by civilisations utilising this plentiful natural resource what you might not think of is the complex construction of chemicals and matter that make up the trees of a forest  nor of the countless ways these can be broken down and used yet this is the reality of forests from essential oils to sturdy packaging to powerful adhesives trees are used to create a range of products that make daily life possible and as awareness of the need to reduce plastic consumption grows research into forest products and how they can replace the lessenvironmentally friendly objects is growing here we look at five of the most common products used today and maybe in the future that owe something to forests adhesives from tall oil anyone who has encountered tree sap can attest trees are made up of some pretty sticky stuff and its because of this that they have long been a source for adhesives production  from glue to cement the substance that makes this possible is known as tall oil named after the swedish word tallolja  meaning pine oil it is a byproduct of pulping coniferous trees tall oil has been produced commercially since the 1930s when the invention of the recovery boiler made it possible to extract it from the kraft pulping process  however the resins and waxes tall oil is made up of have a longer history these are also known as naval products due to their historic use in ship building and can be tapped directly from living trees today tall oil is also used in asphalt roofing as well as medical and cosmetic applications one of tall oils most exciting uses is as bioverno  a renewable alternative to diesel made in the worlds first commercialscale biorefinery in finland disinfectants and detergents from turpentine tapping trees has historically been a means of extracting multiple useful substances and one of the most versatile of these is turpentine this yellowish liquid is produced from distilled tree resin and has a long history of uses turpentine has been used since roman times as torch or lamp fuel but its antiseptic properties also means it was often used as medicine while doctors today would advise against drinking turpentine as was prescribed in the past it is still used today in disinfectants detergents and cleaning products giving off a fresh pinelike odour fuels to replace fossils biomass pellets from working forests are just one of the ways trees are providing renewable energy one other form is cellulosic ethanol a new second generation of liquid biofuel rather than competing with food supply often a concern in the creation of biodiesels cellulosic ethanol is made from nonfood based materials such as forest and agricultural residues left behind after harvest  wheat straw  and timber processing wastes including sawdust it is now being produced at a commercial scale in europe the us and brazil  woody biomass can also be converted into a petroleum substitute known as pyrolysis oil or biooil biomass is transformed into this dark brown liquid by heating it to 500 o c in an oxygendeprived environment and then allowing it to cool biooil has a much higher energy density than biomass in chip or pellet form and after upgrading can be used as jet fuel or as a petroleum alternative in chemical manufacturing  vanilla ice cream and carbon fibre from lignin lignin is what gives trees their tough woody quality  and after cellulose is the worlds second most abundant natural polymer polymers are very long molecules made up of many smaller molecules joined endtoend most often associated with plastic which is a synthetic polymer lignin is generally a waste product from the paper pulping process and is often burnt as fuel however it can also serve as a vanilla flavouring  a property that may make lignin an important resource in the face of an impending vanilla pod shortage  futurelooking research however aims to unlock much more from the 50 million tonnes of lignin produced every year globally  one of the most promising of these is as an alternative source of a family of organic compound known as phenylpropanoids  these are normally extracted from petroleum and are hugely useful in producing plastics and carbon fibre as well as drugs and paint nanocellulose and the future of forest products cellulose is already one of the most important products to come from forests thanks to its role in paper production however this abundant substance  which is also the primary material in the cell walls of all green plants  holds even more potential by shrinking cellulose down to a nano level it can be configured to be very strong while remaining very light  this opens it up as a product with many possibilities including using it as a source of bioplastics  some bioplastics  polylactic acid pha pbs and starch blends  are biodegradable alternatives to fossil fuelbased plastics and could potentially help solve some of the worlds mostpressing waste issues not all biobased plastics are biodegradable however the property of biodegradation doesnt depend on the resource basis of a material  it is linked to its chemical structure in other words 100 biobased plastics may be nonbiodegradable and 100 fossilbased plastics can biodegrade biobased plastics that are not biodegradable include polyethylene terephthalate polyurethanes polyamide polyethylene polyethylenefuranoate or pef is recyclable can be manufactured without fossil fuels and while not biodegradable has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to the oilbased plastic used to make water bottles celluloses combination of strength and light weight has also attracted interest from the auto industry in the ability to help cars become much lighter and therefore more fuel efficient  its flexible strong transparent nature can also make nanocellulose  an important material in helping bring bendable screens  batteries cosmetics paper pharmaceuticals optical sensors and devices to market the idea of using trees as a source of goods and products in everyday life might sound archaic but in reality weve only just tapped the surface of what the chemicals and materials theyre made of can do markus mannström from finnish renewables company stora enso said recently that we believe that everything made from fossilbased materials today can be made from a tree tomorrow as research advances trees and forests will only play a bigger role in a more sustainable future share related stories press releases texas and alabama nonprofits focused on
