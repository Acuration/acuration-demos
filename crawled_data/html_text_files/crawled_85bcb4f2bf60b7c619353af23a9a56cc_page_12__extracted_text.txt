biomass energy north yorkshire tops chart for renewable energy andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 8 april 2016 opinion a new survey from the green alliance and regen sw shows that selby in north yorkshire produces the most renewable energy of any area in england and wales as you can see drax s home tops the chart by a large margin thats because between three and four per cent of the uks electricity is generated from sustainable biomass here at drax power station weve already converted half the station to use compressed wood pellets that half of drax has reduced its carbon emissions by more than 80 per cent as a result but theres so much more drax could do to help the uk get more coal off the grid and if the green alliances next data visualization pitted renewables against fossil fuels a renewableonly drax as our countrys biggest power station would give low carbon technologies an even bigger share than would be the case today drax can not only generate more renewable power ourselves but also help solar and wind power to cope with demand as some of the older coal gas and nuclear plant retire over the coming years moving towards a balanced mix of renewables including further biomass upgrades at drax could save bill payers billions of pounds found research carried out by nera and imperial college london this was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main forms of renewable energy  wind solar and biomass the uk is already far below the european average when it comes to using wood for energy if the government made the right decision and levelled the playing field for biomass in the uk drax could help our country climb the table meet our national climate change targets more quickly and contribute to saving bill payers billions of pounds upgrading from coal to wood pellets is also ensuring drax group  which employs more than 1400 people  has a real future at the heart of the northern powerhouse however its not just for government to change the status quo  businesses have a role to play too many uk businesses have made firm commitments to limit and reduce their impact on the environment for all their use of energy is a critical area to consider and address some of the biggest electricity users such as thames water and manchester airport group are increasingly demanding renewable electricity drax groups haven power is proud to offer the only 100 guaranteed renewable electricity product in the market to businesses big and small perhaps thats what the green alliances next index could investigate  which businesses have taken practical steps towards a renewable future tags yorkshire  electricity generation  drax power station  biomass energy renewables better together andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 5 april 2016 opinion theres more pressure than ever to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation and no one is keener than the team here at drax power station to make it happen in fact weve been doing it for a decade but we need the right support to finish the job we upgraded our turbines between 200712 to save one million tonnes of co2 emissions weve converted half our station to run on compressed wood pellets instead of coal  reducing emissions by up to 86 per cent  our friends in the north of england have invested millions of pounds to help us make that happen through building new infrastructure at our landing and loading facilities at the port of tyne  the new port at liverpool  at hull and at immingham  weve designed and commissioned our own rolling stock with lloyds register rail to ensure that the compressed wood pellets can be transported to the power station in the most energyefficient way possible and while many jobs in the north of england are being lost with the planned closure of a number of older coalfired power stations we continue to employ over a thousand people directly here in north yorkshire in fact its no exaggeration to say that drax is a genuine northern powerhouse to borrow a phrase from the chancellor of the exchequer which is why we hope he and his colleagues in government will listen when we say that were seriously concerned that the planned auctions for new green energy could result in bill payers missing out on savings of over 2 billion the government has committed to three further renewable energy auctions that will happen over the next few years the first of them is already planned for later in 2016 as far as we know those auctions will only be open to offshore wind and perhaps also something being referred to as less established technologies but independent research published by nera and imperial college london suggests that a single technology approach could waste a significant amount of money the research was commissioned by drax to establish the true cost of the main renewable energy technologies  wind solar and biomass as a result economists conclude that hard working families and businesses could enjoy significant savings if these auctions were opened up to include other renewables but the sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow this makes wind and solar intermittent energy technologies backup power is needed when the weathers not right or when demand is high naturally this standby energy isnt free someone has to pay for it but those additional costs are not currently included in the way that the government calculates how much support the different kinds of renewable energy require and the iclnera research shows that when the true costs are added in offshore wind is actually the most expensive form of renewable energy the affordable solution is to convert existing power stations to use compressed wood pellets in place of coal  this balanced approach also allows more offshore wind and solar onto our electricity network without the need for more fossil fuels to provide overall reliability more biomass conversions can also help the uk end coal by energy secretary amber rudds 2025 target date  thats what we mean when we say drax needs the right support to finish the job were asking the government to consider the true cost of bringing new renewable capacity on stream and then to add sustainable biomass to the auctions for new contracts that decision could save bill payers up to 2bn  it could safeguard thousands of direct and indirect jobs in yorkshire and the north of england and it will give our country the reliable renewable power we need when others just cant deliver it tags decarbonisation  transport  ships and shipping  biomass energy the true cost of replacing coalfired electricity generation dorothy thompson 20052017 chief executive drax group 17 february 2016 opinion to make up for these closures the government is already planning to bring on new capacity a new gasfired power station will open at carrington this summer and were expecting to hear any day now that another nuclear power station will be created at hinkley point and of course more electricity from renewables must be added over the years ahead as we look to meet our go green targets in fact the government already has a plan in place to award contracts for new green energy off the back of three auctions over the next four years the first of them is due later this year drax understands that every one of those auctions is focused on offshore wind however new independent research published by nera economic consulting and imperial college london questions that single technology approach commissioned by drax group plc from leading economists the research reveals the true cost of the main forms of renewable energy  wind solar and biomass and the evidence shows that opening up these auctions to include other renewables could result in significant savings that could be passed on to consumers where could these savings come from renewables like wind and solar are vital but they are by their very nature intermittent that means other forms of power generation need to be available on standby at very short notice to meet the gap between supply and demand the costs of providing this standby electricity are passed on to consumers in their energy bills but crucially they are not reflected in how the government ranks the support that each type of renewable energy requires essentially the costs are hidden the neraicl research shows that if these hidden costs are added in the true picture is very different when the true costs are taken into account the governments preferred option  offshore wind  turns out to be the most expensive in fact the cheapest option is deploying new technology to existing power stations enabling them to use biomass  essentially replacing coal with compressed wood pellets all in all getting cheaper renewables into the mix could save consumers up to 22bn how support for renewables is already funded through a portion of your energy bill and bringing in a more costeffective mix reduces the support needed that is why we at drax are urging the government to look at the true costs of new renewable capacity and include us in the mix for new power contracts to do so would not only lead to a potential 2bn saving for consumers but replacing more coal with biomass gives the uk that reliable standby power we know we will need when other renewables cant deliver it using the latest technology weve already upgraded half of our power station to run on compressed wood pellets the jobs not done with the right support we want to carry on with the work were doing and help the government to achieve its target of getting coal off the system by 2025 tags gas  coal  energy policy  biomass energy how to plug the electricity gap andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 26 january 2016 opinion by 2025 the uk will face a 4055 per cent gap between electricity supply and demand according to a report from the institute of mechanical engineers  the government has disputed imeches projection but its own forecasting suggests that uk electricity demand will be 19 higher in 2035 vs 2015  the alleged 2025 gap will be caused by the closure of coalfired power stations to meet targets for carbon reduction according to the imeche current plans to plug the gap by building new gasfired capacity are unrealistic it would require a staggering 30 new power stations to be planned and built from scratch within the next 10 years at drax we have already developed a solution we can do it quickly cheaply and safely in fact it would drastically reduce the time and money involved in building all of those 30 new gas power stations from scratch weve already adapted three of our coalfired generating units to use highdensity pellets made from compressed lowgrade wood and were using worldbeating technology developed by our own engineers here in the uk to do it in all around four or five per cent of the uks entire electricity needs every single day of the year are already being met thanks to our unique biomass technology at drax its an approach that could be adopted elsewhere in the country providing a huge contribution to plugging the electricity gap our highdensity compressed wood pellets are the only nonfossil fuel that can bring about these changes in the time we have left given the right support within two or three years we could convert the remaining three units at drax power station to run on biomass wood pellets with all six units converted plus lynemouth power station  which already has that future secured  and one or two other smaller biomass power stations around 10 per cent of the uks electricity could be generated using this technology well before 2025  long before new gasfired capacity could come on stream the costs involved would be dramatically lower too we invested around 650 million to convert three generating units develop a supply chain and build new storage at drax it is estimated that the equivalent in new combined cycle gas turbine power stations would cost more as it would be new rather than repurposed infrastructure energy hierarchy the imeche has developed an energy hierarchy listing five sustainabilityrelated priorities against which to judge any future energy strategy the two that focus on energy generation are a perfect fit in terms of coaltobiomass conversions at drax and lynemouth priority 3  utilisation of renewable sustainable resources high density compressed wood pellets are made from lowgrade wood sourced according to the highest levels of forestry conservation priority 5  utilisation of conventional resources as we do now using worldleading engineering skills and avoiding the need to build brand new power stations our coal units can be converted without the need for new national grid connections many of our european neighbours such as sweden and germany already use a far higher proportion of biomass to meet their energy needs catching up with the european average is the simplest quickest and most affordable way to avoid a shortfall between supply and demand predicted by 2015 tags technology  drax power station  biomass energy rethinking the uks future energy mix andy koss ceo generation until april 2020 13 january 2016 opinion since the climate change summit in paris theres been a lot of talk about how we can remove coal from the energy mix in the uk and limit further climate change one way would be to close down all the coalfired power stations but coal still provides more than 20 per cent of the uks electricity and the department for energy and climate change decc predicts we will need almost 20 more electricity by 2035  not less chart below whats more building new capacity to replace those power stations would take years while buying in extra supplies of energy at short notice can mean extra costs being passed on to customers the good news is that at drax weve already developed a solution to the challenge as i told the yorkshire post recently  were doing it by converting our coalfired generating units to use compressed wood pellets and were using worldbeating technology developed by our own engineers here in the uk in fact were now producing more electricity from wood pellets than from coal at drax and were doing it day in day out in all around four per cent of the uks entire electricity needs every single day of the year are now being met thanks to our unique biomass technology at drax this enables us to take lowgrade wood and compress it into small highdensity pellets to use in our specially adapted generating units even including a minimal quantity of carbon emissions in the supply chain conversions still cut greenhouse gases by over 80 compared to coal  if we can get the support to convert the other three generating units at the power station then well cease using coal at drax this would help the governments proposed target date of ending unabated coal electricity generation in the uk by 2025  i think at a very high level that support is there we all know that wind and solar energy have the potential to take a bigger role in britains energy mix but to do so they need to be accompanied by another technology that can be turned up to fill gaps when the weather means they produce less energy than required our highdensity wood pellets are the only nonfossil fuel that can do this looking to the future as wind and solar grow and britain becomes more dependent on them it will be ever more important to have this reliable renewable support on hand were well behind our european neighbours in using wood pellets for energy  and a long way behind countries like germany and sweden taking steps to catch up with the european average is the fastest most affordable and most reliable way to move away from coal to the renewable fuels of the future to take those steps energy companies like drax and the government need more dialogue tags biomass energy  energy policy  wind power  coal  1  7 8 9
