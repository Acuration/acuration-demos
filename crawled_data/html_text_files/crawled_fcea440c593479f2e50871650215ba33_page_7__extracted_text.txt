archives press release drax group ceo responds to the us doe national renewable energy lab report 2 september 2022 press releases this week saw some very significant policy progress for beccs in the us with the national renewable energy laboratory overseen by the us department of energy publishing a new study that highlighted the supply side options required to deliver president bidens goal of 100 clean electricity by 2035 with regards beccs the study said by 2035 the us will need 100mt of negative emissions from beccs to offset remaining positive carbon emissions in the power sector the doe confirms its view that beccs is woody biomass with postcombustion ccs  the model that drax has led the world in developing it states beccs results in a net negative emissions rate because carbon from the atmosphere is captured during photosynthesis and then sequestered after combustion to get to 100 clean electricity by 2035 deployment of beccs must start by 2026 and the installed capacity range must be between 7 and 14gw they believe that 714gw of beccs can offset 250375gw of fossil fuel because it acts as a capacity multiplier they believe there is 105 million dry tonnes of sustainable woody biomass fibre available per year to be mobilised in the constrained scenario beccs deploys ahead of dac highlighting it is viewed as the most efficient and effective form of ccs responding to the findings will gardiner drax group ceo said the evidence couldnt be any clearer  only through deploying beccs at scale can the united states cut its carbon emissions while simultaneously benefitting from reliable homegrown renewable power to strengthen its energy independence beccs is vital because it can produce reliable renewable power whilst also permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  no other technology does both drax is the worlds leader in developing power beccs having been the first company in the world to capture carbon dioxide from purely biomass combustion we have been making very encouraging progress towards in delivering beccs in north america and progressing with site selection government engagement and technology development with the right support from governments such as the increase in the level of support for carbon removal projects in the inflation reduction act we stand ready to invest billions in deploying beccs at scale across the globe to cut carbon emissions and generate renewable power for millions of homes and businesses ends background drax is the world leader in developing power beccs having been the first to capture carbon dioxide from a 100 biomass feedstock postcombustion  the company is currently progressing plans to build the worlds largest power in carbon capture and storage project at its uk plant in north yorkshire once scaledup the beccs project in the uk could capture and store eight million tonnes of co2 each year across the globe the company plans to deliver at least four million tonnes of

mumbycroft mp member of parliament for scunthorpe said i was delighted to hear that drax and british steel had reached this agreement its some really positive news for scunthorpe ive long said that we should be using british steel in british infrastructure projects not only because we should be supporting our local businesses but because its also the best i look forward to seeing the outcome of this partnership and the benefits it will bring to scunthorpe protecting jobs and supporting energy security if the uk government gives more clarity this summer on the process for beccs power projects to move forward within its ccs cluster programme draxs beccs project could capture 8 million tonnes of co 2 a year from 2030 making it the largest carbon capture and storage project in the world it will also act as an anchor project for the east coast cluster a consortium of zero carbon humber and net zero teesside which combined account for more than half of the uks industrial emissions the uk steel industry has played a pivotal role in the northern communities in which it operates supporting thousands of jobs in both scunthorpe and teesside large infrastructure projects like draxs beccs

cruachan pumped storage hydro plant in scotland would mean more excess renewable power could be stored and made available when required cutting costs and carbon emissions the cost of turning off uk wind farms to manage the electricity system rose from almost 300m during 2020 to over 500m in 2021 contributing to higher energy bills and carbon emissions according to a new report costs increased substantially because the system relied on expensive gas power to manage periods when wind power was curtailed as not enough electricity storage was available to prevent the excess renewable power from wind farms going to waste the independent report by lane clark  peacock lcp commissioned by renewable energy leader drax found that over the last two years curtailing wind power added 806m to energy bills in britain rising gas prices made the practice more expensive as gas power stations were increasingly used to support the system when wind power was curtailed click to viewdownload despite the growing need for more homegrown renewable power generation from wind farms to support energy security enough renewable power to supply 800000 uk homes went to waste in 2020 and 2021 as wind farms were routinely asked to switch off by the electricity system operator click to viewdownload this happened as a result of constraints in the transmission system and a lack of longduration storage capacity which is needed to manage periods when renewable power generation outstrips demand britain is a world leader in wind power with capacity increasing from 54gw in 2010 to 257gw in 2021  wind turbines now have the capacity to provide enough renewable power for almost 20 million homes but without any new longduration storage projects built for almost 40 years in the uk the only way to manage the imbalance when generation outstrips demand and prevent damage to the electricity grid is to curtail wind power  a practice which could be significantly reduced if more energy storage was available and with gas power stations overwhelmingly called upon to plug the gaps in supply when wind was constrained due to transmission issues there was an environmental cost an extra two million tonnes of co 2 was emitted during 2020 and 2021 as a result of gas being used to replace curtailed wind power equivalent to putting almost half a million more cars on britains roads chris matson from lcp said increasing the output from wind power is essential for the uk to achieve its climate targets and ensure energy security and yet because investment in the infrastructure needed to support this expansion has not kept pace wind curtailment is costing the consumer and the environment every pound spent on curtailing wind power is a pound wasted find out more about cruachan 2 here  drax has recently submitted an application to construct and operate a new underground pumped storage hydro power station at its existing cruachan facility in scotland the 600 mw plant will be located in one of the most constrained transmission areas and will play a crucial role in supporting more wind power to come online to reduce energy bills and carbon emissions penny small draxs group generation director said penny small drax group generation director this report underlines the need for a new regulatory framework to encourage private investment in longduration storage technologies the uk is a worldleader in offshore wind but for the countrys green energy ambitions to be realised we need the right energy storage infrastructure to support this vital technology make the system secure and reduce costs draxs plan to expand cruachan will strengthen uk energy security by enabling more homegrown renewable electricity to power british homes and businesses reducing system costs and cutting carbon emissions longduration storage projects have been left in limbo in recent years without an updated policy and market support mechanism from the uk government the lack of a framework for these technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects with no new plants built anywhere in the uk since 1984 despite their critical role in decarbonisation ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes a copy of the  renewable curtailment and the role of long duration storage report can be found here  the report defines consumer costs of curtailing wind as the cost of turning wind plant down bid costs the consumer benefit arising from the nonpayment of lowcarbon support payments to curtailed wind plant and the cost of paying generation to turnup offer costs to replace the lost wind generation of the 806m cost to consumers from wind curtailment in 2020 and 2021 82 663m was from curtailing wind in scotland  underlining the need for flexible technologies in scotland specifically in may drax applied for consent to build a new 600mw pumped storage hydro plant at its existing cruachan facility in argyll scotland the new power station could be operation in 2030 with construction work getting underway in 2024 it will be a major infrastructure project which will remove of around 2 million tonnes of rock from inside the mountain to create a cavern and tunnels with around 900 jobs created during its construction and across the supply chain longduration electricity storage can be defined as technologies that are able to respond to supply and demand variations caused by daily peaks weather events and seasonal patterns providing power for more than four hours at their full capacity the uk governments 2021 smart systems and flexibility plan recognised longduration storage as essential for achieving net zero the government held a call for evidence to hear the
