Press Release
Drax given green light for new £500 million underground pumped storage hydro plant
25 July 2023
Press releases

Scotland’s First Minister Humza Yousaf called on the UK Government to “provide an appropriate market mechanism” for projects such as Cruachan’s expansion while on a tour of the facility today (Tuesday).

The Scottish Government has formally approved plans to expand the iconic ‘Hollow Mountain’ Cruachan Power Station through building a new underground plant at the site.

The new plant would strengthen UK energy security with flexible generation while enabling more wind power to come online.

With the right support from the UK Government, the new plant could be operational as soon as 2030, with almost 1,000 jobs created and supported during development.

Renewable energy leader Drax Group has secured development consent from the Scottish Government for its ground-breaking plans to build a new c.£500m underground pumped storage hydro plant at its existing Cruachan facility in Argyll. The decision, made through the
Section 36
process, is a significant moment in Scotland’s journey to net zero, with new long-duration storage plants critical to enabling more wind and solar power to come online in the next decade.

Scotland’s First Minister Humza Yousaf visited Drax’s iconic power station on the shores of Loch Awe today (Tuesday), where he underlined his call for the UK Government “to provide an appropriate market mechanism for hydro power and other long duration energy storage technologies.” Mr Yousaf recently
wrote
to the Prime Minister urging him to take action so developers can have the certainty required to build a new generation of pumped storage hydro plants.

The new 600 MW plant at Cruachan is part of a wider £7 billion strategic investment plan by Drax in clean energy technologies between 2024 and 2030, such as long duration storage and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), which tackle climate change and enhance national energy security. Constructed adjacent to the existing underground facility, the plant would effectively more than double the site’s total generation capacity to over 1 GW.

Growing the UK’s pumped storage hydro capacity is crucial to integrating more wind and solar power onto the energy grid, enhancing the nation’s energy security while tackling climate change. Pumped storage plants act like giant water batteries by using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from sources such as wind farms when supply outstrips demand. These same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when the country needs it.

Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“This is a major milestone in Drax’s plans to build Britain’s first new pumped storage hydro plant in a generation.
“These plants play a critical role in stabilising the electricity system, helping to balance supply and demand through storing excess power from the national grid. When Scotland’s wind turbines are generating more power than we need, Cruachan steps in to store the renewable electricity so it doesn’t go to waste.
“With the right support from the UK Government, Drax will invest c.£500m to more than double Cruachan’s generating capacity and support almost 1,000 jobs across the supply chain during construction.”
The expansion of Cruachan requires an updated financial stabilisation mechanism from the UK Government. The current absence of a framework for large-scale, long-duration storage technologies has resulted in no new plants being constructed in the UK since 1984, despite their critical role in the decarbonisation process.

First Minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf, said:
“I’m delighted to visit Cruachan today to hear more about the plans to grow Scotland’s pumped storage hydro capacity through the expansion of the existing facility in Argyll.
“Hydro power has real potential to play a greater role in our transition to net zero, and to help ensure a resilient and secure electricity supply across the UK. The expansion of Cruachan will help to strengthen our energy security by providing much needed resilience in the system, supporting hundreds of jobs and providing a real boost to the Scottish economy.
“However, we know that there remain a number of challenges in developing new hydro power projects in Scotland. The Scottish Government will continue to urge the UK government to provide an appropriate market mechanism for hydro power and other long duration energy storage technologies, to ensure that the potential for hydro power is fully realised.”
Drax acquired Cruachan alongside the Galloway and Lanark hydro schemes in 2019, helping to make the company a leading provider of flexible, renewable power generation.

Editor’s Notes:

Drax
applied for development consent
from the Scottish Government under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 in May 2022.

The UK Government has
pledged
to introduce a new policy and market support framework to enable private investment in large-scale, long-duration storage projects by 2024.

A report by
KPMG
for Drax found that a Cap & Floor regime was the standout solution to unlock private investment in the technology while incentivising system needs to be met efficiently.

No investment decision has yet been taken by Drax and development remains subject to an appropriate regulatory framework among other considerations.

About Drax


Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030, using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology.

Drax’s around 3,000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity – electricity generation, electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties.
For more information visit

Drax Power Station contributes over £350m to the economy of Yorkshire and the Humber
18 July 2023
Press releases

New research by leading consultancy, Oxford Economics,
The Economic Impact of Drax Power Station in the UK
, demonstrates the key role the power station plays in the economies of Selby and Ainsty, Yorkshire and the Humber and the UK.
The report, utilising data from 2021, shows that the North Yorkshire site, including its supply chain, contributed £735m to UK GDP. It also supported 7,130 jobs across the country and delivered a total contribution of £154m in taxes to the UK.
The research also found that in the constituency of Selby and Ainsty, 901 people were directly employed by the power station, a further 290 jobs were supported and it contributed £278m to local GDP.
Across Yorkshire and the Humber, the combined impact of Drax Power Station was £358m with 2,580 jobs supported.
The power station is the largest dispatchable renewable power station in the UK and across its four biomass units it can supply enough power for the equivalent of five million homes. In March this year, almost 50 years of coal generation ended at Drax Power Station.
Between October 2021 and 2022, Drax Group generated 11% of the UK’s renewable electricity. In addition, the business produced on average 19% of the UK’s renewables at times of peak demand and up to 70% on certain days.
Richard Gwilliam, Chair of the Humber Energy Board and UK BECCS Programme Director at Drax Group, said:
“This research underscores the critical role that Drax Power Station plays regionally and nationally. In Yorkshire and the Humber, our power station has created thousands of jobs and contributed hundreds of millions of pounds to its GDP while helping maintain energy security.
“We have been generating power at our North Yorkshire site for nearly 50 years and, providing we get the right support from the UK Government for our bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) plans, we could be doing the same for another 50.”
James Bedford, Senior Economist, Oxford Economics, said:
“Our research demonstrates the significant contribution that Drax Power Station makes to the UK economy and Yorkshire and the Humber.
“In 2021, it supported a £358 million contribution to GDP in the region and over 2,500 jobs. Much of this was within the constituency of Selby and Ainsty, where it supported a £278 million contribution to GDP, equivalent to 12% of the local economy.”
BECCS is the only technology that can deliver reliable, secure and renewable power while permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Providing Drax gets the right support from the UK Government, the company plans to build two BECCS units at Drax Power Station by 2030 which could remove 8Mt of CO
2
from the atmosphere per year.
The development of BECCS at the Selby power station could see up to 10,000 jobs created and supported at the project’s peak, help maintain energy security and help meet the UK’s legally binding Net Zero targets.

Drax Foundation pledges £1.5m to help UK schools save energy and reduce their carbon footprint
17 July 2023
Press releases

The firm, which owns Drax Power Station near Selby, established the Drax Foundation earlier this year to provide grant funding to non-profit organisations in the regions where it operates.

The installation of energy-efficient LED lighting initiative is currently being piloted at the following five schools local to Drax’s operations in England:

Barwic Parade Community Primary School in Selby

Kirk Sandall Junior School in Doncaster

Selby Abbey Primary School

Triangle Primary School in Sowerby Bridge

Great Clacton Junior School in Clacton-on-Sea

It is estimated that these schools will save on average £8,600 per year from reduced energy bills, which can then be reinvested back into the school and children’s education.

The full rollout of the LED lighting and solar panel schemes and energy saving and education programme is planned for later this year, with a focus on rural communities and areas of low social mobility, particularly in and around the communities where Drax operates. Schools wishing to submit an expression of interest should contact
[email protected]


Will Gardiner, CEO Drax Group, said:
“The Drax Foundation is committed to giving back to the communities where we operate, and the new initiative will provide schools with practical, tangible ways to save money and reduce their carbon footprint. It’s important that children start thinking about these issues from a young age as energy usage and its impact is set to become an increasingly relevant topic in their future.”

Kathy Thompson, Executive Headteacher at Kirk Sandall Junior School, said:
“It’s so important that businesses support their communities and this initiative by the Drax Foundation is a really great way to help us save money, especially at the moment when energy costs and prices in general are so high. It also teaches pupils about the impact we have on our environment and how we can act responsibly to save energy.”

The
Drax Foundation
was launched in March this year to award  grants of up to £50,000 for established non-profit organizations.

Dunbeg Primary School pupuls visit iconic ‘Hollow Mountain’ Cruachan Power Station
4 July 2023
Press releases

18 pupils from the primary one class spent time in the exhibition and kids’ zone before travelling by bus 1km underground to the viewing gallery that looks out onto the huge machine hall which houses the four turbines.
Cruachan is an underground pumped hydro storage power station built in a hollowed-out cavern 1km inside Ben Cruachan – Argyll and Bute’s highest mountain. Constructed in 1965, its reversible turbines are still at the cutting edge of energy storage technology, enabling the plant to act like a giant water battery.
Its turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases. This process helps stop wind farms being paid to turn off when they are generating excess power, helping Scotland to be greener whilst cutting household energy bills.
Pupils and teacher from Dunbeg Primary School at the Cruachan Visitor Centre
Sarah Cameron, Drax’s Scotland Community Manager, said:
“We work closely with schools to inspire the next generation to study STEM subjects and these visits can make such an impact on children’s understanding of what a career in STEM can be. Often a visit to Cruachan as a child can be a lifelong memory for some people. During this particular visit, 6-year-old Archie told me he will be back because he is going to work here when he’s older which is brilliant to hear.”
When all four of its generating units are operating at maximum capacity, the plant can supply enough flexible, renewable power for around 800,000 homes.
Dunbeg Primary School children were the latest of over 200 young visitors that Cruachan has welcomed so far this year as part of Drax Group’s initiatives to encourage young people to study STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects, boosting skills across the region.
Tours at Cruachan are free to all primary and secondary schools and can be tailored to suit the area of the curriculum teachers are interested in.

Drax runs a number of other initiatives to support STEM education and skills in Scotland, including:
Work experience placements

Free virtual tours
Grant funding for STEM education and skills development through the Drax Foundation
Pumped storage hydro plants act like giant water batteries, using reversible turbines to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir which stores excess power from wind farms and other low carbon technologies when supply outstrips demand. These same turbines are then reversed to bring the stored water back through the plant to generate power when it is needed.
In May 2022, Drax
submitted the planning application
to build a new underground pumped hydro storage power station at Cruachan which will more than double the site’s electricity generating capacity.
The new 600-megawatt (MW) power station will be located inside Ben Cruachan – Argyll’s highest mountain – and increase the site’s total capacity to 1 gigawatt (GW).
In order to deploy this critical technology, Drax must secure consent from the Scottish Government alongside an updated policy and market support mechanism from the UK Government.
The existing lack of an appropriate framework for new long-duration, large-scale electricity storage technologies means that private investment cannot currently be secured in new pumped storage hydro projects, with no new plants built anywhere in the UK since 1984 despite their critical role in security of supply and decarbonisation.

Ross McKenzie, Drax’s Interim Group Director of Corporate Affairs, said:
“This announcement positions the UK as the potential home of one of the largest compliance markets for carbon removals in the world and we are delighted that the Government intends to include engineered Greenhouse Gas Removals (GGRs) in the UK ETS.
“The development of such a market is an important step towards deploying large-scale carbon removal technologies such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). These technologies are essential in the fight against climate change as they permanently remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they emit.
“With the right support from the UK Government, Drax plans to invest billions into delivering BECCS at our power station in North Yorkshire. This would enable the plant to simultaneously remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere whilst also strengthening UK energy security through generating reliable, renewable power when the wind isn’t blowing, or the sun is not shining.”

Government backs carbon capture pilot at Drax’s CCUS incubation site
29 June 2023
Press releases

The new carbon capture project, Project MONET, will test metal-organic frameworks (MOF) based Negative Emissions Technology. The project was awarded support from DESNZ through Call 2 of the Department’s CCUS Innovation 2.0 competition, which aims to accelerate the development of next generation CCUS technology.
Drax has a strong relationship with Promethean and in 2022 collaborated with the company at the North Yorkshire incubation site to test MOF-based carbon capture.
Drax’s incubation site has also previously hosted a carbon capture project by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Leeds-based company C-Capture. Drax plans to use MHI’s carbon capture technology for its bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) power plants, including its proposals to develop two BECCS units at Drax Power Station.
Jason Shipstone, Chief Innovation Officer, Drax Group, said:
“Congratulations to all at Promethean Particles and Project MONET on securing this award from DESNZ. We have a strong relationship with Promethean and we are pleased to continue to support their work at our CCUS incubation site at Drax Power Station.
“Scientific consensus is increasingly clear – the planet cannot solve the climate crisis without carbon removals. Providing we secure the right support from the UK Government, our ambition is to harness what we have learned piloting carbon removals technologies in North Yorkshire and create two BECCS units at Drax Power Station which could remove 8Mt of CO
2
per annum from our atmosphere.
“We are excited by the opportunities for MOF-based carbon capture and this new project will help us better understand the performance and future applications for the technology. MOFs have the potential to be deployed to help decarbonise Drax’s supply chain and contribute to our mission of enabling a zero carbon, lower cost, energy future.”
James Stephenson, Chief Executive Officer of Promethean, said:
“We are extremely proud that project MONET has been chosen by DESNZ as one of the winners of this competition. Carbon removal is now a necessity in limiting the devastating effects of climate change. MOF-based carbon capture can help enable broader adoption of this critical technology.
“Our manufacturing technology uniquely enables the production of these exciting materials at the scale and cost necessary to make them a viable industrial solution. I would like to thank the Drax team for their continued support of our technological advancement. The incubation area is a huge help in the application development of MOF-based CCS systems.”

Drax welcomes CCC’s call for faster progress in delivering UK carbon removals and confirms decommissioning of coal units will continue
28 June 2023
Press releases

Drax welcomes Climate Change Committee report which argues for greater pace from the UK Government on delivering Net Zero targets and more progress on delivering carbon removals technology.
The company has also confirmed that the decommissioning of its coal units at Drax Power Station (DPS) will continue and they will not be available this winter.
Drax Group (Drax), the renewable energy business, today welcomes the Climate Change Committee’s (CCC) report, Progress in Reducing UK Emissions – 2023, and its recommendation that if Government wants to deliver on its climate targets it must deliver specific policy which supports the development of carbon removals projects in this country.
In 2022, Drax provided around 11% of the UK’s renewable energy and it plays a vital role in maintaining the country’s energy security.
Drax’s ambition is to invest billions in carbon removal projects in the UK and the US through game-changing technology – bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).
Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner, said:
“The CCC’s report is welcome as it is a holistic view of the scale of the challenge facing us all in reaching Net Zero, as well as acknowledging the vital role that carbon removals technologies like BECCS will play in getting us there. We support its recommendation that faster progress is needed to reach the UK’s ambitious carbon removals targets.
“With the right support from the UK Government, we plan to invest billions into delivering BECCS at our power station in Yorkshire. Our formal discussions with the UK Government on BECCS deployment and parallel discussions about a ‘bridging mechanism’ to support the transition to BECCS have been productive and we are looking forward to continuing these in the coming months.
“We also await the publication of the UK Government’s biomass strategy, which we hope will reinforce the critical role that BECCS will play in energy security and decarbonisation, as well as timelines for the deployment of initial BECCS projects in the UK.”
The company has also confirmed today that the decommissioning of its two remaining coal units at Drax Power Station will continue and that they will not be available to generate power this winter.
This confirmation follows a recent request by National Grid ESO to explore the possibility of extending coal generation at Drax Power Station but concluded that due to a combination of technical, maintenance and staffing reasons, the extension of coal over this winter was not possible.
The company first announced in April this year that after almost 50 years of coal power generation at Drax Power Station, its coal units would close.
