accustomed to using electricity we rarely think of the journey it takes from power station to plug in fact electricity must travel across a network of cables wires and substations before it makes it from the power stations generating it to the homes and businesses using it  at drax power station which supplies 16 of great britains renewable power theres another journey that takes place even before the electricity leaves the power station this journey  the journey of more than half of the compressed wood pellet fuel drax uses to generate electricity  has its origins in the expanse of forestland in the southern usa from forest to fuel the journey starts in the huge working forests of the southern states of the usa where low value wood  such as the thinnings cleared as part of a forests growing cycle  is collected in a responsible and sustainable way to make high density wood pellets which drax power station uses to produce more than 60 of its electricity drax groups own pellet manufacturer drax biomass  produces around 15 of the power stations renewable fuel after pelletisation locally at its amite and morehouse facilities located in louisiana and mississippi respectively the biomass is transported to drax transit at the port of greater baton rouge on the mississippi river from morehouse trains made up of closedtop grain cars each capable of carrying 120 tonnes transport the pellets 221 miles to baton rouge at amite just 60 miles from baton rouge fuelefficient trucks carry 25tonne loads between plant and port once at the port the truck and train cargoes are unloaded into one of two biomass storage domes  each holding 40000 tonnes of biomass  before being loaded into the ships for their transatlantic journey from port to port drax uses a range of ships to carry the pellets on their 8000mile journey to the uk ranging from big coastal ships capable of hauling 20000 tonnes to truly massive panamax ships more than a quarter of a kilometre in length and capable of carrying up to 80000 tonnes the ships leave the port and spend 24 hours travelling the 200 miles down the mississippi river into the gulf of mexico around florida and into the atlantic from here its a 19day voyage to reach ports in the uk to put that into perspective it took columbus more than two months to make his first trip across the atlantic the ships pull into ports in tyne hull immingham and liverpool where they are unloaded at the bespoke biomass port facility at peel ports in liverpool an archimedean screw removes the pellets from the ships holds and transports them onto a conveyer belt which loads them onto trains these four ports can process up to 12 million tonnes of biomass every year combined from port to power station like the stateside journey drax uses trains to carry its cargo from port to power plant the difference on the uk side however is that the uk trains were designed specifically to carry biomass wood pellets  clever design and engineering was used to maximise the space inside each carriage and ensure the trains carry large loads despite uk rail restrictions these trains carry the pellets across the country and even over the pennines for trains coming from liverpool to drax power station in selby north yorkshire roughly 14 trains arrive at the plant every day and collectively unload about 20000 tonnes of pellets every day from monday to saturday a system of conveyor belts carry these pellets to one of draxs four giant biomass storage domes  each capable of housing about 80000 tonnes of pellets then when needed the conveyor system takes the pellets on their final journey into the furnace the pellets are combusted which boils water to create steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which then feeds electricity to the national grid the electricity travels across miles of cables and wires  through substations and transformers and finally into your power socket long journey low emissions despite the number of miles travelled the journey of biomass is tracked and managed to ensure the drax power station supply chain is as lowcarbon as possible  the result is that even with all supply chain emissions considered the power generated has a carbon emissions profile that is more than 80 lower than coal it might be one of the most impressive supply chains involved in powering this island  but its not the only one to travel thousands of miles the journey of biomass to england joins liquefied natural gas lng shipped from the middle east coal from colombia and solar panels manufactured in

shareholders drax today announces a new dividend policy drax expects to pay a growing dividend consistent with maintaining its credit rating and investing in its business drax expects to recommend a dividend of 50m with regards to the 2017 financial year the board is confident that this dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow from this level as the implementation of the strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flow in determining the rate of growth in dividends the board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the groups commoditybased businesses if there is a buildup of capital in excess of the groups investment needs the board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders dorothy thompson said britains energy market is changing drax has embraced these changes with a strategy which will help change the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future through our operations in retail generation and biomass supply we expect to deliver a significant increase in high quality visible contracted earnings for the group with the optimisation of our

appliances to one another allowing them to collect data and become smart presents an exciting view of the modern home or workspace the future iotenabled office or household is one with autonomous appliances remoteoperated thermostats and fridges that monitor their contents and reorder supplies when they run low you may never go hungry again theres arguably an even brighter future for the iots potential in industry  it can bring about value through applications like predictive maintenance and performance optimisation on paper these two scenarios  that of industrial optimisation and convenience throughout our daily lives  might seem worlds away but james robbins chief information officer at drax is thinking about how to bring them together  particularly when it comes to energy use central to the approach is a question could a better understanding of how households and businesses use energy change how its generated and provided the importance of data at its heart the iot is about data what data you collect and how you use it determines what value you can create says robbins he explains whether youre talking about the iot big data artificial intelligence ai or robotics  theyre all the modernisation of information collection and use and nowhere is this more applicable than at a largescale power station  at drax were used to managing whats basically our own private iot in the station he explains the realtime control systems we have for the generators and the grid are essentially a bunch of sensors tied to a central network these sensors collect data from the power station which then help optimise it for better performance the same approach to data collection can have benefits for bill payers too tracking energy use in the workspace and home connected devices like smart meters can bring a precise level of insight into energy usage in the home and places of work which can benefit both end users and suppliers of heat and power electricity generators and heating fuel suppliers can use this data to better manage their output by being able to predict how and when it will be required for end users it can help them and their energy suppliers more accurately track what they use where they use it and how they could use it more efficiently for example using iot technology a gas or wood pellet for heat supplier may be able to identify that a home can make substantial cost savings just by turning down their heating by one degree sensors and smart technology can give us that insight says robbins this level of optimisation is already possible to a degree using existing tools but robbins sees a future with greater possibilities for example with comprehensive datasets suppliers can compare business owners energy use with others in the same sector and region to highlight efficiencies the whole thing is about making it easier for us to serve the customer says robbins and the better the dataset the more exotic the services could be just looking at meters means we can only really talk to the bill payer but who else in the home or workplace could we engage with to get them to conserve energy for instance we could develop a game for child in the house thats linked to energy use where they get points for turning off lights or turning down heating he explains the gamification of energy use is  at this stage  just an idea robbins says but it is exactly the kind of thing that better data allows energy suppliers and generators to think about a challenging journey but an exciting one the iot approach to energy generation and use wont be without its challenges  security being one major concern but there will also be substantial technical and standardisation issues any provider keen to leverage iot must tackle to make it a truly effective technology in the 80s you couldnt play a vhs cassette in a betamax player robbins explains the compatibility issue with iot could be an even bigger problem  all these gadgets need to be built into an architecture that can handle them and make them work together consider the socalled smart meter that provides data for a customers itemised bill the bill payer is told that a tumble dryer in their home is using a significant proportion of the power they are paying for the problem is that their appliances and devices have not been meshed together in a way that gives the system sufficient context about the customers situation in the worstcase scenario the customer asks for a refund and switches supplier because they dont actually have a tumble dryer robbins and his team are working with drax suppliers to make sure that compatibility and context dont become a problem he aims to ensure that unintended consequences in the groups use of iot are only of the positive variety by investing in backoffice infrastructure that can use big data processing to ingest and analyse meter data down to the 10second level drax can take advantage of smart tech when it arrives in earnest its an exciting period of technological advancement  but as robbins is keen to point out its only the start itll probably only be over the next few years that we actually begin to really understand how to leverage iot data when we pass the tipping point of user adoption when that happens well be starting a very exciting journey with a clearer purpose  to spot and solve meaningful problems faced by people and businesses in context in realtime tags investors  technology batteries as big as biomass domes 24 may 2017 sustainable bioenergy renewables are playing a bigger part of our electricity mix as the uk moves towards a low carbon economy how we plug the gaps left by intermittent renewables is among the greatest challenges faced by the energy sector sources like wind and solar are intermittent  they cant generate electricity all the time when the sun doesnt shine or the wind doesnt blow they lack the fuel needed to generate power and cant feed into the grid this leaves a gap in the uks electricity supply that needs to be filled today thats done by sources like coal gas and biomass which can be dialled up and down to accommodate for the dips and peaks in generation created by changes in demand and the weather one alternative being touted as a possible solution is storage and in particular battery technology however creating batteries on a scale big enough to meet our incredible demand is a considerable challenge its a challenge that will be met in a future where giant affordable batteries are able to store solar power captured in the summer months for use in the winter but costs would have to come down at an even faster rate than they have done in recent years the challenge of building bigger batteries to demonstrate the size of this challenge consider the biomass storage domes at drax power station these effectively operate as giant energy stores with the flexible ability to quickly feed renewable fuel to the power station which generates electricity on demand our biomass domes can hold 300000 tonnes of sustainablysourced compressed wood pellets  the equivalent of 600 gwh worth of electricity currently batteries cost 350 per kwh meaning at present prices it would cost 210 billion to replace the capacity of all four of our biomass domes using battery power even if battery technology advances dramatically over the next few years that figure is only likely to fall to around 60 billion then there is the question of the ancillary services that thermal power stations provide the batteries of the future may be able to provide these vital services such as synthetic inertia shortterm reserve and reactive power but for now providing these via battery power is prohibitively expensive and in some cases best left to biomass and gas power stations we should not underestimate the challenges ahead the uks everchanging power system will need to balance more electricity generated via wind and solar with affordable solutions that are also reliable flexible and lower carbon than coal  this is why drax is developing four rapidresponse gas power stations in addition to continuing its investment in biomass generation and supply tags drax power station  energy storage  investors everything you ever wanted to know about cooling towers 17 may 2017 power generation cooling towers arent beautiful buildings in the traditional sense but its undeniable they are icons of 20 th century architecture theyre a ubiquitous part of our landscape  each one a reminder of our industrial heritage yet despite the familiarity we have with them knowledge about what a cooling tower actually does remains limited a common misconception is that they release pollution in fact what they actually release is water vapour  similar to but nowhere near as hot as the steam coming out of your kettle every morning and this probably isnt the only thing you never knew about cooling towers what does a cooling tower do as the name suggests a cooling towers primary function is to lower temperatures  specifically of water or cooling water as its known at drax power stations utilise a substantial amount of water in the generation of electricity at a thermal power plant such as drax fuel is used to heat demineralised water to turn it to high pressure steam this steam is used to spin turbines and generate electricity before being cooled by the cooling water which flows through two condensers on either side of each of the steam turbines and then returning to the boiler it is this process that the cooling towers support  and it plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of electricity generation at draxs north yorkshire site to optimise water utilisation some power stations cycle it to do this they have cooling towers of which at drax there are 12 these large towers recover the warmed water which then continues to be circulated where chemistry is permitting the warmed water about 40c is pumped into the tower and sprayed out of a set of sprinklers onto a large volume of plastic packing where it is cooled by the air naturally drawn through the tower the plastic packing provides a large surface area to help cool the water which then falls in to the large flat area at the bottom of the massive structure called the cooling tower pond as the water cools down some of it  approximately 2  escapes the top of the tower as water vapour this water vapour which is commonly mistakenly referred to as steam may be the most visible part of the process but its only a byproduct of the cooling process the majority of the water utilised by drax power station is returned back to the environment either as vapour from the top of the towers or safely discharged back to the river ouse each year about half of the water removed from the river is returned there in effect it is a huge amount of water recycling and in environmental terms  it is not a consumptive process how do you build a cooling tower the history of cooling towers as we know them today dates back to the beginning of the 20 th century when two dutch engineers were the first to build a tower using a hyperboloid shape very wide on the bottom curved in the centre and flared at the top the structure meant fewer materials were required to construct each tower it was naturally more robust and it helped draw in air and aid its flow upwards it quickly became the de facto design for towers across the world the dutch engineers tower measured 34 metres which at the time was a substantial achievement but as engineering and construction abilities progressed so too did the size of cooling towers today each of 12 towers measures 115 metres tall  big enough to fit the dome of st pauls cathedral or the whole of the statue of liberty with room to spare if scaled down to the size of an egg the concrete of each cooling tower would be the same thinness as egg shell the structures at drax are dwarfed by the cooling towers at the kalisindh power plant in rajasthan india the tallest in the world each stands an impressive 202 metres tall  twice the height of the tower housing big ben and just a touch taller than the uks joint fifth tallest skyscraper the hsbc tower at 8 canada square in londons canary wharf the industrial icon of the future todays energy mix is not what is used to be the increased use of renewables means were no longer as reliant on fossil fuels and this has an effect on cooling towers already a large proportion of the uks most prominent towers have been demolished going the same way as the coal they were once in service to but this doesnt mean cooling towers will disappear completely power stations such as drax which has upgraded four of its boilers to superheat water with sustainablysourced compressed wood pellets instead of coal the dwindling coal fleet and some gas facilities still rely on cooling towers as they continue to be part of our energy mix the cooling tower will remain an icon of electricity generation for the time being but itll be a mantle it shares with biomass domes gigantic offshore wind turbines and fielduponfield of solar panels  the icons of todays diverse energy mix view our water cooling towers

spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than just a clearer view on what is happening it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is

noncommodity exposed earnings against a background of low wholesale electricity prices the group has again delivered strong operational performance this is not something we take for granted and it remains at the core of our strategy following a comprehensive review initiated in 2015 the groups new strategy has been defined and is based on creating a more diversified earnings base that will produce higherquality returns in the long term central to this strategy drax aims to play an increasing role in the way energy is generated supplied and used for a better future we announced our new strategy to the market in december evidence of delivering on the new strategy can already be seen in the acquisition of opus energy and four projects to develop rapidresponse open cycle gas turbine ocgt generation plants and most recently we have made progress in our plans to expand our biomass pellet selfsupply capability with the provisional acquisition of a new biomass pellet plant in louisiana sustainably sourced biomass generation remains at the heart of your business and we were delighted to be able to complete the full conversion of our third biomass generating unit resulting in drax delivering 16 per cent of the uks renewable electricity biomass is the most costeffective large scale renewable and with the right policy frameworks we could become 100 renewable through the full conversion of our three remaining coal units and we could do this well before 2025 supporting the governments objective to remove unabated coal from the system through our strategy your board remain focused on optimising the value of the group as well as remaining alert to opportunities for growth the sustainable biomass we use to provide energy is at the heart of our business because this must be sustainable we always strive to ensure all our pellets comply with our policy we are well aware of the obligations we have to society and specifically the communities in which we are located as well as the wider environment we take these obligations very seriously and id like to remind you our shareholders of our guiding principles we never work in countries that lack proper regulation we never cause deforestation or forest decline we never source from areas that are officially protected or where our activities would harm endangered species we only take wood from working forests that grow back and stay as forests we require all our suppliers to pass tough screening and sustainability audits conducted by independent auditors we only source wood from countries that already have huge working forests where we provide another market for low grade material that solidwood industries such as construction and furniture manufacture arent using this year there are a larger number of
