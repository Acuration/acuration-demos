difference four years can make back in 2012 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity production was almost 600g per kwh kilowatt hour jump forward to 2016 and this has halved to make britain one of the least carbonintense power systems in the world this good news comes from electric insights  a quarterly research paper on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by imperial college london academics the latest reports key finding is just how much britains energy system has decarbonised compared to other nations here is what the data from q3 2017 tell us about great britains energy system today and how it will continue to change into the future climbing the low carbon league tables comparing the electricity mix and carbon intensity of nations producing more than 100 twh terawatt hours a year the report has established a league table that tracks the progress or regress of countries efforts it shows britains energy system has decarbonised at a greater pace than any other nation in 2012 britain was ranked 20 th  sitting midtable alongside italy and saudi arabia but in the four years following britain rocketed up to become the seventh leastcarbon intense energy system in the world in 2016 the 47 drop in carbon intensity is the biggest change of any of the countries analysed and puts britain just behind norway and sweden which have the resources to support substantial hydropower generation as well as nucleardependent france the most any other country moved was eight places  in the opposite direction to britain this was the netherlands where new coal power stations were built at a time when use of coal across england scotland and wales combined reduced by around 80 the additional coal capacity and power generated from that fuel in the netherlands led to a dramatic increase in carbon emissions a major force in helping drive britains rapid move away from coal is the carbon price floor  this currently sits at 18 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  emitted on top of just 5 per tonne in the rest of europe read the full analysis at the low carbon electricity league table and view full chart here  importing problems imports are making up an increasing amount of the uks electricity mix and in july and august they reached an alltime high of 9 the majority 60 of these imports in q3 2017 came from france while 30 was from the netherlands and 10 from ireland however while importing electricity from overseas has become crucial in helping meeting demand and maintaining a flexible grid questions remain around the practices carbon intensity france generates much of its electricity from lowcarbon nuclear sources however irish and dutch exports rely heavily on fossil fuels as a result the electricity britain imported had a 30 higher carbon intensity than that generated domestically  314 vs 245 gkwh over the last 12 months over the next five years 7 gw gigawatts of new interconnectors are planned for construction including with france norway and denmark which could increase electricity imports to provide as much as 1024 of the countrys electricity as these continue to play a bigger role in our electricity mix it is important we ensure it comes from lowercarbon sources where possible and supports the continuing decarbonisation of electricity rather than exporting emissions read two articles on the topic of interconnectors in electric insights importing electricity exporting emissions the future of britains interconnectors coal firmly relegated to the bench the nosedive of coal generation in britain since 2012 highlights just how outoffavour the carbonintensive fossil fuel has become in the energy system now it occupies a role solely as a backup to lowcarbon and renewable sources over the summer months coal generation stayed at a historic low of 19 of total electricity generation between april and august britains 14 gw of installed coal stations only produced 06 gw in an average hour this follows a year of milestones in the decline of coal most notably in april when britain saw its first day without burning any coal since 1882  but this is not to say it has disappeared completely as temperatures dropped in late summer coal was called upon to meet sudden demand on september 19 th 40 of the coal fleet was called upon to produce 57 gw on average across that day showing that even as coal capacity plummets  dropping from 28 gw in 2012 to 14 gw in 2016  it still plays a necessary role in helping meet peaks in demand whats clear however is that this role is only growing smaller and smaller as our power system continues to decarbonise and flexible energy technologies replace it read the full article here coal output bottoms out explore the data in detail by visiting

consultancy company  imperial consultants  tags electric insights  investors do electric vehicles actually reduce carbon emissions 19 august 2017 electrification electric vehicles evs are often seen as a key driver towards a greener future indeed transport accounts for roughly a quarter of the uks greenhouse gas emissions and seriously affects air quality in major cities to tackle pollution problems governments around the world are implementing ambitious policies to promote the electrification of transport and phase out ice internal combustion engine vehicles the uk and france both plan to ban the sale of petrol and dieselonly cars by 2040 while india is setting an even more ambitious end date of 2030  added to this are evs growing popularity with drivers there are now almost 110000 electric cars and vans on uk roads spurred on by lowering battery costs and a growing range of models including plugin hybrid vehicles evs now account for 2 of new registrations switching to evs is an obvious way to massively cut pollution in areas of dense traffic but the question remains  how clean are evs on the broader scale when you look at the electricity used to charge them electric vehicles are getting cleaner evs dont give off the same exhaust emissions as engines but the power in their batteries has to come from somewhere follow the flow back from the car through the charging point all the way back to the power station and its likely some of that electricity is coming from fossil fuels and that means emissions they werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell a researcher at imperial college london and author of electric insights  a study commissioned by drax that analyses electricity generation data in britain now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk evs are delivering much better results he continues in fact yearround average emissions from evs have fallen by half in the last four years thanks to greener electricity generation today they are twice as efficient as conventional cars take the tesla model s in the winter of 2012 producing the electricity for a full charge created 124g of carbon emissions per km driven roughly the same as a 2l range rover evoque now the carbon intensity of charging a tesla has nearly halved to 74gkm in winter and 41 gkm in summer as the uk continues to break its own renewable energy records for smaller evs the results are even better the nissan leaf and bmw i3 can now be charged for less than half the co 2 of even the cleanest nonplugin ev the toyota prius hybrid so the current outlook for evs is hugely positive  but as their numbers continue to increase will the demand they add to the grid put their clean credentials at risk will evs accelerate electricity demand the national grid suggests there could be as many as nine million evs on uk roads by 2030 which could lead to an additional 410 gw of demand on the system at peak times  this in some cases could lead to a rise in emissions electricity demand in britain typically peaks between 6pm and 10pm when people arrive home and switch on lights and appliances if you were to charge your ev between those evening hours the emissions would be 8 higher than reported in the chart above if you charged between midnight and 6am they would be 10 lower today this demand is met by the existing mix of power stations which last quarter included more than 50 renewable and lowcarbon sources  but when there are sudden spikes in demand above this typical usage the national grid must call in the help of carbonintensive reserve generators such as coalpowered stations polluting diesel generators are also on standby around the uk ready to turn on and feed into regional distribution grids at a moments notice to meet the challenge of peaktime ev charging less carbon intensive power generation storage and smart power management systems are needed these include rapid response gas power stations such as the four drax ocgts planned to come online in the early 2020s as well as gridscale batteries homebased batteries and demandside response schemes as the share of intermittent renewable capacity on the grid increases more backup power needs to be available for when the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine keeping our future fuels clean a future increasingly relying on backup generators is far from inevitable especially if the use of smart technology and smart meters increases by analysing electricity costs and countrywide demand smart meters have the potential to ensure evs only charge outside peak times unless absolutely necessary when electricity is more likely to come from renewable or lowcarbon and cheaper sources if the grid continues to decarbonise through advances in renewable technologies and lowercost coaltobiomass conversions the potential of evs electricity coming with associated emissions is diminished even further there is no doubt that evs will make up a significant part in the future of our mobility that they will also play a part in the future of cleaning up that mobility is as good as assured but on this journey its imperative we keep our eyes on the road commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by a team of academics from imperial college london led by dr iain staffell and facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants  tags decarbonisation  electric insights  electric vehicles evs  investors what you need to know about britains electricity last quarter 17 august 2017 power generation for an hour over lunch on wednesday 7 th june more than 50 of britains electricity came from renewables it was only the second time this had ever happened  the first had come just two months earlier in april the second quarter q2 of 2017 was a period largely made up of firsts for britains electricity system while there were only two instances of renewable power tipping the 50 mark between april and june overall wind solar biomass and hydro energy made up more than a quarter of all britains electricity for the first time ever these findings come from electric insights  research on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by top university academics over the past year the quarterly report has shown breaking renewable records is becoming the new normal for britains electricity last quarter was no different here we look at the key findings from q2 2017 and what they mean for the changing nature of the energy sector more than half great britains electricity came from renewables twice wind solar biomass and hydro accounted for 515 of the uks electricity for an hour on 7 th june  generating 191 gigawatts gw combined with nuclear power and imports from france lowcarbon output was a record 286 gw  a massive 89 of total demand this followed 30 th april when britains electricity edged over the 50 renewable mark for a shorter but no less significant period the percentage of renewables making up our power supply is set to grow as additional renewable capacity comes onto the grid there is currently 6 gw of additional wind capacity being constructed in britain solar capacity has already hit 124 gw  more solar panels than analysts thought would be installed by 2050 plans to convert more of britains coal units to biomass will increase the availability of renewable power further still electricity was cleaner than ever there was a key date in the history of coal during q2 on 21 st april britain recorded the first full day it had gone without burning any coal since 1882  the year holborn viaduct power station became the worlds first coalfired public electricity station while that date is symbolic of the uks shift away from coal in practice it means carbon emissions are also dropping to historically low levels carbon intensity reached a new low in q2 averaging 199 gkwh over the quarter  10 lower than the previous minimum set last year for context carbon intensity averaged 740 gkwh in the 1980s and 500 gkwh in the 2000s an important indicator of this falling carbon intensity is that britains electricity now regularly drops below 100 gkwh and reached an alltime low of 71 gkwh on the sunny and windy sunday of 11 th june electric cars are cleaner than before one of the greatest decarbonisation challenges moving forward is how we transform transport electrification is the primary driver of change in this sector and q2 saw britain hit a significant milestone as the total number of electric vehicles evs in the country surpassed 100000 the potential of evs in cleaning up transport is significant but there are also concerns they could in some cases increase co 2 levels due to pollution from power stations however as the last quarters data shows evs are in fact twice as carbon efficient as conventional cars thanks to the amount of renewable and low carbon electricity on the system according to our analysis looking at a few of the most popular models evs werent as green as you might think up until quite recently says dr iain staffell from imperial college london but now thanks to the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation in the uk they are delivering much better results the most solar power a quarter has ever seen the longer days in q2 enabled solar power to become a key source of electricity  and for eight hours over the quarter it generated more than all fossil fuels combined it also set output records by supplying 25 of total demand on 8 th april and producing 891 gw on 26 th may while wind remains the largest source of renewable energy generation in the uk solars influence is growing  especially as decentralisation of the power system continues to proliferate  of britains 124 gw solar capacity 57 is concentrated in 1400 solar farms of around 5 mw each while the rest is distributed across almost one million rooftop arrays in homes businesses and other institutions in fact during june 10 of all britains electricity came from these sorts of decentralised sources  sources of power not on the national grid this is unlikely to spell a fundamental shift to an entirely decentralised power grid in the short term but it does hint at the changes the sector is seeing from its carbon profile to its variety to its flexibility britains power system is changing  and thats a

sustainable bioenergy as the country moves towards a lower carbon future each renewable power generation technology has its place wind solar hydro and wave can take advantage of the weather to provide plentiful power  when conditions are right reliable affordable renewable power but people need electricity instantly  not just when its a windy night or a sunny day so until a time when storage can provide enough affordable capacity to store and supply the grid with power from ample solar and wind farms the country has to rely in part on thermal generation like gas coal and biomass reliable and available on demand yes but renewable low carbon and affordable too it can be a year ago a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers at imperial college london highlighted how a balanced mix of renewable technologies could save bill payers more than 2bn  now publicly available ofgem data on which its newly published renewables obligation annual report 201516 is based reinforces the case for government to continue to support coaltobiomass unit conversions within that technology mix why because out of all renewables deployed at large scale biomass presents the most value for money  less public funding is required for more power produced renewable costs compared drax power stations biomass upgrades were the largest recipient of renewable obligation ro support during the period 201516 the transformation from coal to compressed wood pellets has made drax the largest generator of renewable electricity in the country and by a significant margin drax power station produced more than five times the renewable power than the next biggest project supported under the ro  the london array dr iain staffell lecturer in sustainable energy at the centre for environmental policy imperial college london and author of electric insights  who has analysed the ofgem data commented based on ofgems renewables obligation database the average support that drax power station received was 4305 per mwh generated this compares to 8870 per mwh from the other nine largest projects biomass receives half the support of the uks other large renewable projects which are all offshore wind the average support received across all renewable generators in the ro scheme  which includes much smaller projects and all types of technology  is 58 per mwh that is around 15 per mwh more than the support received by drax ending the age of coal drax group isnt arguing for limitless support for coaltobiomass conversions and drax power station being the biggest most modern and efficient of power stations built in the age of coal  is a special case but if the ro did exist just to support lots of biomass conversions like drax but no other renewable technologies then in just one year between 201516 1bn of costs saving could have been made for the public purse drax power station may be the biggestsingle site recipient of support under the ro  but it does supply more low carbon power into the national grid than any other company supported by renewable obligation certificates rocs in fact 65 of the electricity generated at its selby north yorkshire site is now renewable thats 16 of the entire countrys renewable power  enough to power four million households thanks to the support provided to drax by previous governments the current administration has a comparatively cost effective way to help the power sector move towards a lower carbon future biomass electricity generated at drax power station has a carbon footprint that is at least 80 less than coal power  supply chain

taxing coal off the system 13 march 2017 power generation in the spring budget 2017 the chancellor announced that the government remains committed to carbon pricing philip hammonds red book revealed that from 202122 the government will target a total carbon price and set the specific tax rate  giving businesses greater clarity on the total price they will pay further details on carbon prices are to be set out at autumn budget 2017 researchers at imperial college london have modelled what would have happened during 2016 with no carbon tax and also with an increased carbon tax they have compared both with what actually happened their conclusion no carbon tax would mean more coal less gas higher emissions a higher carbon tax would mean less coal more gas lower emissions since it was announced in 2011 the carbon price support cps has encouraged generators and industry to invest in lower carbon and renewable technologies it has also forced coal generators to fire their boilers only when they are really needed to meet demand such as during the winter months or at times of peak demand and still or overcast weather conditions during the summer months the introduction of the carbon price has meant that gas power stations which are less carbon intensive than coal have jumped ahead of coal in the economic merit order of energy generation technologies and produced a greater share of the uks power the same is the case for former coal generation units that have since upgraded to sustainable biomass  three such units at drax power station result in savings in greenhouse gas ghg emissions of at least 80 a coal cliff edge the carbon price support has resulted in significant savings in the countrys greenhouse gas emissions helping the uk meet its international climate change commitments removing or reducing the cps too soon and britains power mix risks going back in time it would improve the economics of coal and encourage britains remaining coal power stations to stay open for longer creating a risk to security of supply through a cliff edge of coal closures in the mid2020s changing the economics to favour coal also makes it harder to reach the uk governments goal of bringing a new fleet of gas power stations online what if  dr iain staffell from the centre for environmental policy at imperial college london has modelled a scenario in which the carbon price support did not exist in 2016 if the government had abolished all carbon pricing we would probably have seen a 20 increase in the power sectors carbon emissions said staffell removing the carbon price support would have the equivalent environmental impact of every single person in the uk deciding to drive a car once a year from lands end to john ogroats without the carbon price support emissions from electricity consumption would be 20 higher meaning an extra 250 kg per person equivalent to driving a car 800 miles running the numbers the carbon price support is capped at 18tco 2 until 2021 in his budget on 8 th march 2017 chancellor philip hammond  rightly in the view of drax  confirmed the governments commitment to carbon pricing using data from national grid and elexon and analysis from dr iain staffell electric insights shows how coal power generation was only needed last winter when electricity demand was greater than could be produced by other technologies alone coal was only used at times of peak demand because it was among the most expensive energy technologies in part due to the cps what if that wasnt the case and the government had decided to scrap the cps before that point in time more coal is burnt particularly during the daytimes  on average coal produces 2500 mw more over this week equivalent to four of drax power stations six generation units and what does dr iain staffells model suggest would have happened if the cap was doubled to 36tco 2  the change is stark even for a week in the winter with an average temperature across the country of 86 o c to see coal generation reduced so much compared to the actual cps of 18tco 2 or the 0tco 2 scenario model illustrates the impact of the carbon price support could bill payers save one argument for reducing the carbon price support  or scrapping it altogether  is the possibility that consumers and nondomestic electricity bill payers would save money its worth noting that apparent savings for electricity bill payers are lowered when the whole way that power is priced is accounted for by the time it reaches homes and businesses carbon price support does increase the cost of wholesale power says staffell but if you add the extra taxes other renewable and low carbon support measures transmission and balancing charges and fees imposed by electricity suppliers the overall impact on consumer bills is modest so if the government abolished all carbon pricing we could expect a 1 pkwh reduction in our tariffs but a 21 increase in our carbon emissions as a report by economic consultancy nera and researchers from imperial college london has already shown there are other ways to save bill payers money while encouraging a low carbon future their analysis published in early 2016 found that households and businesses could save 2bn if the government considered the whole system cost of electricity generation and supply when designing its competitions for support under its contracts for difference cfd scheme 2016 redux without the carbon price support the uk wouldnt have managed to send carbon emissions back to 19 th century levels  so if 2016 was played out one more time but with no carbon price support coal generation would have increased by 102 28 terawatthours to 56 twh gas generation would have decreased by 21 27 twh to 101 twh carbon emissions would have risen by 21 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to 92mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have increased by 20 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 349 gco 2 kwh and if 2016 had seen a doubling of the cps to 36tco 2  coal generation would have decreased by 47 129 twh to 147 twh gas generation would have increased by 9 118 twh to 1395 twh carbon emissions would have decreased by 10 73 mt co 2  to 686 mt co 2 the carbon intensity of the grid would have decreased by 9 from 290 gco 2 kwh to 263 gco 2 kwh the two scenarios presented above only modelled the impact of no or a higher carbon price support on nuclear coal and gas power supply in the realworld changes to the carbon price support would also impact on energy technologies that operate under the renewables obligation ro such as two of draxs three biomass units and much of the countrys other renewable capacity cps changes would also likely impact imports and storage while no analysis is perfect this clearly illustrates the significantly negative impact that scrapping or reducing the carbon price support would have on the uks decarbonisation agenda it also highlights the benefits that the governments decision to remain committed to carbon pricing will deliver what

policy  gas 4 firsts for britains power system 9 february 2017 power generation its no secret 2016 was a year of change but beyond the high stakes political changes were events that indicate a shift of a similar size if far less controversial  the move to a decarbonised power network in the last three months of 2016 this change was characterised by four firsts in the history of britains power network each one signals a continuing trend that could offer a sign of whats to come in the future the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report from researchers at imperial college london commissioned by drax it tracks the rises and falls of the power generation system in england scotland and wales plus its environmental impact 1 wind power reached record output but was down overall one of the most interesting events was the way the wind blew  both a lot and not very much 2016 was the first ever year that wind generated more power than coal and a large part of that was thanks to the weather on the 23 rd december storm barbara hit the uk bringing strong winds of up to 90 miles per hour as a result wind output produced more than 10gw for the first time ever beating the previous record of 94gw set in 2014 at its peak wind power met 37 of british demand generating enough electricity for 15 million people  or everyone and everything north of nottingham but despite these peaks over the full quarter wind output was in fact 7 lower than the same time period in 2015 so while it was a quarter that showed how important a part of our power make up wind is right now and will be in the future it also showed how much it depends on the weather 2 britain exported more power to france than it imported for the first time in six years britain exported more electricity to france than it imported electricity flows between the two countries via an undersea interconnector called the interconnexion franceangleterre  and normally we accept more from the french nuclear generators and its other power sources than we send back that changed at the end of 2016 more than a dozen of frances nuclear power stations where turned off after safety checks found a flaw in their design while urgent maintenance took place during the last few months of 2016 british electricity generators exported power to meet french demand  taking advantage of higherthanusual electricity prices on the other side of the english channel in fact britain exported more in one week in november than over the whole of 2014 and 2015 combined 3 carbon emissions were at a 60year low low carbon energy sources keep on rising as a proportion of the uks total output and in the last quarter of 2016 this meant carbon emissions fell to their lowest autumn level for 60 years overall in 2016 coal generation fell by 61 as a mixture of low gas prices and the carbon price floor continued to force it off the system low carbon power sources grew to fill the gap contributing an average of 40 of the uks power while gas generation was up by more than 50 more than that the quarter also saw another record  britains cleanest christmas in history  up to 81 of britains power was generated by low carbon sources and the share of nuclear biomass hydro wind and solar did not fall below 60 during the three days between christmas eve and boxing day 4 electricity prices hit a new peak but also dipped below zero electricity prices reached their highest in a decade 1528 per mwh but they didnt stay there  for nineteen hours during the quarter they also dropped below zero negative energy prices occur when there is low demand and power being generated from inflexible sources for example the current british nuclear fleet plus wind and solar exceeds the amount needed when this happens generators have to pay to offload the excess electricity which means elexon  the body that handles payments in the balancing market  is essentially managing a market thats paying below zero for electricity these extremes raise the question of whether such price volatility is the new normal as more renewable energy comes onto the network its sensitivity to the elements increases which in turn can increase volatility the answer is possibly what does this mean for the future the number of firsts in britains power system signifies the scale of change its currently seeing with the end date for coal coming ever closer the country is increasingly realising the importance of exploring  and using  lowercarbon fuels to generate its electricity given the pace of change weve already seen by the time we reach

sat down to watch rowan atkinson solve a grisly murder it was the tv drama maigrets dead man and although it wasnt the most watched tv show on christmas day that honour went to the strictly come dancing finale it did cause the biggest televisionrelated sudden surge in electricity demand of the day says sumit gumber energy forecasting analyst at national grid  during a critical ad break in the show demand jumped 400 mw  roughly equivalent to 160000 kettles being switched on  as viewers raced to make cups of tea or go to the bathroom this is known as a tv pickup  while this may have provided the biggest sudden rise in electricity usage of the day it was not the overall peak as is typical on christmas day this years spike in demand came just before one oclock when families were preparing their festive feasts at 371 gw this peak was not only lower than previous years the power used to supply it was generated by more renewables than any christmas before it more than 40 of the electricity generated on christmas day came from renewable sources  what characterises christmas day christmas is a day when electricity usage is at one of its lowest points to put this years 371 gw peak into context an average weekday during december weekday electricity use is higher than on weekends has an electricity peak of nearly 50 gw usually occurring between five and seven oclock when people arrive home and street lighting is switched on the cause for the lower demand during christmas is simple  over the festive period schools as well as a number of offices shops and factories are closed over the last few years average christmas day demand has been fairly typical sitting in a bracket of between 29 gw and 39 gw in 2010 however extreme cold hitting minus three degrees celsius drove lunchtime peak demand as high as 46 gw showing just how important a driver of our electricity use temperature is  but while demand on christmas in 2016 may not have deviated largely from the average over the last few years there were some major leaps forward in how it was generated a greener christmas than ever before this year christmas was characterised by a huge jump in renewable electricity generation  on average 124 gw came from renewable sources  more than ever before of that figure wind contributed the most generating on average 94 gw  equivalent to 31 of all power supplied on christmas day compared to 2015 its a 63 increase and a staggering 195 uplift from five christmases ago in 2012 when just 12 of all electricity generated came from renewable sources biomass generation has also increased providing 2 gw in 2016 compared to the 05 gw it averaged on december 25 th  2012 the increase in renewables also marks an important step towards decarbonisation at its peak emissions from electricity generation this 25 th december were just 168 gkwh a significant drop compared to the 2012 peak of 506 gkwh and the 303 gkwh seen in 2015 this year has been a year of impressive stats in clean energy between july and september for the first time in its 130yearold history more than half of britains power came from lowcarbon sources  on 5 th may the uk did not burn any coal to generate electricity  the first time since 1881 now weve seen one of the cleanest christmases on record its a christmas tradition that is likely to continue biggest tv pickups christmas

electricinsightscouk  tags electric insights  national grid  technology some like it hot how temperature affects electricity prices 30 november 2016 electrification in 2012 europe faced an extreme cold wave temperatures in france dropped to minus four degrees celsius far below its average of five above as people huddled indoors electric heaters were dialled up and lights were switched on electricity demand soared it topped at 102 gw surpassing the countrys previous peak by more than 20 gw france had to import power from neighbouring countries the low temperatures drove demand so high the country couldnt manage on its own its something we see across the world  temperature peaks drive how and when we use electricity increasing demand in the colder northern european countries as the temperature falls and acting inversely in hotter southern countries but more than just driving up how much electricity we need the temperature can affect how much we pay for it too putting a price on electricity in the uk electricity is bought and sold by power generators energy suppliers and the national grid by the megawatt hour mwh one mwh is roughly enough power to boil 400 kettles and although prices fluctuate significantly on average one mwh costs roughly 50 in the uk in winter when uk electricity demand peaks its estimated that for every degree the temperature drops below 15 celsius demand rises by 820 mw electric insights  an independent report produced by researchers at imperial college london and commissioned by drax via imperial consultants  looks at the uks publicly available electricity data and clearly shows the trend as the temperature drops demand rises this raised demand affects the price of electricity in one obvious way consumers bills rise because theyre using more of it a less obvious impact is its effect on the production and supply cost of electricity from generator to the high voltage electricity transmission grid how temperature affects supply in cold weather power plants work better cooling towers are more efficient power cables are more conductive and less energy is needed to help keep generating equipment from overheating this all adds to small cost savings which in turn can make electricity cheaper however during colder weather the amount of gas used in the uk goes up  largely due to the rise in heating  which raises its price and this has a knock effect on electricity for every 1p increase in the cost of gas the cost of generating 1 mwh by a ccgt combined cycle gas turbine power station increases by around 70p as ccgts generate a large percentage of britains electricity the overall price of electricity also goes up but a bigger costdetermining factor is the increasing variety in todays energy make up renewables like wind and solar are intermittent energy sources solar cant function at night or when its overcast wind turbines dont rotate when its still so when it is especially cold dark or without much wind the grid needs to bring in additional flexible power generated by sources like biomass gas and coal these technologies can either deliver power to the grid all the time  known as baseload  or just when demand rises when they can be dialled up quickly but in the event of extreme weather the demand for power can surge and the grid needs to bring in additional generation capacity in britain there are smaller power stations fuelled by diesel oil or gas that lie dormant for much of the year but can start up at short notice to provide this boost of generation to meet demand activating and running these plants quickly for short amounts of time can be expensive and this can subsequently affect electricity price and lead to spikes in the winter the effect on the bottom line this leads to the following trend for every degree celsius the temperature falls below 10 there is a corresponding rise of 110 mwh it is also possible for increases in temperature to cause increased prices but this is usually in countries where air conditioners and electricallypowered cooling units are hooked up to their own national or regional electricity grid for better or worse this is not a problem that affects the uk but its important to understand that maintaining grid stability will always have its costs whatever the weather tags electric insights  energy policy  energy prices the cleanest year in britains electricity 14 november 2016 power generation amid the political upheaval that is characterising 2016 you may have missed the quiet victory of the uks lowcarbon energy sector for the first time ever the third quarter q3 of 2016 saw more than 50 of the britains power come from lowcarbon energy sources five years ago lowcarbon sources made up just over a quarter this doesnt necessarily mean that renewable energy sources made up the full 50  in fact nuclear made up a considerable chunk  but it hints at the big changes were seeing in the way the country is sourcing its power for one its a further sign of coals diminishing life  during the period july to september 2012 coal supplied 38 of britains electricity  during this years q3 it supplied just 3 as a result perunit carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at their lowest levels ever the carbon price floor  also known as the carbon tax and designed to assist energy companies like drax invest in renewable and lower carbon generation  has played a big role in reducing coals contribution the findings come from electric insights  an independent report produced by researchers from imperial college london and commissioned by drax that looks at the uks publicly available electricity data and aims to inform the debate on britains electricity system beyond the continued decline of coal it shows theres a growing diversity in lowcarbon energy sources fuelling the country and that theres a positive outlook for a cleaner electricity future here we look at those lowcarbon sources and how their use has changed over the last five years nuclear at 26 of the total nuclear made up the largest proportion of lowcarbon power generation across q3 2016 that was good news for the sector which went through a turbulent summer after plans for the hinkley point c reactor were momentarily threatened following the dissolution of the department for energy and climate change decc after the brexit vote the eventual decision to continue with hinkley c however means that more baseload nuclear power in the form of large power stations and also possibly small modular nuclear reactors smrs will be coming on to the system in the coming years they will in the main replace older nuclear power stations set to be decommissioned wind wind power made up 10 of total lowcarbon power generation between july and september and was the largest renewable source of the quarter as recently as 2011 electricity generated by wind accounted for just 4 of britains low carbon energy supplies  a 150 increase in just five years this is in part due to huge offshore projects such as the 630 mw london array in the thames estuary and the 576mw gwynt y môr situated off the coast of north wales which have contributed to bringing the uks installed capacity to around 14 gw the uk is now the worlds sixth largest producer of wind power behind china the usa india germany and spain solar following wind power as the second largest renewable contributor to the countrys lowcarbon energy needs was solar five years ago solars contribution was so negligible it didnt even chart in the electric insights data fast forward to 2016 and britain has a total installed solar capacity of nearly 10 gw again this places the country sixth in the world for capacity behind china germany japan the usa and italy biomass biomass  a unique lowcarbon fuel in that it can deliver both baseload and flexible power  made up 4 of the uks power needs in q3 2016 a good proportion of that came from drax which has over the last five years been upgrading from coal to run on compressed wood pellets  like solar biomass generation didnt even chart in 2011 but today in fact between july and september biomass along with solar and wind supplied 20 of the countrys electricity  a huge proof point for the rise of renewables where biomass sits apart from those two sources however is that it isnt dependent on weather and even though the country has less much less biomass generation capacity than the two intermittent technologies it produces nearly as much energy as them this makes it an ideal baseload partner for sources that do ie wind and solar as it can be dialled up and down to meet the energy demand of the country in seconds in the future theres potential to increase this biomass capacity while saving bill payers money  three of draxs six generating units run on biomass but if all were to be upgraded as they could be in less than three years  drax plus lynemouth power station and one or two smaller biomass power stations  could generate roughly 10 of britains electricity using compressed wood pellets by the time unabated coal power stations come off the system before the end of 2025  hydro hydropower made up just 1 of britains power generation over the quarter however this is still up by 20 since 2011 when hydropower contributed just 08 total installed hydropower capacity is around 165gw however studies have found the country has a potential hydropower capacity of close to double this amount  but as many of these sources are located in mountainous rural landscape areas of natural importance its doubtful whether hydropower will be deployed up to its full capabilities in the coming years closing an historic year may the 5 th was an historic day in the uk  it was the first time since 1881 britain burnt no coal to produce its electricity it wasnt an isolated incident either in the third quarter of 2016 britain was completely coal free for nearly six days its a situation that is likely to continue in the future as low carbon energy sources  and in particular renewables  continue to grow in the countrys energy makeup the outlook is a positive one 2016 may have been the cleanest year in uk electricity weve seen so far but it wont be the cleanest year ever explore the data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by
