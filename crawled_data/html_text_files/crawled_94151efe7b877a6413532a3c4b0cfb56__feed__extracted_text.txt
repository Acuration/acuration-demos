commercial director at draxstrongemh3 pin their sixth assessment report the intergovernmental panel on climate change has clearly stated that to limit warming to 15c we will need carbon dioxide removals cdrs on a gigaton scale the magnitude of this challenge lays starkly before us but in equal measure with the size of the task its importance has never been more evidentp pits long been accepted that the world must decarbonise by reducing emissions but the necessity of carbon removals is more newly recognised cdrs are now acknowledged to be a crucial part of the effort to achieve net zero emissions both to neutralise hardtoabate emissions and sectors like mining transportation and aviation and to remove excess historic carbon or overshoot already in the atmospherep pat drax we are developing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs which is unique in its ability to deliver renewable power and remove carbon from the atmosphere simultaneouslyp pengineered carbon removal technologies like beccs are crucial to achieving longterm climate goals beccs is the most scalable of these technologies that can be deployed rapidly and is affordable compared with other permanent removal solutionsp h2strongcredibility transparency and truststrongh2 phistorically the voluntary carbon market has struggled with demonstrating credibility transparency and trust and this has proven to be a significant weight on the industrys ability to scale we have seen reports of lowquality offsets sold as high integrity credits and projects that dont deliver the carbon benefits claimed which has diminished investor trust in the market as a wholep pto address these concerns we are now seeing significant initiatives being put in place to implement the high standards and good governance in carbon removals credits that we need to effectively scale the market to levels required the integrity council for the voluntary carbon markets icvcm is a prime example of this serving as an independent governance body for the voluntary carbon marketp pthe icvcm is working to champion standards across the industry and has set out its core carbon principles ccps  set of principles that all carbon offsets and removals must meet in order to be considered high integrityp pwe welcome this initiative and hope it will raise standards across the marketp psimilar to what we are seeing in the ai industry at present in order to build trust in this nascent market and in turn scale it it is also imperative that industry looks outside of itself and engages with other stakeholders who are impacted or interested in it we must develop ethical principles and guidelines for the design development and deployment of carbon markets implement transparent and accountable mechanisms for the oversight and governance of them educate and engage the public and stakeholders on the benefits of cdrs empower and protect the customers and foster collaboration and dialogue among the industry academia civil society and policymakersp h2strongwhy we need standards for beccsstrongh2 pat drax we already recognise that addressing quality concerns is the only way that the market will work for everybody  buyers rightly want to have confidence that they are buying a highintegrity removals which are robustly quantified and verified sellers need to be able to demonstrate the validity of their claims and government needs a wellfunctioning market and a baseline from which to regulate itp pour partnership with a hrefhttpswwwstockholmexergiseen target_blank relnoopenerstockholm exergia and a hrefhttpswwwecoengineersus target_blank relnoopenerecoengineersa is doing just that 8211 developing a worldleading methodology to ensure the integrity of beccs cdrs the methodology was created to align with the icvcms ccps and to closely consider how to ensure everyone around the table is getting what they needp ul listrongquantificationstrong for the methodology to be successful it requires a thorough approach to quantifying netnegative carbon removals from beccs quantification in the methodology starts with the gross volume of co2 we capture and store then subtracts any supply chain emissions andor emissions associated with the carbon capture and storage process as well as any leakage impacts increases in co2 emissions outside the project boundary we have intentionally developed this approach to be both robust and conservative so that beccs cdrs verified under the methodology are a truly net negative productli ul ul listrongguardrailsstrong it is also crucial in any methodology for beccs that there are robust guardrails in place to ensure biomass used comes from sustainable sources  for example from forests where the carbon stock is stable or increasing and excluding biomass sourced from sensitive areas where theres high levels of biodiversity our methodology also provides that any potential social or environmental risks must be evaluated and mitigated for biomass to be usedli ul ul listrongverificationstrong we aim to register our credits with one of the major registries and once a methodology is adopted we will ensure that our credits are independently verified to confirm that they meet all the requirements set out in the standard and that there is robust governance in place for example to ensure credits cannot be double countedli ul h2strongtaking the methodology forwardstrongh2 ppioneering this work for beccs standards is an important step toward increasing investment in beccs cdrs  a climate critical technology  and it needs to be done collaboratively it has been developed in partnership with stockholm exergy and ecoengineers and we are now working to gather feedback from other stakeholders with the aim of making it comprehensive and representativep pas a part of this wed like to invite further feedback  from other developers standards bodies potential customers and others and welcome constructive comment on the textp pthe methodology has also been submitted to the european commission to help shape their proposals for the framework for cdrs that they are developingp pit is in the interest of all parties to work towards common standards for cdrs to avoid current fragmentation of standards that causes confusion for customers and we appreciate your feedback on this important work as we drive it forwardp h2strongcapturing the opportunitystrongh2 pwe have an opportunity to change our current climate trajectory but that will only happen if we take action now we to need to reduce emissions and rapidly scale the market for high integrity sustainable cdrs putting the required standards and governance into place to build a resilient and trustworthy carbon removals market is a core part of thatp pwe hope that this methodology has a part to play in that work and that it will bring us one step closer to manifesting the potential of beccs done well at scalep h3a

plants with established supply chains further supported by the development of the powerbeccs business model for the first beccs projectsp pthe strategy is also promising as it presents an
