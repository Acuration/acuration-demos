power station drax generates 17bn and supports over 18500 jobs in the uk 18 october 2017 british energy business drax group contributed almost 17 billion towards uk gdp in 2016 and supported over 18500 jobs across the country the findings were revealed in a new report looking at the economic impact of draxs uk operations which includes drax power station  a nationally significant energy asset that provides power to six million homes researchers at oxford economics found that drax groups contribution to the british economy has increased by 34 yearonyear following the groups acquisition of opus energy a large retail company which supplies energy to businesses based on draxs operations in the energy sector and its use of british businesses across its supply chain the report estimates that the company contributed 167 billion to the economy and supported 18500 jobs last year a rise from 14150 in 2015 the vast majority of this impact is felt outside london and the south east  of the 167bn gross value added by drax group only 155m was in london meaning 90 of the groups economic impact was experienced outside of the capital employment supported by draxs activities covered a wide range of sectors including highskilled manufacturing of industrial components engineering and technical machinery construction it professional business services and transport researchers at oxford economics used three measures to calculate draxs gdp contribution the economic activity associated with the daytoday running of the business the activity created by the purchase of goods and services from its suppliers and the wages the companys employees and suppliers employees spend in their local area a breakdown of the gdp generated by drax group shows all regions of the uk benefited highlights include 419 million created in draxs heartland of yorkshire and the humber where its power station is located 760 jobs for the north east and 59m contributed to the local economy 232 million generated in the east of england where one of drax groups business retail suppliers haven power is based 1600 jobs supported and 130 million generated in wales the home of drax groups recently acquired business retail supplier opus energys cardiff offices 900 jobs supported in scotland and 76 million generated in its economy 950 jobs sustained and 83 million contributed to gdp in the south west drax group ceo dorothy thompson said as a british energy company we are committed to working with uk businesses right across our supply chain this report shows that drax now supports more than 18500 jobs across the uk and with our new business strategy in place we believe we will boost this number further with the power stations sophisticated supply chain and our growing retail business we are making a positive economic contribution in every region of the uk we are an important player in an energy sector that is crucial to delivering a low carbon economy as part of the governments wider clean growth strategy for the country since upgrading half of the power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal drax is the uks biggest single site generator of renewable power  producing enough for four million households we are also exploring options for a coalfree future including the repowering of our remaining coal generating units either to biomass or to gas with battery storage of up to 200mw if developed these options for gas and battery storage show how we could upgrade our existing infrastructure to provide capacity stability and essential grid services as we do with biomass this will allow more renewable energy sources onto the system paving the way for increased carbon savings across the uk as a whole and helping us to meet the governments ambitions for a coalfree system by 2025 osman ismail senior economist at oxford economics said drax group makes an important economic contribution to yorkshire and the humber and the uk more widely its activities generated almost 17 billion in gdp last year and sustained thousands of jobs across the nation in addition the implementation of the groups new strategy means that drax is uniquely placed to impact the wider challenges for the uks energy system through helping to balance the grid the opus energy acquisition solidifies draxs principal activities of generating energy and supplying energy services to businesses and directly impacts a number of different regions in the uk in terms of both job creation and contribution to gdp ends full details of the study can be found at draximpactcouk regional press releases northern england yorkshire and the humber cardiff oxford northampton ipswich media contact jessica gorton press officer drax 07712 677177 email protected notes to editors about drax group drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used as the uk moves to a low carbon future drax operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies 7 percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest single site renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax biomass  based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests haven power  based in ipswich providing businesses with electricity opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff providing electricity and gas to businesses the opus energy acquisition was part of the companys new business strategy which focuses on providing greater flexibility to the countrys electricity grid to complement the rise in generation from intermittent renewables such as wind and solar as well as diversifying earnings through its retail businesses and helping companies in the uk to be more sustainable billington bioenergy  based in liverpool with depots across the uk is one of the leading distributors of wood pellets for sustainable heating in the uk for more information visit wwwdraxcom about oxford economics oxford economics was founded in
