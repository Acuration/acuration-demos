power station biomass and beccs are essential in the uks journey to net zero as part of its plan to accelerate decarbonisation efforts across all sectors of britains economy the department for energy security and net zero desnz has today published its longawaited biomass strategy 10 august 2023 opinion the strategy provides an important steer on the short medium and longterm use of biomass in the uks 2050 net zero target with the governments strategy in hand i am more certain than ever on two things first that there remains a clear and powerful role for biomass and beccs in helping the uk balance harder to abate sectors like aviation and reach net zero and secondly that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs has a vital role to play in our global energy transition  and that drax is well placed to deliver why we should be confident in developing the strategy the government has considered several factors including availability of biomass and the priorities for end use impacts on air quality the sustainability of biomass use as well as the role of beccs in helping to reach our longterm climate goals the priority use framework evaluates where biomass would be most sustainably and efficiently used across sectors given supply constraints this framework is an important tool which has been developed with four key principles in mind sustainability air quality the circular economy and resource efficiency and ability to support us getting to net zero critically the priority use framework states that in the shortterm 2020s government will continue to facilitate sustainable biomass deployment through a range of incentives and requirements covering power heat and transport in the mediumterm to 2035 government intends to further develop biomass use for utilities such as heat and power with a view to where possible transition to beccs biomass for use in beccs should be prioritised in the long term to 2050 its very encouraging to see government recognise the important role that biomass plays in our energy transition in both the short and medium term as well as its prioritisation of beccs in the long term although there are various routes for deploying beccs across different industries the strategy further prioritises the deployment of beccs on existing biomass generation plants with established supply chains further supported by the development of the powerbeccs business model for the first beccs projects the strategy is also promising as it presents an evidencedriven basis for longterm policy stability and i believe if the government continues in this direction it will draw investment to the uks bioenergy industry why this is critical for the country biomass has already played an important role in supporting energy security while helping the uk decarbonise displacing fossil fuels with a source of renewable dispatchable power our work has also made a significant contribution to the uk economy adding an estimated 18 billion to the uk gdp and supporting 17800 jobs in 2021 alone and looking to the future beccs presents an enormous opportunity to the uk early investment in this critical technology has the potential to support energy security and climate targets whilst creating jobs and making the uk a leader in the potentially trilliondollar global cdr market this work needs to happen now  nearly all realistic pathways to limit warming to 15c require the carbon removal technology and renewable power beccs offers and expert voices at the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change the uks climate change committee and forum for the future have said that carbon removals will be needed to address the climate crisis todays strategy is a clear signal from government that they recognise the importance of beccs and the urgency with which we must employ it within the uk why this is encouraging for drax drax is an international growing sustainable business at the heart of global efforts to deliver net zero and energy security and i believe the strategy we have seen from government today is a clear indication of their support for the work that we do with beccs drax has the ability to become a global leader in carbon removals technology we are engaged in formal discussions with the uk government about the project and providing these are successful we plan to invest billions in transforming drax power station into the worlds largest carbon removals project the prioritisation of beccs within the priority use framework shows the government is aligned to this vision as we look forward we welcome the governments biomass strategy and will continue to unpack what it means for our business over the coming days and weeks with a mind to our next steps government must now ensure that as it progresses its consultation on biomass sustainability that that process is equally evidencedriven and ensures that sciencebased methods drive the policy forward we hope to continue to work alongside government to support these efforts our formal discussions with the uk government on beccs and a bridging mechanism to support the transition to beccs have been productive but to realise the scale of the ambition included in the governments strategy we need commitment through the delivery of a clear business model that supports beccs todays support from government brings us a big step closer and we look forward to continuing the work will gardiner ceo drax read rns here  share most read electrification storage solutions 3 ways energy storage can get the grid to net zero sustainable
