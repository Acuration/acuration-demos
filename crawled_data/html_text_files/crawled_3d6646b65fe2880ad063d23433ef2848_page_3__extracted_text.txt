great britains electricity system is in the middle of a revolution where power supply was once dominated by some big thermal coal gas and nuclear power stations  it now comes from an array of sources thousands of new individual points have been added to the mix ranging from large interconnectors that bring in power from neighbouring countries through to wind farms solar panels small gas and diesel engines the energy mix has been changing radically with low carbon sources expected to provide 58 of great britains power by 2020  up from 22 in 2010 and 53 in 2018  however the security standards at which the electricity grid needs to be operated remain the same these are predominantly voltage and frequency and nominally 230 v and 50hz for a domestic consumer the operation of the transmission system including maintaining these standards is overseen by the national grid electricity system operator eso using a set of vital tools it needs to have available known as ancillary services some of this capability was inherent in large generators which could provide the ancillary services required to keep a stable transmission system maintaining system stability with thousands of generation points  a large part of which are not directly controllable  is increasingly challenging click graphic to viewdownload ancillary services enable electricity to reach the end customer when and where it is required in a safe manner within acceptable quality standards in addition to managing voltage and frequency levels these standards also include maintaining adequate reserves to accommodate demand forecast uncertainties generator breakdown and system faults 1 as the electricity mix changes so must the process by which these services are secured a diverse set of existing and genuinely new solutions will be needed to keep the lights on in the net zero carbon future three steps to creating the right environment for a stable resilient future grid 1 make the value of ancillary services transparent in order for companies to help the eso be they generators or other service providers it must be open and transparent about whats needed to maintain grid stability and build resilience for the future the eso is the only buyer in the ancillary services market and is wellpositioned to understand how the system is evolving it should be proactively flagging how its needs may evolve in the future so that the market can develop solutions to meet them says marcelo torres draxs regulation manager  markets certain ancillary services still dont have their own competitive markets and are provided as a byproduct of the generation of electricity an example is reactive power  for which there are no developed functioning regional markets yet generally all power stations connected to the transmission network with a generation capacity of over 50mw are required to have the capability to provide this service at a default price that may not reflect its real value to the system another example is inertia  provided today largely through the heavy spinning turbines of thermal and pumpedstorage hydro stations which serve as stored energy that can slow down or smooth out sudden changes in network frequency if ancillary services were valued explicitly market participants would have an insight into how much they are actually worth to the eso and the grids stability which would in turn incentivise new competitive products to reach the market torres points to technologies such as synchronous compensators  which are machines capable of providing ancillary services including inertia and reactive power without generating potentially unneeded electricity click graphic to viewdownload these solutions will enable more renewables to connect safely to the network at a lower cost to consumers for these solutions to come forward ascribing the right value to ancillary services will be key without clear price signals there is a risk of underinvestment in those technologies that provide the services needed potentially resulting in price shocks for consumers the eso is moving in the right direction with its recent network development pathfinder projects it has accelerated this work launching its first ever tender for inertia and should roll out similar initiatives gbwide such procurements should align with existing investment signals such as those provided by the capacity market  this should allow for the right type of capacity to be built where it is most needed delivering a secure and resilient grid 2 create market confidence constructing the machinery and infrastructure that will enable the eso to operate a carbonfree system will require major financial investment as well as years to plan and build says torres this can only be achieved if ofgem designs the esos incentives in a way that rewards it for taking bold strategic initiatives that have the potential to deliver good value for money to consumers in the longterm evidence of this working is shown in the success of offshore wind which now provide around a sixth of great britains electricity at record low prices this is partly due to the government providing offshore wind developers with revenue stabilisation mechanisms known as  contracts for difference  cfds this is not a new concept for government and regulators around the world looking to enable investment in energy infrastructure financing renewables to achieve decarbonisation is enabled through cfds or marketled hedging tools like power purchase agreements  investment to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet peak demand is secured through longterm contracts competitively awarded through the capacity market similarly investment in interconnection is supported through ofgems cap  floor regime subsidy isnt required for investment in ancillary services whats needed says torres is a clear and stable market framework designed around the systems needs which provides a mix of short and longterm signals more certainty over the market landscape and the expected returns will lower the risk of these investments and get the solutions needed at a lower overall cost to consumers longterm procurement is not the right answer everywhere where there is already a mature and liquid market such as the case for frequency response buying services closer to real time makes sense for two reasons first it allows prices to reflect more accurately the market conditions and therefore the real value of a service at the time when it is needed second it allows a wider range of resources to participate in the market increasing competition striking the right balance between short and longterm procurement is key to create a sustainable ancillary services market currently the eso requests that electricitygeneration firms commit to supplying a certain amount of power for the purpose of frequency response a month ahead of time for resources such as wind farms or solar which are dependent on the weather this makes it extremely difficult for them to enter this market even for conventional large thermal generators it can be a problem as many of them do not know how or if they will be running beyond a few days the eso is currently conducting some trials procuring frequency response one week in advance while this is an improvement it is still too long a lead time for intermittent sources or demandside response which ideally need dayahead or almost real time auctions to unlock their full potential says torres the ancillary services market has been through a prolonged period of change since the eso published its system needs and product strategy in 2017  without knowing how the market landscape will look like by the end of these reforms its difficult for providers to develop the right solutions a shift in thinking which considers what the electricity network might require in the future  and how to provide the market with financial incentives to make it a reality is needed a resilient stable future system is to the advantage of consumers 3 diversify there will be no silver bullet that can solve all the challenges the energy transition poses maintaining system reliability in a high renewables world will require large amounts of dispatchable power with different response time and duration from small batteries and demandside response that will manage instantaneously frequency fluctuations  through to large pumped storage hydro plants that will provide backup power during the days when the wind wont blow and the sun wont shine a framework structured around the systems different needs should aim at harnessing flexibility across a range of technologies and sizes source the road to 2050 the need for flexibility in a high renewables world  by ana barillas aurora 2019 truly diversifying will also involve unlocking the flexibility potential on the distribution grid to achieve this the way that access to the distribution network is managed and paid for will need to evolve today with big parts of the distribution network being congested small flexible assets are asked to wait in the queue for several years or face disproportionate amount of network reinforcement costs to get connected machine hall cruachan power station the ongoing review of the network access and forwardlooking charging arrangements needs to address these barriers soon if we are serious about making use of flexibility to foster the energy transition while keeping consumer bills as low as possible since 2018 gbs distribution network operators dnos have been tendering and procuring for various flexibility services to manage congestion in regional electricity grids in 2019 they published a roadmap setting out the steps they intend to take to enable a smarter and more flexible energy system as we transition from dnos towards distribution system operation  a wider set of functions and services to run a smart distribution grid  the regional networks will be open to marketbased flexibility solutions dsos will be able to compete on a level playing field offering options for network reinforcement as dnos move from trials to more structured flexibility procurement harmonisation and effective coordination with the national markets will be the key prerequisites to reveal the true value that flexibility can bring to the energy system argues torres to build a modern and resilient grid we will need a wider lens on whats possible its going to be an exciting journey on the road to net zero this story is part of a series on the lesserknown electricity markets within the

carbon capture nasa museum houston texas how do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes the partnership between drax fuelcell energy p3p partners and the department of business energy and industrial strategy could provide an additional opportunity for the uks biggest renewable power generator to deploy bioenergy carbon capture usage and storage beccus at scale in the mid 2020s from

electricity  electricity generation  energy storage  engineering  hydrogen  technology  transport how the market decides where great britain gets its electricity from 11 june 2019 power generation the makeup of great britains power system changes constantly demand is always changing in winter it may peak at 50 gigawatts gw but overnight in summer it will be less than 20 gw some days wind is the biggest source of the countrys electricity generation other days its gas then there are days when for a few hours solar takes the top spot in the middle of the day and nuclear during the night in the past great britains electricity came almost entirely from big coal and nuclear power stations but as the need for decarbonisation has grown so has the number of sources feeding electricity to the grid creating an ever more complex and varied system made up of technologies that behave in very different ways for example some sources are weather dependent and cant generate all day every day others stop and start flexibly to smooth out changes in demand or intermittent generation but in the event all sources are available what dictates which sources actually generate and when the overriding influence is economics  the costs of starting up and running a turbine the price of fuel or taxes on carbon emissions in great britain electricitys wholesale price is not set in stone by an entity such as a regulator instead its negotiated via trading over the course of a day between generators power stations storage and wind turbines and suppliers who transmit that electricity to consumers as a result the price of electricity fluctuates every half hour responding to factors such as demand cost of fuels availability of resources such as sun and wind and carbon taxes for an example of the scale at which it fluctuates we can look at the period 14 june this year when the index price of electricity ranged from over 55mwh down to around 5mwh see chart above but while these figures speak to the overall price of a megawatt on the system they dont reflect all the individual sources nor their individual costs each of the multiple sources on the grid have their own operating costs fluctuating on a similar basis these changing prices give rise to what is known as the merit order a fluid theoretical ranking of generation sources this is not set by any regulator economist or even by traders rather it is a naturally occurring financial occurrence that explains what sources of electricity generation are feeding power onto the grid daytoday what is the merit order the merit order dictates which sources of generation will deliver power to the grid by ranking them in ascending order of price together with the amount of electricity generated this then determines the order in which power sources are brought onto the system ultimately suppliers want the right amount of electricity for the best possible price so in a system made up of many sources it is the lowest cost highest yield option that is brought online first which in theory helps keep overall electricity prices down north sea wind farm redcar this means it is often sources such as wind and solar which have no fuel costs that sit at the top of the merit order nuclear may come next as it continually generates a large amount of power for a low cost while taking a long time to turn down or off at the opposite end of the merit order are sources like coal and oil which have high fuel and carbon dioxide co 2  emission costs such as carbon taxes and the european emission trading scheme however the merit order isnt a set of hard and fast rules its an assumption used by traders or market commentators to guide what is likely to run and thereby the likely market price says ian foy drax head of ancillary services there is no published merit order it is like santa claus  it doesnt exist but it makes explaining christmas easier the intricacies of being in and out of merit if a generating unit is required to meet demand then its described as in merit if it is not required at any particular point in time then its out of merit  theres no point in suppliers paying for another power station for example to start generating if demand is already being met if the market is efficient we generate from the lowest cost source at all times says foy costs are not simple for example you have to take into account the cost of starting or shutting down generating units however costs are not publicly shared so theres no single view of the merit order each party has its own perspective on it it means the merit order changes from seasontoseason daytoday and hourtohour as rates of supply and demand and the availability of resources change dungeness nuclear power station in kent an obvious example is gas tends to be cheaper in summer than winter when its not being used for heating coal and gas also switch as global prices change says foy availability also changes over the year theres more solar in summer but none in the morning and evening peaks of winter there are also practical issues such as repairs being made on wind and hydro turbines or planned maintenance outages on thermal and nuclear power stations putting those generators out of action and knocking them out of merit and because the merit order is not an implemented working scheme it can be deliberately manipulated by outside forces one of the ways this is most clearly seen is in carbon pricing merit in a changing system the carbon price support tax paid by coal and gas generators in great britain alongside the european emissions trading system have increased the cost of fossil fuel generation gas oil and coal levied as tonne of co 2 emitted this has the effect of pushing fossil generation down the merit order with coal emitting double the co 2 per unit of electricity compared to gas we can see how the merit order can be influenced to achieve environmental outcomes this has helped steer great britain towards record breaking coalfree periods and stimulated the building of low carbon generation sources other sources such as interconnection with europe and power storage facilities also slot into the merit order their position often shifts due to highly variable prices dependent on power generation in neighbouring countries or the amount of electricity that can be stored at a low cost respectively the grid is everchanging over the last two decades weve seen huge shifts in how power is generated and delivered this is unlikely to slow down in the near future but the merit order will remain like the grid it is in a constant state of change adapting to the many moving parts of the electricity system as long as great britain maintains its open electricity trading market the merit order will continue to dictate where the countrys power comes from tags carbon pricing  decarbonisation  electricity generation  renewable energy what makes a mountain right for energy storage 22 may 2019 power generation electricity generation is often tied to a countrys geography climate and geology  as an island great britains long coastline makes offshore wind a key part of its renewable electricity while iceland can rely on its geothermal activity as a source of power and heat one of the most geographicallyinfluenced sources of electricity is hydropower a site needs a great enough volume of water flowing through it and the right kind of terrain to construct a dam to harness it even more dependent on the landscape is pumped hydro storage pumped storage works by pumping water from one source up a mountain to a higher reservoir and storing it when the water is released it rushes down the same shafts it was pumped up spinning a turbine to generate electricity the advantage of this is being able to store the potential energy of the water and rapidly deliver electricity to plug any gaps in generation  for example when the wind suddenly dropsor when great britain instantly requires a lot more power  this specific type of electricity generation can only function in a specific type of landscape and the scottish highlands offers a location that ticks all the boxes the perfect spot for pumped storage cruachan power station  a pumped hydro facility capable of providing 440 megawatts mw of electricity sits on the banks of loch awe in the highlands ready to deliver power in just 30 seconds here there is a minimum distance between the two water sources with a maximum drop says gordon pirie civil engineer at cruachan power station it is an ideal site for pumped storage the challenge in constructing pumped storage is finding a location where two bodies of water are in close proximity but at severely different altitudes from the lochside the landscape rises at a dramatic angle to reach 1126 metres 3694 feet above sea level at the summit of ben cruachan the highest peak in the argyll the crest of cruachan dam sits 4008 metres 1315 feet up the slopes creating a reservoir in a rocky corrie between ridges the four 100 mw turbines which also act as pumps lie a kilometre inside the mountains rock the horizontal distance and the vertical distance between water sources is whats called the pipetolength ratio explains pirie its what determines whether or not the site is economically viable for pumped storage the higher water is stored the more potential energy it holds that can be converted into electricity however if the distance between the water sources is too great the amount of electricity consumed pumping water up the mountain becomes too great and too expensive the distance between the reservoir and the turbines is also reduced by cruachan power stations defining feature the turbine hall cavern one kilometre inside the mountain carving a power station out of rock the access tunnel cavern and the networks of passageways and chambers that make up the power station were all blasted and drilled by a workforce of 1300 men in the late 1950s to early 1960s  affectionately known as the tunnel tigers this was dangerous work however the rock type of the mountainside was another geographic advantage of the region its the diorite and phyllite rock essentially granite so its a hard rock but its actually a softer type of granite and thats also why cruachan was chosen as the location says pirie the right landscape and geology was essential for establishing a pumped storage station at cruachan however the west highlands also offer another essential factor for hydropower an abundance of water turning water to power the west highlands are one of the wettest parts of europe with some areas seeing average annual rain fall of 3500 millimetres compared to 500 millimetres in some of the driest parts of the uk this abundance of water from rainfall as well as lochs and rivers also contributes to making cruachan so wellsuited to pumped storage the cruachan reservoir can contain more than 10 million cubic metres of water most of this is pumped up from loch awe which at 385 square kilometres is the third largest freshwater loch in scotland loch awe is so big that if cruachan reservoir was fully released into the loch it would only increase the water level by 20 centimetres however the reservoir also makes use of the aqueduct system made up of 19 kilometres of tunnels and pipes that covers 23 square kilometres of the surrounding landscape diverting rainwater and streams into the reservoir calculating quite how much of the reservoirs water comes from the surrounding area is difficult but estimates put it at around a quarter there are 75 concrete intakes dotted around the hills to gather water and carry it through the aqueducts to the reservoir says pirie the smallest intake is about the size of a street drain in the corner of a field and the largest one is about the size of a threebedroom house pumped storage stations offer the electricity system a source of extra power quickly but it takes the right combination of geographical features to make it work ben cruachan just so happens to be one of the spots where the landscape makes it possible tags cruachan power station  electricity generation  energy storage

the landscape of europe tell us anything its that hydraulic engineering is nothing new for thousands of years water power has been used to grind wheat saw wood and even tell the time  craigside in northumberland by the 19th century water was able to go beyond performing rudimentary mechanical tasks and generate electricity directly cragside in northumberland england became the first house powered entirely by hydroelectricity in 1878 by 1881 the whole town of niagara falls on the uscanada border was being powered by the force of its eponymous river and waterfall hydropower has many advantages its predictable consistent often zero or low carbon and it can provide a range of ancillary services to power transmission systems in great britain there is 17 gigawatts gw of installed hydropower and another 28 gw of pumped hydro storage capacity but it remains a small part of the overall electricity mix in the fourth quarter of 2018 the 65 of british hydropower that is connected to the national grid accounted for less than one per cent electricity generation or 545600 megawatt hours mwh by contrast wind accounted for 14 of total generation that quarter almost 95 million mwh while hydropower projects can be expensive to construct operational and maintenance costs are relatively low and they can run for an extremely long time  the lanark hydro electric scheme in scotland which drax recently acquired  has been producing power since 1927 today hydropower installations are found at all scales all around the world but the term hydropower covers many different types of facility these are some of the ways water is used to generate electricity impoundment power plants the simplest and most recognisable form of hydropower impoundment facilities work by creating a reservoir of trapped water behind a dam that is then selectively released the water flows through a turbine spinning it which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity from the hoover dam on the nevadaarizona border to the three gorges dam in china  the worlds largest power station of any type with a generating capacity of 225 gw  impoundment dams are some of the most iconic structures in modern engineering three gorges dam china as well as having the potential to provide large quantities of baseload power they can react extremely quickly to grid demands  just by opening or closing their floodgates as the power system operator requires runofriver generation rather than storing and releasing power from behind a dam runoftheriver generators channel off part of a river and use its natural flow to generate power tongland power station galloway hydro scheme because it doesnt require large dams or reservoirs runofriver can be less environmentally disruptive as there is not always a need for large scale construction and flooding is less common stonebyres power station lanark hydro scheme while runofriver facilities tend to be smaller and less flexible than impoundment they still have significant generating potential  the jirau hydroelectric power plant on the madeira river in brazil has a generating capacity of 37 gw pumped storage water can also be good for storing energy that can then be converted to electricity pumped hydro storage facilities operate by pumping water uphill to a reservoir when electricity is cheap or plentiful then letting it flow back downhill through tunnels to a series of turbines that activate generators to generate electricity in the same way as an impoundment dam when electricity is in high demand dam and reservoir cruachan power station their ability to both produce and absorb electricity makes them a vital part of electricity networks playing the role of energy storage systems  in fact a massive 97 of all global grid storage capacity is in the form of pumped hydro their function as giant batteries will only become more important as intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar become more prevalent in the energy mix outlet and loch cruachan power station so too will their ability to ramp up generation very quickly draxs recently acquired cruachan power station in scotland can go from zero to 100 mw or more in less than 30 seconds when generation is called upon  for example when there is a sudden spike in demand tidal range generation swansea bay the sea is also an enormous source of potential hydropower tidal range generation facilities exploit the movement of water levels between and high and low tide to generate electricity tidal dams trap water in bays or estuaries at high tide creating lagoons the dam then releases the water as the rest of the tide lowers allowing it to pass through turbines generating power there are limitations  like wind and solars dependence on the wind blowing and the level of sunlight operators cant control when tides go in or out but its vast generating potential means that it could be a valuable source of baseload power if it were to be deployed more widely great britain in particular has major opportunities for tidal generation the severn estuary between england and wales has the second highest tidal range in the world 15 metres and a barrage built across the estuary could have a generating capacity of up to 86 gw  enough to meet 6 of the britains total electricity demands some environmental groups worry about the impact such projects could have on wildlife due to the level of public funding required the government rejected that plan in 2010 in favour of pursuing its nuclear policy  a second attempt at securing a governmentbacked investment contract known as a cfd  for a smaller 320 mw pathfinder project in swansea bay was also rejected in 2018 the welsh government is however supportive of the project which already has planning permission tidal stream generation rather than building a dam tidal stream generators work like underwater wind turbines sturdy propellers or hydrofoils winglike blades which oscillate up and down rather than spinning around are positioned underwater to transform the energy of tidal streams into electricity while tidal streams move far slower than wind the high density of water compared to air means that more power is generated even at much lower velocities not reliant on large physical structures tidal stream generators are a relatively cheap form of hydropower to deploy and make a much smaller impact on their environment than tidal barrages wave generation unlike tidal power which is generated by the gravitational effects of the sun and moon on the earths oceans wave power ultimately comes from the winds that whip up the oceans surface there are a number of different methods that turn waves into generation including funnelling waves into a tube floating on the surface of the water that contains electricitygenerating turbines or by using the vertical bobbing movement of a tethered buoy to pull and spin a fixed generator an electricitygenerating buoy awaiting installation in spain wave power has yet to be widely implemented but it has significant potential its estimated that the waves off the coasts of the usa could have provided 66 of the countrys electricity generation needs in 2017 alone effectively commercialising wave power could provide another vital tool in developing a sustainable energy landscape for the coming future tidal and wave

great britain keep breaking renewable records 15 february 2019 power generation how low carbon can britains electricity go as low as zero carbon still seems a long way off but every year records continue to be broken for all types of renewable electricity 2018 was no different over the full 12month period 53 of all britains electricity was produced from low carbon sources which includes both renewable and nuclear generation up from 50 in 2017 the increase in low carbon shoved fossil fuel generation down to just 47 of the countrys overall mix the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report found electricitys average carbon intensity fell 8 to 217 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatthour of electricity generated gkwh and while this continues an ongoing decline that keeps the country on track to meet the committee on climate changes target of 100 gkwh by 2030 it was however the slowest rate of decline since 2013 it also highlights that while britain can continue to decarbonise in 2019 the challenges of the years ahead will make it tougher to continue to break the records it has over the past few years httpswwwdraxcomukwpcontentuploadssites8201902drax_record_highs_and_lowsv03mp4 the highs and lows of 2018 last year every type of renewable record that could be broken was broken wind solar and biomass all set new 10year highs for respective annual monthly and daily generation as well as records for instantaneous output generation over a halfhour period and share of the electricity mix the result was a new instantaneous generation high of 21 gigawatts gw for renewables 58 of total output wind had a particularly good year of renewable recordsetting it broke the 15 gw barrier for instantaneous output for the first time and accounted for 48 of total generation during a half hour period at 5am on 18 december  overall low carbon generation which takes into account renewables and nuclear both that generated in britain and imported from french reactors had an equally recordbreaking year with an average of almost 18 gw across the full year and a new record for instantaneous output of 30 gw at 1pm on 14 june  nearly 90 of total generation over the half hour period while low carbon and individual renewable electricity sources hit record highs there were also some milestone lows coal accounted for an average of just 5 of electricity output over the year hitting a record low in june when it made up just 1 of that months total generation fossil fuel output overall had a similarly significant decline hitting a decadelow of 15 gw on average for 2018  44 of total generation over the year one fossil fuel that bucked the trend however was gas which hit an alltime output of 27 gw for instantaneous generation on the night of 26 january there was low wind on that day last year plus much of the nuclear fleet was out of action for reactor maintenance in one case with seaweed clogging a cooling system  this was all aided by an ongoing decline in overall demand as ever smarter and more efficient devices helped the country reach the decades lowest annual average demand of 335 gw more impressive when considering how much the countrys electricity system has changed over the last decade however is the record low demand net of wind and solar only 99 gw was needed from other energy technologies at 4am on 14 june  how the generation mix has changed the most remarkable change in britains electricity mix has been how far out of favour coal has fallen from its position as the primary source from 2012 to 2014 in the space of four years it has crashed down to sixth in the mix with nuclear wind imports biomass and gas all playing bigger roles in the system this sudden decline in 2015 was the result of the carbon price nearly doubling from 954 to 1808 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  in april making profitable coal power stations lossmaking overnight  with coal continuing to crash out of the mix biomass has become the mostused solid fuel in britains electricity system interconnectors are also playing a more significant part in britains electricity mix since their introduction to the capacity market in 2015  thanks to increased interconnection to europe britain is now a net importer of electricity with 22 twh brought in from europe in 2018  nine times more than it exported while more of britains electricity comes from underwater power lines less of it is being generated by water itself hydros decline from the fifth largest source of electricity to the eighth is the most noticeable shift outside coals slide new largescale hydro installations are expensive and a secondary focus for the government compared with cheaper renewables hydros role in the electricity mix is also affected by drier hotter summers which means lower water levels for solar by contrast the warmer weather will see it play a bigger role and its expected to overtake coal in either 2019 or 2020 what is unlikely to change in the nearfuture however is the position at the top in 2018 gas generated 115 twh  more than nuclear and wind combined but this is just one constant in a future of multiple moving and uncertain parts 2019 a year of unpredictability britain is on course to leave the eu on 29 march the effects this will have on the electricity system are still unknown but one influential factor could be britains exit from the emissions trading scheme ets the euwide market which sets prices of carbon emitted by generators this may mean that rather than paying a carbon price on top of the ets as is currently the case britains generators will only have to pay the new fixed carbon tax of 16 per tonne the uk government says will come into play in april topped up by the carbon price support cps of 18tonne lower prices for carbon relative to the fluctuating ets  cps could make coal suddenly economically viable again the black stuff could potentially become cheaper than other power sources this aboutturn could cause the carbon intensity of electricity generation to bounce up again in one or more years between 2019 and 2025 the date all coal power units will have been decommissioned the knockon effect of lower carbon prices combined with fluctuations in the pound against the euro could see a reverse from imports to exports as britain pumps its cheap potentially coalgenerated electricity over to its european neighbours thats if the interconnectors can continue to function as efficiently as they do at present which some parties believe wont be the case if human traders have to replace the automatic trading systems currently in place sizewell b nuclear power station a reversal of importing to exporting could also reduce the amount of nuclear electricity coming into the country from france future nuclear generation in britain also looks in doubt with toshiba and hitachis decisions to shelve their respective plans for new nuclear reactors which could leave a 9 gw hole in the lowcarbon base capacity that nuclear normally provides renewables have the potential to fill the gap and become an even bigger part of the electricity system but this will require a push for new installations 2018 saw a 60 drop in new wind and solar installations and less than 2 gw of new renewable capacity came onto the system making it the slowest year for renewable growth since 2010 britains electricity has seen significant change over the last decade and 2018 once again saw the country take significant strides towards a low carbon future but challenges lie ahead records might be harder to break but it is important the momentum continues to move towards renewable sustainable electricity explore the quarters data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk  read the full report  commissioned by drax electric insights is produced independently by a team of academics from imperial college london led by dr iain staffell and facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants  tags coal  decarbonisation  electric insights  electricity  electricity generation  energy policy electricity and magnetism the relationship that makes the modern world work 30 january 2019 power generation locked in a parisian vault and stored in a double set of bell jars is a small cylinder of metal made of platinumiridium the carefully guarded lump weighs exactly one kilogram but more than just weighing one kilogram it is the kilogram from which all other official kilograms are weighed international prototype kilogram with protective double glass bell known as the international prototype kilogram or colloquially as le grand k the weight was created in 1889 and has been carefully replicated to offer nations around the world a standardised kilogram but over time le grand k and its clones have slightly deteriorated through wear and tear despite extremely careful use in an age of micro and nanotechnology bits of metal arent quite accurate enough to dictate global weighs and so as of may this year it will no longer be the global measurement for a kilogram  an electromagnet is part of its replacement an electromagnet is effectively a magnet that is turned on by running an electric current through it cutting the current turns it off while increasing or decreasing the strength of the current increases and decreases the power of the magnet it can be used to measure a kilogram very precisely thanks to something called a kibble balance which is essentially a set of scales however instead of using weights it uses an electromagnet to pull down one side because the electric current flowing through the electromagnet can be increased decreased and measured very very accurately it means scientists can define any weight  in this case a kilogram  by the amount of electrical current needed to balance the scale  this radical overhaul of how weights are defined means scientists wont have to fly off to paris every time they need precise kilograms beyond just replacing wornout weights however it highlights the versatility and potential of electromagnets from their use in electricity generation to creating hard drives and powering speakers the simple way to make a magnet magnets and electricity might at first not seem closely connected one powers your fridge the other attaches holiday souvenirs to it the former certainly feels more useful however the relationship between magnetic and electric fields is as close as two sides of the same coin they are both aspects of the same force electromagnetism electromagnetism is very complicated and therere still aspects of it that are unknown today  it was thinking about electromagnetism that led einstein to come up with his theory of special relativity  however actually creating an electromagnet is relatively straightforward all matter is made up of atoms every neutral atoms core is made up of static neutrons and protons with electrons spinning around them these electrons have a charge and a mass giving the electrons a tiny magnetic field  in most matter all atoms are aligned in random ways and effectively all cancel each other out to render the matter nonmagnetic but if the atoms and their electrons can all be aligned in the same direction then the object becomes magnetic a magnet can stick to an object like a paperclip because its permanent magnetic field realigns the atoms in the paperclip to make it temporarily magnetic too  allowing the magnetic forces to line up and the materials to attract however once the paper clip is taken away from the magnet its atoms fall out of sync and point in random directions cancelling out each others magnetic fields once again whether a material can become magnetic or not relies on a similar principal as to whether it can conduct electricity materials like wood and glass are poor conductors because their atoms have a strong hold over their electrons by contrast materials like metals have a loose hold on their electrons and so are good conductors and easily magnetised nickle cobalt and iron are described as ferromagnetic because their atoms can stay in sync making them a permanent magnet but when magnets really become useful is when electricity gets involved putting magnets to work running an electric current through a material with a weak hold on its electrons causes them to align creating an electromagnetic field because of the relationships between electric and magnetic fields the strength of the electromagnet can also be altered by increasing or decreasing the current while switching the flow of the current will flip its north and south poles having this much control over a magnetic field makes it very useful in everyday life including how we generate electricity find out how we rewind a generator core in a clean room at the heart of drax power station inside each of the six generator cores at drax power station is a 120tonne rotor  when a voltage is applied this piece of equipment becomes a massive electromagnet when steam powers the turbines to rotate it at 3000 rpm the rotors very powerful magnetic field knocks electrons in the copper bars of the surrounding stator out of place sending them zooming through the metal in turn generating an electrical current that is sent out to the grid the 660 megawatts mw of active power draxs unit 1 can export into the national transmission system is enough to power 13 million homes for an hour beyond just producing electricity however electromagnets are also used to make it useful to everyday life almost anything electric that depends on moving parts from pumping loud speakers to circuit breakers to the motors of electric cars depend on electromagnets as more decarbonisation efforts lead to greater electrification of areas like transport  electromagnets will remain vital to daily life into the future tags decarbonisation  electric vehicles evs  electricity  electricity generation  technology  transport how to get more evs on the roads 25 january 2019 electrification from school runs to goods deliveries getting from a to b is crucial to life in modern britain however a progress report by the committee on climate change ccc found that in 2017 transport was the largest greenhouse gas ghgemitting sector in the uk accounting for 28 of total emissions within domestic transport cars  vans and hgvs are the three most significant sources of emissions accounting for 87 of the sectors emissions a zero carbon future relies on a major shift away from petrol and diesel engines to electric transport a recent report energy revolution a global outlook  by academics from imperial college london and e4tech commissioned by drax examines the decarbonisation efforts of 25 major countries the report found the uk ranked sixth in sales of new electric vehicles evs in the 12 months to september 2018 and seventh for the number of charging points available the governments road to zero strategy outlines the countrys target for as many as 70 of new car sales to be ultralow emission by 2030 alongside up to 40 of new vans it has however been criticised by the committee on climate change as not being ambitious enough  a committee of mps has suggested 2032 becomes the official target date for banning new petrol and diesel cars  rather than 2040 called for in the strategy even as the range of evs on the market grows getting more lowemission vehicles on roads will require incentives and infrastructure improvements heres how some of the countries leading the shift to electrified transport are driving adoption expanding charging infrastructure one of major barriers to ev adoption is a lack of public charging facilitates coupled with reliability issues across a network that includes both old hardware and a plethora of apps and different connections  no one wants to set off on a long journey unsure of whether theyll be able to find a recharging point before their battery goes flat according to the energy revolution report there is one charger for every 5000 people in the uk compared to one for every 500 people in norway the leading country for charging points the scandinavian countrys government has invested heavily in its policy of placing two fast charging stations for every 50 km of main road covering 100 of the cost of installation government support has also been crucial in second and third ranked countries the netherlands and sweden respectively the dutch living lab smart charging is a collaboration between government and private organisations to use wind and solar to change vehicles while sweden has combined its klimatklivet investment scheme for both public and private charge points with experiments such as charging roads  china where half of the worlds 300000 charge points are located has issued a directive calling for the construction of 48 million electric charging points around the country by 2020  its also assisting private investments to make charging stations more financially viable the uks road to zero strategy is to expand charging infrastructure through a 400 million joint investment fund with private investors draxs energising britain report found the uk is on track to meet its 2030 target of 28000 installed chargers ahead of time however deployment still clusters around london the south east and scotland more direct government incentives or policies may be needed to balance this disparity and in the uk the scottish government is leading the pack with a 2032 ban on new petrol and diesel cars plus a range of initiatives including public charging networks and the switched on towns and city fund  charging points are necessary for electrified roads however its a chickenandegg situation more chargers dont mean more evs getting more evs on roads also requires financial incentive money makes the wheels go around putting infrastructure in place is one thing but the reality is evs are expensive especially new ones and cold hard cash is an important driver of adoption financial incentives have been a part of norways policies since the 1980s with the countrys high fuel prices  compared to the us for example further helping to make evs attractive current benefits for ev owners include no import or purchase taxes no vat no road tax no road tolls half price on ferries and free municipal parking there are also nonfinancial incentives such as buslane usage sweden the second ranked country for new ev sales in 2018 is a similar case where high fuel prices are combined with a carrotandstick approach of subsidies for evs and rising road taxes for fossil fuelpowered vehicles including hybrids the uk has had a grant scheme in place since 2011 but last year removed hybrid vehicles from eligibility and dropped the maximum grant for new ev buyers from 4500 to 3500  evs are also exempt from road taxes in april 2019 transport for london is implementing a low emissions zone ulez which exempts evs from a daily charge subsidies for both buyers and vehicle manufacturers have been a cornerstone of chinas policies with support coming up to around 15000 per vehicle  chinese ev buyers can also skip the lottery system for new license plates the country has in place to reduce congestion heavy subsidies have allowed the country to claim as much as 50 of the entire ev passenger market however it makes change expensive and the government is now preparing to find a more sustainable way of driving adoption preparing for transport beyond subsidies china isnt afraid to strongarm manufacturers into building more evs companies with annual sales of more than 30000 vehicles are required to meet a quota of at least 10 evs or hybrids  however the government has begun to scale back subsidies in the hope it will drive innovation in areas such as batteries robotics and automation which will in turn reduce the price for end consumers norway which owes so much of its decarbonisation leadership in lowcarbon transport to subsidies is also grappling with how to move away from this model as evs creep increasingly towards the norm the taxes lost through evs exclusions become more economically noticeable while the government says the subsidies will remain in place until at least 2020 different political parties are calling to make the market commercially viable  there is also concern the schemes only pass on savings to those who can afford new ev models  rather than the wider population who face higher taxes for being unable to upgrade its not just governments responsibility to make new markets for evs sustainable but for business to innovate within the area too drax group ceo will gardiner recently said his company must help to  ensure noone is left behind through the energy revolution  thats a view welcomed by politicians from all sides of the political spectrum concerned not just about mitigating manmade climate change but also to ensure a just transition during the economys decarbonisation energy and clean growth minister claire perry spoke at an aldersgate group event in london in january its been very easy in the past for concerns about the climate to be dismissed as the worries of the few not the many luckily weve been able to strip out a lot of the myths surrounding decarbonisation and costs but we have to be mindful that this is a problem which will have to be solved by the many not just the middle class many countries have set ambitious targets for when the ban of new petrol and diesel

claimed think different and in doing so set about changing the world the renewable electricity sources we take for granted today all started with such people who for one reason or another tried something new these are the stories of the people behind five sources of renewable electricity whose inventions and ideas could help power the world towards a zerocarbon future the magicians hydro house water wheel by the side of the trail to the power house at cragside rothbury northumberland using rushing rivers as a source of power dates back centuries as a mechanised way of grinding grains for flour the first reference to a watermill dates from all the way back to the third century bce  however hydropower also played a big role in the early history of electricity generation  the first hydroelectric scheme first came into action in 1878 six years before the invention of the modern steam turbine  what important device did this early source of emissionsfree electricity power a single lamp in the northumberland home of victorian inventor william armstrong this wasnt the only feature that made the house ahead of its time water pressure also helped power a hydraulic lift and a rotating spit in the kitchen  while the house also featured hot and cold running water and an early dishwasher one contemporary visitor dubbed the house a palace of a modern magician the first commercial hydropower power plant however opened on vulcan street in appleton wisconsin in 1882 to provide electricity to two local paper mills as well as the mill owner hj rogers home after a false start on 27 september the vulcan street plant kicked into life in earnest on 30 september generating about 125 kilowatts kw of electricity it was very nearly americas first ever commercial power plant but was beaten to the accolade by thomas edisons pearl street plant in new york which opened a little less than a month earlier the switch to silicon that made solar possible when the international space station is in sunlight about 60 the electricity its solar arrays generate is used to charge the stations batteries the batteries power the station when it is not in the sun for much of the 20 th century solar photovoltaic power generation didnt appear in many more places than on calculators and satellites but now with more largescale and rooftop arrays popping up solar is expected to generate a significant portion of the worlds future energy its been a long journey for solar power from its origins back in 1839 when 19year old aspiring physicist edmond becquerel first noticed the photovoltaic effect the frenchman found that shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution created an electric current  he did not however have any explanation for why this happened american inventor charles fritts was the first to take solar seriously as a source of largescale generation  he hoped to compete with thomas edisons coal powered plants in 1883 when he made the first recognisable solar panel using the element selenium however they were only about 1 efficient and never deployed at scale it would not be until 1953 when scientists calvin fuller gerald pearson and daryl chapin working at bell labs cracked the switch from selenium to silicon that the modern solar panel was created bell labs unveiled the breakthrough invention to the world the following year using it to power a small toy ferris wheel and a radio transmitter fuller pearson and chapins solar panel was only 6 efficient a big step forward for the time but today panels can convert more than 40 of the suns light into electricity  the wind pioneers who believed in selfgeneration offshore wind farm near øresund bridge between sweden and denmark like hydropower wind has long been harnessed as a source of power with the earliest examples of windpowered grain mills and hydro pumps appearing in persia as early as 500 bc the first electricitygenerating windmill was used to power the mansion of ohiobased inventor charles brush the 60foot 183 metres wooden tower featured 144 blades and supplied about 12 kw of electricity to the house charles brushs wind turbine charged a dozen batteries each with 34 cells the turbine was erected in 1888 and powered the house for two decades brush wasnt just a wind power pioneer either and in the basement of the mansion sat 12 batteries that could be recharged and act as electricity sources small turbines generating between 5 kw and 25 kw were important at the turn of the 19 th into the 20 th century in the us when they helped bring electricity to remote rural areas however over in denmark scientist and teacher poul la cour had his own grander vision for wind power  la cours breakthroughs included using a regulator to maintain a steady stream of power and discovering that a turbine with fewer blades spinning quickly is more efficient than one with many blades turning slowly he was also a strong advocate for what might now be recognised as decentralisation  he believed wind turbines provided an important social purpose in supplying small communities and farms with a cheap dependable source of electricity away from corporate influence in 2017 denmark had more than 53 gigawatts gw of installed wind capacity  accounting for 44 of the countrys power generation the prince and the power plant larderello italy italian princes arent a regular sight in the history books of renewable energy but at the turn of the last century on a tuscan hillside piero ginori conti prince of trevignano set about harnessing natural geysers to generate electricity in 1904 he had become head of a boric acid extraction firm founded by his wifes greatgrandfather his plan for the business included improving the quality of products increasing production and lowering prices but to do this he needed a steady stream of cheap electricity in 1905 he harnessed the dry steam which lacks moisture preventing corrosion of turbine blades from the geographically active area near larderello in southern tuscany to drive a turbine and power five light bulbs  encouraged by this conti expanded the operation into a prototype power plant capable of powering larderellos main industrial plants and residential buildings it evolved into the worlds first commercial geothermal power plant in 1913 supplying 250 kw of electricity to villages around the region by the end of 1943 there was 132 megawatts mw of installed capacity in the area but as the main source of electricity for central italys entire rail network it was bombed heavily in world war two following reconstruction and expansion the region has grown to reach current capacity of more than 800 mw globally there is now more than 83 gw of installed geothermal capacity  the engineer who took on an oil crisis with wood compressed wood pellet storage domes at baton rouge transit drax biomass port facility on the mississippi river while sawmills had experimented with waste products as a power sources and compressed sawdust sold as domestic fuel  it wasnt until the energy crisis of the 1970s that the term biomass was coined and wood pellets became a serious alternative to fossil fuels as a response to the 1973 yom kippur war the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries opec placed oil embargoes against several nations including the uk and us the result was a global price increase from 3 in october 1973 to 12 in march 1974 with prices even higher in the us where the countrys dependence on imported fossil fuels was acutely exposed  one of the most vulnerable sectors to booms in oil prices was the aviation industry to tackle the growing scarcity of petroleumbased fuels boeing looked to fuelefficiency engineer jerry whitfield  his task was to find an alternative fuel for industries such as manufacturing which were hit particularly hard by the oil shortage and subsequent recession this would in turn leave more oil for planes wood pellets from morehouse bioenergy a drax biomass pellet plant in northern louisiana being unloaded at baton rouge transit for storage and onward travel by ship to england whitfield teamed up with ken tucker who  inspired by pelletised animal feed  was experimenting with fuel pellets for industrial furnaces the pelletisation approach combined with whitfields knowledge of forcedair furnace technology opened a market beyond just industrial power sources and whitfield eventually left boeing to focus on domestic heating stoves and pellet production one of the lasting effects of the oil crisis was a realisation in many western countries of the need to diversify electricity generation  prompting expansion of renewable sources and experiments with biomass cofiring since then biomass pellet technology has built on its legacy as an abundant source of lowcarbon renewable energy with largescale pellet production beginning in sweden in 1992 production has continued to grow as more countries decarbonise electricity generation and move away from fossil fuels since those original pioneers first harnessed earths renewable sources for electricity generation the cost of doing so has dropped dramatically and efficiency skyrocketed the challenge now is in implementing the capacity and technology to build a safe stable and lowcarbon electricity system tags electricity  electricity generation  sustainability
