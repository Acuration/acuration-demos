electric insights how close is great britains electricity to zerocarbon emissions 15 may 2019 power generation demand for electricity might have been 6 lower in the first three months of 2019 than in last years first quarter but the demand for lower carbon power is only growing and theres more pressure than ever for global industries to decarbonise more rapidly aided by a significantly milder winter than last year  great britains electricity sector continued to make further progress in reducing carbon emissions in the first quarter q1 of 2019 the carbon intensity of great britains electricity was almost 20 lower in q1 2019 than in the same period last year this was driven by a significant decrease in coal usage with 581 coalfree hours in total over the period  eight times more than in q1 2018 this trend has only increased with may seeing the countrys first coalfree week in modern times the findings come from electric insights  a report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london that analyses great britains electricity consumption and looks at what the future might hold as public commercial and political demand for lower carbon emissions mounts the question for the power system is can it truly reach zeroemissions keeping a zerocarbon system stable quarter after quarter the carbon intensity of great britains electricity system has declined from 545 grams of carbon dioxide co 2  per kilowatt hour gkwh in q1 2012 to just over 200 gkwh last quarter for a single hour carbon emissions have fallen as low as just 56 gkwh but how soon can that figure reach all the way down to netzero carbon emissions the national grids electricity system operator eso believes it could be as soon as 2025  but some serious changes are needed to make it possible for the system to operate safely and efficiently when you have fewer sources offering balancing services like reserve power inertia frequency response and voltage control  the national grid eso believes an approach that establishes a marketplace for trading services holds the solution the hope is that competition will breed new innovation and bring new technologies such as gridscale storage and ai into the commercial energy markets offering reserve power and more accurate forecasting for solar and wind power for the meantime weatherdependent technologies are a key source of renewable electricity in great britain with wind making up more than 20 of all generation in q1 2019 however with wind capacity only expected to increase how should the system react when its not an option read the full article coauthored by julian leslie head of national control national grid eso how low can we go we cannot control the weather  but we can harness its power today there are around 20 gigawatts gw of wind capacity installed around great britain and this is forecast to double to 40 gw in the next seven years however average wind output can fluctuate between 2 gw one day and 12 gw the next  as happened twice in january it highlights the ongoing needs for flexibility and diversity of sources in the electricity system even as it decarbonises there are a number of ways to make up for shortfalls in wind generation the most obvious of which is through other existing sources there is more solar installed around the county than any source of generation except gas at 129 gw and sun power helped meet demand during a wind drought last summer  solar averaged 13 gw over the last 12 months this is more than coal which accounted for 11 gw however storage will also be important in delivering low or zerocarbon sources of electricity when there is neither wind nor sufficient sunlight at present this includes pumped storage and some battery technologies but in future will include greater use of gridscale lithiumion batteries as well as vehicletogrid systems that can take advantage of power stored in idle electric cars httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201903drax_how_pumped_storage_works_animationv1mp4 new fuels particularly hydrogen also have the potential to meet demand and help create a wider lowercarbon economy for heating  as well as vehicle fuel with water as the only emission hydrogen can be produced from natural gas or using excess electricity from renewable sources or through carbon capture from industrial emissions  it can then be stored for a long time and at scale before being used to generate electricity rapidly when needed another increasingly important source of great britains electricity is interconnectors however they are not yet being used in a way that can support gaps in the electricity system with northern european countries normally all experiencing the same weather  and wind levels  at the same time read the full article what to do when the wind doesnt blow a bigger future for interconnection great britain added a new power source to its electricity system in q1 2019 in the form of belgium the opening of the 600 million nemo link between kent and zeebrugge added another 1 gw of interconnection capacity it joins connections to france the netherlands northern ireland and the republic of ireland to bring great britains total interconnection capacity to 5 gw these links accounted for 79 of the 78 terawatt hours twh of electricity consumed over the quarter electricity from imports also set new records for a daily average of 43 gw on 24 february  accounting for 129 of total consumption and a monthly average in march when it made up 106 of consumption  these records represent the first time great britain fell below 90 for electricity selfsufficiency with 34 gw of new interconnectors under construction coming online by 2022 and 91 gw more planned to be completed over the next five years great britains neighbours are set to play a growing role in the countrys electricity mix however while interconnectors offer an often costeffective way for great britain to ensure electricity supply meets demand the carbon intensity of neighbouring countries electricity should also be considered read the full article 10 of electricity now generated abroad the need for crossborder decarbonisation the new link to belgium has imported rather than exported electricity every day since it began operations as belgium has the lowest natural gas prices in europe and its power stations pay 16 per tonne less for carbon emissions than their british counterparts this makes it cheaper to import and less carbon intense than electricity from the more coaldependant netherlands and ireland planned links to germany and denmark could allow great britain to import more renewable power however if there is a wind drought across northern europe these countries often turn to their emissionsheavy coal or even dirtier lignite sources france is currently great britains cleanest source of imports mostly using nuclear and renewable generation however when the north sea link opens in 2021 it will give great britain access to norways abundance of hydropower to plug gaps in renewable generation considering the carbon intensity of great britains imports is important because the decarbonisation needed to address the global climate change emergency cant be solved by one country alone for electricity emissions to go as low as they can it takes collaboration that goes across borders read the full article where do britains imports come from explore the quarters data in detail by visiting electricinsightscouk  read the full report  commissioned by drax electric

renewable records 15 february 2019 power generation how low carbon can britains electricity go as low as zero carbon still seems a long way off but every year records continue to be broken for all types of renewable electricity 2018 was no different over the full 12month period 53 of all britains electricity was produced from low carbon sources which includes both renewable and nuclear generation up from 50 in 2017 the increase in low carbon shoved fossil fuel generation down to just 47 of the countrys overall mix the findings come from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report found electricitys average carbon intensity fell 8 to 217 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatthour of electricity generated gkwh and while this continues an ongoing decline that keeps the country on track to meet the committee on climate changes target of 100 gkwh by 2030 it was however the slowest rate of decline since 2013 it also highlights that while britain can continue to decarbonise in 2019 the challenges of the years ahead will make it tougher to continue to break the records it has over the past few years httpswwwdraxcomwpcontentuploads201902drax_record_highs_and_lowsv03mp4 the highs and lows of 2018 last year every type of renewable record that could be broken was broken wind solar and biomass all set new 10year highs for respective annual monthly and daily generation as well as records for instantaneous output generation over a halfhour period and share of the electricity mix the result was a new instantaneous generation high of 21 gigawatts gw for renewables 58 of total output wind had a particularly good year of renewable recordsetting it broke the 15 gw barrier for instantaneous output for the first time and accounted for 48 of total generation during a half hour period at 5am on 18 december  overall low carbon generation which takes into account renewables and nuclear both that generated in britain and imported from french reactors had an equally recordbreaking year with an average of almost 18 gw across the full year and a new record for instantaneous output of 30 gw at 1pm on 14 june  nearly 90 of total generation over the half hour period while low carbon and individual renewable electricity sources hit record highs there were also some milestone lows coal accounted for an average of just 5 of electricity output over the year hitting a record low in june when it made up just 1 of that months total generation fossil fuel output overall had a similarly significant decline hitting a decadelow of 15 gw on average for 2018  44 of total generation over the year one fossil fuel that bucked the trend however was gas which hit an alltime output of 27 gw for instantaneous generation on the night of 26 january there was low wind on that day last year plus much of the nuclear fleet was out of action for reactor maintenance in one case with seaweed clogging a cooling system  this was all aided by an ongoing decline in overall demand as ever smarter and more efficient devices helped the country reach the decades lowest annual average demand of 335 gw more impressive when considering how much the countrys electricity system has changed over the last decade however is the record low demand net of wind and solar only 99 gw was needed from other energy technologies at 4am on 14 june  how the generation mix has changed the most remarkable change in britains electricity mix has been how far out of favour coal has fallen from its position as the primary source from 2012 to 2014 in the space of four years it has crashed down to sixth in the mix with nuclear wind imports biomass and gas all playing bigger roles in the system this sudden decline in 2015 was the result of the carbon price nearly doubling from 954 to 1808 per tonne of carbon dioxide co 2  in april making profitable coal power stations lossmaking overnight  with coal continuing to crash out of the mix biomass has become the mostused solid fuel in britains electricity system interconnectors are also playing a more significant part in britains electricity mix since their introduction to the capacity market in 2015  thanks to increased interconnection to europe britain is now a net importer of electricity with 22 twh brought in from europe in 2018  nine times more than it exported while more of britains electricity comes from underwater power lines less of it is being generated by water itself hydros decline from the fifth largest source of electricity to the eighth is the most noticeable shift outside coals slide new largescale hydro installations are expensive and a secondary focus for the government compared with cheaper renewables hydros role in the electricity mix is also affected by drier hotter summers which means lower water levels for solar by contrast the warmer weather will see it play a bigger role and its expected to overtake coal in either 2019 or 2020 what is unlikely to change in the nearfuture however is the position at the top in 2018 gas generated 115 twh  more than nuclear and wind combined but this is just one constant in a future of multiple moving and uncertain parts 2019 a year of unpredictability britain is on course to leave the eu on 29 march the effects this will have on the electricity system are still unknown but one influential factor could be britains exit from the emissions trading scheme ets the euwide market which sets prices of carbon emitted by generators this may mean that rather than paying a carbon price on top of the ets as is currently the case britains generators will only have to pay the new fixed carbon tax of 16 per tonne the uk government says will come into play in april topped up by the carbon price support cps of 18tonne lower prices for carbon relative to the fluctuating ets  cps could make coal suddenly economically viable again the black stuff could potentially become cheaper than other power sources this aboutturn could cause the carbon intensity of electricity generation to bounce up again in one or more years between 2019 and 2025 the date all coal power units will have been decommissioned the knockon effect of lower carbon prices combined with fluctuations in the pound against the euro could see a reverse from imports to exports as britain pumps its cheap potentially coalgenerated electricity over to its european neighbours thats if the interconnectors can continue to function as efficiently as they do at present which some parties believe wont be the case if human traders have to replace the automatic trading systems currently in place sizewell b nuclear power station a reversal of importing to exporting could also reduce the amount of nuclear electricity coming into the country from france future nuclear generation in britain also looks in doubt with toshiba and hitachis decisions to shelve their respective plans for new nuclear reactors which could leave a 9 gw hole in the lowcarbon base capacity that nuclear normally provides renewables have the potential to fill the gap and become an even bigger part of the electricity system but this will require a push for new installations 2018 saw a 60 drop in new wind and solar installations and less than 2 gw of new renewable capacity came onto the system making it the slowest year for renewable growth since 2010 britains electricity has seen significant change over the last decade and 2018 once again saw the country take significant strides towards a low carbon future but challenges lie ahead records might be harder to break but it is important the momentum continues to move towards renewable sustainable electricity explore the quarters data in detail by

facilitated by the colleges consultancy company  imperial consultants  tags energy policy  coal  electric insights  decarbonisation  electricity  electricity generation three things last summer tells us about great britains electric future 7 november 2018 power generation great britains electricity system has had its robustness tested at both ends of the thermometer in 2018 first the onceinadecade low temperatures of the  beast from the east saw electricity demand reach its highest peak in three years on 1 march as the country turned on electric heaters and extra lighting following fast on its heels was an unusually hot dry and still summer that pushed demand up by the equivalent of adding a second scotland to the system  and required solar generation to make up for a wind drought and all of this happened in the first half of the year so far the second half of the year has seen fewer instances of freak weather which has meant fewer peaks in the power system while uneventful in this sense the last quarter of great britains power does go some way towards showing us what we might expect from the system in the future the findings come from electric insights  an independent report written by researchers at imperial college london and commissioned by drax that analyses the countrys power and hints at what we might expect in the future breaking renewable records will get boring quarter after quarter great britain breaks new renewable records and q3 2018 was no exception the threemonth period from july through september saw total capacity of renewable sources exceed fossil fuels for the first time great britain now has 406 gigawatts gw of gas coal diesel and oilfired power generation capacity compared to 419 gw of capacity from wind solar biomass hydro and waste sources to put this into perspective at the start of the decade fossil fuel capacity was seven times that of renewables since 2010 renewables have grown sixfold wind passed 20 gw of installed capacity in september and is now the countrys largest renewable source solar has slowed in growth but remains the second biggest renewable with 13 gw of capacity biomass is now the third largest source of renewable electricity thanks to the coaltobiomass conversions of lynemouth power station and draxs unit 4  which together added 1 gw more renewable electricity to the system along with these conversions a quarter of the countrys coal capacity retired in the last year leaving just six generators in operation while this shift to renewables is helping decarbonise great britains power system the increasing intermittency that comes with it means balancing the grid is becoming more complicated read the full article coauthored by luke clark at renewableuk renewables leapfrog fossil capacity as balancing the network becomes more complex it could grow more expensive the daily cost of running the transmission system  which manages the flow of electricity from generators to consumers  has doubled over the last four years this growth has been steady since 2010 but q3 2018 saw the cost reach onesixth higher than the previous record in q3 2017 over this quarter balancing the system on average cost 38 million per day with three days seeing costs exceed 10 million in turn adding 6 to the overall wholesale price of electricity part of the reason for the increased costs is that need for balancing services such as voltage control reserve power and frequency response spike when there are high levels of intermittent renewables such as wind and solar on the system as this type of generation cant be perfectly calculated it is important for national grid to ensure there are flexible reserve sources running to plug gaps and help move electricity around the grid  both of which incur balancing costs for example in september balancing costs spiked several times as a result of increases in wind power the rising price highlights that for the grid to function its not just a matter of generating enough electricity to meet demand where and when it is generated is as important to maintain its stability and with everincreasing levels of intermittent renewables the need for stabilising services will grow read the full article the cost of staying in balance the cost of generating electricity may rise which will have knock on effects its not just balancing costs however that are driving up the cost of electricity dayahead market prices have risen by 50 over the last year  from an average of 42mwh in q3 2017 to 60mwh last quarter this was not the result of spikes caused by events such as the beast from the east or the summers world cup final but by a gradual creeping up of prices caused by a combination of increasing gas prices and carbon emissions costs as well as a weaker pound in the wake of ongoing brexit negotiations gas power stations are six times more influential on power price than any other generation technology but with global gas prices rising 50 the countrys primary source of flexible generation is becoming costlier the knock on effect of this 10year high gas price was not only an impact on consumers pockets but also a resurgence in coal which became cheaper than gas and led to a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation for a period during the quarter  adding to this the european emissions trading scheme ets increased the price of carbon dioxide co 2  emissions by a factor of four over the past 12 months pushing up the cost of wholesale electricity even further the international nature of the electricity system also makes prices vulnerable to currency fluctuations and a weakening pound made the impact greater the currency devaluations following the eu referendum are continuing to contribute to this and ofgem found it caused an 18 increase in electricity prices  this isnt the referendums only effect if the uk leaves the eu next year under a nodeal scenario the country would also exit the ets removing a component of the current total carbon price there are plans to replace this with a new tax adding to the existing uk carbon price support cps but this would only come into effect from april 2019 leaving q1 with just the cps  effectively making it cheaper to emit carbon during that threemonth period which in turn adds a risk of more carbonintensive sources becoming more economically viable than renewable sources while there is little great britain can do to influence international fuel prices it can alter domestic policies to influence the price for consumers making heavily emitting fuels economically prohibitive and incentivising more lower carbon and renewable sources onto the system can reduce dependency on imported fuels and cut carbon costs read the full article

and ancillary services coal comeback pushes up uks carbon emissions iain staffell imperial college london 17 september 2018 opinion 10year high gas prices 1 have prompted a resurgence in coalfired power across britain  and with it a 15 increase in carbon emissions from electricity generation if coalfired electricity remains cheaper than gasfired  as analysts predict  we could see the first yearonyear rise in carbon emissions from britains power sector in six years this highlights the importance of retaining a strong carbon price if we are to ensure the successful decarbonisation of the power system is not reversed after dropping to a historic low of just 02 gw during june and july britains coal power generation doubled in august and has shot up to 2 gw during the first week of september the last time coal output was this high was during the beast from the east  when temperatures plummeted in march with these coal power stations running instead of more efficient gas plants britain is producing an extra 1000 tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  every hour 2 carbon emissions from electricity generation are up 15 as a result these coal plants are not running solely because they are needed to meet peak demand but because gas prices have risen sharply and carbon prices have not kept up making coal power stations more economic to run than gasfired ones it became cheaper to generate power from coal than from gas see thick lines chart below in late august even though carbon prices now double the cost of generating electricity from coal 3 coal plants are consistently in the money at the moment meaning they can generate power profitably all day and night estimated cost of generating electricity from coal and gas in quarter 3 thick lines and the output from coal power stations in britain thin line the cost of emitting co 2 has increased sharply up 45 so far this year due to the ongoing rally in european emissions trading scheme eu ets prices rising carbon prices should make gas more economical to burn as it emits less than half the co 2 of coal however wholesale gas prices have also risen 40 since the start of the year as supplies and storage are squeezed in the run up to winter  gas prices are at a tenyear high currently 14 above their previous quarterlyaverage peak back in 2013 see chart below  these rising costs are feeding through into wholesale power prices which have risen by a third over the past year to hit 60mwh the estimated cost of generating electricity from fossil fuels over the last 20 years along with the cost of emitting co 2  britains carbon price strengthened dramatically through 201415 due to the government implementing a carbon price support scheme this caused gas to become competitive against coal for power generation leading to carbon emissions from the power sector halving  unless britains carbon price can once again make up the gap between coal and gas prices we risk rolling back some of the worldleading gains made on cleaning up our electricity system  the committee on climate change has made it clear that power is the only sector that is pulling its weight when it comes to decarbonising the uk clean electricity could power lowcarbon vehicles and heating but this opportunity will be wasted if the electricity comes from highcarbon coal so what can be done the sharp rise in gas prices hints at a lack of flexibility in the energy system britain came uncomfortably close to gas shortages in march in part due to the closure of the countrys largest gas storage site with nearly half of the electricity generated in britain coming from gas plus fivesixths of household heat diversifying into other  cleaner  energy sources would help insulate consumers and businesses from price spikes no one country has the power to determine international fuel prices several factors have come together to push up gas prices  including a lack of transmission capacity depleted stores of gas after the long hot summer and a lack of wind power increased output from gasfired stations suppliers which dont wish to be caught short after the beast from the east are also stocking up on gas any kneejerk reaction to try and lower the cost of electricity for example slashing the cost of carbon emissions may only have a shortterm impact and could easily lead to longerterm damage such as the resurgence of coal which would require further interventions in the future britain does have control over its carbon price its power stations and industry currently pay the emissions trading system price determined on the europewide market which has fluctuated wildly over the past week between 25 22 and 19 17 per tonne plus 18 per tonne in carbon price support which goes to the treasury this needs to be maintained or

for the first time ever  for 12 days it dropped all the way to zero spurred on by the beginnings of an uncharacteristically dry hot summer and a jump in solar generation the possibility of the country going entirely coalfree for a full summer now looks more achievable than ever in modern times this is one of the key findings from electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written independently by researchers from imperial college london it found that across q2 2018 there were as many coalfree hours as in the whole of 2016 and 2017 combined and while the reports findings are hugely positive they also hint at where development is still needed what else does the performance of this quarter tell us about what we can expect in the power sector  in great britain and around the world great britain is slashing coal generation the rest of the world needs to catch up great britain has reduced its coalfired power generation by fourfifths over the last five years last quarter the countrys coal fleet ran at just 3 of its 129 gigawatt gw capacity coal capacity is now lower than the capacity of solar pv panels 131 gw installed nationwide with the most recent decline resulting from draxs conversion of a fourth unit from coal to biomass  when coal generation was running it primarily provided system balancing services overnight in may and june rather than baseload electricity however this positive trend is not seen around the world the share of coal in national power systems during 2017 globally coal still provides 38 of the worlds electricity  the same amount it did 30 years ago this comes despite efforts in europe and north america to move away from coal and growing investment into renewable generation and technologies overall europes coal generation dropped from 39 to 22 over the last 30 years  despite some countries  such as poland and serbia  still drawing significant generation from the fossil fuel the us has also reduced its coal generation from 57 to 31 over the past 30 years as natural gas proves more economical even in an era of procoal policies  coal train at rail station in india however in the middle east and africa which draw significant generation from their oil and gas reserves and south america where coal accounts for less than 3 of generation total coal generation is growing in fact globally only seven countries use less coal today than 30 years ago germany poland spain ukraine the us great britain and canada electric insights attributes part of this global growth to the continued increase in demand for electricity particularly in asia china south korea and indonesia collectively burn 10 times more coal than they did 30 years ago indias coal habit has also increased over the past decade to account for 76 of its electricity generation while japans usage has grown from 15 to 34 in the same period as well as the stresses created by growing demand this highlights a global disparity in the

closed to entrants contracts for differences the future of which is uncertain for mature technologies like onshore wind and solar and feedin tariffs for rooftop solar installations which will close in april 2019 the end of these initiative paints a hazy picture of how future renewable capacity will be brought into the system nuclear capacity also looks unlikely to expand at the rate needed to plug gaps in demand with half of the countrys fleet expected to close for safety reasons by 2025 the hinkley point c nuclear power station meanwhile is only expected to come online at the end of that year  read the full article here has britains power sector decarbonisation stalled ramsgate kent during summer 2018 heatwave weather will continue to play a major part in renewable generation if the first quarter of 2018 was defined by low temperatures and heavy snowfall  the second quarter saw the impact of the opposite in weather conditions from 23 june a heatwave set in around the country that saw temperatures increase by 33 o c in a week driving demand to jump 860 mw  the equivalent of an extra 25 million households or an area the size of scotland  the increase in demand isnt as drastic as when cold fronts hit but if summers continue to get hotter this could change today wintertime demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it drops below 14 o c as electric heaters are plugged in to aid largely gasbased centralheating systems when the mercury rises however demand increases by 350 mw for every degree rise over 20 o c as businesses turn on air conditioning and the countrys refrigerators work harder these heatwave spikes are at the moment more easily dealt with than winter storms while the beast from the east saw demand reaching a peak of 533 gw junes topped out at 325 gw the clear skies and long days of june also meant solar pv generation soared making up for the wind drought caused by the highpressure weather wind output floated between 03 gw and 43 gw in june far below its quarter peak to 13 gw however solar made up for this by peaking past 8 gw for 13 days in june and setting a new record of 939 gw at lunchtime on 27 june read the full articles how the heat

enough for aircon not too cold to put the heating on in march we saw how the beast from the east caused a surge in demand now the long summer heatwave is doing the same june 23 rd marked the start of the heatwave with daytime temperatures surpassing 30c in scotland and wales the last week of june was 33c warmer than the previous week and demand was 860 mw higher see chart below  this rise is equivalent to power demand from an extra 25 million households this reflects the growing role of air conditioning and refrigeration in shops and cooling for data centres global electricity demand from cooling is rising dramatically and is seen as a  blind spot  in the global energy system this will become more important as global temperatures and more importantly global incomes rise however it is easier to deal with than cold spells during winter because demand is low and solar pv output is high below 14c demand increases by 750 mw for every degree it gets colder as buildings need more heating around a tenth of british homes have electric heating as do half of commercial and public buildings  and while the uk is not synonymous with air conditioners demand rises by 350 mw for each degree that temperature rises above 20c this effect may well grow stronger in the coming years national grid expect that the peak load from air conditioners will triple in the coming decade perhaps events such as the current prolonged heatwave may spur more households to invest in air conditioning read the press release explore power grid data during the heatwave beginning 23 rd june commissioned by

hottest may day bank holiday on record its hard to believe march saw the coldest spring day since records began but thats exactly what happened during the six days the beast from the east hit europe from 26 february to 3 march great britains weather sunk to a onceinadecade level of cold dipping on 1 march when thermometers dropped to an average of 38 degrees celsius across central england these extreme conditions drove electricity demand up 10 as darker days required extra lighting and more people plugged in energyintensive electric heaters to keep warm after successive years of milder winters  january to march made for a period in which the weather played a pivotal role in dictating how the countrys electricity was generated according to electric insights  a quarterly report commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the report highlights how despite the storm disrupting power transmission in parts of the country and sensationalist headlines suggesting lights could go out at any moment the electricity system held up well in the adverse conditions the beast from the east tests energy security the subzero temperatures brutal wind and siberianlevel snow blizzards that hit great britain for six days between february and march proved a real test for the electricity system the evening of 1 march saw demand reach 533 gw  its highest peak in three years this had a knockon effect on the hourahead price of electricity which was 50 higher during march than the same period in 2017 the weather had a notable impact on the types of generation needed to power the county with fossil fuels playing an important role at the expense of carbon emission levels over the sixday cold spell fossil fuels averaged between 2025 gw of electricity generation coal accounted for almost 10 of the total electricity mix across the quarter in part because of rising gas prices which made it a more economical fuel gas however remained the biggest power source accounting for just shy of 40 of all electricity what is most significant about this q1 2018 fossil fuel usage is that even in such extreme weather coal and gas generation was still 16 and 2 lower respectively than the same quarter in 2017 this drop is the result of increased renewable capacity allowing wind generation to grow by almost 40 and make up just short of 20 of the electricity mix read the full articles here the beast from the east who helped and hindered the system rampant wind leads renewable generation the conditions brought by the storm where particularly favourable to wind generation which hit new peakgeneration levels of 13 gw on 17 january and then 14 gw on 17 march over the full quarter wind power production reached 15560 gwh 30 gwh more than nuclear the nearest low carbon source this increase comes in part as a result of a 19 increase in installed capacity around the country since q1 2017 but also thanks to the grid getting better at making use of it during the six subzero days of the quarter wind contributed a minimum of 44 gw crucial at a time when other power sources appeared vulnerable for example heavy snowfall blocked solar panels from the sun leaving it contributing just 2 of the electricity mix over the quarter nuclear power fared better and made up just shy of 20 of generation but was held back by two routine reactor maintenances while a third shut on the quarters coldest day due to seaweed clogging a plants cooling system  biomass ran solidly throughout the cold spell contributing 4 of the total electricity generation mix the opening of a new 22 gw cable connecting scotland  where there is 77 gw of installed capacity  to north wales saved national grid some 9 million a month in constraint payments across the first quarter read the full articles wind power breezes past nuclear wind farm curtailment falls by twothirds did the country almost run out of gas one of the most headlinegrabbing events from the cold spell was national grids decision to issue a gas deficit warning on the morning of 1 march suggesting supplies could run out before the end of the day with 83 of british households depending on gas for heating and gas turbines accounting for a significant portion of the countrys electricity generation  the announcement drew considerable press attention however national grid explained domestic gas users would unlikely be impacted and it would work with industrial partners to make more gas available to meet demand this clearly had the desired effect with as much as 19 gw of spare gas capacity ending up available that day the warning was withdrawn the following morning and gas generation averaged 11 gw more than any other source between 26 february and 3 march nevertheless europeanwide demand for gas sent prices soaring and making it more economical to burn coal which generated roughly 10 gw a day on average over the sixday period of 26 february to 3

38c the six days from 26 february to 3 march highlighted in blue were the coldest britain has been since christmas 2010 this pushed electricity demand up 10 as people used more electric heating to keep warm the evening peak demand on 1 march was the highest in three years and so was not stretching the system to its limits electricity prices rose to five times the average for the quarter they peaked at 990 per megawatt hour mwh for half an hour and also fell to 150 per mwh as the market became volatile coal generation surged for the weeks surrounding the cold spell not because more output from conventional plants was needed but rising gas prices made it more economical to burn than gas total generation from fossil fuels remained around 2025 gw biomass and hydro ran solidly throughout the cold spell wind output was particularly high when it was most needed ranging from 118 to 138 gw during 1 march whilst wind certainly helped the lights would not have gone off without it as up to 19 gw of spare gas capacity was available if needed britains links to other countries were not so helpful we exported to france through much of the cold spell french electricity demand is more impacted by temperature than british as more french homes use electric heating looking in more detail at the uks links to other countries britain had been largely importing from france all year but then exported solidly through 2728 february when power prices were higher in france prices remained lower in the netherlands so britain continued importing from them britain and ireland traded power

21 february 2018 power generation after a year of smashing renewable records  great britains electricity system is less dependent on fossil fuels than ever before over the course of 2017 lowcarbon energy sources including nuclear as well as renewables accounted for half of all electricity production the finding comes from electric insights  a quarterly research paper on britains power system commissioned by drax and written by researchers from imperial college london the latest report highlights how great britains electricity system is rapidly moving away from fossil fuels with coal and gas dropping from 80 of the electricity mix in 2010 to 50 in 2017 its an impressive change for eight years but its even more dramatic when compared to 60 years ago powering the past with renewables in 2017 renewable output grew 27 over 2016 and produced 96 terawatt hours twh of electricity  enough to power the entire country in 1958 back then great britain was dependent on one fuel coal it was the source of 92 of the countrys power and its highcarbon intensity meant emissions from electricity generation sat at 93 million tonnes of carbon dioxide co 2  compare that to just three million tonnes of co 2 emissions from roughly the same amount of power generated in 2017 just by renewables today the electricity system is much more diverse than in 1958 in fact with nuclear added to renewable generation 2017s total lowcarbon capacity produced enough power to fulfil the electricity needs of 1964s beatlemania britain but whats enabled this growth in renewable generation one answer as bob dylan explained a year earlier is blowin in the wind read the full article here powering the past  stormy weather powering great britain wind power experienced a watershed year in 2017 thanks to blusterier weather and a wave of new wind farm installations coming online wind generation grew 45 between 2016 and 2017 windfarms both onshore and offshore produced 15 of the entire countrys electricity output in 2017 up from 10 in 2016 the 45 twh it generated over the course of the year was almost double that of coal  and theres potential for this to increase in 2018 as more capacity comes online the 16 gigawatts gw of new offshore wind turbines installed in great britain last year accounted for 53 of the net 315 gw installed across europe  with large offshore farms at dudgeon and race bank still being commissioned the 32 gw of total new operating capacity registered in 2017 across offshore as well as onshore wind is on course to grow coauthor of the article renewableuks head of external affairs luke clark said these figures underline that renewables are central to our changing power system higher wind speeds and a jump in installed capacity drove a dramatic increase in the amount of clean power generated alongside breaking multiple records for peak output wind energy continued to cut costs as wind power is dependent on weather conditions it is intermittent in its generation but in 2017 more than one storm offered ideal conditions for wind turbines during q4 there were three named storms as well as the remnants of a hurricane all battering the british isles all of which helped push average wind speeds 5 higher than in 2016 while calculating wind power based on wind speed is complex  windier weather means more power  monthly average wind speed is proportional to monthly average power output from wind farms while the 2017 annual average wind speed of 101mph was in line with the countrys longterm average wind generation was not consistent across the year in q4 wind output was close to an average of 7 gw by contrast between may and august it was closer to 4 gw thankfully these calmer months saw longer hours of daylight allowing solar power to compensate read the full article here wind power grows 45 driving down carbon emissions the knockon effect of an increase in renewable generation is a drop in the carbon intensity of electricity production and in 2017 this reached a new low across the year carbon emissions including those from imported sources totalled 72 million tonnes down 12 from 2016 this decrease is equal to 150 kg of co 2 saved per person or taking 47 million cars off the roads the least carbon intensive period of the quarter came just after midnight in the early hours of monday 2 october when it measured a record low of 56 grammes per kilowatt hour gkwh thanks to low fossil fuel generation and high levels of renewables over the whole year there were 139 hours when carbon intensity dipped below 100 gkwh this generally required 50 of the electricity mix to come from renewable sources and demand to be lower than 30 gw for carbon intensity to dip under 100 gkwh on a more permanent basis greater renewable capacity will be required as demand rises read the full article here carbon emissions down 12 interconnectors meeting future demand electricity demand in great britain has been on the decline since 2002 primarily due to more efficient buildings and appliances  and a decline in heavy manufacturing however this is expected to change over the coming years as more electric vehicles are introduced and the heating system is electrified to help meet 2050 carbon emissions targets while installing greater renewable capacity will be crucial in meeting this demand with lowcarbon power interconnectors will also play a significant role particularly from france which boasts a large nuclear and lowcarbon capacity however electricity sales through interconnectors are often based on dayahead prices rather than the live market which can lead to trades that arent reflective of demand on each sides of the channel in q4 there were eight halfhours when demand was very high more than 50 gw yet power was being exported this occurred despite dayahead prices suggesting traders would lose money due to lower demand in france and the cost of using the interconnector it highlights the need for improvements in internetwork trading as great britain increases its intermittent renewable generation and looks to a greater reliance on importing and exporting power read the full article here moving electricity across the channel great britains electricity system continues to break its renewable records each year and heading into 2018 this is likely to continue wind and solar power will continue to grow as
