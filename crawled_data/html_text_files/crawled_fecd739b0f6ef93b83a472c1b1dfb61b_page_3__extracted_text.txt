forests latvia catchment area analysis 19 june 2020 sustainable bioenergy latvia is a heavily forested small country about half the size of england with 52 forest cover totalling 354 million ha 27 times bigger than the forest area in england and 11 bigger than the entire uk in its catchment area analysis report of the baltic country consultancy indufor found best management practice is driven by the stateowned sector with an increasing proportion of corporate owners improving management standards in the private sector markets are dominated by domestic sawtimber demand and pulpwood exports to neighbouring scandinavia fuelwood pellets and biomass are substantial and critical markets for lowgrade fibre increasing forest area carbon stored and no deforestation there has been an increase of around 400000 hectares ha of forest in latvia since 2000 this is due to natural afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands and also to an improvement in forest inventory analysis in 2009 which provided a more accurate assessment of land use and forestry data since 2010 the forest area has increased by 55000 ha there is no evidence of deforestation primary land use latvia there has also been a substantial increase in forest carbon or growing stock this increased by 106 million cubic metres m 3  since 2000 75 hardwood and by 33 million m 3 since 2010 57 hardwood increase in forest carbon limited hardwood markets a proportion of the increase in hardwood volume in 2009 was due to the improvement of forest inventory calculations but also due to increased natural regeneration on unutilised land the hardwood forest in latvia and the baltic region is quite different to that of the us south  in the baltics there is prolific hardwood regeneration birch alder and aspen which grows quite rapidly there are limited markets for structural timber therefore hardwoods produce a lot of lowgrade wood fibre there are no domestic pulp markets in latvia and only limited markets for panel board therefore much of the lowgrade wood fibre can only be used for firewood and biomass the chart below shows a minor change in species composition from planted pine to naturally regenerated spruce and aspen  the most prolific regenerators in this region varied species mix planting and regeneration state owned forests have a higher proportion of planted forest areas compared to the private sector where natural regeneration is preferred due to lower costs planting allows the owner to control the species mix quality and growth whereas regeneration can be more of a lottery for both quality and species mix as more corporate owners emerge planting with improved stock may increase restocking practice by ownership category how the financial crisis impacted latvian forests harvesting levels have been consistently below net annual increment since 2000 there have been some fluctuations in the annual allowable cut in state forests particularly following the global financial crisis in 2008 harvesting in the private sector declined due to falling prices and sawnwood production dropped by 42 in 2009 compared to 2006 during that period stateowned forest increased harvesting in order to support the industry in the absence of strong markets and private sector supply postrecession the harvesting balance returned and demand for wood products increased the current surplus of growth compared to removals is around 55 million m 3 pa or a growth drain ratio of 16 surplus of growth compared to removals biomass and pulp prices increasing wood pellet exports have had limited impact on wood prices the feedstock for this market fuelwood  forest chip has limited competition and therefore remains fairly stable pulpwood markets are driven by export demand to scandinavia and can be volatile as this market fluctuates 2018 saw a substantial spike in pulpwood prices due to increased export demand as a response to a global increase in pulp and paper prices boosting scandinavian production this had a minor knock on effect on the domestic fuelwood markets variation of lowgrade wood prices with changing demand an important part of this analysis is to look for evidence to evaluate draxs performance against its new forest commitments  some of which relate directly to these trends and data sets pine forest in latvia below the consultant summarises the evidence of biomass impacts against key metrics in the forest industry of latvia is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes in  forest area  forest cover no impact both forest area and forest cover have increased during the last two decades the main driver of the growing forest area has been the natural regeneration of agricultural lands that were left uncultivated during the soviet regime forest growing stock no impact forest growing stock has steadily increased throughout the observation period the main driver for harvesting level is the roundwood demand from sawmills panel mills and export woodbased bioenergy demand may increase thinnings and residue collection but it is not as significant a driver for total harvests as the aforementioned exported pellets have accounted for approximately 1014 of the total volume of annual harvests in recent years depending on the assumed average dry densities of the harvested wood and pellets harvesting levels no impact  slight increasing impact the national felling volume is only about 65 of the national forest increment the total harvesting area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings and increased share of clearcuts a decline in both area and volume of fellings can be seen between 20022008 and 20102016 the main drivers of harvesting levels are sawmill industry panel industry and export demand however wood demand for energy purposes can still improve the overall income for the forest owner and therefore increase the total harvesting levels in private forests harvesting residue collection increasing impact most of the collected residues originate from clearcuts in state forests most produced harvesting residues are left in situ and they are not overexploited collection of wood residues from harvesting operations has been increasing for the last 15 years as a result of increased capacities and demand from heat and chp plants latvia is increasingly relying on woody biomass for energy generation forest growth  carbon sequestration potential no apparent impact the total forest area and growing stock have grown in the last decade according to latvias national forestry accounting plan 20212025 the forests are decreasing their ghg sequestration capacity even a low sequestration rate increases carbon storage which explains the increases in forest growing stock and area the decrease in ghg sequestration capacity is due to forest ageing emissions from soils and the increased share of broadleaved forests which have lower carbon accumulation capacity than conifers removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are an input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has caused changes to forest management practices  rotation lengths no impact the law on forests regulates minimum forest age and diameter for clearcuts the lvm and largescale forest owners often conduct clearcuts at minimum diameter whereas smallholders tend to wait until roundwood prices are high due to the regulation an increase of woodbased bioenergy demand has not shortened rotations thinnings increasing impact in naturally afforested former agricultural lands no impacts on thinnings overall the total harvested area has been declining while the total harvested volume has increased in the past 20 years this can be explained by the diminished share of thinnings due to existing forest age structure and increased share of clearcuts most of the harvesting residues are collected from clearcuts there is an increased demand for small diameter wood and harvestingprocessing residues overall the increased demand for smalldiameter hardwood has increased harvesting in previously unmanaged afforested agricultural lands which usually overgrow with broadleaved trees these kinds of lands are usually otherwise not significant for forest management conversion from hardwood to softwood no impact no indication of hardwood conversion to softwood was found instead pine forests are decreasing due to the favouring of natural regeneration which usually results in spruce or broadleaved forests in nutrientrich andor wet soils is there any evidence that woodbased bioenergy demand has impacted solid wood products markets  diversion from other wood product markets no apparent impact production of sawnwood and woodbased panels have increased or remained steady ie no evidence of diversion several interviews confirmed that sawlogs are not processed for other products besides sawnwood and woodbased panels wood prices no apparent impact prices of all wood assortments increased in 20172018 most notably the prices of pulpwood this was due to difficult harvesting conditions and increased demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden because of high market pulp prices pulpwood prices returned to presurge levels in 2019 fuelwood prices also increased temporarily but at a much more moderate rate the main driver for fuelwood price increases was the surge of pulpwood prices read the full report catchment area analysis in latvia  a 2017 interview with raul kirjanen ceo of graanul invest a wood pellet supplier of drax operating in latvia can be

arboriculture  forests  wood pellets  latvia  biomass energy changing forest structure in virginia and north carolina 21 may 2020 sustainable bioenergy forest owners have responded to the recovery in pine sawtimber markets since the global financial crisis of 2008 by planting more forest and investing more in the management of their land the same period has witnessed increased demand from the biomass sector which has replaced declining need for wood from pulp and paper markets the area of timberland  actively managed productive forest  has increase by around 89000 hectares ha since 2010 this change is due to three important factors new planting on agricultural land the planting of lowgrade selfseeded areas with more productive improved pine and the reclassification by the us forest service usfs of some areas of naturally regenerated pine from woodland to timberland the 2018 data shows that pine forest makes up 46 of the timberland area of which 61 is planted and the remainder naturally regenerated hardwoods cover 43 of the timberland area with 93 of this naturally regenerated the remaining area is mixed stands composition of timberland area since 2000 there have been some significant changes in the composition of the timberland area with a transition from hardwood to softwood pine has increased from 39 of the total area in 2000 to 46 in 2018 and hardwood has decreased from 50 to 43 over the same period all pine areas have increased since 2000 with naturally regenerated pine increasing by 13000 ha and planted pine by 340000 ha since 2000 mixed stands have declined by 6500 ha as some of these sites have been replanted with improved pine to increase growth and sawtimber production the biggest change has been in the hardwood areas where there has been a decline of around 314000 ha despite the total area of timberland increasing by 31000 ha change in forest type this change has been driven by private forest owners representing 91 of the total timberland area seeking to gain a better return on investment from their forest land hardwood markets have declined since the 2008 recession and demand for hardwood sawtimber has not recovered demand for pine sawtimber has rebounded and is now as strong as precrisis pine also offers much faster growth rates and higher total volumes in a much shorter time frame typically 2535 years compared to 7580 years for hardwoods the decision to change species is similar to a farmer changing their agricultural crops based on market demand and prices for each product where forests are managed for revenue generation then it is reasonable to optimise the land and crop for this objective this can be a significant positive from a carbon perspective more carbon is sequestered in a shorter time frame and more carbon is stored in long term wood products if the quantity if sawtimber is increased increased revenue generation also helps to maintain the forest area rather than conversion to urban development agriculture or other uses a potential negative is the change in habitat from a pure hardwood stand to a pure pine stand each providing a different ecosystem and supporting a different range of flora and fauna there is no conclusive evidence that one forest type is better or worse than the other there is a great deal of variety of each type some hardwood forests are rich in species and biodiversity others can be unremarkable the key is not to endanger or risk losing any species or sensitive habitat and to ensure that any conversion only occurs where there is no loss of biodiversity and no negative impact to the ecosystem it is not clear whether all of the lost hardwood stands have been directly converted to pine forests some hardwood stands may have been lost to other land uses urban and other land has increased by 400000 ha some may have been directly converted to pine by forest owners encouraged by the increase in pine sawtimber demand and prices whatever the primary driver of this change it is clearly not being driven by the biomass sector change in forest type  timing the chart above demonstrates that the biggest change loss of hardwood and increase in planted pine occurred between 2000 and 2012 prior to the operation of the pellet mills since 2012 there has been no significant loss of natural hardwood and only a small decline in planted hardwood

the area surrounding three pellet plants operated by enviva  ahoskie northampton and southampton enviva catchment area in virginia and north carolina forests and woodlands represent 68 of the total area at just over 54 million hectares ha with 87 of this area classified as timberland the area of timberland actively managed productive forest has increased by around 89000 ha since 2010 and there have been some significant changes in forest type  the overall area of forest has increased and there is no evidence of deforestation occurring land use by area since 2000 the total volume of standing timber in the catchment area has increased by 170 million cubic metres m 3  sixty five percent of this increase has occurred since 2012 indicating a growingmaturing forest resource and an expanding forest area most of the increase in volume has been in the sawtimber categories for both pine and hardwood although the hardwood pulpwood size class has also increased by nearly 10 million m 3 since 2012 following a small decline between 2000 and 2012 timber inventory by product category the increased demand from the three enviva pellet mills beginning operation in 2012 in the chesapeake region appears to have had no negative impact of the accumulation of forest carbon in the growing stock of the region since this time all categories of timber product have increased timber inventory by product category  pre and postenviva this increase in inventory is also reflected in the comparison of average annual growth to removals the surplus of uncut growth has increased substantially since 2010 from 47 million m 3 per year to 159 million m 3 pa over this period annual growth has increased by 355 whereas removals have decreased by 86 annual growth vs removals and surplus volume demand for timber products has fluctuated since 2000 the global financial crisis in 200809 impacted all product categories but particularly pine and hardwood sawtimber where there was a combined drop of over five million tonnes in 2010 compared to 2000 this was a loss of over 20 of total annual demand in the catchment area pine sawtimber has now recovered to precrisis levels but hardwood demand has remained low hardwood pulpwood demand also declined around this time with the closure and decline of existing pulp mills in the catchment area demand had fallen by one million tonnes pa by 2011 prior to the enviva pellet mills opening from 2012 the new biomass demand enabled the hardwood pulpwood market to recover to precrisis levels with demand in 2018 at almost exactly the same level as in 2000 annual demand by product category this fluctuation in demand is reflected in the average annual stumpage price data shown on the chart below this is the value that the forest owner gets for each product the trends are generally as expected with the exception of the hardwood sawtimber price which has increased substantially despite a decrease in demand this is due to supply chain issues reduced capacity of loggers and access to land average annual stumpage prices detailed below is an edited version of the consultants review and analysis of key issues in the catchment area the full version can be found in the main report is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows the opposite the total area of timberland in the enviva chesapeake catchment area has increased an estimated 82818 hectares 18 since enviva pellets ahoskie commenced full production in 2012 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no  inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area since 2012 but there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand has caused these changes conversion of hardwood and mixed pinehardwood timberland to planted pine timberland has occurred in the catchment area diversion from other markets no  inconclusive since 2012 pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has decreased 19 however this decrease is largely attributed to decreased demand from the pulppaper sector also demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs have increased an estimated 14 and 7 respectively since 2012 an unexpected increase in wood prices no  inconclusive the increase in hardwood biomass demand coincided with price increases of 1024 for delivered hardwood pulpwood these price increases were likely linked to a combination of both supply chain issues shortage of local loggers following pulppaper mill closures in the region and elevated prices offered by enviva to ensure guaranteed wood supply for the first several years of operation as prices for delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chips proceeded to decline 16 and 9 respectively from 2014 to2017 once the market stabilised since 2014 prices for pine products have held flat even though softwood raw material purchases demand by enviva have more than doubled in this catchment area changes in pine pulpwood and pine chip prices are largely driven by demand attributed to the pulppaper sector a reduction in growing stock timber no total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 19 from 2012 through 2018 over this period inventories increased as follows for each of the five major timber products 33 for pine sawtimber 23 for pine chipnsaw 14 for pine pulpwood 12 for hardwood sawtimber and 14 for hardwood pulpwood the increase in timber inventory can be linked to a combination of increased forest area additional hectares  additional inventory and annual harvest levels below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment area forest ie annual growth has continued to exceed annual removals resulting in increased inventory levels a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock timber has increased slightly since 2012 increased timber growth ratescarbon sequestration rates can be linked to a combination of changes in species composition and silvicultural practices softwood pine grows at a much quicker rate compared to hardwood species and in the enviva chesapeake catchment area pine timberland area increased from 436 of total timberland area in 2011 to 460 in 2018 also improvements in silviculture have continued to enhance growth and overall productivity together these factors help explain how average per hectare volume growth increased from 59 m3 in 2011 to 77 m3 in 2018 an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no in 2018 the latest available growthtoremovals ratio for pine and hardwood pulpwood the timber products utilised by bioenergy equalled 249 and 276 respectively a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area what has been the impact of bioenergy demand on timber growing stock inventory neutral total wood demand increased an estimated 14 from 20122018 and much of that increase can be attributed to increased demand from bioenergy in this catchment area inventories are so substantial that increases in demand from bioenergy as well as from other sources have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth total growing stock inventory has continued to increase  an average of 29 per year since enviva first entered this market in 2012 timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have increased for pine sawtimber pine chipnsaw pine pulpwood and hardwood pulpwood since 2012 hardwood sawtimber growth rates have declined slightly evidence suggests these overall increases in growth rates are linked to changes in age class distribution ie a younger forest not due to changes in bioenergy demand forest area positive  neutral total forest timberland area in the catchment area increased nearly 83000 hectares 18 from 2012 through 2018 the latest available our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found a strong positive correlation between these two variables but also a moderately strong correlation between softwood sawlog demand and forest area wood prices neutral  negative the additional wood demand placed on this market by enviva from 20122014 coincided with a 19 increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 24 increase in delivered hardwood pulpwood price pine and hardwood chip prices also increased 1011 over this period analysis found evidence that increases in hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices can be linked to increases in total hardwood pulpwood demand however given that hardwood bioenergy demand has accounted for over 75 of total hardwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 2014 it is reasonable to conclude that hardwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy has had some level of impact on delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices markets for solid wood products positive in the enviva chesapeake catchment area demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased 15 and 9 respectively from 20122018 a byproduct of the sawmilling process are sawmill residuals  a material utilied by envivas three mills to produce wood pellets with the increased production of both softwood and hardwood lumber so too has come an increase in sawmill residuals some of which has been purchasedconsumed by enviva not only has enviva benefited from the greater availability of this byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as envivas three mills have provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts forest landowners positive increased demand attributed to bioenergy has been a positive for forest landowners in the chesapeake catchment area not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood particularly hardwood pulpwood but the increase in pulpwood prices as a result of an overall increase in both softwood and hardwood pulpwood demand has transferred through to landowners improved compensation specifically since 2013 the first year all three enviva pellet mills were operating hardwood pulpwood stumpage price  the price paid to landowners  has averaged roughly 560 per ton in the chesapeake catchment area this represents a 47 increase over the approximately 380 per ton averaged by hardwood pulpwood stumpage in the catchment area over the 10 years prior 20032012

forestry and forest management and arboriculture estonia catchment area analysis 17 march 2020 sustainable bioenergy estonia is a heavily forested country with a mature forest resource that has been neglected over many years due to political and ownership changes management of state and corporate owned forests is now good but some small privatelyowned areas of forest are still poorly managed despite this both the forest area and the growing stock have been increasing largely due to new planting and the maturing age class of existing forest forest area has increased from 49 to 52 of the total land increasing by more than 118 thousand hectares since 2010 land use in estonia click to viewdownload over the same period the growing stock increased by 52 million m 3  with 60 of this growth in softwood and 40 in hardwood species the data shows a slight decline in 2018 but this is due to a sampling error and the growing stock is thought to have been maintained at 2017 levels this should be rectified in the 2019 data when available change in forest growing stock  estonia click to viewdownload the forests of estonia have been going through a period of restitution since the 1990s land that had been taken into state ownership during soviet rule has been given back to private owners this process was complex and lengthy and limited active management in the forest during this time since 2008 harvesting and management has increased private and corporate forest owners have been harvesting forest that had been mature and ready for clear felling the longerterm harvesting trend has been considerably lower than annual growth increment and the maximum sustainable harvesting level as shown on the chart below annual increment and harvesting levels click to viewdownload in 2018

regeneration harvesting type by volume click to viewdownload harvesting type by area click to viewdownload clear cutting regeneration felling is the largest operation by volume but thinning maintenance felling is the largest by area this indicates a forest landscape in balance with widespread thinning to produce more sawlog trees and a large volume of clear cuts in the mature stands to make way for the next generation of forests reforestation in estonia  note since 2014 it has not been compulsory for private and other forest owners to submit reforestation data click to viewdownload planting of seedlings is the most common form of regeneration however some native hardwood species are strong pioneers and naturally regenerate among the spruce and pine stands this has led to a change in the species composition of some forests with an increase in hardwoods although this is relatively small scale and only prevalent among some small private owners that do not invest in clearing unwanted regeneration species mix in estonian forests click to viewdownload markets and prices for forest products sunrise and fog over forest landscape in estonia pulpwood markets are limited in estonia and this material has been historically exported to neighbouring finland and sweden export demand has had a significant impact on prices as can be seen in a spike in 2018 when demand was at its strongest the forest industry has been dominated by sawmills and panel board mills demand and production in this sector has been increasing and this has kept prices high there is a substantial differential between sawlog and pulpwood pricing comparison of sawlog and pulpwood prices click to viewdownload the pellet industry developed due to the abundance of lowgrade fibre

forest growing stock has been increasing for the last two decades in 2018 the growth slowed or halted official statistics show a decrease but this is due to sampling error in 2018 there was recordhigh wood demand from finland which was driven by high global pulp prices motivating maximal pulp production this increased harvests to a previously unseen level harvesting levels slight increasing impact during 20042011 harvesting levels in estonia were less than half of the estimated maximum sustainable level this resulted in an increase in the maximum sustainable harvesting level for the 20112020 period in 2018 the harvesting volumes were at the maximum sustainable level the main drivers increasing the harvesting volumes have been increased sawmill capacity and production high demand for pulpwood in finland and sweden and improved demand for energy wood this was a temporary peak and demand has already slowed softwood lumber prices have decreased significantly in europe due to an abundance of wood supply from central europe which has been created by widespread bark beetle and other forest damages global pulp prices have also decreased to below 2017 prices forest growth  carbon sequestration potential ambivalent impact the annual increment has grown throughout the 20002018 period increased fuelwood price has enabled forest management in some of the alder forests that were completely unutilised in the past thinnings both commercial and precommercial accelerate longterm volume growth in forests leading to increased carbon sequestration removal of harvesting residues decreases carbon sequestration since the residues are input to the soil carbon pool however the majority of the harvesting residues carbon is released to the atmosphere when the biomass decays so the ultimate impact of harvesting residue collection is minimal if the collection is done on a sustainable level the sustainability of the collection is determined by how the soil nutrient balance is impacted by collection this is not accounting for the substitution effect that the harvesting residues may have by eg reducing the need to burn fossil fuels utilisation of sawmill byproducts does not

healthy forests 29 january 2020 sustainable bioenergy international papers pulp and paper mill located in the morehouse parish of louisiana had been in operation since 1927 and was once the largest employer in the area however as a result of the global recession of 2008 the company was forced to lay off over 550 employees and shut the facility other mills in the area have also reduced production including georgia pacific which let go around 530 people at its crossett arkansas plant 18 miles to the north of morehouse in 2019 for an area dominated by forests such as northern louisiana and southern arkansas this decline in traditional markets came as a serious blow its a region where a healthy market for wood products is vital for the local economy and in turn the health of the regions forests luckily other wood product manufacturers and industries have since began to fill the gap engineers in front of wood pellet storage silos at draxs morehouse bioenergy biomass manufacturing facility in northern louisiana drax biomass has opened a mill in morehouse parish that uses some of the the lowgrade wood previously used to supply the paper industry to produce compressed wood pellets which are used to generate renewable electricity in the uk commissioned in 2015 the plant employs 74 people and can produce as much as 525000 metric tonnes of biomass pellets a year this makes it an important facility for local employment and the wood market in the region however to ensure it is positively contributing to the area and its environment the demand for wood must be sustainably managed morehouse bioenergy sources lowgrade wood from a catchment area that covers a 60mile radius and includes 18 counties in arkansas and four in louisiana as drax biomass doesnt own any of the forests it sources wood products from it regularly examines the environmental impact of its pellet mills on the forests and markets in which it operates the aim is to ensure the biomass used by drax to generate 12 of great britains renewable electricity is sustainably sourced and does not contribute to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts a new report by forestry research and consulting firm forisk evaluates the impact of biomass pellet demand from morehouse bioenergy on the forests and wood markets within the mills catchment area map of pulpwoodusing mills near morehouse timber market it found that biomass demand in the region does not contribute to deforestation  nor increase forest harvesting above a sustainable level overall growth of the regions pine timberland which supplies morehouse bioenergy continues to exceed removals pointing to expanding forest carbon and wood inventory annual growth compared to harvesting removals growing forests and increasing timber stocks the study focuses on timberland  working forests  in the plants sourcing area which the us forestry service categorises as productive land capable of providing timber on an industrial scale the timberland here is made up of 63 softwood trees which includes pines and 37 hardwoods such as oak pellet manufacturing as a whole including other pellet producers in the area accounts for only 6 of the demand for wood products in the region of that morehouse bioenergy contributes to 4 of total pellet demand total area of timberland lumber  such as sawtimber  makes up the bulk of demand for wood products accounting for 46 of total demand largely as a result of its high market value and landowners aims to extract maximum revenue from their pine stands however the less valuable wood  parts of trees that are misshapen too short or thin to be used for lumber  can be sold at a lower price to biomass pellet mills this wood might previously have been sold to paper and pulp mills exclusively but with international papers departure morehouse bioenergy now fills a part of that role total volume of growing stock on timberland maintaining healthy markets for both high and lowvalue wood is key to enabling landowners to reforest areas once they have been harvested in the knowledge it will provide a valuable return in the future ultimately however the way forests are maintained depends on the individual landowners and how they want to use their land the advantages of corporate ownership morehouse bioenergys catchment area covers 28000 square kilometres of timberland within which 96 of the timber is privately owned while some of that is owned by families with small patches of productive land 54 is held by corporate owners this includes businesses such as real estate investment trusts reits and timber investment management organisations timos which advise institutional investors on how to manage their forest assets this high percentage of corporate ownership influences forest management and replanting as owners look to maximise the value of forests and seek to continue to generate returns from their land in general corporate owners are spending more money on silviculture and actively managing their timber stands explains forisk consulting partner amanda lang they are investing more in fertiliser their seedlings and harvest control on pine stands because that leads to larger trees of a higher quality and more profit in the long run this is reflected in the higher growth rates found in the private sector leading to faster rates of carbon sequestration annual growth per hectare by owner type smaller private landowners meanwhile may have other objectives for their land like recreation and hunting in addition to timber income as a result some owners may be less inclined to intensively manage their timber stands forgoing fertilisation and competition control due to cost and might harvest on a less regular basis although these landowners may not be maximising the productivity of their timber resource to the same degree corporate owners do their unique management often contribute to greater diversity on the landscape demand and forest health in 2018 the annual average price for a metric tonne of pine sawtimber in morehouse bioenergys catchment area was 2571 down from a 10year high of 3160 in 2010 similarly pine pulpwood from which biomass pellets are made was valued at 775 per metric tonne in 2018 down from a 10year high of 13 in 2010 these low wood prices have caused many landowners to delay harvesting forests in hopes for a more lucrative wood price as a result pine timber inventories have grown across morehouse bioenergys catchment area in 2010 the us forest service counted more than 167 million metric tonnes of pine inventory by 2018 this had increased by more than 35 to reach 226 million morehouse bioenergy market historic stumpage prices metric tonne the report suggests this price slump is an ongoing result of the 2008 recession which greatly affected us house construction  one of the primary uses of sawtimber and many other types of wood products in the us some areas have already seen sawtimber prices increase as they recover from the recession  however the report suggests this is not spread evenly on a national level the inventory overhang in morehouse bioenergys catchment area is expected to begin reversing in 2024 or 2025 as lang explains we expect inventories to increase for a few more years and then start to decline that said inventories will remain higher than prerecession levels while high inventories suggest an abundant resource lower inventory volumes are not indicative of declining or unhealthy forests rather they can point to younger growing forests that have recently been replanted which will later grow to higher inventory volumes as they mature both suggest a healthy forestry industry in which landowners continue to reinvest in forests overall the analysis of the region points to healthy growing forests and importantly a sustainable industry from which drax can responsibly source biomass pellets ensuring the biomass used at drax power station

shows that harvesting is greater than growth this can be the case when the forest area is predominantly mature and at the age when clear cutting is necessary a growth drain ratio of more than one shows that growth exceeds harvesting this is typically the case in younger forests that are not yet ready for harvesting and are in the peak growing phase but it can also occur when insufficient market demand exists and owners are forced to retain stands for longer in the absence of a viable market draxs morehouse bioenergy compressed wood pellet plant in northern louisiana this can have a negative impact on the future growth of the forest limiting the financial return to forest owners and reducing the cumulative sequestration of carbon by enforcing suboptimal rotation lengths the current growth drain ratio of pine around morehouse is 167 with an average annual surplus of around 7 million metric tonnes this surplus of growth is partly due to a decline in sawtimber demand due to

iab the independent advisory board on sustainable biomass provides this statement following its first meeting on friday 15th november 2019 attendees john beddington chair john krebs deputy chair virginia dale sam fankhauser elena schmidt robert matthews exofficio member during the meeting iab members discussed the role of the iab reflected on the public launch of the iab reviewed and accepted the iabs terms of reference developed its understanding of draxs business considered draxs approach to sustainable biomass including its new responsible sourcing policy  explored the climate aspects of draxs new responsible sourcing policy in light of forest researchs work on the carbon impacts of biomass  explored draxs use of the independent sustainable biomass program standard to evidence their performance against drax policies the iab shares this summary of its findings and recommendations the iab agreed that its role is to provide independent advice to drax on its sustainable biomass policy and practice iab members will do this by scrutinising the science and evidence informing draxs approach and by providing independent feedback to drax on how it can adopt best practices in addition to holding two face to face meetings each year the iab agreed to hold two interim telephone meetings the iab recommended drax refer to forest environment not natural environment in its policy the iab noted that the ten criteria drax have outlined to reduce the carbon emissions of its biomass approach have been designed to reflect the findings of forest researchs carbon impacts of biomass consumed in the eu report 2018 the iab found that the drax criteria are an accurate interpretation of the report the iab would like to explore how the science can further be developed with regard to the use of small early thinnings and small roundwood and consider how draxs policy might evolve the iab and drax discussed the possibility of developing some sub criteria for specific forest types the iab suggested drax could consider a restatement of the evidence academic review process to better understand and draw alignment on where there is scientific evidence on the sustainability of biomass the iab suggested drax should consider both a goal to continuously improve and consider the longer term implications of its policy commitments in light of potential climate changes the iab emphasised that the way drax operationalises its commitments will be critical it stressed the importance of robustly exploring the counterfactuals to draxs biomass activities highlighting the potential for tradeoffs between climate and biodiversity outcomes as an area for more detailed review the iab highlighted a number of considerations for drax in its use of the sustainable biomass program sbp it welcomed sbps adoption of a multistakeholder approach and suggested it will be important to scrutinise its evolution it noted that as draxs sustainability commitments go beyond sbps current criteria drax needs a strategy on how to evidence the compliance for these additional commitments the iab expressed interest in learning about draxs long term vision it noted that the ceasing of subsidies in 2027 will be a key milestone and highlighted its interest in exploring draxs strategy for managing this in future meetings with drax the iab will further examine evidence of draxs approach performance and impact against its commitments to identify any changes that drax may need to make the iab noted the following specific topics for further consideration evidence relating to the impact of thinning a forest on carbon pest control and fire risks how drax operationalises its commitments the counterfactuals of draxs biomass activities and potential tradeoffs between biodiversity and carbon outcomes

land classification  use 2017 on the states western border with louisiana near the town of gloster draxs amite bioenergy pellet mill is an important part of this local economy providing employment and creating a market for lowgrade wood amite produces halfamillion metric tonnes of wood pellets annually that not only benefit the surrounding area but also make a positive impact in the uk providing a renewable flexible low carbon source of power that could soon enable carbon negative electricity generation  however this is only possible if the pellets are sourced from healthy and responsibly managed forests thats why its essential for drax to regularly examine the environmental impact of the pellet mills and their catchment areas to ultimately ensure the wood is sustainably sourced and never contributes to deforestation or other negative climate and environment impacts in the first of a series of reports evaluating the areas drax sources wood from hood consulting has looked at the impact of amite on its surrounding region the scope of the analysis had to be objective and impartial using only credible data sources and references the specific aim was to evaluate the trends occurring in the forestry sector and to determine what impact the pellet mill may have had in influencing those trends positively or negatively this included the impact of harvesting levels carbon stock and sequestration rate wood prices and the production of all wood products the report highlights the positive role that the amite plant has had in the region supporting the health of western mississippis forests and its economy woodchip pile at amite bioenergy 2017 the landscape of the amite bioenergy wood pellet plant amite bioenergys catchment area  the working forest land from which it has sourced wood fibre since it began operating  stretches roughly 6600 square kilometres km 2  across 11 counties  nine in mississippi and two in louisiana amite bioenergy catchment area boundary us forest service data shows that since 2014 when amite began production total timberland in this catchment area has in fact increased by more than 5200 hectares 52 million m 2  an increase in market demand for wood products particularly for sawtimber can be one of the key drivers for encouraging forest owners to plant more trees retain their existing forest or more actively manage their forests to increase production  markets for low grade wood like the amite facility are essential for enabling forest owners to thin their crops and generate increased revenue as a byproduct of producing more sawtimber around 30 of the annual timber growth in the region is pine pulpwood a lowervalue wood which is the primary source of raw material used at amite more than 60 of the growth is what is known as sawtimber  highvalue wood used as construction lumber or furniture or chip n saw also used for construction and furniture amite bioenergy catchment area  net growth of growing stock timber by major

just 850 thousand m 3 was removed the table below shows the ratio of removals to growth in the pine forests around amite a ratio of 1 is commonly considered to be the threshold for sustainable

2018 the economic argument for sustainability the timberland of the amite bioenergy catchment area is 85 privately owned among the tens of thousands of smaller private landowners are larger landowners like forestry business weyerhaeuser  companies that manage forest land on behalf of investors like pension funds and private families for these private owners as long as there are healthy markets for forest products forests have an economic value  without these markets some owners may choose to convert their forest to other land uses eg for urban development or agriculture more than a billion tree saplings have been grown at weyerhaeusers pearl river nursery in mississippi the facility supplies these young trees to be planted in the amite catchment area and across the us south strong markets lead to increased investment in better management eg improved seedlings more weeding or fertilisation thinning and selecting the best trees for future sawtimber production thinning pulpwood is part of the forest management process explains dr harrison hood forest economist and principal at hood consulting typically with pine you plant 500 to 700 trees per acre that density helps the trees grow straight up rather than outwards but once the trees begin to grow beyond a certain point they can crowd one another and some trees will be starved of water nutrients and sunlight it is therefore essential to fell some trees to allow the others to grow to full maturity  a process known as thinning at final harvest youve got about 100 trees per acre continues dr hood you remove the pulpwood or the poorquality trees to allow the higherquality trees to continue to grow these thinnings have typically been used as pulpwood to make things like paper but with the slight decline of this industry over the last few decades theres been a need to find new markets for it paper production in the amite catchment area has declined since 2010 as shown on the chart on the right whilst demand for

southern forest products association american forest  paper association timbermartsouth producing sawtimber without a market for thinnings and lowgrade wood is a challenge the arrival of a biomass market in the area has created a renewed demand  something that is even more important at the current time when there is an abundance of forest but wood prices are flat or declining slightly sawtimber prices havent moved much over the last six to eight years explains dr hood theyve been flat because theres so much wood out there that theres not enough demand to eat away at the supply pulpwood consumers such as amite bioenergy create demand for pulpwood from thinning allowing landowners to continue managing their forests while waiting for the higher value markets to recover revenue from pulpwood helps to support forest owners particularly when sawtimber prices are weak amite bioenergy catchment area mill map 2019 theres so much pulpwood out there says dr hood you need a buyer for

prices and the production of all wood products analysis shows a maturing forest resource with a substantial surplus of annual growth increasing in age and growing stock increasing production of sawtimber and higher value wood products stable wood prices and no market displacement key report data since 2010 the total growing stock the amount of wood stored in the forest around amite bioenergy has increased by 111 million cubic metres m 3  this is partly due to an increase in the area of timberland which increased by more than 5200 hectares ha but predominantly due to the forest ageing and increasing the average size class the average tree gets bigger moving from a small diameter pulpwood tree to a larger sawtimber grade tree the chart below shows that the increase in volume is entirely within the private sector where forests are more actively managed the public sector has declined in growing stock by 15 million m 3 whilst the private sector has increased by 126 million m 3  the

that the total timberland area has increased by more than 5200 ha a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no  inconclusive changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last five to 10 years but there is little evidence to suggest bioenergy demand has caused these changes market research shows thinnings have declined in this catchment area since 2014 when amite bioenergy commenced production however local loggers identify poor market conditions for the decrease in thinnings not increased bioenergy demand the primary focus of timber management in this area is the production of sawtimber rotation lengths of managed forests have remained unchanged between 2535 years of age despite increases in bioenergy demand increased bioenergy demand however has benefited landowners in this catchment area providing additional outlets for pulpwood removed from thinnings  a management activity necessary for sawtimber production diversion from other markets no since 2014 softwood pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has increased 8 while demand for softwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood has increased 53 and 5 respectively an abnormal increase in wood prices no prices for delivered pine pulpwood the primary raw material consumed by amite bioenergy have decreased 12 since the pellet mill commenced production in 2014 a reduction in growing stock timber no  inconclusive total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 5 from 2014 through 2017 the latest available data specifically pine sawtimber inventory increased 13 pine chipnsaw inventory increased 24 and pine pulpwood inventory decreased 12 over this period this is indicative of an aging forest a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock timber has decreased slightly since 2014 and a slower timber growth rate essentially represents a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon however the reduced growth rate and subsequent reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon is due to the aging of the forest changes in timber age class distribution not to increases in bioenergy demand as trees get older the growth rate slows down an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual harvests provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2017 the latest available the growthtoremovals ratio for pine pulpwood equalled 180 a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy demand harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment forest area evaluate the impact of bioenergy demand positive neutral negative on  timber growing stock inventory neutral total wood demand from biomass and other solid wood products is up more than 35 compared to 2014 levels intuitively increased demand means more timber is harvested which reduces total growing stock inventory however in this catchment area inventories are so substantial that increases in demand from bioenergy as well as from other sources have not been great enough to offset annual timber growth and as such total growing stock inventory has continued to increase  an average of 2 per year since 2014 when amite bioenergy commenced production timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have declined since 2014 however evidence suggests the reduction in growth rates is more a product of an aging forest and not due to changes in bioenergy demand additionally young planted pine stands are actually growing at a faster rate than ever before  due to the continued improvement of seedling genetics and as timber is harvested and these stands are replanted in pine as has historically occurred in the catchment area over the long term the average timber growth rate is likely to increase weyerhaeuser nursery hazlehurst mississippi forest area positive  neutral total forest timberland area in the catchment area increased more than 5200 ha from 2014 through 2017 the latest available and while our analysis of biomass demand and forest area found a moderately strong relationship between the two findings are inconclusive as to whether the increase in timberland acreage can be attributed to increases in biomass demand wood prices neutral despite the additional wood demand placed on this market by amite bioenergy since 2014 prices for delivered pine pulpwood the primary raw material consumed by amite bioenergy have decreased 12 in the catchment area prices for pine sawmill residuals and inwoods chips the other two raw materials consumed by amite bioenergy have also declined over the last several years  down 3 since 2016 for pine sawmill residuals and down 3 since 2015 for inwoods chips markets for solid wood products positive  neutral in the amite bioenergy catchment area demand for softwood sawtimber to produce lumber has increased more than 50 since 2014 a biproduct of the sawmilling process is sawmill residuals  a material utilized by amite bioenergy to produce wood pellets not only has amite bioenergy benefited from the greater availability of this biproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as amite bioenergy has provided an additional outlet for these biproducts read the full report catchment area analysis of forest management and
