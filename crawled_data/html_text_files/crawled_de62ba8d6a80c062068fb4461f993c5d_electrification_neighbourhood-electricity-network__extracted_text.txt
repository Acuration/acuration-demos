britains electricity network is a lot like its roads for long distance highspeed journeys the road network has motorways  the electricity networks equivalent is the national grid  which transfers power across the country at extremely high voltages between 400000132000 volts and high speeds for shorter journeys at progressively lower speeds the traffic network has a and b roads these are the regional distribution networks these regional distribution networks take power at 132000 volts and transform it down in stages to 230 volts and make the link from the national grid to local distribution systems that deliver electricity to homes and businesses and while these a and b roads of electricity may be one of the most important parts of getting electricity from power station to plug very few people spare them any thought electricity in the north west when the government first privatised the electricity network in 1989  it set up different distribution regions to provide national coverage through a series of similarlysized regions says pete emery senior director of electricity north west  today each part of the uk is served by one of 14 different regional networks and in the north west across the pennines from where drax power station operates in north yorkshire thats the job of electricity north west it was formed in 1995 and today delivers around 23 terawatts of power to 22 million homes and 200000 business every year it does that using a vast network of more than 13000 km of overhead cables 44000 km of underground cables making it the second most underground electricity network in the uk behind london and more than 34000 transformers which work to convert the electricity from transmission voltage to one that can be used in uk homes  the scale of infrastructure needed to create these regional networks mean that each one is a natural monopoly in this case its a monopoly that benefits customers a natural monopoly a natural monopoly is when the cost of duplicating the assets needed to provide the service outweighs the benefits of efficiency that having competition would provide explains emery so it is in the public interest to have only one provider for decades each regional distribution network has operated the same way delivering power consistently to uk homes but as the country moves into the future of cleaner more sustainable energy  these grids are changing rapidly the potential proliferation of battery technologies and the increasing variation of power sources and their demands on the grid mean changes are in store for distributors like electricity north west one such factor already having an effect is embedded generation across the country there are sources of electricity generation that arent connected to regional distribution networks  for example private solar panels on domestic roofs wind turbines on private land or smallscale power stations connected to a single private distribution network and when there is excess electricity generated from these sources it can be sold back to electricity suppliers in the north west this embedded generation is fed back into emerys network in our region alone we have 2200 mw of embedded generation  more than half the capacity of drax power station  which means we already manage and control the power this input brings to the electricity system says emery they are invisible to national grid this is a radical change and its happening now regardless of whats to come whats certain is therell be traffic on the a roads of electricity share related stories press
