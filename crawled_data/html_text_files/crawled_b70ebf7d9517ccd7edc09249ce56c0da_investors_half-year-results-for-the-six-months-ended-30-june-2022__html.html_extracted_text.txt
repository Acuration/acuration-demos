Drax CEO, Will Gardiner [click to view/download]
Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said:
“As the UK’s largest generator of renewable power by output, Drax plays a critical role in supporting the country’s security of supply. We are accelerating our investment in renewable generation, having recently submitted planning applications for the development of BECCS at Drax Power Station and for the expansion of Cruachan Pumped Storage Power Station.
“As a leading producer of sustainable wood pellets we continue to invest in expanding our pellet production in order to supply the rising global demand for renewable power generated from biomass. We have commissioned new biomass pellet production plants in the US South and expect to take a final investment decision on up to 500,000 tonnes of additional capacity before the end of the year.
“As carbon removals become an increasingly urgent part of the global route to Net Zero, we are also making very encouraging progress towards delivering BECCS in North America and progressing with site selection, government engagement and technology development.
“In the UK and US we have plans to invest £3 billion in renewables that would create thousands of green jobs in communities that need them, underlining our position as a growing, international business at the heart of the green energy transition.”
Financial highlights
Adjusted EBITDA £225 million up 21% (H1 2021: £186 million)
Strong liquidity and balance sheet – £539 million of cash and committed facilities at 30 June 2022

2
and other GHGs

Continue to target final investment decision on up to 0.5Mt of new capacity in H2 2022
Generation – increased recognition of value of long-term security of supply from biomass and pumped storage
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations £205 million up 24% (H1 2021: £165 million)
Optimisation of biomass generation and logistics to support security of supply at times of higher demand
Summer – lower power demand, lower power generation and sale of reprofiled biomass
Winter – maximise biomass deliveries to support increased generation at times of higher demand
Four small, planned biomass outages completed in H1, supporting higher planned generation in H2-22
Strong portfolio system support performance (balancing mechanism, ancillary services and optimisation)
Higher cost of sales – logistics optimisation, biomass and system costs
Six-month extension of coal at request of UK government – winter contingency contract for security of supply
Closure of coal units in March 2023 following expiration of agreement with ESO at end of March 2023
Fixed fee and compensation for associated costs, including coal

Financial performance measures prefixed with “Adjusted” are stated after adjusting for one-off exceptional items that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group (revaluation of deferred tax balances reflecting future increases in UK CT rates, acquisition costs, gain on sale of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine generation assets, restructuring costs, debt restructuring costs and asset obsolescence charges and impairments), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS measures exclude amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
(2)
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, gains/losses on disposal of assets and impairment of non-current assets, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements, earnings from associates and earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.
(3)
Borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.

FSC License code: FSC-C119787.
(5)
Total $/t cost of production in Pellet Production – raw fibre, processing into a wood pellet, delivery to Drax port facilities in US and Canada, loading to vessel for shipment and overheads – Free on Board (FOB). Cost of ocean freight, UK port and rail cost reflected in Generation business accounts in addition to price paid to Pellet Production for the biomass pellet.
