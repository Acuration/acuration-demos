capture and storage beccs is the process of capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide co 2  from biomass organic matter energy generation why is beccs important for decarbonisation when sustainable bioenergy is paired with carbon capture and storage it becomes a source of negative emissions as co 2 is permanently removed from the carbon cycle experts believe that negative emissions technologies nets are crucial to helping countries meet the longterm goals set out in the paris climate agreement as beccs is the most scalable of these technologies this decade it has a key role to play in combating climate change how is the bioenergy for beccs generated most bioenergy is produced by combusting biomass as a fuel in boilers or furnaces to produce highpressure steam that drives electricitygenerating turbines  alternatively bioenergy generation can use a wide range of organic materials including crops specifically planted and grown for the purpose as well as residues from agriculture forestry and wood products industries energydense forms of biomass such as compressed wood pellets  enable bioenergy to be generated on a much larger scale fuels like wood pellets can also be used as a substitute for coal in existing power stations  how is the carbon captured beccs uses a postcombustion carbon capture process  where solvents isolate co 2 from the flue gases produced when the biomass is combusted the captured co 2 is pressurised and turned into a liquidlike substance so it can then be transported by pipeline  how is the carbon stored captured co 2 can be safely and permanently injected into naturally occurring porous rock formations for example unused natural gas reservoirs coal beds that cant be mined or saline aquifers water permeable rocks saturated with salt water this process is known as sequestration  over time the sequestered co 2 may react with the minerals locking it chemically into the surrounding rock through a process called mineral storage beccs fast facts two 600 megawatt mw biomass units upgraded with carbon capture technology could deliver 40 of the negative emissions the climate change committee indicates will be needed from beccs for the uk to reach netzero by 2050 beccs has the potential to remove 2070 million tonnes of co 2 per year in the uk by 2050 all national grids net zero future energy scenarios fes deploy beccs by 2028 and see a rapid increase in capacity in the 2030s there are 70 billion tonnes of potential co 2 storage space around the uk according to the british geological survey is beccs sustainable bioenergy can be generated from a range of biomass sources ranging from agricultural byproducts to forestry residues to organic municipal waste during their lifetime plants absorb co 2 from the atmosphere this balances out the co 2 that is released when the biomass is combusted whats crucial is that the biomass is sustainably sourced  be it from agriculture or forest waste responsibly managed sources of biomass are those which naturally regenerate or are replanted and regrown where theres a increase of carbon stored in the land and where the natural environment is protected from harm biomass wood pellets used as bioenergy in the uk for example are only sustainable when the forests they are sourced from continue to grow sourcing decisions must be based on science and not adversely affect the longterm potential of forests to store and sequester carbon biomass pellets can also create a sustainable market for forestry products which serves to encourage reforestation and afforestation  leading to even more co 2 being absorbed from the atmosphere go deeper the triple benefits for the environment and economy of deploying beccs in the uk how beccs can offer essential grid stability as the electricity system moves to low and zerocarbon sources producing biomass from sustainable forests is key to ensuring beccs can deliver negative emissions 5 innovative projects

asked questions  forests  sustainability evaluating regrowth postharvest with accurate data and satellite imagery 13 may 2021 sustainable bioenergy drax has been using effective postharvest evaluations which includes remote sensing technology and satellite imagery alongside sustainable forest management monitoring can help support rapid regrowth after harvesting evidence shows healthy managed forests with no signs of deforestation or degradation as part of draxs worldleading programme of demonstrating biomass sustainability including ongoing work on catchment area analysis caa  responsible sourcing policy and healthy forest landscapes hfl  we have also been trialling the use of highresolution satellite imagery to monitor forest conditions on specific harvesting sites in the years after harvesting has taken place in addition to the catchment area level monitoring of trends and data postharvest evaluations phe are an essential part of an ongoing sustainability monitoring process ensuring that the future forest resource is protected and maintained and that landowners restore forests after harvesting to prevent deforestation or degradation the most effective form of phe is for an experienced local forester to walk and survey the harvesting site to check that new trees are growing and that the health and quality of the young replacement forest is maintained rapid regrowth the images below show some of the sites surrounding draxs amite bioenergy pellet plant in mississippi with trees at various stages of regrowth in the years after harvesting newly planted pine pine 23 years pine 612 months pine 45 years a full site inspection can therefore enable a forester to determine whether the quantity and distribution of healthy trees is sufficient to make a productive forest equivalent to the area that was harvested it can also identify if there are any health problems pest damage or management issues such as weed growth or waterlogging that should be resolved typically this will be the responsibility of the forest owner or their forest manager and is a regular part of ongoing forest management activity this degree of survey and assessment is not practical or costeffective where a thirdparty consumer of wood fibre purchases a small proportion typically 2025 tonnes per acre of the lowgrade fibre produced at a harvest as a oneoff transaction for its wood pellet plant it is time consuming to walk every acre of restocked forest and it is not always possible to get an owners permission to access their land forests from space therefore an alternative methodology is required to make an assessment about the condition of forest lands that have been harvested to supply biomass without the need to physically inspect each site one option is to use remote sensing and satellite imagery to view each harvested site in the years after biomass sourcing this helps to monitor restocking and new tree growth drax has been testing the remote sensing approach using maxars commercial satellite imagery maxar has four satellites on orbit that collect more than three million square kilometres of highresolution imagery every day drax accesses this imagery through maxars subscription service securewatch  to test the viability of this methodology drax has been looking at harvesting sites in mississippi that supplied biomass to the amite bioenergy pellet plant in 2015 and in 2017 as part of the sustainability checks that are carried out prior to purchasing wood fibre drax collects information on each harvesting tract this includes the location of the site the type of harvest the owners longterm management intentions and species and volume details this data can then be used at a later date to revisit the site and monitor the condition of the area thirdparty auditors for instance through sustainable biomass program sbp certification  do visit harvesting sites however this is typically during the year of harvest rather than after restocking maxar has historical imagery of this region from 2010 which is prior to any harvesting for wood pellets the image below shows a harvesting site near the pellet plant at gloster mississippi before any harvesting has taken place march 2010 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies the image below shows the same site in 2017 immediately following harvesting december 2017 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies if we look again at this same site three years after harvesting we can see the rows of trees that have been planted and the quality of the regrowth this series of images demonstrates that this harvested area has remained a forest has not been subject to deforestation and that the regrowth appears to be healthy at this stage august 2020 50m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies another site in the amite catchment area is shown below the image shows a mature forest prior to harvesting the site has been previously thinned as can be seen from the thinned rows that are evident in the imagery may 2010 200m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies looking at the same site in the year after harvesting the clear cut area can be seen clearly some green vegetation cover can also be seen on the harvested area but this is weed growth rather than replanted trees some areas of mature trees have been left at the time of harvesting and are visible as a grey colour in the 2010 image these are likely to be streamside management zones that have been left to maintain biodiversity and to protect water quality with the grey winter colouring suggesting that they are hardwoods september 2018 200m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies three years after the harvest in a zoomed in view from the previous image clear rows of replanted trees can be seen in the imagery this demonstrates that the owner has successfully restocked the forest area and that the newly planted forest appears healthy and well established august 2020 50m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies while examining different harvesting sites in satellite imagery drax noted that not every site had evidence of tree growth particularly within the first three years after harvesting deliberate conversion of land to nonforest use such as for conversion to pasture agricultural crops or urban development is likely to be evident fairly soon after harvesting preparing for planting some forest owners like to leave a harvested site unplanted for a couple of years to allow ground vegetation and weed growth to establish this can then be treated to ensure that trees can be planted and that the weed growth does not impede the establishment of the new forest this process can mean that trees are not visible in satellite imagery for three to four years after harvesting the image below shows a site three years after harvesting with no evidence of tree growth given that no conversion of land use is evident and that the site appears to be clear of weed growth this is likely to be an example of where the owners have waited to clear the site of weeds prior to replanting this site can be monitored in future imagery from the maxar satellites to ensure that forest regrowth does take place november 2020 100m satellite image  2021 maxar technologies drax will continue to use maxars securewatch platform to monitor the regrowth of harvesting sites and will publish more detailed results and analysis when this process has been developed further the platform allows ongoing comparison of a site over time and could prove a more efficient method of analysis than ground survey in conjunction with the caa and hfl work phe can add remote sensing as a valuable monitoring and evidencegathering tool to demonstrate robust biomass sustainability standards and a positive environmental

joins other countries that have announced significant reduction goals for example the eu committed to reduce its emissions by at least 55 also south korea japan and china have all set netzero targets by midcentury here in the uk prime minister boris johnson this week outlined new climate commitments that will be enshrined in law the ambitious new targets will see carbon emissions cut by 78 by 2035 almost 15 years earlier than previously planned if delivered this commitment which is inline with the recommendations of the climate change committees sixth carbon budget will put the uk at the forefront of climate action and for the first time the targets include international aviation and shipping what makes climate change so difficult to tackle is that it requires collaboration from many different parties on a global scale never seen before as a uknorth american sustainable energy company with communities on both sides of the atlantic at drax we are keenly aware of the need for thinking that transcends borders creating a global opportunity for businesses and governments to work together towards a shared climate goal thats why we joined other businesses and investors in an open letter supporting the us governments ambitious climate actions collaboration between countries and industries its widely recognised that negative emissions technologies will be key to global efforts to combat climate change at drax were pioneering the negative emissions technology bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at our power station in north yorkshire which when up and

atlantic consider beccs essential for reaching net zero  the uks climate change committee says it will play a major role in removing co 2 emissions that will remain in the uk economy after 2050 from industries such as aviation and agriculture that will be difficult to fully decarbonise meanwhile a report published last year by new yorks columbia university revealed that rapid development of beccs is needed within the next 10 years in order to curb climate change and a recent report from baringa commissioned by drax showed it will be a lot more expensive for the uk to reach its legally binding fifth carbon budget between 2028 and 2031 without beccs a shared economic opportunity globally as many as 65 million wellpaid jobs could be created through investment in clean energy systems in the uk beccs and negative emissions are not just essential in preventing the impact of climate change but will also be a key component of a postcovid economy government and private investments in clean energy technologies can create thousands of wellpaid jobs new careers education opportunities and upskill workforces developing beccs at drax power station for example would support around 17000 jobs

clean growth in a postcovid recovery inside a pinnacle pellet mill we already know pinnacle well  it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with drax our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so im looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together we will benefit from pinnacles scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues in 2019 pinnacles production cost was 20 lower than draxs completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 49 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets at 17 plants in locations across western canada and the us south  up from 16mt now it also expands our access to three major north american fibre baskets and four export facilities giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply this positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by demand in asia biomass wood pellet storage dome drax power station we believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with c67 billion of longterm contracts with high quality asian and european customers including drax and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027 drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio we believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics helping to reduce distance time carbon footprint and cost train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station importantly  there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group we recognise that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta

will gardiner  wood pellets what is renewable energy 17 december 2020 sustainable bioenergy these differ to nonrenewable energy sources such as coal oil and natural gas of which there is a finite amount available on earth meaning if used excessively they could eventually run out renewable resources can provide energy for a variety of applications including electricity generation transportation and heating or cooling the difference between lowcarbon carbon neutral and renewable energy renewables such as wind solar and hydropower are zero carbon sources of energy because they do not produce any carbon dioxide co 2  when they generate power lowcarbon sources might produce some co 2  but much less than fuels like coal bioenergy that uses woody biomass from sustainably managed forests to generate electricity is carbon neutral because forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere as they grow meaning the amount of co 2 in the atmosphere remains level supply chains that bring bioenergy to power stations commonly use some fossil fuels in manufacturing and transportation therefore woody biomass is a low carbon fuel when its whole lifecycle is considered managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power responsible biomass sourcing also helps forests to absorb more carbon while displacing fossil fuelbased energy generation nuclear is an example of a zero carbon source of electricity that is not renewable it does not produce co 2 but it is dependent on uranium or plutonium of which there is a finite amount available managing forests in a sustainable way that does not lead to deforestation allows bioenergy to serve as a renewable source of power how much renewable energy is used around the world humans have harnessed renewable energy for millions of years in the form of woody biomass to fuel fires as well as wind to power ships and geothermal hot springs for bathing water wheels and windmills are other examples of humans utilising renewable resources but since the industrial revolution fossil fuels coal in particular have been the main source of power however as the effects of air pollution and co 2 produced from burning fossil fuels become increasingly apparent renewable energy is gradually replacing sources which contribute to climate change in the year 2000 renewable energy accounted for 18 of global electricity generation according to the iea  by 2019 renewable sources made up 27 of the worlds electrical power why renewable energy is essential to tackling climate change the single biggest human contribution to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions such as co 2 into the atmosphere they create an insulating layer around the planet that causes temperatures on earth to increase making it less habitable renewable sources of electricity can help to meet the worlds demand for power without contributing to global warming unlike carbonintensive fuels like coal gas and oil bioenergy can also be used to remove co 2 from the atmosphere while delivering renewable electricity through a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs forests absorb co 2 from the atmosphere then when the biomass is used to generate electricity the same co 2 is captured and stored permanently underground  reducing the overall amount of co 2 in the atmosphere humans have used renewable energy for millions for years from wood for fires to wind powering boats to geothermal hot springs whats holding renewables back the worlds energy systems were built with fossil fuels in mind this can make converting national grids difficult and installing new renewable energy sources expensive however as knowledge grows about how best to manufacture build and operate renewable systems the cost of deploying them at scale drops there are future changes needed renewables such as wind solar and tidal power are known as intermittent renewables because they cant generate electricity when there is no sun wind or the tidal movement for future energy systems to deliver enough power large scale energy storage as well as other flexible reliable forms of generation will also be needed to meet demand and keep systems stable  renewable energy key facts renewable power in the uk has grown sixfold in the last decade helping to cut the amount of carbon produced by the countrys electricity system by 58 according to electric insights the cost of electricity from solar panels dropped by 82 between 2010 and 2019 while the cost of onshore wind fell 40 and offshore

number of compressed wood pellet plants operated by georgia biomass now owned by enviva and fram renewable fuels the evidence found in the report by hood consulting shows a substantial increase in forest inventory stored carbon and a relatively stable forest area however with continued pressure from urban development future losses of timberland area are possible despite this increasing growth rates can maintain and improve wood supply and carbon stock for the foreseeable future increasing forest growing stock and carbon sequestration the overall inventory of growing stock in the catchment area has increased by 63 million cubic metres m 3  between 2000 and 2018 a growth of 193 all of this increase has been in the pine area which increased by nearly 68 million m 3  whereas the hardwood species decreased in volume by 45 million m 3  overall the inventory volume split by species in 2018 was 72 to 28 softwood to hardwood the breakdown by product category is shown in figure 3 below figure 1 change in growing stock by major product category and species usfs the pine sawtimber and chipnsaw product categories larger dimension and higher value material showed the largest increase in

stock volume by major product category usfs these changes are likely to reflect an increasing age class in the catchment area with younger stands of pine previously classed as pulpwood growing into a larger size class and being reclassified as sawtimber this means that the volume of sawtimber availability in future will be significantly higher but pulpwood availability will be diminished for pellet mill markets any loss in pulpwood availability can be compensated by an increase in sawmill residue production if market demand is maintained or increased figure 2 change in growing stock by major product category and species usfs growth rates for both softwood and hardwood species have been increasing since 2000 as shown in figure 3 below softwood growth has increased by 185 since 2000 and hardwood by 14 the improved softwood growth rate probably resulted from increased investment in the management of pine forests the superior quality of seedlings and better management practice ground preparation weed control fertilisation etc this is a very positive trend for the sequestration rate of carbon and also for providing landowners with the potential to increase revenue per hectare and encourage the retention and improved management of forests rather than converting to other land uses the georgia catchment area is likely split between passive owners that do not actively manage where growth rates are slower or decline and the incentive to convert land is greater and owners that actively manage to improve growth and quality increasing revenue and maintaining productive forest there is likely to be a much greater differential in growth rate between these two management approaches than reflected by the trend in figure 3 highlighting the importance of active management for carbon abatement figure 3 average annual growth rate per hectare usfs stable forest area at a macro scale the distribution of land use categories has remained relatively stable since 2000 with no apparent major shifts in land use the timberland area around the seven mills has decreased by around 135 thousand hectares ha between 2000 and 2018 23 of the total land area whilst the area of arable and urban land increased by 98 thousand 17 of total area and 158 thousand 27 of total area ha respectively in 2018 timberland represented 67 of total land area and all forest and woodland 80 of total area down from 69 and 82 respectively in 2000 figure 1 figure 4 change in land use category usda looking at this change in land use more closely the timberland area shows the most pronounced decline between 2010 and 2018 a drop of 117 thousand ha the largest change in other land use categories over this period was an increase of 97 thousand ha in urban and other land suggesting that a large proportion of the timberland area has been converted to urban areas the most significant change in agricultural land occurred prior to 2010 when the timberland area remained relatively stable this change appears to have involved the transition of pastureland to arable crops there may also have been some reclassification of forest and woodland types with a decrease in the area of woodland and an

population pressure and increased development can lead to more forest loss and land use change figure 5 trends in major land use categories usda draxs suppliers in the georgia catchment area have made a commitment not to source wood from areas where land use change is taking place this commitment is monitored and verified through the sustainable biomass program sbp certification process that is

has been around 36 million m 3 with both demand and growth increasing in recent years figure 7 average annual growth removals and surplus usfs as shown in figures 2  3 growth rates are strong and inventory is increasing this is not a problem in the georgia area the relatively small surplus as compared to other catchment areas in the us south is due to the higher concentration of wood fibre markets and the more intense forest industry activity in this region as of july 2020 there were over 50 major woodconsuming mills operating within the georgia catchment area and an additional 80 mills operating within close proximity overlapping the catchment area total pulpwood demand in 2019 was 129 million tons of which approximately 87 was attributed to nonbioenergyrelated sources predominantly pulppaper and 13 was attributed to the bioenergy sector given the bioenergy sectors low ranking position in the market with the lowest ability to pay for fibre combined with the relatively small scale in demand compared to the pulp and paper industry the influence of biomass markets can be considered to be minimal in this region particular when it comes to impacts on wood prices and forest management practice wood price trends pine sawtimber prices suffered a significant decline between 2000 and 2010 dropping almost 21 per ton as a result of the global financial crisis and the decline in demand due to the collapse in housing markets and construction table 3 since 2010 pine sawtimber has remained relatively stable with some minor fluctuations shown in figure 8 below change ton pine

tms pine pulpwood prices have been on a generally increasing trend since 2000 with a more significant increase since 2011 this increase does not reflect an increase in demand or total volume which has remained relatively stable over this period but a shifting of the geographic distribution of the market with some new mills opening and old mills closing resulting in increased competition in some localised fibre baskets and leading to an overall increase in stumpage price figure 8 stumpage price trends tms figure 9 below shows that with the exception of the hurricane salvage volume in 2018 pulpwood removals have declined or remained relatively stable since 2010 whereas pulpwood stumpage prices increased by 41 from 2010 to 2018 figure 9 pulpwood demand and stumpage price usfs tms

comparison of pine pulpwood stumpage prices in drax supply areas us south tms hood consulting summary of the impact of the seven pellet plants on key trends and metrics in this catchment area is there any evidence that bioenergy demand has caused the following deforestation no us forest service usfs data shows a 108130hectare 26 decrease in total timberland in the georgia catchment area since georgia biomass first full year of production in 2012 specifically this loss in total area of timberland coincided with a more than 21000hectare increase in croplandpastureland and a more than 73000hectare increase in urban land and land classified as having other uses however there is little evidence to suggest that increased wood demand from the bioenergy sector has caused this decrease in total timberland furthermore pine timberland  the primary source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry  has increased more than 17000 hectares in the catchment area since 2016 a change in management practices rotation lengths thinnings conversion from hardwood to pine no changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last two decades however there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand which accounts for roughly 1014 of total pulpwood demand and only 57 of total wood demand in the catchment area has caused or is responsible for these changes clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region both of which are longstanding widely used methods of harvesting timber timbermartsouth tms data shows that thinnings accounted for 67 of total reported harvest area in the southeast georgia market from 20002010 but only 43 of total harvest area reported from 20122019 specifically this downward shift was initiated by the bursting of the us housing bubble in the mid2000s and had been completed by the early 2010s wed like to note that this shift coincided with a nearly 50 decrease in pine sawtimber stumpage price from 20062012 this is important because the strength of pine sawtimber markets had been a driving force behind timber management decisions in this region in the early and mid2000s also contributing to the decreased prevalence of thinnings was the strengthening of pine pulpwood markets in the mid2000s as pine pulpwood stumpage prices increased more than 40 in the georgia catchment area from 20032008 so with sawtimber markets continuing to weaken and pulpwood markets doing just the opposite the data suggests that many landowners decided to alter their management approach to take advantage of strong pulpwood markets and focus on short pulpwood rotations that typically do not utilize thinnings ultimately the shift in management approach that occurred in this market can be linked to the weakening of one type of timber market and the strengthening of another in the early and mid2000s timber management was focused on sawtimber production  a type of management that utilizes thinnings however for more than a decade now this market has been driven to a large degree by the pulppaper industry with a significant portion of the timber management in this area focused on short pulpwood rotations diversion from other markets no demand for softwood pine sawlogs increased an estimated 39 in the georgia catchment area from 20112019 also increased bioenergy demand has caused no diversion from other pulpwood markets ie pulppaper as pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy held steady and remained nearly unchanged from 20122017 before increasing in 2018 and 2019 due to the influx of salvage wood brought about by hurricane michael wed like to make special note that increased demand for softwood sawlogs since 2011 has not resulted in a full pine sawtimber pst stumpage price recovery in this market reduced demand for softwood sawlogs in the late 2000s and early 2010s resulted in oversupply and this oversupply has remained despite increased demand the last 68 years as a result pst stumpage prices have held steady and averaged roughly 30 per ton in the catchment area since 2013  down approximately 35 from the 20002006 average of more than 46 per ton but up roughly 15 from the 20112012 average of approximately 26 per ton an unexpected or abnormal increase in wood prices no  inconclusive the delivered price of pine pulpwood ppw  the primary roundwood product consumed by both georgia biomass and fram  increased 26 in the georgia catchment area over the six years directly following the startup of georgia biomass increasing from 2916 per ton in 2011 to 3663 per ton in 2017 and while this 26 increase in delivered ppw price coincided with a roughly 11 million metric ton increase in annual pine pulpwood demand from georgia biomass and fram total demand for pine pulpwood from both bioenergy and other sources actually decreased 7 over this period moreover evidence suggest that this increase in ppw price is more closely linked to changes in wood supply specifically the 9 decrease in ppw inventory from 20112017 however there is evidence that links increased demand from the bioenergy sector to an increase in secondary residual ie sawmill chips sawdust and shavings prices specifically the price of pine sawmill chips  a residual feedstock utilized by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet production  held steady and averaged approximately 26 per ton in the georgia catchment area from 20082012 however from 20122016 pine sawmill chip prices increased more than 15 to 2955 per ton in 2016 this increase in price coincided with annual pine residual feedstock purchases by georgia biomass and fram increasing from roughly 325000 metric tons to nearly 10 million metric tons over this period however note that pine sawmill chip prices have held steady and averaged roughly 2950 per ton in the catchment area since 2016 despite further increases in pine secondary residual purchases by georgia biomass and fram to more than 12 million metric tons in 2019 ultimately the data suggests that any excess supply of pine secondary residuals in the catchment area was absorbed by the bioenergy sector in the early and mid2010s and the additional demandcompetition placed on this market led to increased residual prices however the plateauing of residual prices since 2015 along with the continued increase in secondary residual purchases by georgia biomass and fram further suggest that an increasing percentage of secondary residual purchases by the bioenergy sector is sourced from outside the catchment area specifically fram confirmed this notion noting that 3540 of its secondary residual purchases come from outside the georgia catchment area from six different states in the us south a reduction in growing stock timber no total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 11 from 2011 through 2018 the latest available specifically over this period inventories of pine sawtimber and chipnsaw increased 35 and 13 respectively however pine pulpwood inventory decreased 11 from 20112018 note that the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory was not due to increased demand from bioenergy or other sources or increased harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area  as annual growth of pine pulpwood has exceeded annual removals every year since 2011 rather this decrease can be linked to the 24 decline in pine sawtimber removals that occurred from 20052014 due to the bursting of the us housing bubble and great recession that followed in this region timber is typically harvested via clearcut once it reaches maturity ie sawtimber grade after which the stand is reestablished and the cycle repeated however with the reduced harvest levels during this period also came a reduction in newly reestablished timber stands  the source of pine pulpwood so with less replantings occurring during this period inventories of pine pulpwood were not replenished to the same degree they had been previously and therefore this catchment area saw a reduction in pine pulpwood inventory levels however according to the us forest service annual removals of pine sawtimber have increased 50 in the georgia catchment area since 2014 which would suggest higher clearcut levels and increased stand reestablishment timbermartsouth data also supports this assertion as clearcut harvests have constituted approximately 60 of the total harvest area reported to timbermartsouth in this region since 2014 compared to 40 from 20052014 ultimately these increases in clearcut and stand reestablishment levels may not be reflected in increased pine pulpwood inventory levels in the short term  as it can take more than 10 years for a pine seedling to become merchantable and reach the minimum diameter requirements to be classified as pulpwood however adequate supply levels are expected to remain in the meantime furthermore pine pulpwood inventory levels are expected to increase in the midtolong terms as a result of the increased harvest levels and stand reestablishment levels that have occurred in the catchment area since 2014 a reduction in the sequestration rate of carbon no  inconclusive us forest service data shows the average annual growth rate of total growing stock timber has remained nearly unchanged holding between 60 and 61 in the catchment area since 2011 which would suggest that the sequestration rate of carbon has also changed very little in the catchment area the last 810 years however the 11 increase in total growing stock inventory since 2011 does indicate that total carbon storage levels have increased in the georgia catchment area since georgia biomass commenced operations in this market an increase in harvesting above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area no growthtoremovals gr ratios which compare annual timber growth to annual harvests provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge of market sustainability in 2018 the latest available the gr ratio for pine pulpwood the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector equaled 106 a value greater than 10 indicates sustainable harvest levels note however that the pine pulpwood gr ratio averaged 144 from 20122017 the significant drop in 2018 was due to a 31 increase in removals due to hurricane michael and is not reflective of the new norm specifically pine pulpwood removals are projected to be more in line with pre2018 levels in 2019 and 2020 and so too is the pine pulpwood gr ratio timber growing stock inventory neutral according to usfs data inventories of pine pulpwood decreased 11 in the catchment area from 20112018 however that decrease was not due to increased demand from bioenergy typically a reduction in inventory is linked to harvest levels above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area but in this case annual growth of pine pulpwood exceeded annual removals every year during this period ultimately the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory from 20112018 can be linked to decreased pine sawtimber production beginning in the mid2000s specifically annual removals of pine sawtimber decreased 24 from 20052014 and the reduction in harvest levels during this period meant fewer new pine stands were reestablished and that has led to the current reduction in pine pulpwood inventory note that the decrease in pine sawtimber removals from 20052014 was mirrored by a 27 increase in pine sawtimber inventory over this same period however usfs data shows that annual removals of pine sawtimber have increased 50 in the georgia catchment area since 2014 which suggests that pine pulpwood inventory levels will start to increase in the catchment area due to increased harvest levels and the subsequent increase in stand reestablishment levels timber growth rates neutral timber growth rates have increased for both pine sawtimber and pine chipnsaw but decreased slightly for pine pulpwood in the catchment area since 2011 evidence suggests that this decrease in pine pulpwood growth rate is not due to increases in bioenergy demand but rather linked to changes in diameter class distribution and indicative of a forest in a state of transition where timber is moving up in product class ie pine pulpwood is moving up in classification to pine chipnsaw forest area neutral in the georgia catchment area total forest area timberland decreased more than 115000 hectares 28 from 2011 through 2018 note that this decrease coincided with a roughly 19000hectare increase in cropland and 93000hectare increase in urban land and land classified as having other uses specifically pine timberland the primary source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry decreased over 34000 hectares from 20112016 however from 20162018 pine timberland stabilized and rather increased more than 17000 hectares in the catchment area or a net decrease of roughly 17000 hectares from 20112018 ultimately there is little evidence that the decrease in pine timberland from 20112016 or increase since 2016 is linked to increased bioenergy demand rather the overall decrease in pine timberland since 2011 appears to be more closely linked to the relative weakness of pine sawtimber markets in the georgia catchment area and the lack of return from sawtimber wood prices positive  negative intuitively an increase in demand should result in an increase in price and this is what the data shows in the georgia catchment area as it relates to increased biomass demand from georgia biomass and fram and the prices of the various raw materials consumed by these mills specifically the 14million metric ton increase in softwood pulpwood demand attributed to georgia biomass and fram coincided with a 20 increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 1015 increase in pine chip prices from 20112015 since 2015 biomass demand has held relatively steady and overall so too have delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices the apparent link between increased bioenergy demand and increased pine raw material prices is supported further by statistical analysis as strong positive correlations were found between softwood biomass demand and both delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices however note that biomass demand alone is not responsible for these changes in prices as softwood biomass demand accounts for only 1015 of total softwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area rather the prices of these raw materials are impacted to a larger degree by demand from other sources ie pulppaper which accounts for 8590 of total softwood pulpwood demand in the georgia catchment area on the other hand its also important to note that the increase in bioenergyrelated wood demand has been a positive for forest landowners in the georgia catchment area not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood in this market but the increase in pulpwood prices as a result of increased pulpwood demand has transferred through to landowners improved compensation specifically since 2015 pine pulpwood ppw stumpage price  the price paid to landowners  has averaged more than 17 per ton in the georgia catchment area this represents a 70 increase over the approximately 10 per ton averaged by ppw stumpage in the catchment area over the last five years prior to georgia biomass startup in 2q 2011 note pine pulpwood stumpage prices are notably higher in the georgia catchment area due to a much tighter balance in supply and demand in comparison to most other markets across the us south for instance in all other areas across the us south2 ppw stumpage prices have averaged less than 9 per ton since 2015 or roughly half that of prices in the georgia catchment area markets for solid wood products positive in the georgia catchment area demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased an estimated 39 from 20112019 and byproducts of the sawmilling process are sawmill residuals  materials utilized by georgia biomass and the fram mills to produce wood pellets with the increased production of softwood lumber so too has come an increase in sawmill residuals some of which have been purchasedconsumed by georgia biomass and fram not only have these pellet producers benefited from the greater availability of this byproduct but lumber producers have also benefited as the georgia biomass and fram mills have provided an additional outlet for these producers and their byproducts read the full report georgia biomass catchment area analysis this is

energy biomass is any organic matter that can be used to generate energy for example wood forest residues or plant materials how is biomass used biomass used and combusted for energy can come in a number of different forms ranging from compressed wood pellets  which are used in power stations that have upgraded from coal  to biogas and biofuels a liquid fuel that can be used to replace fossil fuels in transport the term biomass also refers to any type of organic material used for energy in domestic settings for example wood burned in wood stoves and wood pellets used in domestic biomass boilers  biomass is organic matter like wood forest residues or plant material that is used to generate energy where does biomass come from biomass can be produced from different sources including agricultural or forestry residues dedicated energy crops or waste products such as uneaten food drax power station uses compressed wood pellets sourced from sustainably managed working forests in the us canada europe and brazil and are largely made up of lowgrade wood produced as a byproduct of the production and processing of higher value wood products like lumber and furniture biomass producers and users must meet a range of stringent measures for their biomass to be certified as sustainable and responsibly sourced  is biomass renewable biomass grown through sustainable means is classified as a renewable source of energy because of the process of its growth as biomass comes from organic living matter it grows naturally absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere in the process it means when biomass is combusted as a source of energy  for example for heat or electricity production  the co 2 released is offset by the amount of co 2 it absorbed from the atmosphere while it was growing fast facts in 2019 biomass accounted for 6 of great britains electricity generation more than 16 of the total generation of all renewable sources there is about 550 gigatonnes of biomass

what is carbon capture usage and storage carbon capture and storage ccs is the process of trapping or collecting carbon emissions from a largescale source  for example a power station or factory  and then permanently storing them carbon capture usage and storage ccus is where captured carbon dioxide co 2  may be used rather than stored in other industrial processes or even in the manufacture of consumer products  how is carbon captured carbon can be captured either precombustion  where it is removed from fuels that emit carbon before the fuel is used or postcombustion  where carbon is captured directly from the gases emitted once a fuel is burned precombustion carbon capture involves solid fossil fuels being converted into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide under heat pressure the separated co 2 is captured and transported to be stored or used postcombustion carbon capture uses the addition of other materials such as solvents to separate the carbon from flue gases produced as a result of the fuel being burned the isolated carbon is then transported normally via pipeline to be stored permanently  usually deep underground  or used for other purposes carbon capture and storage traps and removes carbon dioxide from large sources and most of that co 2 is not released into the atmosphere what can the carbon be used for once carbon is captured it can be stored permanently or used in a variety of different ways for example material including carbon nanofibres and bioplastics can be produced from captured carbon and used in products such as airplanes and bicycles while several startups are developing methods of turning captured co 2 into animal feed captured carbon can even assist in the largescale production of hydrogen  which could be used as a carbonneutral source of transport fuel or as an alternative to natural gas in power generation where can carbon be stored carbon can be stored in geological reserves  commonly naturally occurring underground rock formations such as unused natural gas reservoirs saline aquifers or unmineable coal beds the process of storage is referred to as sequestration the underground storage process means that the carbon can integrate into the earth through mineral storage  where the gas chemically reacts with the minerals in the rock formations and forms new solid minerals that ensure it is permanently and safely stored carbon injected into a saline aquifer dissolves into the water and descends to the bottom of the aquifer in a process called dissolution storage according to the global ccs institute  over 25 million tonnes of carbon captured from the power and industrial sectors was successfully and permanently stored in 2019 across sites in the usa norway and brazil what are the benefits of carbon storage co 2 is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in our atmosphere and therefore contributes to global warming by capturing and storing carbon it is being taken out of the atmosphere which reduces greenhouse gas levels and helps mitigate the effects of climate change carbon capture fast facts ccus is an affordable way to lower co 2 emissions  fighting climate change
