business different people do things different ways says sam stocks an apprentice engineer at drax power station its a sentiment echoed by corporate administration apprentice chloe carpenter at opus energy asked to describe her role she says its a very different kind of job chloe and sam are just two of a number of apprentices at drax group who are working across the uk and while theyre proud to do things differently they do have something in common  theyre all handson practical people who would rather get stuck in on a project than sit still and hear about it in the classroom i chose an apprenticeship over higher education because im more of a doing person says molly fensome a corporate administration apprentice sam agrees i like to be handson he says i dont like being sat in a classroom they are doing things their way  engineering their own futures while growing personally and professionally and ensuring the future of our energy supply in the process finding a strong sense of identity for sam working at drax wasnt just a sensible career move it was also following in his familys footsteps my grandad worked in the power station industry all his life my family know exactly what im like and they knew what type of place this was to work draxs transformation from a coalpowered plant to a modern sustainable electricity company means sams work is building a power framework for future generations while also paying homage to his grandads career jake dawson an electrical engineer apprentice followed a similar path into the power industry being born and bred in the area drax power station has always been a part of his geography because im such a local lad it was perfect for me he says in his role jake can play a key part in the region where he grew up a recent oxford economics report shows that drax contributes 431 million to yorkshire and the humber economy and supports over 3200 jobs a role in a team drax is a large organisation but for chloe finding role models within her team she can look up to and take guidance from has been easy mentoring sessions are relaxed and you build a special bond with that person she says you can talk to them about work outside of work  anything theyll always be there for you corporate administration apprentice matt donnelly has had a similar experience adding that hes seen his confidence grow and feels he has made lifelong friends in his role ultimately its not just that they are given the right support but that apprentices are integrated as a part of the company from day one my favourite part of my apprenticeship so far is being part of the team says chloe because you feel like youre not just an apprentice but youre also one of them  being part of something bigger sam remembers his first day at drax power station it was overwhelming you dont actually realise how big it is and realise how many people work here its just normal now if i go anywhere else im thinking thats not as big as at work its not just its size that makes the uks biggest single site renewable power station stand out but the potential for career development there its this that jake had on his mind when he first made the decision to become an apprentice he was working in an unskilled job with little opportunity but he knew he had it in him to find something bigger his outlook today as a drax apprentice is very different my aim after the four years is to carry on growing as a person increasing all my skills that i have and maybe eventually becoming a supervisor or an engineer who knows this mindset of striving for better is evident across apprentices its what drove them to join the programme in the first place instead of going somewhere like uni and then possibly coming out without a job youve got a job and youre actually learning as youre doing it says sam the skill set that ive learnt now  ill probably go anywhere in the world with it find out more about apprenticeships at drax tags opus energy  careers

his education and completed an hnc in electrical  electronic engineering after a 10year break he resumed his further education graduating from humberside  lincolnshire university with a degree in electronics  control engineering achieving chartered engineering status with the institute of electrical engineers in 1999 having worked at drax for 41 years micks career has included roles such as instrument mechanic various engineering grades from assistant engineer to process control engineer  maintenance section head mick is now the electrical control  instrumentation engineering section

group may have been built with drax power station at its core but today its a set of integrated companies helping to change the way energy is generated supplied and used to build a better future at the heart of each part of the business  from creating the fuel to power the stations boilers to managing the supply of electricity gas and renewable heating fuel to customers  is people here we meet some of those people working behind the scenes robert gatlin operations supervisor amite bioenergy drax biomass i was a student in the process operations technology programme at southwest mississippi community college and drax came to the school to recruit new grads they were introducing a new technology id never heard of and it sparked my interest the idea of using biomass to produce electricity on such a large scale was fascinating so i joined drax biomass in 2014 i was unaware biomass was being used to produce electricity  its very exciting to be part of something this big and cutting edge one of the most interesting things ive discovered working here is the way moisture affects nearly everything in the pelletising process we really have to work diligently to ensure our moisture levels are where they need to be in every stage of producing a pellet rachel grima sustainability analyst drax group ive always wanted to work in renewable energy and i studied life cycle analysis during my degree i started looking for jobs in renewable energy and as the biggest generator of renewable energy in the uk drax was an obvious choice today my job involves assessing and interpreting sustainability data for all the biomass we use our team uses this data to assess if a supplier meets our sustainability policy and regulation id never looked very much at transport emissions so i find it really interesting you can move 30000 tonnes of wood pellets in one ship but it would take over 1000 trucks to move that many creating far more greenhouse gas emissions since joining the team ive been really surprised to see how driving small efficiencies in a supply chain can create real savings in greenhouse gas emissions stephen wilkinson turbine maintenance technician drax power station  ive always enjoyed building and fixing things given that my father and both grandfathers were in engineering  one of them even working at drax during its construction  i had a strong drive to get into engineering living locally it seemed the biggest and best place to work im a turbine maintenance technician so i act as the link between the turbine support group and the main station planning and maintenance teams i start the day early by looking through the list of overnight defects focusing on the turbine area after this im out of the office having a look at the issues to determine whether the station maintenance team or the turbine support group will carry out the repair work from this point on every day is different the recent changes drax has made to adapt to a rapidly changing energy market has affected most people at the station for me seeing the major turbine upgrades take place has been extremely interesting i started as an apprentice and then as a fitter working on the turbine outages seeing these upgrades firsthand this has moved on to the point where i have been lucky enough to visit a number of the turbine manufacturing facilities in the uk and germany gemma baker sme customer service delivery manager haven power i joined haven power in july 2007 as a customer service advisor id never worked in the energy industry before and thought it sounded interesting  haven caught my eye as it was a new company which excited me being part of and contributing to a growing company was right up my street now im responsible for delivering a consistent and valued account management service to our electricity customers across all the small to medium enterprise sme segments this includes everything from billing and cash collection to renewals and query and complaint resolution ive been at haven for nine and a half years now sam french customer service administrator apprentice opus energy before joining  opus energy  i didnt know anything about the energy industry  now i know about different supplier competitors how an electricity supply contract is agreed and registered and how we actually apply for a supply ive learnt so much about different aspects of the energy industry too i havent had that much involvement with the drax group yet but ive enjoyed looking into the business ive found it really interesting to learn how theyve managed to transition from a nonrenewable company to one that is now producing more renewable than fossil fuel power  which is amazing amy carton sales and marketing executive billington bioenergy im responsible for all aspects of internal and external marketing and communications at billington bioenergy  a company which supplies wood pellets to commercial and domestic customers who use them to heat their homes or businesses i try to be environmentally conscious and keep my carbon footprint as low as possible  renewable and sustainable heating comes into this its wonderful to spend my days promoting the merits of renewable heating its a relatively small industry in the uk in comparison to our european counterparts but this makes what we do here in billington bioenergy quite unique there was quite a bit of information to digest when i first started  for example en plus regulations  different types of pellets how wood pellet boilers work it was a big learning curve find out about careers and apprenticeships within drax group billington bioenergy drax biomass drax group and drax power haven power opus energy tags about us  careers  apprenticeships what does an instrument craftsperson do 10 november 2016 power generation how do you go about fixing a turbine that on a normal day spins 3000 times every minute the first port of call is to call in someone like alice gill an instrument craftsperson at drax power station what does an instrument craftperson do what i do is maintain and repair the equipment that links the outside power plant and the control room  equipment that tracks temperature levels or positioning that then informs our operators in the control room whats happening on the plant things like an oxygen analyser its a probe that sits in the boiler and monitors the oxygen level so the operator can ensure the correct ratio of fuel to air is going into the boiler to reach optimum combustion i might be called on to do calibration checks on that sensor to ensure that its working properly or i might be asked to completely remove it and then to repair it how did you come to be doing this job im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person my dad was always working and fixing things in the garage at home and i liked being in there with him when i was at school i decided i didnt want to go to university so started applying for apprenticeships and looking into engineering opportunities drax was one of those schemes and was the one i most wanted to be selected for  luckily enough i was offered a place the apprenticeship was four years and there are loads of training courses and so much to learn including hands on experience and working in the plant i remember first arriving to the power station and not really believing the scale of the place you think how am i ever going to find my way around but you soon get used to it and it becomes the norm in september i became a full instrument craftsperson so now i can really get stuck in im not the sort of person who likes to sit down at a desk all day  im more of a hands on sort of person what sort of challenges do you face over the summer ive been doing a lot of work on the turbines its a big job as theyre one of the most important elements driving the plant and generating the power during outages the whole thing gets overhauled and given a full health check the turbine team needs to get into machinery which is densely constructed and put together so its my job to go in and carefully remove instrumentation so they can access it when theyre done i have to go back in refit everything and check its all working again how do you do that when youre removing the instruments its a bit more of a just get it off approach  you just make sure you get it off safely without damaging it then when were refitting it were out there with our multimeters making sure were setting different probes at the right voltages and that everything is calibrated correctly theres a screen in our workshop we use to watch the activity of the turbine so we can see the speed of the turbine creeping up as they switch it back on its always a big moment you know things are going to be alright because youve done everything but there are still some nervous people in the room the turbines are spinning at 3000rpm so you really need it all to be working properly is there anything that could wrong on an average day one of the biggest things that could go wrong in my area is the potential to trip an entire generating unit it might be that you overpressurise something or you accidentally trigger a switch that then sets off a daisy chain of events that ends up in a unit tripping tripping is where the unit turns off which basically leads to a total shutdown in electricity generation from one sixth of drax power station theres something called the 660 club  at full load the units are operating at 660 mw so if you trip one you enter into this infamous club there are a few guys in the 660 club but thankfully i havent joined when operating at full load of 660 mw our units supply the national grid with around 645 mw enough to power an entire city what do you do outside of work ive got a horse called red  ive had him for seven years but ive been riding since i was eight its quite different to working with things that do exactly what you tell them when you get on the horse he just does what he wants  hes got a mind of his own its a big change tags power station  careers  apprenticeships  engineering  technology name email comment
