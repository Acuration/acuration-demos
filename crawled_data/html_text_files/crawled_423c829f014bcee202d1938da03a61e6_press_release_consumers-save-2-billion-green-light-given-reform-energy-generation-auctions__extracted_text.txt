reform of energy generation auctions 16 february 2016 an independent report published today has revealed consumers could save more than 2 billion if the governments planned renewable energy auctions are opened up to include a wider mix of technologies drax commissioned nera economic consulting and imperial college to look at hidden costs that are not reflected in the contracts government awards for renewable generation these hidden costs or whole system costs are increasing as intermittent renewables  those reliant on the sun and wind  increase these intermittent renewables mean other forms of power generation need to kick in and flex up and down to meet electricity demand these costs are passed on to consumers via their energy bills currently the government is planning three auctions for new renewable energy contracts  contracts for difference cfds  planned over the next four years and all are focused on offshore wind the new research shows significant differences in the true costs of renewables once these additional costs are recognised offshore wind could require a cfd of 127 per mwh onshore wind 9297 per mwh solar 96 per mwh and biomass 84 per mwh once these new support levels are modelled over the planned energy auctions the new energy mix that could win contracts is shown to save consumers 19 22 billion this support is already paid for through energy bills and the new costefficient mix would lessen the impact drax group ceo dorothy thompson said this independent research shows its crucial we get the right mix of energy generation the uks system faces growing challenges from costs to reliability as traditional forms of generation are replaced with renewables intermittent renewables like wind and solar are vital as we continue to clean up energy generation but they need to be backed up by a constant supply of electricity that can be flexed up and down to make sure the uks businesses and households always have power on demand opening up energy auctions to include other renewables could save consumers 2 billion and with more biomass in the mix energy security is also boosted using the latest technology weve upgraded half our power station to run on compressed wood pellets which give an 80 plus carbon saving against coal with the right support we stand ready to finish the job nera economic consulting associate director daniel radov added nera economic consulting is pleased to be able to continue its partnership with imperial college in modelling the total costs of different power generation technologies and in helping to inform the policy discussion around renewable energy and decarbonisation to ensure that we achieve environmental targets as efficiently as possible it is essential to have policies in place that provide the right incentives to minimise costs we hope the combination of imperials wholesystem energy modelling with neras ability to model the details of the cfd auctions will contribute to a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different policy approaches ends contact drax paul hodgson 44 1757 612026 email protected nera david tomlinson 44 20 7659 8752 mobile 44 7919 398079 email protected notes to editors nera economic consulting is a global firm of experts dedicated to applying economic finance and quantitative principles to complex business and legal challenges nera brings academic rigor objectivity and real world industry experience to bear on issues arising from competition regulation public policy strategy finance and litigation across many sectors including energy infrastructure and the environment imperial college london is a respected academic institution with experience of energy system modelling they were chosen to ensure the modelling would be consistent with the work they produced for the committee on climate change on the same topic in 2015 the report focuses on whole system costs whole system costs wsc are simply the sum of the levelised cost of energy and the associated system integration costs for a given technology ie wsc  lcoe  sic the levelised cost of energy lcoe is the cost of building maintaining and operating a generation asset ie power stationwind farmsolar park over the life of the asset this is the figure that is currently factored into cfd auction bids system integration costs sic represent the additional expense of operating the electricity network as a result of those assets participating in the gb electricity market these costs include maintaining sufficient levels of backup capacity system reliability and managing flows on the transmission network system balancing different technologies eg wind solar biomass etc have different impacts on total system integration costs depending on their reliability flexibility and location on the system the government has committed to support offshore wind capacity in the next three cfd auctions to promote technological learning and cost reduction in that technology this analysis proposes that a proportion of the offshore wind budget is protected in each auction to promote such benefits the analysis demonstrates that opening a proportion of the budget to full technology neutral competition could reduce costs to consumers by up to 22bn report click here to view the nera economic consulting report about drax drax group plc is an innovative energy company that owns and operates the uks largest power station in selby north yorkshire typically providing some 8 of the uks electricity a vital strategic asset the group has transformed itself into a
