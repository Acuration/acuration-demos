power station drax moves closer to coalfree future with unit four conversion drax power station today took a step closer to achieving its coalfree ambitions by taking its fourth coalfired power generating unit offline as part of a planned outage programme as it prepares to convert it to run on sustainable biomass 6 june 2018 once the upgrade is complete twothirds of the power stations capacity will produce renewable power drax has already invested around 700 million in upgrading half the power station and associated supply chain infrastructure to use sustainable biomass instead of coal  transforming the business to become europes largest decarbonisation project the conversion of the fourth unit is expected to be complete over the summer returning to service in the second half of 2018 the cost of conversion is significantly below the level of previous conversions at around 30 million draxs engineers will upgrade the unit by reusing some redundant infrastructure left from when the company was first cofiring biomass with coal on a large scale around eight years ago a trial last year confirmed that by modifying the old cofiring delivery system compressed wood pellets can be delivered in the quantities required to fully convert the fourth generating unit andy koss drax power ceo said switching the fourth unit from coal to biomass is another milestone in the transformation of the power station it will extend the life of the plant protecting jobs both here at drax and in the supply chain whilst delivering cleaner reliable power for millions of homes and businesses the conversion thats underway is testament to the engineering expertise skill and ingenuity we have at drax the team has developed some very innovative solutions for this upgrade using all the knowledge weve gained throughout the work we have done so far to transform the business using sustainable biomass once it comes back online the fourth unit will help the power station at selby in north yorkshire to deliver vital reliable and flexible power needed by the grid to maintain secure supplies as more renewables come online and the sector continues to decarbonise once the conversion is complete drax will turn its attention to its remaining two coal units which it plans to replace with gasfired power generating units the closed cycle gas turbines it is looking to develop could deliver up to 36gw of capacity as well as up to 200mw of battery storage draxs plans for the gas project have been submitted to the planning inspectorate which has 28 days to determine if it will accept the application if accepted the proposals will be examined by the planning inspectorate and then considered by the secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy with a decision expected in 2019 in the uk there has been an 84 per cent reduction in coalfired power generation in the last five years as low carbon generation has increased ends media contacts jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 07712 677177 editors notes drax welcomed the uk governments response to the consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the renewable obligation scheme published in january it proposed that rather than imposing a cap on renewable obligation certificate roc support for any future biomass unit conversions a cap would be applied at the power station level across all units receiving rocs this will protect existing converted generating units and limit the amount of incremental rocs attributable to additional unit conversions to 125000 per annum as a result once the unit is converted this summer drax expects to optimise its power generation from biomass across its three roc units under the cap whilst supporting the governments objective of controlling costs under the renewable obligation scheme drax also has a biomass generating unit which receives support under the contract for difference cfd scheme this unit is unaffected by the government consultation on cost control for further biomass conversions under the ro scheme the fourth generating unit at drax was switched on in 1986 when the second half of the power station known as drax b began generating power from coal this was 12 years after the first half of the power station began generating power in 1974 drax converted its first three coal units to use biomass between 2013 and 2016 65 of the electricity drax produced in 2017 was renewable  enough to power four million households drax signed up to the powering past coal alliance in april  the ukcanadian initiative seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries drax is the most efficient power station in the uks coal fleet and draxs fourth unit would have been one of the last to close under the governments coal phase out plans this means drax is closing a coal unit nearly seven years earlier than anticipated about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet
