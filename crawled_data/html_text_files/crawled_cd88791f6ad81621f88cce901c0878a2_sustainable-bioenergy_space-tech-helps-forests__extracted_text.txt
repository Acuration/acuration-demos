things for the earths forests 20 april 2017 sustainable bioenergy can you count the number of trees in the world accurately no  there are just too many spread out over too vast an area but if we could what would we gain for one we would get a clearer picture of whats happening in our planets forests theyre a hugely important part of our lives  not only for the resource they provide but for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide co 2  so properly understanding their scale and what is happening to them  whether increasing or decreasing  and designing strategies to manage this change is hugely important the trouble is they exist on such a vast scale that we traditionally havent been able to accurately monitor them en masse thanks to space technologies thats changing the view from up there as far back as world war ii aerial imaging was being used to monitor the environment in addition to using regular film cameras mounted to aeroplanes to follow troops on the ground infrared film was used to identify green vegetation and distinguish it from camouflage nets as satellite and remote sensing technology developed through the 20 th century so too did our understanding of our planet satellites were used to map the weather monitor the sea and to create topological maps of the earth but they werent used to track the earths forests in any real detail but in 2021 the european space agency esa will launch biomass  a satellite that will map the worlds forests in unprecedented detail using the first ever pband radar to be placed in earth orbit this synthetic aperture radar penetrates the forest canopy to capture data on the density of tree trunks and branches it wont just be able to track how much land a forest covers but how much wood exists in it in short the biomass will be able to weigh the worlds forests over the course of its fiveyear mission it will produce 3d maps every six months giving scientists data on forest density across eight growth cycles the satellite is part of esas earth explorers programme which operates a number of satellites using innovative sensor technology to answer environmental questions and its not the only entity carrying out research of this sort californiabased firm planet has 149 microsatellites measuring just 10cm x 30cm in orbit around the earth each of which beams back around three terabytes of data every day to put it another way each satellite photographs about 25 million square kilometres of the earths surface on a daily basis the aim of capturing this information is to provide organisations with data to help them answer the question what is changing on earth when it comes to forests this includes identifying things like illegal logging and forest fires but the overall aim is to create a searchable expansive view of the world that enables people to generate useful insights keeping the world green all this data is not only vital for developing our understanding of how the world is changing it is vital for the development of responsible sustainable forestry practices from 2005 to 2015 the un rolled out the redd programme reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which among other functions allows countries to earn the right to offset co 2 emissions  for example through forestry management practices sophisticated satellite measurement techniques not only let governments know the rate of deforestation or afforestation in their respective countries it can also help them monitor highlight and encourage responsible forestry satellite technology is increasingly growing the level of visibility we have of our planet but more than just a clearer view on what is happening it allows us the opportunity to see why and how it is happening and its with this information that real differences in our future can be made share related stories sustainable bioenergy ensuring british columbias forests offer a sustainable source of fibre takes collaboration and careful management
