know that a business energy service that is as smooth and efficient as possible is a top priority nicola kilgourcroft finance manager at salisbury museum commented the switching process went through really smoothly and the facility to receive invoices via email means i dont need to spend time on the phone trying to sort out payment having 12month contracts really works for us we were looking for a business energy supplier that offered great value combined with the right length of contract and good ethics  and opus energy ticked all these boxes for us tags opus energy  haven power  customers  sustainability collaborating for biodiversity protection and enhancement sustainable bioenergy drax biomass conducts regional risk assessments with extensive reviews of existing public and private datasets to identify high conservation value forests this regional information is then augmented by countylevel natural heritage data in 2017 drax biomass contracted with nature serve to package this regional and countylevel data into a format that would facilitate a rapid risk assessment for all inwoods fibre this operational risk assessment procedure combined with formal conservation commitments such as the atchafalaya basin keeper agreement reflect a comprehensive strategy to protect biodiversity drax biomass is looking forward to actively contributing to regional conservation enhancement efforts in 2018 and beyond a partnership formed with the american forest foundation aff in 2017 is paving the way the aff is a publicly supported notforprofit organization established to conduct charitable educational research and scientific programmes aimed at the responsible use and conservation of renewable resources our partnership with the aff is aimed at improving habitat for atrisk southern wildlife species through active forest management  with opencanopy pine habitat identified as a conservation need the market that drax biomass provides for smalldiameter forest thinning material can directly benefit the regional biodiversity in addition to efforts around our own facilities drax biomass employees have been contributing to a collaborative effort run by the sustainable biomass program sbp to provide better information on how to assess whether or not there are forests with high conservation values in a catchment and what to do about them sbp expects to publish the guidance from this workgroup in early 2018 tags forests  sustainable biomass program sbp  sustainability  biomass energy drax biomass creates value in the united states sustainable bioenergy in many us states including those in which drax biomass operates there is a system of local taxation called severance tax this is a tax raised on each tonne of timber felled in a state and is usually paid by the landowner drax biomass has elected to pay this tax directly on behalf of the supplier on all roundwood received at each pellet plant in mississippi alone over a 12month period severance tax in excess of 80000 was paid the monies raised are used for local schools roads and other public services tags sustainability american tree farm sustainable bioenergy the majority of forestlands in the southern us are privately owned 86 and twothirds of these forests are owned by families and individuals the american tree farm system atfs administered by the american forest foundation was established over 75 years ago to provide support and recognition to these noncorporate landowners who play a key role in forest sustainability today the 74000 tree farmers across the us manage approximately 205 million acres of forestland the programme has evolved into an internationally recognised third partyverified certification standard endorsed by the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc standards the atfs now provides a means by which family tree farmers can be recognised and rewarded in the marketplace for meeting rigorous sustainability standards analogous to large corporate owners certified to sustainable forestry initiative sfi or forest stewardship council fsc standard tags sustainability  biomass energy people strategy sustainable business our people strategy one drax following extensive consultation with employees we developed our people strategy to 2020  one drax it has been designed to address the key issues that were raised by employees in our 2016 employee survey such as the need for clearer learning and development programmes and more effective internal communications the strategy focuses on valuing our people  driving business performance and developing talent to deliver our strategic and operational objectives we launched the five aspects of the strategy my career my performance our behaviours our reward my recognition in 2018 we will focus on all of these aspects and in particular our reward my recognition and my career behavioural framework we have developed a number of hr programmes in line with our people strategy the foundation of this is a new behavioural framework that identifies positive behaviours reflecting our company values honest energised achieving together the behaviours are integrated into all areas of our people management processes at drax group the hr team consulted with one in five employees across the business including senior leaders and union representatives to develop the framework in 2018 we will further embed the behavioural framework and our company values into our culture by developing an online tool for employees to evaluate how they demonstrate the behaviours developing our people  apprenticeships at drax power we have a proud history of apprenticeships  with the majority remaining to work at drax and progressing through the company mick moore joined drax on 7 september 1976 as a craft apprentice on completion of his apprenticeship mick continued to further his education and completed an hnc in electrical  electronic engineering after a 10year break he resumed his further education graduating from humberside  lincolnshire university with a degree in electronics  control engineering achieving chartered engineering status with the institute of electrical engineers in 1999 having worked at drax for 41 years micks career has included roles such as instrument mechanic various engineering grades from assistant engineer to process control engineer  maintenance section head mick is now the electrical control  instrumentation engineering section head for drax power and is currently responsible for a team of 51 people tags engineering  sustainability  apprenticeships  careers listening to local communities sustainable business over the course of the year we held many meetings and outreach events with the communities living in proximity to our gasfired power station projects  including millbrook power  bedfordshire 160 people attended public exhibitions hosted by drax in the villages neighbouring the project marston moretaine stewartby ampthill and lidlington we also held a series of briefings with local elected representatives and interest groups the feedback we received helped to inform the application we subsequently submitted to the planning inspectorate progress power  suffolk we held two roundtables with local landowners and politicians in eye community centre in july and october to introduce drax group and better understand the communitys perception of the project further roundtables will take place in 2018 to involve local people in the design of the power station and substation repower project  drax power station 120 people attended informal consultation events in selby town hall drax sports and social club and junction in goole the sessions provided an opportunity for the drax project team to discuss our plans with the community and identify the key issues of interest to them ahead of the formal statutory stage of public consultation taking place in q1 2018 rapidresponse gas plants in wales we worked with rhondda cynon taf country borough council to discharge our planning obligations in relation to the hirwaun power project we also started meeting with local stakeholders ahead of our statutory consultation on the abergelli power project in 2018 tags sustainability  gas  communities the sustainable biomass program sustainable bioenergy in 2013 drax cofounded the sbp together with six other energy companies sbp builds upon existing forest certification programmes such as the sustainable forest initiative sfi forest stewardship council fsc and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc these evidence sustainable forest management practices but do not yet encompass regulatory requirements for reporting greenhouse gas ghg emissions  this is a critical gap for biomass generators who are obligated to report ghg emissions to european regulators there is also limited uptake of forestlevel certification schemes in some key forest source areas sbp is working to address these challenges sbp certification provides assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements for the users of biomass for energy production are met the tool is a unique certification scheme designed for woody biomass mostly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips used in industrial largescale energy production sbp certification is achieved via a rigorous assessment of wood pellet and wood chip producers and biomass traders carried out by independent third party certification bodies and scrutinised by an independent technical committee tags forests  wood pellets  sustainable biomass program sbp  sustainability  biomass energy working with our suppliers sustainable bioenergy pinewells lda is part of grupo visabeira with global interests in the telecommunications construction manufacturing technology real estate and energy sectors constructed in 2009 the biomass plant in portugal is one of the strategic investments of the group in the renewable energy sector the plant has an annual biomass production of 150000 tonnes supplying both the international industrial and the internal domestic biomass markets drax worked closely with pinewells in 2017 to ensure the feedstock used for production is both harvested lawfully and sustainable by meeting the requirements of the drax supplier data return and thirdparty audit working with the forest and quality engineers at pinewells we have supported the company to develop and implement their monitoring and inspection system within their own supply base key features of this system include deskbased research to determine the characterisation of harvesting areas and field audits to approve the felling areas highlight the good forest practice guide and deliver focused training this work has provided a valuable foundation for pinewells to implement the sustainable biomass program sbp within their supply chain working with drax this year has provided us guidance and understanding towards the requirements of sbp certification the encouragement and advice from the drax sustainability team proved both valuable and practical  alexandra pedro pinewells overseas sales director tags wood pellets  sustainable biomass program sbp  sustainability the bettercoal initiative sustainable business bettercoal is a global notforprofit initiative that has been established by a group of major european utilities to promote the continuous improvement of corporate responsibility in the coal supply chain  with a specific focus on the mines themselves through membership of the bettercoal initiative drax aims to ensure that the coal industry respects peoples rights and makes a positive contribution to the social and economic livelihoods of workers producers and communities the bettercoal code sets out 10 social environmental and ethical principles it is not a certification body but outlines a process for assessing coal suppliers performance against the ten principles suppliers complete selfassessment questionnaires and approved assessors conduct bettercoal assessments continuous improvement plans are developed jointly with the supplier and summary results are shared with bettercoal members all bettercoalengaged mines sign a letter of commitment at the outset which outlines their responsibilities if a mine then falls short of these expectations such as by not following up on the continuous improvement plan put in place by their auditors then they would lose their status as a bettercoalengaged mine drax ended its membership of bettercoal in june 2020 tags coal  sustainability  1  4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  name email comment sign up for updates from drax sign up to receive
