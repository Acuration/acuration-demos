Press Release
Project Update
8 January 2016
Press releases

The decision has been made because Watt Power (the parent company of Millbrook Power) was unable to secure contracts for its two consented 299MW gas-fired generation projects (in Suffolk and in south Wales) through the Government’s recent Capacity Market Auction for future power generation (held in December 2015). If contracts are secured for these two consented projects in the Government’s next Capacity Market Auction (to be held in December 2016), Millbrook Power would look to submit a Development Consent Order application in 2017.
Both Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council, as the local planning authorities, have been notified.

Drax announces plan to end further investment in White Rose Carbon Capture & Storage project
25 September 2015
Uncategorized

Selby, Yorkshire: Drax today announced it remained committed to fulfilling its current work on a Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) feasibility and technology development project (FEED), but once completed, would not be investing further and will withdraw as a partner of Capture Power Ltd, the developer of the White Rose CCS project.
The two year project is being taken forward by the Capture Power partnership – made up of Drax, Alstom and BOC and is looking at the potential to capture up to 90% of carbon emissions from a new coal fired power station and safely store them beneath the North Sea. The project is due to conclude during the next 6-12 months.
Drax has also confirmed that while at that point it would cease to commit further investment, it will continue to make the site owned by Drax, along with the infrastructure at the Power Plant, available for the project to be built.
Drax Group Operations Director, and Capture Power Board Director, Pete Emery said:
“We remain fully committed to completing what we’ve signed up to – the completion of a study into the feasibility and development of world leading technology that could result in dramatic reductions in carbon emissions produced by power stations and heavy industry.
“We are confident the technology we have developed has real potential, but have reluctantly taken a decision not to invest any further in the development of this project. The decision is based purely on a drastically different financial and regulatory environment and we must put the interests of the business and our shareholders first.
“We will focus our resources on the areas which we can deliver best value, particularly working with Government to explore the potential for converting a fourth generating unit to run on sustainable biomass.
“Drax still believes this project has great potential and we have announced that the site at the Drax Power Plant, along with our existing infrastructure remain available for the project to be built.”

Creative crafts at Drax Summer Art Schools
20 August 2015
Uncategorized

Some 60 aspiring young artists in the Goole and Selby area attended Summer Art and Crafts schools at Drax Power Station this week to brush up on their artistic abilities and creative talent.
The free events, held over three days were run by David Anderson, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.  David, who is a skilled artist, designer and illustrator created the activities for the three days as well as giving advice and demonstrations in drawing and painting techniques.
The children aged 7 to 10 learnt how to transfer their designs on to a variety of items including porcelain mugs and linen bags, as well as moulding scenes from air-dry clay and personalising their own apron. A Master Class for 11 to 14 year-olds helped them learn simple yet effective drawing and painting techniques, resulting in their very own watercolour masterpiece.
David Anderson said: “It’s fantastic to see the enthusiasm, imagination and creativity displayed over the three days. Both age groups were keen to try out different ideas and worked hard to improve their skills, techniques and knowledge.”
The Summer Art schools are now in their eighth year and are organised by Drax to build on its Art in the Community scheme to encourage and develop art appreciation as part of the company’s support for education and to promote art learning within the National Curriculum.

Nearly a third would pay more to go green but value for money is key
24 July 2015
Uncategorized

New research commissioned by Drax has revealed 31% of people are willing to pay nearly £10 more on average to support green energy. They are clear this would be on top of the amount already paid through their energy bills to encourage the shift to low-carbon energy sources.
The ComRes survey shows there is very little understanding of the proportion of an energy bill that goes towards green energy, with the majority saying they don’t know and 17% saying it’s more than £100.
When the actual average amount on a bill was revealed to the respondents – £62 – a surprising number said they were prepared to pay more. While the average was nearly an extra £10, one in five said they’d be willing to contribute more than an extra £20.
But this willingness is conditional. In return bill payers want to see renewables investment go into reliable technologies that are affordable and offer value for money. The survey showed that 35% of Britons ranked value for money or affordability for customers highest out of a range of options the government should prioritise, including impact on the landscape, impact on the local economy and ability to safeguard jobs. Reliability of supply had the third highest level of support, with 15% ranking it in first place.
This research is published as the new Conservative government reaffirms its commitment to going green and tackling climate change, but is clearly emphasising this must be done in the most affordable way possible.
Drax Group CEO, Dorothy Thompson said:
“It’s clear a significant number of people are prepared to pay more to boost green energy in the fight to tackle climate change.
“However it’s also clear they are not prepared to write a ‘blank cheque’ and want guarantees that anything extra must be spent on green energy generation that is affordable and reliable.
“At Drax we’re leading Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and already meeting these ‘consumer asks’ as we take coal off the system and replace it with sustainable biomass that continues to provide a 24/7 source of electricity that doesn’t break the bank.”

23 July 2015 – Hirwaun Power secures planning permission – new gas fired power station approved by government
23 July 2015
Press releases

Hirwaun Power Ltd has secured consent from the Department of Energy & Climate Change for its £200m gas-fired power station project, near Aberdare in south Wales.  Subject to raising the necessary finance, it will enter commercial operation in 2019.  It will operate as a “peaking plant”, providing back-up to intermittent renewable generation and create 150 construction jobs, and up to 15 permanent and skilled jobs.
To be located on part of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate which lies adjacent to the A465 “Heads of the Valleys” dual carriageway between Swansea and Abergavenny, the Hirwaun Power project will produce up to 299 megawatts (MW) of electricity, the equivalent of supplying 400,000 homes.
It represents a significant investment into the local economy and will give rise to multi-million pound construction and supply chain contracts, support 150 jobs over the two year construction and commissioning period, and up to 15 full-time jobs when operational.
Amber Rudd, Secretary of State for the Department of Energy & Climate Change granted planning permission to the Hirwaun project after a 2½ year public consultation and examination process.
Norman Campbell, Project Director at Hirwaun Power said: “Securing the Goverrnment’s approval for the project is very good news for the Hirwaun team and the local economy. We would expect our £200m scheme to provide a catalyst for further investment in the area. Importantly, the project also helps to meet the Government’s policy objectives of security of energy supple and affordability and supports the country’s transition to a low carbon economy.
“The input that we received from the Rhondda Cynon Taff Council and the local community during the project’s public consultation process was very helpful, and we will liaise closely with the Council and other local interests during the project’s construction and eventual operation.
“However, despite the widespread acceptance that new generation plant is required and the considerable investment we have made so far, we must still secure the money to get the project built.  We expect to know whether or not we are successful in doing that by the middle of next year (2016).”



New milestone reached in biomass supply chain
9 July 2015
Uncategorized

A three year partnership between Lloyds Register Rail, UK manufacturer WH Davis and Drax has reached a significant milestone as Drax takes delivery of its 200th specially designed biomass rail freight wagon.
The partnership, which has pushed the boundaries of rail engineering and lead to the design and manufacturing of the largest ever rail freight wagons in the UK, has played a major role in ongoing developments in Drax’s supply chain as part of its conversion to burning sustainable biomass in place of coal – a process which has seen Drax transform from the UK’s largest emitter of CO2 to Europe’s largest decarbonisation project.
Since entering operations in 2013, the wagons, designed by Lloyd’s Register Rail and manufactured by WH Davis, have collectively travelled over 12 million miles between the Ports of Tyne, Hull and Immingham and Drax. Over the course of these journeys they have transported around 4.5 million tonnes of sustainable biomass – enough to power 2.5 million homes with low carbon, affordable and reliable renewable electricity. The wagons are 30 per cent larger than any other rail freight wagon currently used in the UK, and are able to carry a biomass load weighing 71.6 tonnes.
Peter Emery, Group Operations Director of Drax Group plc said: “This milestone demonstrates the sheer scale of our decarbonisation project as we replace coal with sustainable biomass providing a reliable and affordable source of electricity.
“Lloyds Register Rail and WH Davis have been important partners in the development of our biomass operations. The delivery of our 200th wagon marks a major stage in a process which has been a huge success both in terms of modifications to Drax’s supply chain and for UK engineering as a whole.”
Mark Jackson, Managing Director of W H Davis said: “We’re proud of what we’ve achieved for Drax, providing UK manufactured wagons which set the standard for wagon manufacture and enable Drax to receive volumes of biomass which would be impracticable by road.
“Our subsidiary, Davis Wagon Services, is supporting Drax with maintenance of the wagons and is working with Drax to establish a dedicated maintenance facility, ensuring maximum fleet availability.”

Five stars for safety
25 June 2015
Uncategorized

Drax Power has been awarded the maximum five stars in the British Safety Council’s Five Star Occupational Health and Safety Audit, and achieved a near perfect score. The audit, which was carried out by the British Safety Council, is a rigorous evaluation of the power station’s occupational health and safety management system, set against a worldwide benchmark.
Jon Clough, Head of Safety and Environment, Drax Power, explained what was involved:
“During the five day audit, auditors reviewed our safety management systems, interviewed colleagues and took a site tour and inspection to get a comprehensive picture of our health and safety culture.
“We were measured and scored against compliance with our policies and procedures and implementation in the work place. To achieve a five star award, it is necessary to score 92% or more. We scored 97.4%, highlighting how high our standards are, even against a global benchmark.
“This was our first audit, making the achievement all the more impressive.”
Andy Koss, Chief Executive for Drax Power said: “Safety is our number one priority – nothing is more important. Being awarded five stars is recognition that our standards and safety practices are among the very best. We can be proud of this achievement, but safety requires continuous vigilance and the commitment of everyone across the site.”
As five star winners, Drax Power will be eligible to apply for the coveted ‘Sword of Honour’ award which recognises the very best in health and safety management.

Drax is a winner in the RoSPA Awards 2015
23 June 2015
Uncategorized

Drax Power Limited (part of the Drax Group) is among the winners in the RoSPA Occupational Health and Safety Awards 2015. The Winner of the Electricity Industry Sector award in the prestigious annual scheme run by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) was presented during a ceremony at ExCeL London on June 16.
As the UK’s family safety charity, RoSPA’s mission to save lives and reduce injuries covers all ages and stages of life. In support of this mission, the RoSPA Awards, which date back 59 years, recognise commitment to continuous improvement in accident and ill health prevention at work. Through the scheme, which is open to businesses and organisations of all types and sizes from across the UK and overseas, judges consider entrants’ overarching occupational health and safety management systems, including practices such as leadership and workforce involvement.
David Rawlins, RoSPA’s Awards Manager, said: “The RoSPA Awards encourage improvement in occupational health and safety management. Organisations that gain recognition for their health and safety management systems such as Drax, contribute to raising standards overall and we congratulate them.”
Andy Koss, Chief Executive for Drax Power said:
“Receiving this award is recognition that our standards and safety practices are among the very best. Safety is our number one priority – nothing is more important. We can be proud of this achievement, but safety requires continuous vigilance and the commitment of everyone across the site.”
The majority of RoSPA’s awards are non-competitive, grading achievement at merit, bronze, silver and gold levels. Organisations that maintain high standards in consecutive years can win gold medals, president’s awards and orders of distinction.
Competitive awards are presented in more than 20 industry sectors, and they also recognise excellence in specialist areas, such as the management of occupational road risk (MORR).
The sponsors of the RoSPA Awards 2015 are: headline sponsor – NEBOSH; The RoSPA International Sector Award – airsweb; The MORR Trophy – Allianz; The International Dilmun Environmental Award – GPIC; The Best New Entry Trophy – Safety and Health Expo; The Workforce Involvement in Safety and Health Trophy – Springfields Fuels; and, The MORR Technology Trophy – Tesco Dotcom.
This year, RoSPA Occupational Health and Safety Awards ceremonies are being held in three locations: at ExCeL London on June 16 alongside the Safety and Health Expo 2015; in Birmingham on July 14 and 15  and in Glasgow on September 17, the day after the RoSPA Scotland Occupational Health and Safety Congress.
