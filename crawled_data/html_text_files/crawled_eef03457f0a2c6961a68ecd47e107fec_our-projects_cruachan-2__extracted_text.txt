cruachan power station visit drax power station home  about us  our projects  cruachan 2 cruachan 2 cruachan 2 planning application we have kickstarted the planning process to build a new underground pumped hydro storage power station  more than doubling the electricity generating capacity at cruachan the 600 megawatt mw power station will be located inside ben cruachan  argylls highest mountain  and increase the sites total capacity to 1 gigawatt gw the new power station would be built within a new hollowedout cavern which would be large enough to fit big ben on its side to the east of draxs existing 440mw pumped storage hydro station  more than a million tonnes of rock would be excavated to create the cavern and other parts of the power station the existing upper reservoir which can hold 24 billion gallons of water has the capacity to serve both power stations drax submits application to expand iconic hollow mountain power station read more drax has submitted an application to scottish ministers under section 36 of the electricity act 1989 seeking permission for the construction and operation of an electricity generating station the proposals are an expansion of the existing cruachan pumped storage hydroelectric psh generation station and will be capable of operating independently view full details of the application why cruachan 2 great britains energy storage capacity will need to grow to around 30 gigawatts gw or more over the next 20 to 30 years from 3 gw in 2020 found analysis for drax electric insights by researchers at imperial college london and apricum the association for renewable energy and clean technology rea advised that a new market mechanism is needed before projects such as cruachan 2 can be deployed the reas 2021 report said that some 30 gw of longerduration energy storage capacity is necessary for the uk economy to be net zero by 2050 cruachan 2 is on the european unions 4 th list of projects of common interest  a 2016 feasibility study indicated it would be possible to develop up to 600 megawatts mw of additional capacity at cruachan power station our pumped storage hydro plant in scotland the study was published two years after the scottish governments third national planning framework  setting out a longterm vision for development and investment across scotland over the next 20 to 30 years commented  we particularly support development at cruachan in argyll a nationally important pumped storage facility with significant potential for enhanced capacity drax group ceo will gardiner this is an exciting and important project which underlines draxs commitment to tackling the climate crisis and supporting the energy system as it continues to decarbonise our plans to expand cruachan will unlock more renewable electricity to power homes and businesses across the country and support hundreds of new jobs in rural scotland last year the uks lack of energy storage capacity meant wind farms had to be paid to turn off and we lost out on enough renewable power to supply a million homes we need to stop renewable power from going to waste by storing it and drax is ready to move mountains to do just that  will gardiner ceo drax june 2021 what is pumped storage hydro read more cruachan power station  click to viewdownload  electricity storage including pumped hydro storage has a key role to play in helping the uk end its contribution to climate change by 2050 we are making significant progress in ensuring this technology can enter the market and compete fairly alongside other more established forms of energy as set out in our energy white paper we will outline our next steps for removing barriers to the deployment of large scale and longer duration electricity storage shortly  uk
