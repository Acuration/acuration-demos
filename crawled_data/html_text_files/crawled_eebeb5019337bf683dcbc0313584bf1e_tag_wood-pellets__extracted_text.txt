completed on schedule incremental power sales on biomass roc 2 units since july 2021 capturing higher prices commissioning of 550kt of new biomass pellet production capacity in us southeast 2021 adjusted ebitda 3  around the top end of current range of analyst expectations subject to continued baseload generation on biomass units throughout december positive policy developments for biomass and framework for uk beccs 4 pellet production in north america the group has made good progress integrating pinnacle renewable energy inc pinnacle since acquisition in april 2021 and is currently in the final stages of commissioning over 360kt of new production capacity at demopolis alabama in october 2021 the group commissioned a 150kt expansion at its lasalle plant in louisiana and at leola arkansas a new 40kt satellite plant is due to be commissioned in december these developments alongside incremental new capacity in 2022 support the groups continued focus on production capacity expansion and cost reduction once fully commissioned drax will operate around 5mt of production capacity across three major north american fibre baskets  british columbia alberta and the us southeast of which around 2mt are contracted to highquality thirdparty counterparties under longterm contracts with the balance available for draxs ownuse requirements there has been no disruption to ownuse or thirdparty volumes from the global supply chain delays currently being experienced in some other sectors however as outlined at the groups 2021 half year results summer wildfires led to pellet export restrictions in canada more recently heavy rainfall and flooding in british columbia have led to some further disruption to rail movements and regional supply chains through its enlarged and diversified supply chain drax has been able to manage and limit the impact on biomass supply for ownuse and to customers in addition due to the groups active and longterm hedging of freight costs there has been no material impact associated with higher market prices for ocean freight the group uses longterm contracts to hedge its freight exposure on biomass for its generation business and following the acquisition of pinnacle is taking steps to optimise freight requirements between production centres in the us southeast and western canada and end markets in asia and europe generation in the uk the groups biomass and pumped storage generation assets have continued to play an important role providing stability to the uk power system at a time when higher gas prices european interconnector issues and periods of low wind have placed the system under increased pressure the groups strong forward sold position means that it has not been a significant beneficiary of higher power prices from these activities in 2021 but has been able to increase forward hedged prices in 2022 and 2023 in march the groups two legacy coal units ended commercial generation activities and will formally close in september 2022 following the fulfilment of their capacity market obligations reflecting the system challenges described above these units were called upon in the balancing mechanism by the system operator for limited operations in september and november these shortterm measures helped to stabilise the power system during periods of system stress and have not resulted in any material increase in the groups total carbon emissions in september the generation business experienced a twoweek unplanned outage on one biomass unit operating under the roc scheme the units contracted position in this period was bought back and the generation reprofiled across the two unaffected biomass roc units and deferred until the fourth quarter during this period the groups pumped storage power station cruachan provided risk mitigation from the operational or financial impact of any additional forced outages in november the generation business successfully completed a major 98 day planned outage on its biomass cfd unit which included the third in a series of highpressure turbine upgrades drax now expects the unit to benefit from thermal efficiency improvements and lower maintenance costs incrementally reducing the cost of biomass generation at drax power station customers the group continues to expect the customers business will return to profitability at the adjusted ebitda level for 2021 inclusive of an expected increase in mutualisation costs associated with the failure of a number of energy supply businesses in the second half of 2021 separately the group is continuing to assess operational and strategic solutions to support the development of the sme 5 supply business full year expectations reflecting these factors the group now expects that full year adjusted ebitda for 2021 will be around the top of the range of current analyst expectations 6  subject to good operational performance during december including baseload running of all four biomass units the groups financial expectations do not include any balancing mechanism activity in december for the coal units drax continues to expect net debt to adjusted ebitda to return to around 2x by the end of 2022 negative emissions in october the uk government selected the east coast cluster and hynet as the first two regional clusters in the uk to take forward the development of the infrastructure required for carbon capture and storage in addition the uk government published its net zero strategy and biomass policy statement reaffirming the established international scientific consensus that sustainable biomass is renewable and indicating that it will play a critical role in helping the uk achieve its climate targets it also signposted an ambition for at least 5mt pa of negative emissions from beccs and direct air capture by 2030 23mt pa by 2035 and up to 81mt pa by 2050 the reports commit the government to the development during 2022 of a financial model to support the development of beccs to meet these requirements the group is continuing to progress its work on beccs with the aim to develop 8mt of negative co 2 emissions pa at drax power station by 2030 and

sustainable biomass generation and supply business will gardiner chief executive officer drax group 13 april 2021 opinion today we completed a transformational deal  our acquisition of canadian biomass pellet producer pinnacle renewable energy im very excited about this important acquisition and welcoming our new colleagues to the drax family  together we will build on what we have already achieved having become the biggest decarbonisation project in europe and the uks largest single site renewable power generator as a result of us using sustainable biomass instead of coal the deal positions drax as the worlds leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business  making us a truly international business trading biomass from north america to europe and asia it also advances our strategy to increase our self supply reduces our biomass production costs and creates a longterm future for sustainable biomass  a renewable energy source that the uns ipcc says will be needed to achieve global climate targets its also an important milestone in draxs ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 and play an important role in tackling the global climate crisis with our pioneering negative emissions technology beccs  thats because increasing our annual production capacity of sustainable biomass while also reducing costs helps pave the way for our plans to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs at drax negative emissions from beccs are vital to address the global climate emergency while also providing the renewable electricity needed for a net zero economy supporting jobs and clean growth in a postcovid recovery inside a pinnacle pellet mill we already know pinnacle well  it is one of our key suppliers and the company is a natural fit with drax our new colleagues have a wealth of operational and commercial expertise so im looking forward to seeing what we can achieve together we will benefit from pinnacles scale operational efficiency and lowcost fibre sourcing that includes a high proportion of sawmill residues in 2019 pinnacles production cost was 20 lower than draxs completing this deal will increase our annual production capacity to 49 million tonnes of sustainable biomass pellets at 17 plants in locations across western canada and the us south  up from 16mt now it also expands our access to three major north american fibre baskets and four export facilities giving us a large and geographically diversified asset base which enhances our sourcing flexibility and security of supply this positions us well to take advantage of the global growth opportunities for sustainable biomass the market for biomass wood pellets for renewable generation in europe and asia is expected to grow in the current decade principally driven by demand in asia biomass wood pellet storage dome drax power station we believe that with increasingly ambitious global decarbonisation targets the need for negative emissions and improved understanding of the role that sustainably sourced biomass can play will result in continued robust demand pinnacle is already a key supplier of wood pellets to other markets with c67 billion of longterm contracts with high quality asian and european customers including drax and a significant volume contracted beyond 2027 drax aims to leverage pinnacles trading capability across its expanded portfolio we believe that the enlarged supply chain will provide greater opportunities to optimise the supply of biomass from its own assets and thirdparty suppliers the transport and shipping requirements of the enlarged company will provide further opportunities to optimise delivery logistics helping to reduce distance time carbon footprint and cost train transporting biomass wood pellets arriving at drax power station importantly  there will also be opportunities to share best practice and drive sustainability standards higher across the group we recognise that the forest landscape in british columbia and alberta is different to the commercially managed forests in the south eastern us where we currently operate in line with our world leading responsible sourcing policy drax will work closely with environmental groups indigenous first nation communities and other stakeholders and invest to deliver good environmental social and climate outcomes in pinnacles sourcing areas we are determined to create a longterm future for sustainable biomass and deliver beccs  the negative emissions technology that will be needed around the world to meet global climate targets the

largest decarbonisation project cruachan our scottish pumped storage facility is a key complement to britains ever increasing supply of offshore wind our transition from coal to biomass has allowed us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 while providing clean and flexible energy to millions of homes and businesses across the uk this month saw the end of commercial coal generation at drax power station  a milestone in the history of our company and of the uk economy too but the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here which is why we have committed to a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  we will achieve this by making a transformational investment in bioenergy with ccs or beccs which will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon water outlet into loch awe from cruachan power station today we are pioneering beccs at drax power station as part of the zero carbon humber cluster a coalition of diverse businesses with one ambition to create the worlds first net zero emissions industrial cluster  the benefits are enormous beccs is a vital technology in the fight against climate change expert bodies such as the climate change committee here in the uk and the ipcc at a global level are clear that we need negative emissions technologies including beccs to reach net zero and beccs is central to the uk and europes decarbonisation plans as the worlds largest and most experienced generator and supplier of sustainable bioenergy there is no better place to pioneer beccs than at drax the economic social and environmental benefits are enormous beccs at drax will permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere and help heavy industry in the uks largest emitting area decarbonise quickly and cost effectively it will enable the creation of tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england levelling up the economy and delivering a green recovery from the covid crisis and it will put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to develop carbon removal technology in this the year that we host cop26 in glasgow the scale of the climate crisis means that we cannot stop here a proven technology we know that beccs works and that the technology is available now looking at cost projections from the ccc we also know that it is the best value negative emissions technology engineer at beccs pilot project within drax power station we have already successfully run two beccs pilots at the power station in 2019 we demonstrated that we can capture co 2 from a 100 biomass feedstock and in 2020 we began a second pilot working with mitsubishi heavy industries to further enhance the potential for delivering negative emissions we aim to deploy beccs at scale by 2027 to that end earlier this month we kickstarted the planning process for our proposals to build our first beccs units  marking a major milestone in the project and putting us in a position to commence building beccs as soon as 2024 the support we need drax power station has a proud history of transformation and today we are making rapid progress in further decarbonising our operations and making bold commitments about our future the core of our successful decarbonisation has been a close partnership with government  and it is this partnership that will make beccs a reality and enable the multiple benefits that come with it an effective negative emissions policy and regulatory framework from government will enable further investments from companies such as drax we believe it is possible for such a policy framework to emerge in the coming months with cop26 later this year making that policy commitment will allow us to accelerate our own decarbonisation journey and support the industries of the future here in the uk beccs in context but we know that there is no silver bullet solution to tackling climate change negative emissions technologies such as beccs will be needed alongside others for example more renewables electric vehicles  energy storage energy efficiency and hydrogen beccs will enable us to permanently remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere while continuing to supply the renewable electricity that millions of british homes and businesses depend upon beccs complements  and does not  and should not  substitute for ambitious decarbonisation plans technologies such as beccs have a clear and unique role to play by helping harder to abate sectors such as heavy industry aviation and agriculture  decarbonise this is critically important if we are to meet our legally binding 2050 net zero target the ccc estimates that 51m tonnes of co 2 will need to be captured via beccs to meet net zero sustainability at our core we know that beccs can only make a meaningful contribution to tackling climate change if the bioenergy is sustainably sourced this has been fundamental to draxs transition from coal to biomass and it remains fundamental as we progress our plans for beccs biomass as the uk government has stated is one of our most valuable tools for reaching net zero emissions so we need the right framework to ensure it is sourced sustainably as the worlds largest bioenergy producer and generator we recognise our responsibility to be the world leaders in sustainability too at drax we have invested in world leading policies tools and expertise to ensure that our biomass is sustainably sourced we go beyond regulatory compliance and have set up an independent advisory board  chaired by the uk governments former chief scientific advisor to help us and challenge us on sustainable biomass and its role in draxs transition to net zero click to read thanks to our independent catchment area analyses  we know more about the forests we source from than ever before we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests for example in the south east us where drax sources most of its biomass there is more than double the carbon stored in forests than there was 50 years ago a partnership with our stakeholders the purpose of todays session is to discuss all these issues and more our aim is clear to enable a successful energy transition at drax we stand ready to invest hundreds of millions of pounds to scale up beccs technology to put the uk at the forefront of global efforts to reach net zero emissions and to help create tens of thousands of green jobs in the north of england but i want your help in making beccs as sustainable and successful as it can be we know and can demonstrate how demand for biomass can support healthy forests thank you very much for listening and i wish you a good and constructive session tackling this critical global challenge will gardiner delivered this keynote address at energy transitions 2021  the
