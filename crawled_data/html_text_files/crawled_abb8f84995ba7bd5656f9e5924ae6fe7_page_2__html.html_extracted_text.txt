Investment programme in biomass capacity expansion and cost reduction
19 November 2019
Investors

Highlights
Targeting biomass self-supply capacity of five million tonnes by 2027
1.5 million tonnes of existing capacity, plus 0.35 million tonnes of low-cost capacity announced at the 2019 half year results
Evaluating options for a further three million tonnes over the next seven years
Supports target to reduce biomass cost by c.30 percent to c.£50/MWh
Targeting returns significantly in excess of the Group’s cost of capital
Trading update – in-line with expectations
Acquired assets performing strongly
Capacity Market restored and included in 2019 Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
Will Gardiner, Drax Group CEO, said:
“Drax’s purpose is to enable a zero-carbon lower cost energy future. We believe sustainable biomass has a long-term critical role to play. That’s why we plan to supply 80 percent of our biomass from our own sources – a significant increase on the 20 percent we currently self-supply. Supplying more of our own biomass will cut costs and reduce supply chain risks, ensuring our biomass power generation remains viable in the long term. When combined with carbon capture it will also enable negative emissions, helping the UK on its path to net zero by 2050.”
Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group. Click to view/download in high res.
Capital Markets Day
Drax is today hosting a Capital Markets Day for investors and analysts.
Will Gardiner and his management team will update on how the Group is delivering on its purpose. The day will outline the significant opportunities Drax sees in growing its biomass supply and renewable generation businesses.
Investment in biomass to increase capacity and reduce cost
As a part of the Group’s key strategic objective of building a long-term future for sustainable biomass, Drax remains focused on opportunities to reduce its cost of biomass to a level which is economic without subsidy in 2027.
These savings will be delivered through further optimisation of existing biomass operations and greater utilisation of low-cost wood residues; an expansion of the fuel envelope to incorporate other renewable fuels and; a significant expansion of self-supply capacity.
Drax is targeting five million tonnes of self-supply capacity by 2027 (1.5 million today, plus 0.35 million tonnes in development), with greater scope for operational leverage and cost reduction. Drax will continue to work with its current suppliers to develop its portfolio.
At the 2019 half year results, Drax announced an investment in low-cost capacity at its existing three sites in the US Gulf, adding 350k tonnes of new capacity by 2021. The capital cost is in the region of £50 million, enabling targeted fuel cost savings in excess of £15/MWh on the additional capacity once commissioned.
Drax is evaluating options to deliver an additional three million tonnes of capacity. These options are expected to deliver returns significantly in excess of the Group’s cost of capital, with strong cash flow generation and a fast payback.
These activities would enable Drax to develop an unsubsidised biomass generation business by 2027, with the option to service wood pellet demand in other markets – Europe, North America and Asia.
Biomass sustainability is at the heart of the Group’s activities and Drax has implemented industry leading processes which support this expansion, encourage forest growth and make a positive contribution to climate change.
Drax LaSalle BioEnergy wood pellet plant in Louisiana is now co-located with a sawmill. A new rail spur became operational at LaSalle earlier in 2019. Click to view/download.
Options for gas generation
Drax continues to see flexible gas generation as an enabler of greater renewable and low carbon generation, in addition to supporting the development of hydrogen.
Any investment decision would reflect Drax’s objective of delivering earnings visibility and be underpinned by a 15-year capacity agreement to support a low double-digit rate of return. Drax would consider a range of funding options, including partnerships, consistent with Drax’s balance sheet objective of around 2 x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
over time.
Capital allocation and dividend
Drax remains committed to the capital allocation policy established in 2017.
Trading and operational performance
The performance of the assets acquired from Iberdrola in December 2018 has been strong, particularly the pumped storage business which has performed well, driven by the system support market. Drax reiterates the Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
guidance provided at the time of acquisition, of £90-£110 million in the 2019 financial year.
In July, Drax completed the refinancing of the acquisition bridge facility used to acquire these assets. These facilities now extend the Group’s debt maturity profile to 2029, adding an ESG
(2)
facility with a mechanism that adjusts the margin based on Drax’s carbon emissions against an annual benchmark. The Group’s cost of debt is now below four percent and below three percent on the new facilities, reflecting the Group’s reduced business risk. The Group continues to identify opportunities to optimise its balance sheet and cash flow.
During the summer, Drax completed major planned outages on two biomass units. Following a delayed return to service, the plan is to run all four ROC
(3)
units at high utilisation levels in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The outlook for coal generation remains challenging and Drax continues to monitor the situation with regards to future operation, noting that all unabated UK coal generation must close by 2025.
Following formal confirmation from the UK Government, Drax expects the Capacity Market to be re-instated shortly, with full retrospective payments made for the capacity provided. Capacity payments due to Drax for 2019 and since the suspension of the Capacity Market in 2018 are £75 million. Drax expects these to be included in 2019 Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
, with cash settlement in January 2020.
These factors underpin the Group’s expectations for full year Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
, which remain unchanged and around 2 x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
when adjusted to reflect cash payment of retrospective capacity payments received in January 2020.
Capital Markets Day webcast and presentation material
The event will be webcast from 9.30am and the material made available on the Group’s website at the same time. Joining instructions for the webcast and presentation are included in the links below.

Further statement in relation to the AGM vote on political donations
15 October 2019
Investors

In the lead up to the 2019 AGM, the Company undertook initial consultation with major shareholders and received a variety of feedback on both the Resolution and the Company’s approach to engagement with regulators and policymakers including political parties and governments.
Following the AGM, the Board of Directors initiated further engagement to facilitate a clear understanding of the reasons underpinning the votes cast against the Resolution. This included writing to the Company’s largest shareholders and offering to discuss how the Company proposed to respond to points raised during the initial consultation and policy on stakeholder engagement. The Company is grateful to those shareholders that provided feedback at that time.
The Company regularly engages with regulators and policymakers in the UK, Europe and USA (including those associated with political parties and governments) to understand and contribute to discussions on a wide range of matters which are associated with our business and delivering increased value to our shareholders. This approach is detailed on pages 32 and 33 of the
2018 Annual Report
as a fundamental aspect of our stakeholder engagement. Political and regulatory risk has been identified by the Board as one of the nine principal risks that the business faces. Activities of this nature are not designed to support any political party or to influence public support for a particular party and would not be thought of as political donations in the ordinary sense of those words.
Reflecting the feedback received from shareholders, it has been determined that within future Annual Reports additional disclosure will be provided. This will describe the forms of engagement that have taken place with regulators and policymakers in the financial year as well as additional disclosure regarding the oversight of that engagement. To assure shareholders of the governance associated with managing engagement and transparency, the Company has also developed and published a
policy explaining how stakeholder engagement is undertaken, including oversight and associated reporting
.
The term ‘political donation’ is widely defined in the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”). For clarity, the Company has not made, and does not intend to knowingly make, political donations. The Company continues to believe it is in the best interests of the business and shareholders to renew the authority most recently granted at the 2019 AGM to avoid any inadvertent infringement of the Act.
Prior to 2019, the Company had proposed an authority to spend up to £50,000 under each of the three categories covered by the Act. At the 2019 AGM, Drax sought an authority to spend up to £100,000 under the same three categories which was approved by a majority of shareholders.Nonetheless and reflecting feedback received in connection with the Resolution, at the 2020 and future AGMs the Company will propose an authority to spend up to £100,000 in each of the three categories but will introduce an aggregate cap of £125,000.
Further explanation on these matters, and our ongoing engagement with shareholders, will be included in the 2019 Annual Report and notice of the 2020 AGM.

Acquisition Bridge Facility refinancing completed
24 July 2019
Investors

Private placement
The £375 million private placement with infrastructure lenders comprises facilities with maturities between 2024 and 2029
(2)
.
ESG Facility
The £125 million ESG facility matures in 2022. The facility includes a mechanism that adjusts the margin based on Drax’s carbon emissions against an annual benchmark, recognising Drax’s continued commitment to reducing its carbon emissions as part of its overall purpose of enabling a zero-carbon, lower cost energy future.
Together these facilities extend the Group’s debt maturity profile beyond 2027 and reduce the Group’s overall cost of debt to below 4 percent.

Will Gardiner, CEO, Drax Group. Click to view high resolution photo.
“Drax Group has delivered strong profit and dividend growth in the first half of the year. Integration of our new Hydro and Gas generation assets is progressing well and the value the Group delivers from supporting the energy system has almost doubled.
Drax is supporting British business with innovative new energy services and, despite challenging market conditions, our Customers business continues to grow. Our biomass cost reduction initiative and plans for expanded biomass self-supply are going well.
“Drax wholeheartedly supports the UK’s target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”
