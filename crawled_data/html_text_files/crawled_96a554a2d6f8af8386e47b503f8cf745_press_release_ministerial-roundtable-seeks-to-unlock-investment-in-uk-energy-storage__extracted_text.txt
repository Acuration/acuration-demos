power station ministerial roundtable seeks to unlock investment in uk energy storage 18 march 2022 business leaders have met with uk energy minister the rt hon greg hands mp to discuss how the government could unlock significant investment in vital energy storage technologies needed to decarbonise the power sector and help ensure greater energy independence the meeting was organised by the longduration electricity storage alliance a new association of companies progressing plans across a range of technologies to be first of their kind to be developed in the uk for decades representatives from drax  sse renewables highview power and invinity energy systems met with the rt hon greg hands mp minister of state for business energy and clean growth on thursday he heard how decarbonising the uks electricity system by 2035 will require a range of flexible homegrown longduration energy storage ldes technologies to strengthen the contribution of cheap but variable renewables and deliver enhanced system stability a recent report by aurora showed that the uk may need an eightfold increase in longduration electricity storage capacity by 2035 as such ldes technologies will not only play a major role in significantly reducing the uks reliance on imported gas and supporting the uk governments ambitions to supercharge renewables but they will also deliver massive efficiency gains to the uk grid  helping to lower consumer energy bills the longduration electricity storage alliance intends to work with the uk government to unlock potential developments in new pumped storage hydro capacity and to accelerate the commercial deployment of exciting emerging technologies such as liquid air energy storage and flow batteries to put the uk in the vanguard of ldes innovation following the meeting greg hands mp said the longduration electricity storage alliance is a key part of our plan to get the full benefit from our worldclass renewables sector government have already committed 68 million of funding toward the development of these technologies this will support the uk as we shift towards domesticallyproduced renewable energy that will boost our energy security and create jobs and investment will gardiner drax group ceo said  enough renewable electricity from wind to supply around a million uk homes is wasted each year because there isnt enough storage available to harness that power and ensure it is available when we need it we cannot afford to allow that to continue especially with current concerns around energy security drax has plans to invest 500m developing 600 mw of additional pumped storage hydro capacity at our cruachan power station in the west of scotland  a project which with the right policies from government will not only contribute to uk energy security but also deliver around 1000 jobs in rural areas during construction finlay mccutcheon sse renewables director of onshore europe said in response to the current situation in the energy markets the uk needs to not only supercharge cheap renewables but also homegrown longduration storage technologies to costeffectively decarbonise the grid and reduce our dependence on imported gas the swift introduction of an adapted cap  floor mechanism by government this year could unlock billions of pounds of investment in these vital technologies and create thousands of skilled jobs as the uks clean energy champion with our consented and shovelready 1500 mw coire glas pumped storage project in the scottish highlands we stand ready to play our part rupert pearce highview power ceo added  highview powers liquid air energy storage technology is ready for commercial deployment and we believe that it can make a substantial contribution to the uks net zero ambitions for the uk grid as we move into the delivery phase for our matured technology we recognise that the uk leads the world in innovation in the uk grid and has already made extraordinary strides in admitting renewables to its system we are very grateful for the uk governments strong interest in ldes and their willingness to engage with uk industry to accelerate and embed key ldes capabilities in the uk economy and to create uk leaders in a fastemerging global ldes marketplace larry zulch ceo of invinity energy systems said wind and solar power will clearly play an increasing role in the uks longterm energy security reducing reliance on imported gas and supporting climate goals renewable energy requires energy storage to fill in the missing hours and make zerocarbon electricity available when it is needed not just when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining the more dependent the uk is on renewables the more urgent it is that longduration energy storage such as that provided by invinitys vanadium flow batteries be made available we couldnt be more pleased to see the uk take a leadership role in the deployment of long duration energy storage projects and welcome further government policy and investment support to facilitate the rapid adoption of critical energy storage technology ends media contacts drax aidan kerr email protected t 07849090368 sse renewables

progressing development plans on their separate projects drax is currently progressing plans to build a new underground pumped hydro storage power station at its existing cruachan site in argyll scotland sse renewables is currently progressing plans to build the 1500 mw coire glas pumped storage hydro project on the shores of loch lochy in the scottish highlands it would more than double great britains existing electricity storage capacity highview power is developing a liquid air energy storage plant at trafford energy park just outside manchester invinity energy systems energised a 5mwh vanadium flow battery at the energy superhub oxford in december 2021 and was recently awarded beis funding for the first phase of a project aiming to deliver the uks largest colocated solar  energy storage project  longduration electricity storage can be defined as technologies that are able to respond to supply and demand variations caused by daily peaks weather events and seasonal patterns providing power for more than four hours at their full capacity the uk governments 2021 smart systems and flexibility plan recognised longduration electricity storage as essential for achieving net zero the government held a call for evidence to hear the industrys views on derisking investment which closed in september 2021 and aims to evaluate options and respond early this year a recent report from aurora energy research showed that up to 24 gw of longduration electricity storage  equivalent to eight times the current installed capacity  could be needed to integrate wind power into a secure net zero electricity system the last long duration electricity storage project to be built in the uk was dinorwig pumped hydro storage power station in 1984  the last of four psh power stations built before privatisation of the electricity markets since then despite their vital role in enabling more renewable power to come online no others have been built due to the barriers that exist to securing private investment in projects a number of options exist for reforming the market to incentivise longduration electricity storage with a report published in january by kpmg
