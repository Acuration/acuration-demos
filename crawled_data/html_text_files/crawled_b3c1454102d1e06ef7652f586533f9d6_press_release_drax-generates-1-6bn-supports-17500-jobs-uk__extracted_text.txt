towards uk gdp in 2017 and supported over 17500 jobs across the country 12 november 2018 the findings were revealed in a new report looking at the economic impact of draxs uk operations which includes drax power station  the countrys biggest renewable power generator which produces enough renewable electricity for four million homes based on draxs operations in the energy sector and its use of british businesses across its supply chain the analysis by oxford economics estimates that the company contributed 165 billion to the economy and supported 17500 jobs last year the vast majority of the groups impact was felt outside london and the south east of the 165bn gross value added by drax group 142m was in london meaning 91 of the groups economic impact was experienced outside of the capital haven power employment supported by draxs activities covered a wide range of sectors including highskilled manufacturing of industrial components engineering and technical machinery construction it professional business services and transport researchers at oxford economics used three measures to calculate draxs gdp contribution the economic activity associated with the daytoday running of the business the activity created by the purchase of goods and services from its suppliers and the wages the companys employees and suppliers employees spend in their local area a breakdown of the gdp generated by drax group shows all regions of the uk benefited highlights include 431 million created in draxs heartland of yorkshire and the humber where its power station is located a rise from 419 million in 2016 1100 jobs for the north east and 77m contributed to the local economy 273 million generated and 2500 jobs supported in the east of england where one of drax groups b2b power supply businesses haven power is based 750 jobs supported and 51 million generated in wales home to the cardiff offices of opus energy  draxs other b2b retail business which supplies energy to smes 700 jobs supported in scotland and 68 million generated in its economy 850 jobs sustained and 64 million contributed to gdp in the south west apprentices at drax power station in north yorkshire drax group ceo will gardiner said as a british energy company we are committed to working with uk businesses right across our supply chain this report shows that drax now supports more than 17500 jobs across the uk and our proposed acquisition of a number of assets from scottish power will bolster these numbers further will gardiner ceo drax group with the power stations sophisticated supply chain and our growing retail business we are making a positive economic contribution in every region of the uk we are an important player in an energy sector and are keen to do whatever we can to help the country achieve a low cost zero carbon future since upgrading two thirds of the power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal drax has become the largest decarbonisation project in europe we plan to stop using coal well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline with proposals to repower our remaining coal generating units to use gas this will enable more renewables onto the system paving the way for increased carbon savings across the uk and helping us to meet our climate targets opus energy osman ismail senior economist at oxford economics said drax group makes an important economic contribution to yorkshire and the humber and the uk more widely its activities generated almost 16 billion in gdp last year and sustained thousands of jobs across the nation opus energy was successfully been onboarded into the group in 2017 and draxs principal activities of generating energy and supplying energy services to businesses directly and indirectly impacts a number of different regions in the uk in terms of both job creation and contribution to gdp regional press releases northern england yorkshire and the humber cardiff oxford northampton ipswich ends full details of the study can be found at httpsdraximpactcouk media contacts ali lewis drax group interim head of media  pr e email protected t 07712670888 jessica gorton drax group press officer e email protected t 07712677177 notes to editors drax recently converted the fourth of its six generating units from coal to use sustainable biomass  around 70 of the power produced at the power station is now renewable it has plans to repower its two remaining coal generating units to use gas which are being considered by the planning inspectorate if approved drax could stop using coal well ahead of the governments 2025 deadline it also has plans to start the first bioenergy carbon capture and storage pilot project of its kind in europe this year beccs technology is vital if we are to meet our climate targets it could enable the power produced at drax to become carbon negative meaning it would help to reduce the carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere about drax drax group plc plays a vital role in helping change the way energy is generated supplied and used its 2300strong staff operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production the group includes drax power ltd which operates the largest power station in the uk based at selby north yorkshire and supplies six percent of the countrys electricity needs the energy firm converted from burning coal to become a predominantly biomassfuelled electricity generator drax is the biggest renewable generator in the uk and the largest decarbonisation project in europe haven power  based in ipswich supplies electricity to large industrial and commercial sector businesses opus energy  based in oxford northampton and cardiff provides electricity and gas to small and medium sized sme businesses drax biomass  is based in the us and manufactures compressed wood pellets produced from sustainably managed working forests supplying fuel used by drax power station in north yorkshire to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses for more information visit wwwdraxcomuk about oxford economics oxford economics was
