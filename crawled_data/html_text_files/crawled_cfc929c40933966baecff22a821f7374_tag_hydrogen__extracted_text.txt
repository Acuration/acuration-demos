hydrogen committing to a net zero power system as part of cop26 30 november 2020 carbon capture dear prime minister chancellor cop26 president and minister for energy and clean growth we are a group of energy companies investing tens of billions in the coming decade deploying the low carbon infrastructure the uk will need to get to net zero and drive a green recovery to the covid19 crisis we welcome the leadership shown on the ten point plan for a green industrial revolution and the detailed work going on across government to deliver a net zero economy by 2050 we are writing to you to call on the government to signal what this will mean for uk electricity decarbonisation by committing to a date for a net zero power system  head of beccs carl clayton inspects pipes at the ccus incubation area  drax power station the electricity sector will be the backbone of our net zero economy and there will be ever increasing periods where great britain is powered by only zero carbon generation to support this the electricity system operator is putting in place the systems products and services to enable periods of zero emissions electricity system operation by 2025 achieving a net zero power system will require government to continue its efforts in key policy areas such as carbon pricing which has been central in delivering uk leadership in the move away from coal and has led to uk electricity emissions falling by over 63 between 2012 and 2019 alone it is thanks to successive governments commitment to robust carbon pricing that the uk is now using levels of coal in power generation last seen 250 years ago  before the birth of the steam locomotive a consistent robust carbon price has also unlocked long term investment lowcarbon power generation such that power generated by renewables overtook fossil fuel power generation for the first time in british history in the first quarter of 2020 yet even with the demise of coal and the progress in offshore wind more needs to be done to drive the remaining emissions from electricity as its use is extended across the economy wwwdraxcomuscaptureit in the nearterm in combination with other policies continued robust carbon pricing on electricity will incentivise the continued deployment of low carbon generation market dispatch of upcoming gasfired generation with carbon capture and storage ccs projects and the blending of low carbon hydrogen with gasfired generation further forward a robust carbon price can incentivise 100 hydrogen use in gasfired generation and importantly drive negative emissions to facilitate the delivery of a net zero economy next year the worlds attention will focus on glasgow and negotiations crucial to achieving our climate change targets with important commitments already made by china the eu japan and south korea amongst others an ambitious 2030 target from the uk will help kickstart the sprint to glasgow ahead of the ukun climate summit on 12 december electricity cables and pylon snaking around a mountain near cruachan power station  draxs flexible pumped storage facility in the highlands 2030 ambition is clearly needed but to deliver on net zero deep decarbonisation will be required previous commitments from the uk on its coal phase out and being the first major economy to adopt a net zero target continue to encourage similar international actions to build on these and continue uk leadership on electricity sector decarbonisation we call on the uk to commit to a date for a net zero power system ahead of cop26 to match the commitment of the us presidentelects clean energy plan  to ensure the maximum benefit at lowest cost the chosen date should be informed by analysis and consider broad stakeholder input alongside nearterm stability as the uks carbon pricing future is determined to meet this commitment government should launch a consultation on a date for a net zero power system by the budget next year with a target date to be confirmed in the uks upcoming net zero strategy this commitment would send a signal to the rest of the world that the uk intends to maintain its leadership position on climate and to build a greener more

generation were all familiar with the phrase oilrich nations but as low carbon energy sources become ever more important to meeting global demand renewable energy could become a global export with a future favouring zerocarbon and even negative emissions innovation here are some countries that are not only harnessing their natural resources to make more renewable energy but are making progress in storing and exporting it could these new opportunities lead us to one day deem them renewablerich could europe import its solar power supply with the largest concentrated solar farm in the world  morocco is already streets ahead in its ability to capture and convert sunlight into power the 3000 hectare solar complex known as noorouarzazate  has a capacity of 580 megawatts mw which provides enough power for a city twice the size of marrakesh noorouarzazate power plant morocco image source acwa power its uses curved mirrors to direct sunlight into a singular beam that creates enough heat to melt salt in a central tower this stores the heat and  when needed  is used to create steam which spins a turbine and generates electricity this has helped keep morocco on course to achieve its goal of deriving 42 of its power from renewable sources by the end of 2020 which potentially means a surplus in the coming years morocco already has 14 gigawatts gw of interconnection with spain  and another 700 mw is scheduled to come online before 2026 the countrys close proximity to europe could make its solar capacity a source of power across the continent africas geothermal potential olkaria ii geothermal power plant in kenya kenya was the first african nation to embrace geothermal energy and has now been using it for decades in 1985 kenyas geothermal generation produced 45 mw of power  30 years later the country now turns over 630 mw  kenyas ample generation of geothermal electricity is due to an abundance of steam energy in the underground volcanic wells of olkaria in the great rift valley in 2015 the region was responsible for providing 47 of the countrys power currently the olkaria region is thought to have a potential capacity of 2 gw of power which could help to provide a source of clean energy for kenyas neighbours however there is potential for the rest of east africa to generate its own geothermal power in this region of the continent there is an estimated 20 gw of power generation capacity possible from stored geothermal energy while the demand for the creation of usable grids that can connect multiple countries is high kenya is currently expanding its own grid installing a planned 3600 miles of new electrical wiring across the country winds of change chinas position in the renewable energy market is already up top with continuous investment in solar and hydro power giving it a renewable capacity of more than 700 gw the country is also home to the worlds largest onshore wind farm in the form of the gansu wind farm project which is made up of over 7000 turbines  it is set to have a capacity of 20 gw by the end of 2020 bringing the nationwide installed wind capacity to 250 gw with china exporting more than 20000 gigawatthours gwh of electricity in 2018  large scale renewable projects can have a widereaching effect beyond its borders southasia is the primary market but excesses of power in western china have stoked ideas of exporting power as far away as germany  can the us store the worlds carbon in the quest for zerocarbon energy it wont just be nations that can export excess energy that could stand to profit  those that can import emissions could also benefit while many countries are developing the capabilities to capture carbon dioxide co 2  storing it safely and permanently is another question  having underground facilities that can store co 2 creates an opportunity to import and sequester carbon as a service for other nations norway is already doing it but the us has the greatest potential thanks to its abundance of large underground storage capabilities the global ccs institute highlights the us as the country most prepared to deploy carbon capture and storage ccs at scale thanks to its vast landscape history of injecting co 2 in enhanced oil recovery and favourable government policies the petra nova plant in texas is also known as the worlds largest carbon capture facility  the coalpower station captured more than 1 million tonnes of co 2 within the first 10 months of operating as a 654 mw unit carbon capture facility at the petra nova coalfired power plant texas usa chiles hydrogen innovation hydrogen is becoming increasingly relevant as an energy source thanks to its ability to generate electricity and power transport while releasing far fewer emissions than other fossil fuels chile was an early proponent of energy sharing with its hydrogen programme the country uses solar electricity generated in the atacama desert which sees 3000 hours of sunlight a year to power hydrogen production in a process called electrolysis which uses electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen chile plans to export the gas to japan and south korea  but with global demand for hydrogen set to grow highervolume furtherreaching exporting of the countrys hydrogen could soon be on the way going forward these green innovations  from carbon storage to geothermal potential  could increasingly be shared between countries and continents in an attempt to lower the overall carbon footprint of the worlds energy this could create a global power shift toward nations which rather than having high capacity for fossil fuel extraction can instead use a different set of natural resources to generate store and export cleaner energy tags decarbonisation  electricity generation  fossil fuels  hydrogen  wind power what is a fuel cell and how will they help power the future 27 june 2019 carbon capture nasa museum houston texas how do you get a drink in space that was one of the challenges for nasa in the 1960s and 70s when its gemini and apollo programmes were first preparing to take humans into space the answer it turned out surprisingly lay in the electricity source of the capsules control modules primitive by todays standard these panels were powered by what are known as fuel cells which combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity the byproduct of this reaction is heat but also water  pure enough for astronauts to drink  fuel cells offered nasa a much better option than the clunky batteries and inefficient solar arrays of the 1960s and today they still remain on the forefront of energy technology presenting the opportunity to clean up roads power buildings and even help to reduce and carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from power stations power through reaction at its most basic a fuel cell is a device that uses a fuel source to generate electricity through a series of chemical reactions all fuel cells consist of three segments two catalytic electrodes  a negatively charged anode on one side and a positively charged cathode on the other and an electrolyte separating them in a simple fuel cell hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe  is pumped to one electrode and oxygen to the other two different reactions then occur at the interfaces between the segments which generates electricity and water what allows this reaction to generate electricity is the electrolyte which selectively transports charged particles from one electrode to the other these charged molecules link the two reactions at the cathode and anode together and allow the overall reaction to occur when the chemicals fed into the cell react at the electrodes it creates an electrical current that can be harnessed as a power source httpswwwdraxcomuswpcontentuploadssites10201905drax_fuel_cells_v62mp4 many different kinds of chemicals can be used in a fuel cell such as natural gas or propane instead of hydrogen a fuel cell is usually named based on the electrolyte used different electrolytes selectively transport different molecules across the catalysts at either side are specialised to ensure that the correct reactions can occur at a fast enough rate for the apollo missions for example nasa used alkaline fuel cells with potassium hydroxide electrolytes but other types such as phosphoric acids molten carbonates or even solid ceramic electrolytes also exist the byproducts to come out of a fuel cell all depend on what goes into it however their ability to generate electricity while creating few emissions means they could have a key role to play in decarbonisation fuel cells as a battery alternative fuel cells like batteries can store potential energy in the form of chemicals and then quickly produce an electrical current when needed their key difference however is that while batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged fuel cells will continue to function and produce electricity so long as there is fuel being fed in one of the most promising uses for fuel cells as an alternative to batteries is in electric vehicles rachel grima a research and innovation engineer at drax explains because its so light hydrogen has a lot of potential when it comes to larger vehicles like trucks and boats whereas batterypowered trucks are more difficult to design because theyre so heavy these vehicles can pull in oxygen from the surrounding air to react with the stored hydrogen producing only heat and water vapour as waste products which  coupled with an expanding network of hydrogen fuelling stations around the uk europe and us  makes them a transport fuel with a potentially big future fuel cells in conjunction with electrolysers can also operate as largescale storage option electrolysers operate in reverse to fuel cells using excess electricity from the grid to produce hydrogen from water and storing it until its needed when there is demand for electricity the hydrogen is released and electricity generation begins in the fuel cell a project on the islands of orkney is using the excess electricity generated by local communityowned wind turbines to power a electrolyser and store hydrogen  that can be transported to fuel cells around the archipelago fuel cells ability to take chemicals and generate electricity is also leading to experiments at drax for one of the most important areas in energy today carbon capture turning co 2 to power drax is already piloting bioenergy carbon capture and storage technologies but fuel cells offer the unique ability to capture and use carbon while also adding another form of electricity generation to drax power station were looking at using a molten carbonate fuel cell that operates on natural gas oxygen and co 2  says grima its basic chemistry that we can exploit to do carbon capture the molten carbonate a 600 degrees celsius liquid made up of either lithium potassium or lithiumsodium carbonate sits in a ceramic matrix and functions as the electrolyte in the fuel cell natural gas and steam enter on one side and pass through a reformer that converts them into hydrogen and co 2  on the other side flue gas  the emissions including biogenic co 2  which normally enter the atmosphere from draxs biomass units  is captured and fed into the cell alongside air from the atmosphere the co 2 and oxygen o 2  pass over the electrode where they form carbonate co 3 2  which is transported across the electrolyte to then react with the hydrogen h 2  creating an electrical charge its like combining an open cycle gas turbine ocgt with carbon capture says grima it has the electrical efficiency of an ocgt but the difference is it captures co 2 from our biomass units as well as its own co 2  along with capturing and using co 2  the fuel cell also reduces nitrogen oxides nox emissions from the flue gas some of which are destroyed when the o 2 and co 2 react at the electrode from the side of the cell where flue gas enters a co 2 depleted gas is released on the other side of the cell the byproducts are water and co 2  during a governmentsupported front end engineering and design feed study starting this spring this co 2 will also be captured then fed through a pipeline running from drax power station into the greenhouse of a nearby salad grower here it will act to accelerate the growth of tomatoes the partnership between drax fuelcell energy p3p partners and the department of business energy and industrial strategy could provide an additional opportunity for the uks biggest renewable
