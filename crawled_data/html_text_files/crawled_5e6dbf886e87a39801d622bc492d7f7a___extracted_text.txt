that cluster development could be worth hundreds of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of pounds in gva to the uks economy by 2050 with over 80 of the uks licensed storage in the north sea the majority of these economic benefits could go to the north of england and create an additional 330000 jobs if the uk fails to deliver on its ccs rollout 136000 jobs could be at risk a new independent research report uk cluster potential  how the uk can lead the world in carbon capture and storage by development economics finds that if the uk government accelerates and expands the development of carbon capture and storage ccs clusters across the country it could generate an extra 32bn of gross value added gva for the economy from 2050 onward and nearly 500000 additional jobs the research commissioned by drax group demonstrates that in the most optimistic scenario the uk government could enhance our energy security turbocharge economic growth across the country and cement the uks position as a worldleader in carbon capture and removals technology it states that this scenario could be delivered through policy changes which can unlock investment and clarify how ccs clusters are developed these include finalising ccs business and financial models confirming the role of the uk ets scheme and voluntary carbon markets in supporting investment in ccs providing a nearterm incentive for prospective storage operators to appraise storage locations building on recent north sea transition authority licencing rounds the north of england would be the region to benefit most with 22bn added to the economy per year from 2050 onward and 330000 additional jobs the report also explores the economic impacts of two additional scenarios one where the uk delivers on current ccs policy commitments and another where it does not if the uk does fulfil its ambitions it will be worth an additional 23bn per year from 2050 and an additional 310000 jobs richard gwilliam uk beccs programme director at drax group said carbon capture and removals can be a catalyst for growth stronger energy security increasing employment and reaching net zero in the uk this research demonstrates that if the uk puts its foot on the accelerator and expands the rollout of ccs clusters across the country a unique prize worth tens of billions of pounds to the economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs is within reach at drax we want to play our part in ensuring the uk becomes a global leader in ccs and that is why we are working towards installing two bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs units at drax power station this would see us become a key part of a humberbased carbon capture cluster and we are currently working on routes to deployment through the track 1 expansion and track 2 processes steve lucas director at development economics said this research demonstrates the significant opportunity for the uk to be a global leader in carbon capture and storage and the importance of ccs for key industries which provides jobs growth and opportunity across the uk with ambition clarity and the necessary support from government  following the key suggestions outlined in the reports roadmap  there is a significant prize to be won for the uk economy and environment however in its recent progress report the climate change committee warned that the rollout of ccs is already behind schedule and development economics research shows that if this trend continues and the uk fails to deliver on its ccs policy commitments the economic effects could be severe this includes the loss of 136000 jobs and 9bn gva per year from 2050 from heavyemitting companies which will have no other route to decarbonise and therefore could move their operations abroad to countries with better resourced and more ccs clusters the report argues that the combination of additional support delivered in the most optimistic scenario the countrys past hydrocarbon expertise and 15bn from the investment community for the energy transition would put the uk on the map as a worldleader in ccs it also demonstrates that the humber with existing plans to become the worlds first carbon negative region and 80 of the uks licensed co 2 storage could become a global model for regional cluster development the research shows that with increased ambition the humber could benefit from an additional 42000 jobs and 34bn gva per year by 2050 drax plans plan to invest billions in its beccs plans at north yorkshires drax power station to develop two units which could remove 8mt of carbon from the atmosphere per year while continuing to provide renewable baseload power to the uk grid this will ensure the station continues to generate secure renewable electricity into the future while delivering up to 10000 highskilled jobs in the humber at the projects peak and playing a critical role in delivering carbon removals so the uk can meet its binding engineered greenhouse gas removal

help energy sparks engage many more schools and pupils across the uk in reducing their energy use and costs as well as fighting climate change alongside our existing grant funding for led lighting and solar panels we are excited to bring energy sparks energy analysis tool and education programme to more schools in and around the communities where we operate its important to us to help children start thinking about saving energy and reducing their carbon footprint from a young age as these issues are going to be increasingly important for them in the future dr claudia towner ceo and programme director at energy sparks said we are delighted to receive this funding from the drax foundation it means we can reach even more schools and pupils and remove financial barriers to ongoing engagement for some of the existing schools using our services our work equips children and young people with the knowledge skills and tools to take measurable action in their school and wider community to reduce carbon emissions we also enable school leaders staff and communities to better understand and reduce their schools energy consumption save money and introduce wider measures to reduce their carbon footprint energy sparks was founded in 2020 and in the last year through energy sparks tools the average primary school it works with has saved at least 3000 in energy costs and 128 tonnes of co2 additionally the average secondary school has saved at least 12000 and 48 tonnes of co2 energy sparks education activities encourage pupils to learn about climate change and why reducing carbon emissions is important investigating energy use around the school site taking action to reduce energy use and spreading the energy saving and carbon reduction message across their wider school community energy sparks online tool presents bespoke analysis of the energy data with suggestions of actions the school community could take to save energy and reduce the schools carbon emissions this new funding is drawn from a pot of 15m that drax foundation unveiled earlier this year for uk schools to install energyefficient led lights and solar panels and deliver energy saving

ground in uks energy mix 13 september 2023 press releases after more than a century of fossil fuels dominating the uks power grid britain now has more installed wind capacity than gas generation new data from drax electric insights also shows output from gas power stations fell year on year by 23 in q2 2023 and output from coal fell by 75 to its lowest level on record carbon emissions from electricity production fell to less than 10 million tonnes of co2 in the second quarter of 2023 for only the second time on record new analysis from imperial college london for drax electric insights has found that for the first time ever installed wind capacity has surpassed gas reaching 279gw in june compared to the 277gw installed capacity of gas generation as a result after more than a century of fossil fuels dominating britains electricity grid coal and gas power generation has plummeted at the fastest rate outside of the pandemic in its latest quarterly report drax electric insights has found that output from gasfired power stations fell by 23 in q2 2023 compared to the same quarter last year meanwhile output from coal which was once was the backbone of grid was slashed by 75 to its lowest levels on record overall carbon emissions from electricity production fell to less than 10 million tonnes of co2 in the second quarter of 2023 for only the second time on record with the only previous occasion being due to the destruction of demand from covid19 lockdowns britains installed capacity of power stations over the past two decades click to viewdownload the figures come amid new data showing that for the first time ever the uk has more wind power capacity installed than gas left electricity generated from fossil fuels in britain during each quarter since 2010 right yearonyear change in electricity generated from fossil fuels in britain during each quarter since 2010 click to viewdownload dr iain staffell of imperial college london and lead author of the quarterly drax electric insights report series said wind power is blowing away gas and coal from britains energy mix and in just a decade weve gone from relying completely on the polluting fuels of the past to embracing the clean energy technologies of the future the shift to wind as the largest power source by capacity is a clear sign of the progress weve made showing countries around the world that they can decarbonise their power grids when government and industry works together great britain now has just one remaining coalfired power station following draxs decision earlier this year to permanently end use of the fuel at its plant in north yorkshire once the largest coalfired power station in western europe drax power station is now the single largest generator of renewable power in the uk over the last decade four of the power stations six generating units have been converted to use sustainable biomass providing the uk with clean green and secure renewable electricity penny small draxs group generation director said cutting the uks reliance on imported foreign gas and coal is critical to strengthening the countrys national energy security and tackling climate change at drax we believe the uks next big focus should be on unlocking investment in technologies which permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere thats why we are progressing plans to deploy bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology at scale in the uk and the us beccs is a remarkable technology that simultaneously removes millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while
