companies making coal history how three coalfired power generators are giving up coal and changing their businesses 26 june 2018 power generation coal has been the backbone of electricity generation for well over a century  but times have changed a growing understanding of fossil fuels contribution to pollution and global climate change means more energy companies around the world now realise their longterm success depends on moving away from coal as a result between 2015 and last year construction of new coalpowered plants dropped by 73 the powering past coal alliance is an initiative helping facilitate this move it brings together those working moving completely away from coal and is comprised of a number of governments businesses and energy companies  including drax  however it isnt the only initiative of its type  nor is drax the only electricity generator fast moving away from coal here we look at some of the other companies giving coal the cold shoulder avedøre is a high efficiency multifuel combined heat and power plant in denmark operated by ørsted source ørsted ørsted denmarks partly stateowned global energy firm once called dong an acronym for danish oil and natural gas is one of the largest of the alliances members leading the charge away from coal the company is at the forefront of the energy sectors transformation towards renewables it is the global leader in offshore wind having installed more than one quarter of the worlds total offshore wind capacity more recently the company changed its name to ørsted after the danish scientist who first discovered that electric currents create magnetic fields the name change reflects the companys move away from fossil fuels including coal  the company has slashed its coal usage from 62 million tonnes in 2006 to 11 million last year and aims to reach zero by 2023 as well as cutting its co 2 emissions by 96 this is thanks largely to the massive growth in ørsteds offshore wind farm business as well as the conversion of six of ørsteds danish coalfired power stations to biomass the company aims to have enough wind capacity by 2020 to supply 16 million people in europe denver colorado  xcel energys cherokee generating station originally coalfired it is being converted to natural gas xcel energy coal is something of a controversial topic in the us these days however forwardthinking electricity generators in the country are quickly moving from contentious fossil fuels to renewables midwestbased xcel energy is laying out a timeline to switch the majority of its generation from coal to carbonfree sources  the company plans to retire 20 of its coal units between 2005 and 2026  40 of its total coal capacity  and expand its renewable portfolio in its place xcels ambitions are perhaps clearest in colorado where it recently announced it will bring forward the closure of about a third of its coal fleet by a decade  alongside these coal closures the company plans to construct 1131 megawatts mw of new wind capacity 707 mw of new solar power and 275 mw of battery storage in the state nationwide xcel says it is on course to hit a 50 reduction of its 2005 carbon emissions levels by 2022 enel generación chile italian electricity giant enels chilean arm is one of the companies signed up to the chilean governments target of generating 70 of its electricity by renewable sources by 2050 in a positive move towards this the firm recently closed a deal to build 242 mw of new solar wind and geothermal generation  adding to its already growing roster of renewables last year enel green power chile and enap opened the cerro pabellón geothermal plant in the countrys atacama desert located 4500 meters above sea level it is the first facility of its kind in south america and uses chiles volcanic landscape to produce 340 gwh per year it comes as a part of enels wider push to become carbon neutral by 2050  chiles energy ministry and the electricity power generators association have pledged to build no new coal power stations unless they are fitted with carbon capture technology like drax group and the uk companies and countries are quickly moving beyond unabated coalfired
