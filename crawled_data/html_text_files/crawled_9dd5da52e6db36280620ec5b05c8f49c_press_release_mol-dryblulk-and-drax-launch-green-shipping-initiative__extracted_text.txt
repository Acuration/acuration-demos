drax group and japanese shipping company mol drybulk ltd are working together to reduce the emissions and fuel costs associated with shipping biomass by deploying wind power technology on its vessels 11 july 2022 drax and mol drybulk partner to develop wind power technology that will reduce biomass shipping emissions by a fifth newly built vessels will be fitted with mols wind challenger hard sail technology with first ship expected as soon as 2025 the initiative is part of draxs plans to reduce its supply chain emissions and become carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs the companies plan to facilitate the development of windpowered vessels to transport bulk cargoes of draxs wood pellets to its customers in japan where the biomass is used to generate reliable renewable energy which displaces fossil fuels efbc1 wind challenger and rotor sails the newly built vessels will be fitted with mols wind challenger hard sail technology with the first ship expected to be on the water as soon as 2025 the initiative is part of draxs plans to further reduce supply chain emissions in line with its worldleading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs drax group chief executive will gardiner said drax group ceo will gardiner mol drybulks hard sail technology has the potential to transform the maritime industry cutting emissions and fuel costs and supporting global efforts to address the climate crisis this partnership to advance this crucial new technology will support draxs commitment to reduce its own supply chain emissions and could also deliver farreaching benefits across a number of different sectors that rely on ships to carry goods to customers around the world under the memorandum of understanding mou the two companies will study the feasibility of deploying a first and second generation environmentally friendly bulk carrier efbc to carry draxs biomass the first efbc will use mols automated telescopic hard sail technology  wind challenger and will evaluate the application of other technologies including rotor sails the second efbc aims to at least halve emissions with new vessel designs that use multiple wind challenger sails other lowcarbon technologies in development and the use of alternative fuels such as ammonia liquefied natural gas and synthetic fuels sail from the rear  extended sail from the rear  retracted construction of the wind challenger sail at oshima shipbuilding yard kazuhiko kikuchi president and representative director of mol drybulk said kazuhiko kikuchi president and representative director of mol drybulk mol has been working with our partners to develop the wind challenger technology for over a decade and its great to see this become a reality we are extremely excited to work together with an innovative company such as drax this partnership will help us have a positive impact on how wood pellets and other cargoes are transported across the world mol drybulks work will include developing the technologies that will be used and liaising with the shipyard where the vessel will be built and fitted with the hard sail technology drax will work with the ports and terminals in the supply chain on the operational feasibility studies the mou with mol drybulk follows draxs previous work with the smart green shipping alliance to look at the potential of fitting innovative sail technology on ships transporting biomass from the us to the uk ends top image caption image of the vessel fitted with wind

produces around 940 million tonnes of co2 a year  around 25 of the worlds total co2 drax has already cut emissions from its fossil fuel generation by over 95 since 2012 and is targeting further reductions for its remaining emissions including in its supply chain drax reports its supply chain emissions in its annual report which is independently audited draxs biomass comes from sustainably managed working forests it includes the residuals left behind after harvesting activities for other sectors such as construction and furniture as well as sawmill residues and thinnings mol drybulk is a 100 subsidiary of mitsui osk lines ltd mol mol has set out its plans to reach net zero by 2050 about drax drax groups purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower cost energy future and in 2019 announced a worldleading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs technology draxs around 3000 employees operate across three principal areas of activity  electricity generation electricity sales to business customers and compressed wood pellet production and supply to third parties for more information visit wwwdraxcom power generation drax owns and operates a portfolio of renewable electricity generation assets in england and scotland the assets include the uks largest power station based at selby north yorkshire which supplies five percent of the countrys electricity needs having converted drax power station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal it has become the uks biggest renewable power generator and the largest decarbonisation project in europe it is also where drax is piloting the groundbreaking negative emissions technology beccs within its ccus carbon capture utilisation and storage incubation area its pumped storage hydro and energy from waste assets in scotland include cruachan power station  a flexible pumped storage facility within the hollowedout mountain ben cruachan the group also aims to build on its beccs innovation at drax power station with a target to deliver 4mt of negative co2 emissions each year from newbuild beccs outside of the uk by 2030 and is currently developing models for north american and european markets pellet production and supply the group has 17 operational pellet plants and developments with nameplate production capacity of around 5 million tonnes a year once developments are complete drax is targeting 8mt of production capacity by 2030 which will require the development of over 3mt of new biomass pellet production capacity the pellets are produced using materials sourced from sustainably managed working forests and are supplied to third party customers in europe and asia for the generation of renewable power draxs pellet plants supply biomass used at its own power station in north yorkshire england to generate flexible renewable power for the uks homes and businesses and also to customers in europe and asia customers drax supplies

joint research project led by the university of tokyo and in january 2018 mol and oshima shipbuilding took charge of the plan and now play a central role in this project the system converts wind energy to propulsive force with a telescopic hard sail in october 2019 it acquired approval in principle aip for the design of a hard sail system in december 2020 mol reached a longterm transport deal with tohoku electric power co inc using a 99000dwt vessel equipped with a wind challenger sail with the aim to achieve 5 to 8 reduction of the ghg emissions the vessel is currently constructed at
