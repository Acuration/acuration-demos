 sustainability  carbon emissions  towards carbon negative towards carbon negative progress towards meeting our worldleading ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030 drax was the first energy company in the world to announce an ambition to be carbon negative by 2030  we are confident we can achieve it  pioneering new technology is what we do best being carbon negative means removing more carbon dioxide co 2  from the atmosphere than produced in our operations creating a negative carbon footprint our carbon negative ambition includes all group scope 1 and 2 emissions and will include the foreseen negative emissions achieving this carbon negative ambition is critical to beating the climate crisis it will also enable a just transition protecting jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth  delivering for the economy as well as the environment how we are progressing towards our ambition we achieved a 74 reduction in carbon intensity of power generation from 311 tco 2  gwh in 2017 down to 80 tco 2  gwh in the first half of 2021 in the first half of 2021 our co 2 emissions per unit of electricity were just 9 of their 2012 amount 882 tco 2  gwh  a decrease of 909 eight million tonnes mt of negative emissions are illustrative of potential negative emissions from two units at drax power station based on current estimates of 4mt per unit per annum our rapid decarbonisation is thanks to our move away from coal 937 tco 2  gwh to biomass 120 tco 2  gwh and hydro 0 tco 2  gwh in january 2021 we sold our gas power stations and the following month committed not to build any combined cycle gas turbine 394 tco 2  gwh power stations the gas sale is too recent to be reflected in data on this page drax power staton is now the largest single site generator of renewable power in the uk producing 141 twh in 2020 each of our power generation and storage technologies can be operated flexibly they deliver electricity and essential system services in support less flexible renewable technologies dependent on weather conditions our technologies will play an important role in the uks transition towards net zero by 2050 and a grid powered predominantly by intermittent wind and solar  carbon intensities from measuring the progress and impacts of decarbonising british electricity dr iain staffell energy policy volume 102 march 2017 how draxs decarbonisation compares to other large utilities source bloombergown company data what next using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs  we will remove more co 2 from the atmosphere than is emitted during power generation creating a negative carbon footprint for drax by 2030 our ambition is only achievable with an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework  which the uk government is developing by 2030 we must close our two remaining coalfired power generation units at drax power station we stopped commercial power generation using coal in march 2021  have two biomass units operating with beccs running at 90 availability capturing and storing eight million tonnes of co 2 a year we have included all harmful greenhouse gases as defined by the kyoto protocol
