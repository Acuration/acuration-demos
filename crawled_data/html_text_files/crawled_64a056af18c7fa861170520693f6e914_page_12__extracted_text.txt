team at drax power station has developed the stem box project an engaging activity for students to take part in relating to the subject areas of science technology engineering and maths students aged between seven and eleven at camblesforth community primary academy and selby community primary school were provided with individual activity boxes containing a range of learning materials games and resources they will need to build their robots the focus of which is on recycling and forms part of their school curriculum the robots are made from recyclable materials that can be found around the house such as bottles tin cans and cardboard and have been designed to carry out recycling tasks such as having magnetic hands to pick up metal or builtin compartments to store paper to launch the project students received a presentation from visitor centre guides on recycling and the role everyone plays ensuring the correct waste items enter recycling schemes drax director of sustainability alan knight said by providing schools with these resources we hope to further students understanding of the importance of recycling and hopefully fire up their imaginations and inspire them to study stem subjects by showing them the wide range of career options that are available year 4 pupils at selby community primary school with drax visitor centre guide natalie dobson camblesforth community primary academy teacher georgia wynn said the students had a great time taking part in the stem box programme learning about drax and building the recycling robots activities like these are so important as it really brings the subject to life and encourages students to start thinking about careers they might enjoy in the future selby community primary school teacher louisa currie said creating their amazing robots really sparked the childrens enthusiasm for stem and drew their focus to the importance of recycling we look forward to continuing to work with drax on projects such as this drax has a long tradition of supporting education and helping to inspire the next generation of engineers by encouraging interest in stem subjects the renewable energy company offers a number of

projects built in the uk since the 1980s enough wind power to supply more than a million homes was wasted in 2020 as excess renewable power could not be stored anywhere new report identifies suitable revenue stabilisation mechanism to help unlock private investment in new generation of storage technologies to help stabilise the power grid and enable more renewables to come online  cutting costs and reducing emissions drax plans to build uks first new pumped storage hydro plant in a generation at its iconic cruachan facility in scotland helping the country meet its climate targets whilst supporting hundreds of jobs a new report by kpmg commissioned by drax group has looked at different revenue stabilisation mechanisms which could be deployed to unlock private investment in these vital storage technologies no new long duration storage infrastructure such as pumped hydro storage power stations have been built in the uk for more than 30 years however kpmgs analysis has found that an existing mechanism could be part of the solution to attract a wave of new investment in largescale electricity storage infrastructure projects possible solutions were assessed through a rigorous framework to find which stabilisation regime would not only incentivise investment but would also address system needs and provide best value for money for consumers the report found that a cap and floor mechanism like the regime used to incentivise investment in crossborder interconnectors is the standout solution to overcome the hurdles currently blocking investment in long duration storage technologies this model would reduce risks for investors while at the same time encouraging operators of the new storage facilities to respond to system needs helping the electricity system operator to maintain secure supplies on an increasingly volatile grid penny small drax group generation director said the uk has decarbonised its electricity system at a faster rate than any other country as a result of the successful deployment of renewables including wind solar hydro and sustainable biomass with more longduration storage the system would operate more effectively in terms of reducing emissions cutting costs and maintaining secure supplies this report sets out a clear pathway to unlock private investment in a new generation of pumped hydro power stations in the uk and which also gives value for money for consumers innovative technologies like pumped storage hydro are key to achieving the uks net zero target because they help stop excess renewable power from wind farms going to waste by storing it and making it available at lightning speed when the country needs it cruachan power station drax is moving forward with ambitious plans to build a new underground pumped storage hydro plant at its existing cruachan facility in argyll scotland the new 600mw station would be built within a new hollowedout cavern that would be large enough to fit big ben on its side supporting around 900 jobs during its construction the new facility would bring the sites total generating capacity to 104gw  enough to power more than a million homes  capacity which could be available by 2030 with a suitable investment framework developments such as cruachan 2 are critical to realising the uks climate targets in 2020 enough wind power to supply a million homes went to waste in the uk because there wasnt enough capacity to store this excess renewable power there are many prospective long duration energy storage projects in the uk but none have shovels in the ground as businesses require more certainty from the government before giving the green light to development ends media contacts aidan kerr media manager e email protected t 07849090368 editors notes an executive summary of the kpmg report can be found here on the drax website the report considered external factors such as the uks target to significantly expand offshore wind power to 40gw by 2030 and the rise in power demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps through to 2050 four investment mechanisms were examined contracts for difference regulated asset base model cap and floor regime and a reformed capacity market a cap and floor regime was found to be the optimal solution against an 11area assessment framework the same support regime has been transformational in unlocking private investment in crossborder interconnectors since its launch in 2014 this is because investors can see the projects annual maximum and minimum revenues over a 25year period which reduces risks nine interconnector projects with a combined flow capacity of 105gw have been awarded agreements during the first two application windows securing enough capacity to keep the lights on for around 29 million homes if all projects are developed separate independent analysis by lane clark and peacock lcp found the uk curtailed 36twh of wind power in 2020 enough renewable electricity to supply around a million homes despite their benefits to the grid attracting private investment in long duration storage technologies has been difficult due to their build times often being longer than the timeframes offered by
